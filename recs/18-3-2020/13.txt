AB Comparisons of well-developed practice-based interventions with research-based interventions are rare. This quasi-experimental study compares the outcomes of 274 adolescents (75% male; 63% weekly+ users; 54% dependent; 27% prior treatment; 73% with co-occurring problems) who received Chestnut Health System's best-practice Outpatient Treatment (CHS) or Cannabis Youth Treatment (CYT) research-based interventions. Ninety-five percent of participants completed follow-up interviews at three, six, nine, and 12 months after their intake GAIN interview. Initially, the CYT cohort scores indicated greater severity on several substance-related measures, while the CHS cohort scored higher on prior mental health treatment, victimization, and illegal activities measures. Adolescents in the CHS cohort were more likely to have longer lengths of stay and receive over three times as many hours of treatment. Mixed effects models revealed that CHS participants were significantly more likely to report a decrease in recovery environment risk, an increase in self-help attendance after treatment, and greater decreases in emotional problems, while CYT participants were significantly more likely to report decreases in their substance use. The results suggest that neither the best-practice nor the research-based interventions were clearly superior and call for a more rigorous randomized field experiment to better understand the differences in effectiveness between interventions.

AB The purpose of this paper was to investigate the factor structure and reliability of the Young ADHD Questionnaire-Self-Report [YAQ-S] and the Young ADHD Questionnaire-Informant Report [YAQ-I] and to investigate the relationship between self and informant reported information. A second aim was to evaluate whether the questionnaires discriminated between an ADHD symptomatic group [ADHD], a clinic referred non-ADHD symptomatic group [CCG] and a healthy control group [NCG]. A total of 223 participants and 150 informants (recruited from clinic referrals and healthy community controls) completed the questionnaires. A principal component analysis was conducted on the data and four factors were rotated using varimax procedure relating to ADHD symptoms, emotional problems, delinquency and social functioning. Comparison of factors across the three groups showed the ADHD group had significantly greater ADHD symptomatology, emotional problems and delinquent behaviour than the CCG and the NCG on both the YAQ-S and YAQ-I. Social functioning was impaired compared with the NCG but not the CCG. All factors significantly correlated between the YAQ-S and YAQ-I except for the social functioning of the ADHD group and the ADHD symptom scale for all three groups. Discriminant function analysis showed the ADHD scale to be the most significant factor between groups according to self and informant ratings. The findings suggest that the instruments are useful clinical assessment tools for guiding treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reliability and validity of the teacher version of the Child Symptom Inventory-4 (CSI-4) was examined in 248 boys referred for evaluation of behavioral and emotional problems. The CSI-4 is a behavior rating scale whose items correspond to the symptoms of DSM-IV-defined disorders. The results indicated satisfactory internal consistency reliabilities for most symptom categories, and CSI-4 scores converged and diverged in a theoretically consistent manner with respective scales of the Teacher's Report Form (Achen-bach, 199 1), the IOWA Conners Teacher's Rating Scale (Loney & Milich, 1982), and the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised Parent Version (DICA-P; Reich, Shayka, & Taibleson, 1991). Correlations between teacher and parent CSI-4 ratings were low to moderate, whereas all correlations between teacher ratings and child self report were very low, (rs <.16). Children who met DICA-P diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder received significantly higher corresponding CSI-4 teacher symptom ratings than children not so diagnosed. Collectively, findings support the clinical utility of the CSI-4 in clinically referred boys.

AB Using a representative sample of low-income, urban preschoolers (n = 755) and adolescents (n = 1,130), this article addresses links among family welfare receipt, family processes, and child outcomes. For adolescents, family welfare receipt is related to decreased cognitive achievement and heightened behavioral and emotional problems. For preschoolers, both current and past welfare receipt are associated with problematic functioning. Families who received welfare sanctions have children with particularly problematic developmental outcomes. Mothers' human capital, health, and parenting practices attenuate many of these links. Policy implications regarding potential impacts of welfare reform on children's developmental trajectories are discussed.

AB This study examines the reliability and validity of a newly developed self-report measure designed to assess children's coping strategies in response to everyday rejection experiences. The Survey for Coping with Rejection Experiences ( SCORE) was administered to 225 children and factor analysis of responses resulted in the conceptually meaningful subscales of active, aggressive, denial, and ruminative coping. A subset of 95 children also completed a battery of self- (depression, social anxiety), parent- (internalizing and externalizing problems), and peer- (social preference, aggression, withdrawal) ratings of socioemotional adjustment. Children's coping strategies were meaningfully associated with adjustment measures, although these associations differed for boys and girls in several instances. Importantly, both aggressive and ruminative coping strategies were positively associated with internalizing problems even after controlling for the effect of children's actual sociometric status. In addition, denial coping emerged as a significant moderator of the relation between status and adjustment.

AB Background: Studies of depressed mothers have generally been conducted in psychiatric settings with non-minority, middle-class women. Primary care has an increasing role in early detection and treatment, especially for the poor who have less access to specialized mental health services. Data on the relationship between maternal depression and problems in the offspring in a primary care context could help physicians to more effectively identify children in need of psychiatric help. Methods: All mothers aged 25 to 55 from a systematic sample of consecutive adults (response rate, 80%) in an urban general medicine practice were screened using the PRIME-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). Mothers who screened positive for major depression (n = 85); other psychiatric disorders, but not major depression (n = 67); or no psychiatric disorders (n = 191) were compared on their children's history of emotional problems, unmet need for mental health treatment, parent-child discord, maternal functional status and mental health treatment. Results: Compared to non-psychiatric controls, depressed mothers reported a three-times greater risk of serious emotional problems in their children (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-6.1); a four-times greater risk of having their children's problems left untreated (95% CI, 2.3-8.2), and a 10-times greater risk of having poor mother-child relations within the past month (95% CI, 3.9-29.4). Depressed mothers reported more functional disability, more psychiatric treatment and more problems in their offspring than mothers with non-depressive psychiatric disorders. Although a majority of mothers (regardless of psychiatric status) believed that counseling (96%) or medication (84%) should be offered to those with serious emotional problems, only about half (49%) of the depressed mothers had received mental health treatment in the past month. Limitations: Children were not assessed directly. Conclusions: The children of low-income depressed women at a general medicine practice were reported to have a greatly increased risk for emotional problems. Many mothers bad not received treatment for their own emotional problems. By enquiring about the emotional health of children of adult primary care patients, primary care providers have an opportunity to promote early detection and to facilitate appropriate treatment for both the mothers and their children.

AB Background. Despite the demonstrable influence of both genes and the family environment on children's behavioural and emotional development, the mechanisms by which these factors are transmitted from parents to their children are not known. Numerous aspects of the family have long been associated with behavioural and emotional problems in children; it is not clear, however, whether these family variables represent genuine environmental risks or secondary consequences of the underlying genetic liability shared between parents and their children.
   Method. In this Study We present a model for analysing the non-genetic contributions of family background to risk for childhood and adolescent depression and conduct disturbance using simulated data on adult MZ and DZ twins, their spouses and children.
   Results. The twin offspring design provides substantial power to detect remarkably small non-genetic effects on parent-offspring resemblance against the background of genetic transmission. As presented, the model is able to resolve the direction of transmission from both parent to child (passive genotype-environment correlation) and child to parent (evocative genotype-environment correlation).
   Conclusions. Unlike many other genetic studies, a study of twins and their children can sort out which putative family environmental risk factors do actually have a significant environmental impact on the child and which ones only appear to do so because they are associated with genetic mediation.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate children's perceptions (i.e. expectations) of the interventions that teachers should implement to deal with their loneliness. The role of significant others in children's attempts to cope with loneliness and the children's perceptions of that role have been neglected by researchers. A random sample of 180 second, fourth and sixth graders from Athens, the capital of Greece, were individually interviewed. Qualitative analysis using the 'concept-indicator model' (Strauss, 1987) showed that school-age children have an adequate understanding of the loneliness alleviation strategies that teachers can and should use. The strategies may be distinguished into the two already known broad categories of coping, that is problem-focused or active coping strategies (i.e. manifestation of interest and care, intervention in the peer group, encouragement to approach peers and make friends, consultation for personal improvement, informing parents), and emotion-focused or avoidance coping strategies (i.e. emotion regulation, encouragement to engage in activities and inability to cope). Results are discussed in terms of their implications for the role of the teacher in alleviating loneliness, for school-based interventions with this purpose, as well as for their contribution in the existing knowledge about coping with loneliness strategies.

AB Scholars have proposed that individualistic values resulting from globalization are associated with increasing behavioral and emotional problems among youth in modernizing cultures. This study examined specific individualistic and traditional values in the context of suicidal ideation and behaviors in Hong Kong among community adolescent youths (N = 2427) ages 14-18 years. Participants indicated the extent to which self-direction/independence and obedience/respect for elders were important to them. They also reported on four progressive levels of suicidality: whether in the last year they had experienced suicidal ideation, made plans for a suicide attempt, attempted suicide, and (for attemptors) made a serious attempt requiring medical attention. After controlling for quality of family relationships and depressive symptoms, at least one of the values predicted suicidality at all but the highest level. There were sex-specific associations between values and suicidality. In general, endorsement of self-direction was correlated with reduced risk of suicidality for boys and was irrelevant to girls. In contrast, traditional emphases on obedience and respect for elders were more frequently protective against suicidality for girls and were inconsistent predictors for boys. The relationship between values and suicidality was generally independent of the effect of family relationships and depressive symptoms. Thus, values were associated with adolescent suicidality, but not consistently in the direction predicted by some theorists, and the association depended upon the adolescent's sex.

AB Risk taking and novelty seeking are hallmarks of typical adolescent behavior. Adolescents seek new experiences and higher levels of rewarding stimulation, and often engage in risky behaviors, without considering future outcomes or consequences. These behaviors can have adaptive benefits with regard to the development of independence and survival without parental protection, but also render the adolescent more vulnerable to harm. Indeed, the risk of injury or death is higher during the adolescent period than in childhood or adulthood, and the incidence of depression, anxiety, drug use and addiction, and eating disorders increases. Brain pathways that play a key role in emotional regulation and cognitive function undergo distinct maturational changes during this transition period. It is clear that adolescents think and act differently from adults, yet relatively little is known about the precise mechanisms underlying neural, behavioral, and cognitive events during this period. Increased investigation of these dynamic alterations, particularly in prefrontal and related corticolimbic circuitry, may aid this understanding. Moreover, the investigation of mammalian animal models of adolescence-such as those examining impulsivity, reward sensitivity, and decision making-may also provide new opportunities for addressing the problem of adolescent vulnerability.

AB To examine adolescent depression as a model for unusual emotion regulation, the current study considered the influence of gender, pubertal development, and cortisol on self-reported mood. Children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (n = 35, mean age 12.5 years) were compared with psychiatrically healthy children and adolescents (n = 36, mean age 10.5 years). During a three-day assessment, participants rated their mood at three time points, pubertal development was determined through physical examination, and plasma cortisol was sampled during the second night. Depressed participants experienced less positive affect and more negative affect than did controls. Diagnostic group, gender, and pubertal status interacted to predict negative affect, with depressed adolescent girls experiencing especially high levels of negative affect. Cortisol was generally unrelated to depression and mood. Findings are consistent with emotion-based models of depression and with the literature on depression and emotion regulation during adolescence.

AB The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which direct and indirect bullying and victimization at school affects the mental and physical health of 661 Italian boys and girls, aged 11 to 15 years old. The impact of bullying and victimization is assessed by taking into account the relative buffering effect of a positive relationship with one or both parents. Internalizing symptoms such as withdrawn behaviors, somatic complaints, and anxiety and depression, measured with the self-administered Youth Form of the Achenbach's Child Behavioral Checklist, are indicators of maladjustment. Multiple regression analyses revealed that being a girl is a strong significant risk factor for all internalizing symptoms. Being a victim of indirect bullying is the strongest predictor of withdrawn behaviors, somatic complaints, and anxiety/depression, independent of direct victimization, which significantly predicts somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression, but not withdrawn behaviors. Bullying others directly by hitting, threatening, or calling names is not a significant predictor the poor mental and somatic health of youngsters, whereas indirect bullying (spreading rumors or not talking to someone on purpose) does significantly predict anxiety and depression, as well as withdrawn behaviors. The negative impact of victimization and bullying is buffered by youngsters' positive relationship with one or both parents. Recommendations are provided with regard to possible intervention strategies underlying the importance of distinguishing between different forms of bullying and victimization and providing social support in each different case.

AB Tested a theoretical model in which social cognitions about aggression partially mediated the relation of environmental and emotion regulation factors to children's aggressive behavior. An ethnically diverse sample of 778 children (57% girls) in grades 4-6 from both urban and suburban schools participated. Measures included exposure to aggression (seeing/hearing about aggression, victimization), emotion regulation (impulsivity, anger control), social cognitions about aggression (self-evaluation, self-efficacy, retaliation approval, aggressive fantasizing, caring about consequences), and aggressive behavior. Results supported the hypothesis that social cognitions mediate the relations of exposure to aggression and anger control to aggressive behavior. Also, social cognitions about direct and indirect aggression differentially predicted the respective behaviors with which they are associated. That is, social cognitions about direct aggression were mediators of direct aggressive behavior, whereas social cognitions about indirect aggression were mediators of indirect aggressive behavior. Finally, gender moderated the relations among the variables such that for girls, retaliation approval beliefs were a strong mediator, whereas for boys, self-evaluation was more important.

AB This article examines relationships between familial emotional support, self-esteem, emotional well-being, and delinquency in 58 adjudicated Mexican American adolescents who were on probationary status with the juvenile justice system. Results indicated that maternal emotional support was negatively correlated with delinquency, and positively correlated with emotional well-being. In addition, regression analyses revealed that familial emotional support significantly predicted delinquency and emotional well-being, with maternal emotional support accounting for most of the total variance. Unlike previous findings in the general delinquency research, familial emotional support was unrelated to self-esteem. These results offer several insights into the nature and effects of Mexican American familial emotional support on an adolescent's behavioral and emotional adjustment.

AB This work reports on a study to evaluate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to both competence scales and behavioral/emotional syndromes as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A total of 279 pairs of twins and same-sex sib-pairs aged 12-16 years were recruited from 51 junior high schools in Taipei City, Taiwan. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. The Mx program was used to estimate parameters for a full model that contains effects from sex-specific additive genes, shared environment, and nonshared environment for the majority of the scales. The shared environment in the full model was replaced with nonadditive genetic factors for some scales when indicated. All girls' competence and behavioral/emotional syndromes exhibited a substantial heritability (h(2)>0.4), except for Social Competence and Withdrawn. For boys, though the heritability was also >0.4 for some scales (Social and School Competence, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Delinquent Behavior, and Total Behavior Problems), environmental influences, especially shared environment, were predominant for most of the scales (10 out of 15 scales). Genetic factors are important for explaining adolescent behavioral problems, especially for girls, while shared environmental influences cannot be ignored for boys. Gender differences in heritability exist for various CBCL-based competence and behavioral/emotional problems.

AB Objective: To establish the nature and extent of maltreatment experiences, coping strategies, and behavioral/emotional problems, and their relationships, in a sample of Palestinian adolescents.
   Method: A study of 97 male adolescents aged 15-19 years, and attending a vocational training center based in the Gaza Strip. Adolescents completed the Child Maltreatment Schedule and the Ways of Coping Scale (WAYS). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was completed by adolescents and by their teachers.
   Results: Findings revealed high rates of emotional and physical maltreatment. Reliance on emotion-focused or avoidant coping strategies was associated with exposure to maltreatment. Use of maladaptive coping also predicted emotional difficulties in the respondents.
   Conclusions: Coping strategies are an important indicator of psychosocial functioning in adolescents who have experienced maltreatment. Identification of coping styles can augment the assessment of at-risk adolescents. Emotion-focused strategies, in particular, appear to be widely used by young people from non-Western cultural backgrounds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined whether the relationship between college students' adaptive family functioning and the valence of emotions following recent conflict with their parents is mediated by both distal constructs (psychological coping resources and mood regulation expectancies) and the more proximal construct of cognitive appraisals about the desirability or undesirability of the conflict experience. Participants were 609 undergraduate students enrolled in a large, US southwestern university. The results of applying proposed mediational models to these data, developed for both paternal and maternal conflict, suggested theoretically meaningful associations between the antecedent construct of adaptive family functioning, mediating variables of coping resources, mood regulation expectancies, and cognitive appraisals, and the outcome variable of emotional valence. The results of this study may be useful in identifying psychological resources and patterns of thinking about stressful events that affect emotional reactions.

AB As part of the validation procedure of a new parent questionnaire ("Five to Fifteen" or the FTF) a random sample of 1500 children aged 5-13 years from the Swedish Population Register (SPAR) was approached. The FTF and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were sent to the parents of the children together with questions about background conditions. After two reminders the response rate was 55.6%. The final sample had a mean age of 9.12 years (SD = 1.89) and a sex distribution with 55% boys and 45% girls. Analysis of attrition did not support overrepresentation of foreigners/immigrants in the attrition population. FTF like CBCL showed sensitivity to sociodemographic variables. On the FTF fewer problems were indicated for girls in all domain scales, whereas this was true for the summary scale Externalising and Mixed problems of the CBCL. The effects of age and area of residence were slight, but parental education was negatively related to all domain scales of the FTF and to all the CBCL scales. The intercorrelations of the FTF and CBCL scales with common content showed substantial overlap supporting the validity of the FTF scales. The correlation between scales within the FTF however also indicates a substantial comorbidity. This is also supported by the substantial correlation between problem score of the FTF domains perception, language, motor skills and the CBCL scale scores Attention, Social problems as well as the summary scale Mixed problems. These findings indicate that problems with inattention and social relations are shared across the various problem domains. Factor analysis of the FTF subdomain scores resulted in two factors, one representing learning problems and the other behavioural/emotional problems. Despite the low response rate the representativity of the sample was supported by the fact that the total problem score of CBCL was very similar to that of another Swedish sample with a relatively high response rate. The finding of a frequency of AD/HD symptoms in the FTF rating corresponding to the figures of prevalence of AD/HD in several international epidemiological studies could also be seen as support for the relevance of the findings. Thus, the results give support to the usefulness of the FTF questionaire as an instrument that can help in delineating specific problem areas within the field of child neuropsychiatry. Through the comparison with the CBCL the validity of the FTF for the parts that the two instruments share could be ascertained and the value of tapping a broader problem area could be elucidated.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the German self-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in a clinical setting. We also investigated whether this additional information gathered directly from older children and adolescents improves the prediction of clinical status when external ratings from their parents and/or teachers are already available. Methods SDQ self-reports were collected from 214 in- and outpatients (81 girls and 133 boys) aged 11 to 17 years who were seen at the department of child and adolescent psychiatry of the University of Gottingen. Results obtained with the self-rated questionnaire were compared with the parent and teacher SDQs, corresponding CBCL/YSR scores, and the clinical diagnostic classification. Finally, the additional diagnostic benefits of the self-reports were examined. Results The scales of the SDQ self-report proved to be sufficiently homogeneous, and acceptable correlations were found with the equivalent parent and teacher ratings. The self-rated version of the SDQ demonstrated good validity with respect to the differentiation between clinically defined cases and non-cases and in detecting various subcategories of psychiatric disorders within the clinic sample. SDQ self-reports significantly contributed to the prediction of diagnostic status, specifically if only parent or teacher ratings were available. Conclusions The self-rated version of the SDQ was shown to be a reliable and valid method for the assessment of behavioural problems in children and adolescents. In the absence of adult informant reports from parents and teachers, the diagnostic value of self-ratings was also demonstrated.

AB The aims of this study were the Italian standardization of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18) and the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), the analysis of the internal consistency of the two instruments, and the evaluation of the agreement between parents' and teachers' ratings. A group of 1423 parents and 1464 teachers of children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years, from three different provinces of Northern Italy, were randomly recruited. Boys scored higher than girls on the Externalizing scales on both CBCL and TRF, while there were no significant differences between the two sexes on the Internalizing scales. In general, internalizing problems increased with age, whereas externalizing behaviors decreased, mainly through a reduction of aggressive problems in older subjects. For most scales, low socioeconomic status was associated with high problem scores. Most scales of the CBCL and the TRF showed a satisfactory internal consistency, with higher alpha coefficients for overt behaviors. A low - to - moderate parents' and teachers' agreement was found, with the higher correlation found for the Attention Problems scale. Overall, the figures of this first standardization are in line with the results of most studies carried out in Western and Eastern countries, evidencing a good applicability of Achenbach's instruments in Italy.

AB This study examined the relationship among burn scarring, severity and visibility, and body esteem. Previous work addressing this question has relied on case studies and small samples. We mailed a survey to 2500 members of a national burn survivor support group. Survivors were asked to complete and return the mailed survey or complete the survey on line at our Web site. Three hundred sixty-one survivors completed all questionnaires in the survey relevant to this study, which included measures of burn characteristics, social stigmatization, social support, depression, and body esteem. The sample characteristics were as follows: 52% were women, the mean age was 44.1 years, the mean age burned was 26 years, 88% were European American, 5% were African American, 4% were multiracial, 3% were other, the average TBSA was 48%, and the mean educational level was high school graduate. We measured scar visibility by asking survivors to rate "how often are your burn scars visible to others" on a six-point scale. We also asked them to rate the presence or absence of scars on 15 body parts, total TBSA, and number of surgeries. The correlation between visible scarring and different aspects of body esteem, that is, self-satisfaction with appearance (-.19) and perception of others reaction to your appearance (-.27), was statistically significant but low. Visible scarring was unrelated to self-satisfaction with weight (.01). Visible scarring had a low but significant correlation with perceived stigmatization (.23) and was not correlated with depression (0.01). Other measures of scarring also had low correlations with social and emotional outcome variables. Because scar severity and visibility are hypothesized to be particularly relevant to body esteem, we performed a multiple regression predicting body esteem. We entered the variables in three blocks: burn characteristics, demographic characteristics, and social and emotional characteristics. Burn characteristics accounted for less than 20% of the variance. R square for the final equation equated. 62, with social adjustment and depression accounting for the largest portion of the variance. In this sample, burn scar visibility and severity did not have a strong relationship with social and emotional adjustment variables. More effort must be placed into developing psychosocial interventions that help survivors accept scars, reduce depression, and build a strong loving support system.

AB This paper examines the literature regarding preadolescent (ages 9-12) psychiatric disorders, mental health problems, substance abuse disorders and the ecology of risk and protection. The paper is divided into three primary sections. The first section addresses the challenges in defining and applying disorders for preadolescents. The next section reviews the prevalence of psychiatric disturbances and substance abuse among preadolescents. This section also examines the state of knowledge regarding the emotional problems that do not meet DSM-IV criteria as disorders but that may be prodromal for future disorders. The final section reviews risks and preventive factors as well as an ecological theoretical framework that organizes the influences of psychiatric disturbances and substance use. The primary conclusion drawn from this review of the literature is that preadolescence is a critical developmental crossroads for the expression of mental health problems and the initiation of substance abuse and that researchers and clinicians should pay particular attention to this vulnerable age range.

AB Objective: To review stressful experiences and stress reactions among child and adolescent refugees, as well as interventions and ethical considerations in research and clinical work, within the framework of the chronological experiences of child refugees; namely, the phases of preflight, flight, and resettlement. Highlighted are special refugee populations such as unaccompanied minors, asylum seekers, and former child soldiers. Pertinent medical findings are summarized. Method: The authors reviewed articles from 1990 to 2003 addressing the topics above. Literature was gathered from databases including PsycINFO, Medline, and SocioFile. Pertinent earlier papers and those from other disciplines cited in database-identified articles were also included. Results: Child and adolescent refugees suffer from significant conflict-related exposures. Reactions to stress may be mediated by coping strategies, belief systems, and social relations. Conclusions: More research is needed on interventions, specifically on efficacy and cultural relevance. Interventions that have an impact on multiple ecological levels need further development and evaluation.

AB Generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents frequently turns out to be very complex with different comorbid anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms. Consequently, comprehensive individualized assessment and therapeutic procedures are particularly important. To illustrate this kind of approach, the diagnostic procedure involving a multimodal and multimethodal assessment of behavioral and emotional problems and also the cognitive-behavioral treatment approach used in the case of a 13-year-old boy with generalized anxiety disorder are described in detail here. In addition, the cognitive-behavioral interventions that can generally be used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder are presented.

AB Epidemiological studies of sleep disturbances in preschool and school-aged children are under-represented in international clinical research. Based on this fact we investigated the prevalence of insomnia and parasomnia in a representative sample of school-novices in Cologne in 2002 (Cologne Children's Sleep Study). We have also considered the relationship between sleep problems on the one hand and sleep hygienic variables, physical and somatic healthy factors and behavioral problems on the other. A high prevalence of insomnia problems (15%) and repeated nightmares (14%) in children of this age were found in parent's report. Thereas sleepwalking, night terrors and daytime sleepiness were reported less frequently. Children having a solid sleep-wake-schedule show significant less problems to fall into sleep and feel sleepy during the day. Moreover we focused the correlation between disturbed sleep and multiple influencing, as light irritating and noise. We found a two- to three times elevated risk for hyperactive and emotional problems for children with insomnia or parasomnia complaints with regard to the comorbidity of behavioural difficulties. These findings underline the necessity for diagnostic clarifying of sleep disturbances and intervention programs for behavioural disturbed and isolated sleep impaired children.

AB The purpose of this paper is to analyse personality and family variables related to adolescent aggressiveness and prosocial behaviour; emphasis has been placed on emotional processes linked to a lack of control or emotional regulation and child-rearing styles perceived by adolescents in their parents. An empirical analysis was carries out including 1.285 randomly selected adolescents (aged 13 to 18, 698 males and 597 females). Discriminating analyses were conducted. Results showed that emotional processes reach higher correlation with aggressive behaviour, emotional instability and proneness to anger being the main predicting factors of aggressiveness, while empathy appears like the main predictor of prosocial behaviour. The parents' child-rearing styles have a secondary position in drawing the differential profile between high and low prosocial proneness, behind personal variables and are moved by emotional processes in prediction of aggressive behaviour.

DE boys; adolescent males; male violence; rites of passage; boy code;

AB Unlike the separation-based, stereotyped views of boys' developmental movement into adulthood, this paper will argue that there are more modern and relational models, as well as multiple pathways, for young males to journey through such rites of passage. Indeed, it will be suggested and supported by both qualitative and quantitative data that the more classic models depend on a "boy code" of traumatic separation from mother and the feminine, a process that is not only negative rather than positive in its developmental trajectory, but also likely to create a premature traumatic separation, leaving boys at risk for emotional maladjustment, everyday sadness, increased incidence of depression and the potential for violence toward the self, suicide, as well as violence toward others. More-positive visions and versions of male rites of passage will be posited and described. The definition of emotional "resilience" during this significant period will be re-addressed as one of "healthy vulnerability," sustained through connection to loving adults, rather than a classic belief in stoicism and release from relational ties. Attachment theory will be brought to bear and the desperate yearnings of adolescent males not only for connection to adult mentors, but also for non-romanticized friendships with adolescent females, will be discussed. Finally, the understanding and substitution of these new, more positive, developmental pathways will be linked to the prevention of violence.

AB Objective: The goal of this study was to predict the onset of mood and anxiety disorders from parent-reported emotional and behavioral problems in childhood across a 14-year period from childhood into young adulthood.
   Method: In 1983, parent reports of behavioral and emotional problems were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist for children and adolescents 4-16 years of age from the Dutch general population. At follow-up 14 years later, lifetime mood and anxiety diagnoses were obtained by a standardized DSM-IV interview for 1,580 subjects. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict the incidence of mood and anxiety disorders from childhood problems and demographic covariates.
   Results: Mood disorders were significantly predicted by high scores on the anxious/depressed scale and on the internalizing composite (withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed). Anxiety disorders were significantly predicted by the social problems scale and the externalizing composite (delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior). Anxiety disorders predominantly started in childhood and early adolescence, whereas the incidence of mood disorders increased sharply in adolescence and young adulthood.
   Conclusions: These results suggest different developmental pathways for mood and anxiety disorders. The predictions based on problem behavior remained stable during the 14-year period across adolescence and young adulthood. The results therefore underline the importance of early intervention and prevention of behavioral and emotional problems in childhood.

AB As part of a larger investigation of very low income families, this study examined the characteristics that differentiated resilient from nonresilient school-age youths, with a focus on self-regulation (e.g., executive function, emotion regulation) skills. Resilience was operationally defined in a robust and comprehensive manner using well-established instruments that measured children's emotional well-being and mental health. Controlling for other explanatory variables, including differences in the experience of negative life events and chronic strains, resilient youths were notably different from nonresilient youths in terms of having greater self-regulatory skills and self-esteem, as well as in receiving More active parental monitoring. Study findings are discussed with regard to the theoretical framework of self-regulation and their implications for preventive intervention.

AB The study was part of the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development in which the same persons have been followed from age 8 through to age 36. The present sample was restricted to those men (n = 131) and women (n = 132) who were either living, or had lived, in a cohabiting or marital relationship. Data on socio-emotional characteristics were collected at ages 8 and 14 using teacher ratings, and on personality traits at age 27 using personality inventories. Marital data were collected at age 36 using an interview and questionnaires. The results showed, first, that divorced individuals differed from those in intact marriages in the aggressiveness versus compliance dimension in childhood and adolescence; the divorced individuals having been more aggressive and less compliant. Second, marriage at a young age in women, and unstable careers and childlessness in men added to the explanation of divorce. Third, poor-quality marriages were linked to anxiety and passivity in childhood for women, and to anxiety, emotional lability and aggression for men. Neuroticism in early adulthood explained dissatisfaction with the current relationship for men and hostility in the relationship for women. The results suggest that low emotional regulation plays a significant role as an antecedent of subsequent partner relationships.

It is the first study to comprehensively examine the psychological adjustment of intellectually gifted adolescents using both multi-informant ratings and multi-dimensional, co-normed instruments. Parent ratings indicated that the intellectually gifted adolescents showed lower levels of problem behaviour than their peers of average ability. Teacher ratings indicated no significant differences between the two groups. Adolescent self-reports showed no difference on a global measure of emotional adjustment. However, intellectually gifted adolescents reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms, a better attitude towards teachers, greater self-reliance and a greater sense of adequacy.

AB The objective of the present study was to examine relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptomatology across different types of life event. A sample of 138 secondary school students filled out a questionnaire. They were asked to indicate their most negative life event ever. On the basis of their answers, 3 types of negative life event were distinguished: loss, health threat, and relational stress experience. No relationship was found between type of negative life event and depressive symptomatology. Significant relationships were found between type of negative life event and the cognitive strategies self-blame and other-blame. Adolescents with a health threat experience scored higher on self-blame, while adolescents with a relational stress event scored higher on other-blame than the other groups. Significant relationships were also found between depressive symptomatology and the cognitive strategies self-blame, rumination, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, and catastrophizing. No interaction effects were found between type of negative life event and cognitive strategies, suggesting that relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptomatology are consistent across different types of life event.

AB This paper reports key findings of a review of instruments suitable for assessing emotional and social competence in preschool and primary school settings, commissioned by the English Department for Education and Skills. We aimed to identify instruments appropriate for children aged 3-11 years, applicable to the general population. Searches of the published literature were carried out using six electronic databases and a wide range of search terms, from 1990 to 2002. Notices were posted on the CASEL and Focus Project website notice boards. Contact was made with academics known to be active in the field. We included instruments developed during the period 1990-2002 and critically appraised their content, method of application, reliability,, validity, and appropriateness for screening (early, identification), profiling and monitoring.
   We describe 33 instruments, 21 of which were identified from the published literature. Many of the latter focused on negative aspects of social competence and behaviour Only two were considered relevant to the assessment of emotional competence: the Behavioural and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS) for assessment of individual children, and the Child Development Project Questionnaire (CDP) for class and school assessment. Twelve (12) instruments were identified through contact with researchers and practitioners. These differed from those in the published literature in that they, all included positive questions or statements and many, covered some aspects of emotional competence. Those most relevant to the assessment of emotional and social competence included the youth version of the Emotional Quotient Inventory, (EQ-i: YV) for children over 6 years, the Process-orientated Child Monitoring System (POMS) for 4-5 year olds and the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (DECA)for 2-5 year olds. Some of the most relevant instruments mentioned to us are still in development.

AB Objective: To address the mental health needs of youths who are arrested and detained in Illinois, an initiative was designed and implemented that identified youths with psychotic or affective disorders, linked them to community services and monitored their cases. This study assessed whether such linkage is possible and whether it improves clinical and forensic outcomes. Methods: Under the initiative, court staff refer youths Who may have a mental illness, to a clinical liaison. If the youth is eligible for the program, the liaison works with the family to develop a community-based action plan: For the analysis presented-here, the Child and Adoleseent Needs and Strengths -Mental Health Scale (CANS-MH) and the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) were used to assess outcomes among 314 youths who had completed the program at the time of the study. School and forensic outcomes were also monitored. Results: Seventy-five percent of the youths were successfully linked to at least one mental health or community service. A comparison of average CANS-MH dimension scores at enrollment and program completion indicated that youths' emotional problems decreased considerably within three months of referral. CAFAS scores six months after enrollment improved across nearly all dimensions. Homed community, and school functioning-were significantly improved from, baseline. Only 42 percent of the youths were rearrested, compared with a statewide rate of 72 percent of detained youths. Conclusions: By linking youths with significant mental health needs,to existing community-based, services, it appears possible both to ameliorate psychopathology and to reduce delinquency.

AB Through surveying of children in 10 nations with parent, teacher, and Youth Self-Report (YSR) forms of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), cross-informant syndromes (CISs) were derived and cross-validated by sample-dependent methodology. Generalizing CBCL syndromes and norms to nations excluded from its normative sample is problematic. This study used confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to test factor model fit for CISs on the YSR responses of 625 Jamaican children ages I I to 18 years. Item response theory (IRT), a sample-independent methodology, was used to estimate the psychometric properties of individual items on each dimension. CFAs indicated poor to moderate model-to-data fit. Across all syndromes, IRT analyses revealed that more than 3/4 of the cross-informant items yielded little information. Eliminating such items could be cost effective in terms of administration time vet improve the measure's discrimination across syndrome severity levels.

AB Aim: The majority of research investigating attachment and psychopathology has focused largely on children, and more recently adults. By comparison, few studies have considered the role of attachment on the development of psychopathology during adolescence. The scarcity of studies in this area is surprising given that adolescence is a critical period of psychological adjustment. This study investigates attachment patterns in adolescence and their relationship to symptomatology and interpersonal difficulties.
   Method: A two-sample comparative design was employed so that a clinical group of adolescents were compared with a matched non-clinical group, on attachment classifications (using a modified Separation Anxiety Test), reported interpersonal difficulties and clinical symptoms.
   Results: Significant differences were found between the clinical and non-clinical groups on attachment classifications. Adolescents with ambivalent attachment patterns reported significantly more interpersonal difficulties and symptoms compared to young people classified as having secure and avoidant attachment classifications. The results are suggestive of specific differences in the way difficulties are reported.
   Conclusion: The findings are consistent with two strategies of affect regulation. It is proposed that a 'hyperactivating' strategy and a 'deactivating' strategy may be operating among those adolescents with ambivalent and avoidant attachment classifications, respectively. The implications of using self-report measures in clinical work and for evidence-based practice are discussed.

An empirical analysis was carried out including 1,285 randomly selected youngsters (aged 13 to 18, 698 males and 597 females). The discriminating analyses conducted show that emotional processes reach higher correlation with aggressive behavior, emotional instability and proneness to anger being the main predicting factors of aggressiveness. The parents' child-rearing styles have a secondary position in drawing the differential profile between high and low aggressiveness individuals, particularly male ones.

AB This study examined links between emotion regulation and adjustment in a sample of 152 adolescents in Grades 7 (M age = 12) and 10 (M age = 15). Emotion regulation was assessed using the experience sampling method, in which adolescents provided multiple reports about the intensity, lability, and strategies used to regulate negative emotions across 1 week. Adolescents also completed self-report measures of adjustment. Adolescents who reported more intense and labile emotions and less effective regulation of these emotions also reported more depressive symptoms and problem behavior. Responding to negative emotions with disengagement (e.g., denial) or involuntary engagement (e.g., rumination) was less effective in regulating negative affect, and greater use of these strategies was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms and problem behavior.

DT Review
DE bullying; victimization; assessment; social emotional problems
AB Bullying is a relationship problem in which power and aggression are used to cause distress to a vulnerable person. To assess and address bullying and victimization, we need to understand the nature of the problem, how the problem changes with age and differs for boys and girls, the relevant risk factors (those individual or environmental indicators that may lead to bullying and victimization), and the protective factors that buffer the impact of risk. For children involved in bullying, we need to assess its extent and the associated social, emotional, psychological, educational, and physical problems. Bullying is a systemic problem; therefore, assessments of bullying need to extend beyond the individual child to encompass the family, peer group, school, and community. We recommend that assessments at each of these levels reflect the scientific research on bullying and victimization. With attention to the problems associated with bullying, we can work collectively to make schools and communities safer for children and youth.

AB Purpose: To describe the Gatehouse Project which addresses the social context of high school with an aim of changing students' sense of school connection and in turn, health risk behavior and well-being.
   Methods: Distinguishing features of the project were its conceptual framework, implementation process, and evaluation design. The conceptual framework derived from attachment theory and focused on three aspects of the school social context: security, communication, and participation. Implementation was standardized around a survey of the school social environment, creation of a school-based action team, and the implementation of strategies matched to a school's profile of need. In addition, an early high school curriculum addressed the skills relevant to social functioning and emotional adjustment. The evaluation design was based on a cluster randomized trial involving 26 schools. It used follow-up of an individual cohort and repeat cross-sectional surveys to capture outcomes at an individual student and whole-school level.
   Results and Conclusions: The Gatehouse Project drew on both health and education research to develop and coordinate a broad-based school health promotion intervention. It represents a promising new direction for school-based preventive work. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2003.

AB Objective: To estimate genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental contributions to stability and change in internalizing and externalizing problems. Method: Maternal Child Behavior Checklist ratings were obtained for 3,873 twin pairs at age 3 and 1,924 twin pairs at age 7. For 1,575 twin pairs, ratings were available at both ages. Results: For Internalizing/Externalizing ratings, genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors explained about 59/51%,10/30%, and 31/19% of the variance at age 3, and 40/52%, 31/32%, and 29/16% of the variance at age 7. The phenotypic correlation of r = 0.38/0.54 between problems assessed at 3 and 7 years of age was explained for 66/55% by genetic factors, for 23/37% by shared environmental factors, and for 11/8% by nonshared environmental factors. The genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental correlations between ages 3 and 7 were 0.51/0.57, 0.47/0.66, and 0.13/0.24, respectively. Conclusions: Genetic and shared environmental factors were most important for the stability of Internalizing and Externalizing Problems between ages 3 and 7. Nonshared environmental factors were mainly age-specific. For Internalizing Problems, shared environment may become more important from early to middle childhood.

AB The development of a short form of the Gray-Wilson Personality Questionnaire (GWPQ-S) is described. On the basis of earlier, cross-cultural factor analyses of the original 120 items and 6 subscales it was decided to reduce the test to two major scales, the behavioural activation system (BAS) and the behavioural inhibition system (BIS). Although these bear similarity to the familiar factors of impulsiveness and anxiety, they differ in being derived from a pool of items specifically designed to tap human equivalents of the animal learning paradigms central to Gray's personality theory (approach, active avoidance, passive avoidance, extinction, fight and flight). Item reduction was based on factor loadings from a new sample of 454 Russian adolescents and correlations with previously validated criteria -teacher, parent and self-ratings of conduct and emotional problems. Despite the additional constraint of balanced direction of scoring (an advantage over previous BAS/BIS Scales), satisfactory internal consistency was achieved with a 28 item test (alphas of 0.67 and 0.64).

SO SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION

ID FAMILY; STRESS; STATISTICS; CHILDHOOD; BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; SIZE; RISK
AB School organization has been examined largely for its effects on academic achievement. Insufficient attention has been devoted to the school as a sociological context that influences adolescents' mental health. It is often asserted that small schools and private schools offer a unique sense of community that is conducive to adolescents' emotional adjustment, but empirical evidence of these mental health benefits is sparse. This study used the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to determine whether adolescents are protected in small and/or private schools, examining depression, suicidality, and violent dispositions. The results refute claims that students who attend these types of schools have better emotional adjustment than do those who attend large and/or public schools. In addition, the results suggest that small schools and private schools may actually be detrimental to adolescents' mental health. That is, net of selection effects, small schools are associated with higher levels of depression and a greater likelihood of attempted suicide for male students. In addition, private schools are associated with increased odds of the use or threat of use of weapons by both male and female students.

AB Objective. To examine the effects of a catastrophe on the mental health of adolescents using prospective data from before and after the catastrophe.
   Design. Prospective, comparative.
   Method. The Volendam cafe fire wounded about 250 adolescents, of whom 14 died. In September and October 1999, 15 months before the catastrophe, all grade 2 pupils from the main Volendam secondary school (of whom 31 were in the cafe as the fire broke out) and from two other schools had been included as control group in a planned study. They had provided self-report data on behavioural and emotional problems (using the questionnaire 'Youth Self-Report'; YSR) and on substance use. In May 2001, 5 months after the catastrophe, follow-up data were collected in accordance with the protocol from 91 of 124 Volendam children (aged 13-14 years) for whom 1999-data were available (73.4%) and from 643 of 830 control children (77.5%).
   Results. Volendam children exhibited higher increases in the proportion of clinical scores on the YSR scale for total problems (odds ratio: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.29; p = 0.046) and on excessive use of alcohol (4.57; 2.73-7.64; p < 0.0001), but not for smoking (0.87; 0.48-1.56; p = 0.63) and not for the use of marihuana ecstasy and sedatives. YSR increases were greatest for the syndromes 'anxiety/depression' (2.85; 1.23-6.61), 'thought problems' (2.16; 1.09-4.30), and 'aggressive behaviour' (3.30; 1.30-8.36). Intention to treat analyses, in which all cases of drop-out retained their original baseline values, showed statistically significant effects for the excessive use of alcohol and YSR syndromes. The effects were virtually the same for both the victims and their classmates.
   Conclusion. Post-catastrophe interventions should address anxiety, depression, thought problems, aggression and alcohol abuse among both victims and their peer group.

AB Purpose: To explore the experiences of chronically ill adolescents in communicating with health professionals, including the identification of factors which hinder or facilitate their use of health professionals as an information source.
   Methods: 63 adolescents (11-16 years) with a chronic condition (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, epilepsy, juvenile chronic arthritis, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy) were interviewed, and subsequently took part in two group discussion meetings with other adolescents of a similar age with the same condition. Data were analyzed using the framework method involving data reduction, data display, and conclusion-drawing and verification.
   Results: Factors affecting the openness and effectiveness of communication included: duration and frequency of contact; gender; perceived attitudes towards adolescents; the communication skills of the adolescent and health professional; and the presence of parents and medical students/trainee doctors. The type of information needed also affected whether the adolescents felt able to discuss an issue with a health professional. Adolescents were reluctant to raise personal or sensitive issues or to ask questions that revealed poor adherence. A perceived lack of interest in the wider impacts of having a chronic condition on day-to-day life was also a barrier to adolescents discussing difficulties at school and socio-emotional problems.
   Conclusions: Communication and information provision are key roles for health professionals, yet this study highlights a population with potentially high levels of information need who are facing considerable barriers to addressing these needs. Steps taken to improve adolescent-health professional communication need to address a range of practical, attitudinal and behavioral factors. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2003.

AB Examined the mutual influence on maternal depressive symptoms and child adjustment problems and their antecedent-consequence conditions across 3 cycles of panel data collected over a 4-year period in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). Results indicated stability in, and relations between, maternal and child outcomes. Cross-lagged panel correlations showed that maternal depressive symptoms tended to precede child aggression and hyperactivity but tended to follow child emotional problems. Temporal relations were interpreted in the context of mechanisms that transmit risk between mothers and children. Logistic regression analysis showed bidirectional risk between maternal mood and child adjustment after earlier symptoms were statistically controlled. These findings indicate that maternal depression increases the risk of adjustment problems in children, and vice versa, underscoring the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology.

ID MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRIVATION
AB Study objective: This study investigates whether neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage may contribute to child behavioural and emotional problems, beyond the effects of parental socioeconomic status. It also examines the influence of neighbourhood disadvantage on changes in the frequency of behavioural problems from late childhood into early adolescence.
   Design and setting: The study was conducted in a large community sample in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. An index of neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage was calculated for each of the city's 74 neighbourhoods. Multilevel regression analysis estimated effects of neighbourhood disadvantage and individual variables (parental socioeconomic status, child's gender, and age) on behavioural problems reported by children (Youth Self-Report) and parents (Child Behavior Checklist) and on changes in these scores over a two year follow up.
   Participants: A cohort of all children born in 1978 and living in Rotterdam. Of those eligible, 73% (n=2587) participated in the first measurement (T1), at 10-12 years; 71% of the T1 respondents participated again two years later (T2), at 12-14 years.
   Main results: Neighbourhood disadvantage was associated with higher Total, Internalising, and Externalising Problems, as assessed with both the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report, even after controlling for parental socioeconomic status. Neighbourhood disadvantage also seemed to contribute to increases in Total Problems over the follow up.
   Conclusions: Living in a disadvantaged neighbourhood is associated with greater behavioural problems and may lead to an exacerbation of problems as children move from childhood into adolescence. Public health interventions to improve child mental health must take the neighbourhood environment into account.

AB The Kidcope (A. Spirito, L. J. Stark, & C. Williams, 1988), a brief screening measure of coping strategies for children and adolescents, was subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in a sample of adolescents in Hong Kong. A 2-factor model was found to fit the data when only the 2 emotional regulation items were treated separately and were allowed to load on the 2 different factors. Further analyses showed that factor loadings, factor variances, and factor covariance were invariant across age and gender. On the basis of the factor analyses, the authors created 2 composite scores, representing control-oriented and escape-oriented coping strategies. Implications for the use of the Kidcope in research and preventive intervention are discussed.

ID CHILDHOOD MIGRAINE; PEDIATRIC HEADACHE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; DISORDERS
AB Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of autogenic relaxation training in a mildly disturbed outpatient population of children and adolescents with mostly internalizing symptoms, and/or some aggressive, impulsive, or attention deficit symptoms. Method: Fifty children and adolescents from southern Germany (mean age 10.2 years; range 6-15 years; mostly intact middle class family background) participated in a group intervention program. Fifteen patients were randomly assigned to a waiting-list control group. Behavior symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist), psychosomatic complaints (Giessen Complaint List), and level of stress were assessed before and after the intervention or after the waiting phase. Individual goal attainment was evaluated at the end of the intervention and in a 3-month follow-up. Results: The parent report on CBCL reflected reduced symptoms compared with control. The child report indicated reduced stress and psychosomatic complaints both in the intervention and control group, and no significant group X time interaction effects occurred on these scales. Effect sizes of 0.49 in the CBCL and 0.36 in the complaint list indicated clinically relevant effects of the intervention compared with the control group. At the end of the intervention, 56% of the children and 55% of the parents reported partial goal attainment, 38% of the children and 30% of the parents reported complete goal attainment; 71% of the parents confirmed partial goal attainment 3 months postintervention. Conclusions: Autogenic relaxation training is an effective broadband method for children and adolescents.

Sixteen imported measures from the West are identified and their psychometric equivalence across cultures is reviewed; 2 new measures are briefly introduced. Although initial evidence is generally promising, more studies are needed to support their use in Asia. One recently developed Singapore measure cannot be considered genuinely indigenous. Culture-specific items proposed for imported measures could be grouped into existing diagnostic constructs. There is, as yet, no strong theoretical support for culture-bound diagnostic constructs in Asian cultures.

AB Background Disasters greatly affect the mental health of children and adolescents, but quantification of such effects is difficult. Using prospective predisaster and postdisaster data for affected and control populations, we aimed to assess the effects of a severe disaster on the mental health and substance use of adolescents.
   Methods In January, 2001, a fire in a cafe in Volendam, Netherlands, wounded 250 adolescents and killed 14. In the 15 months before the disaster, all grade 2 students (aged 12-15 years) from a school in Volendam (of whom 31 were in the cafe during the fire), and from two other schools, had been selected as controls for a study. 124 Volendam students and 830 from the other two schools had provided data for substance use, and completed the youth self-report (YSR) questionnaire about behavioural and emotional problems. 5 months after the disaster, we obtained follow-up data from 91 (response rate 73.4%) Volendam adolescents and 643 (77.5%) controls from the other two schools. The primary outcome measures were changes in score in YSR categories of total problems, alcohol misuse, smoking, and substance use. We compared changes in scores between groups using logistic regression.
   Findings Volendam adolescents had larger increases in clinical scores than controls for total problems (odds ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.01-3.29, p=0.045) and excessive use of alcohol (4.57, 2.73-7.64, p<0.0001), but not for smoking or use of marijuana, MDMA (ecstasy), and sedatives. Increases in YSR scores were largest for being anxious or depressed (2.85, 1.23-6.61), incoherent thinking (2.16, 1.09-4.30), and aggressive behaviour (3.30, 1.30-8.36). Intention-to-treat analyses showed significantly larger for increases in rates of excessive drinking and YSR symptom subscales in Volendam adolescents than controls. Effects were mostly similar in victims and their classmates.
   Interpretation Mental health interventions after disasters should address anxiety, depression, thought problems, aggression, and alcohol abuse of directly affected adoloscents and their peer group.

AB Recent research has found a positive association between insecure adult attachment styles and harmful drinking patterns. In the present study, we examined the relation between alcohol-related consequences and two dimensions underlying attachment, 'model of self' and 'model of others,' among a population of college student drinkers (N = 366). It was predicted that a negative model of self would contribute significantly to the variance in drinking problems over and above that accounted for by level of alcohol consumption. In an attempt to clarify the nature of the relationship among these variables, it was further hypothesized that coping drinking motives would mediate the relationship between the self attachment dimension and alcohol consequences. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed results consistent with the predictions. There was a significant relationship between negative model of self and problems which was fully mediated by coping drinking motives. The findings support the basic theoretical supposition that one primary function of interpersonal attachment is the regulation of emotions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study compared ratings for self-reported behavioral and emotional problems in adolescents from seven countries.
   Method: Youth Self-Report scores were analyzed for 7,137 adolescents ages 1118 years from general population samples from Australia, China, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States.
   Results: Comparisons of problems scores yielded small to medium effect sizes for cross-cultural variations. Youths from China and Jamaica had the highest and youths from Israel and Turkey had the lowest mean total problems scores. With cross-cultural consistency, girls scored higher for internalizing and lower for externalizing than boys. Cross-cultural correlations were high among the mean item scores.
   Conclusions: Empirically based assessment provided a robust method for assessing and comparing adolescents' self-reported problems. Self-reports thus supplemented empirically based assessments of parent-reported problems and offered a cost-effective way of identifying problems for which adolescents from diverse cultural backgrounds may need help.

AB Most children adjust to their chronic illnesses within the span of 1 year; most families achieve healthy stable functioning with accommodations for the illness. The challenge of adjusting to a chronic illness can provide an excellent opportunity for a child or adolescent to master crucial skills, such as emotion regulation and problem-solving. Mastery of these skills can engender strong self-esteem and confidence. As our knowledge about the predictive factors for positive behavioral outcomes increases, the pediatrician can be in the position to minimize the negative behavioral aspects of chronic illness and facilitate adjustment. Attention to the behavioral aspects of chronic illness, in the three critical areas of psychosocial adjustment of the patient, adjustment of the family, and adherence to regimens, allows pediatricians to play a crucial role in prevention, early identification, and early interventions.

AB In a sample of 1,940 Dutch 7-year-old twin pairs we studied the etiology of individual differences in Internalizing and Externalizing behavioral problems. For the majority of twins in the sample, both maternal and paternal ratings of behavioral problems were obtained from the Child Behavior Checklist. This made it possible to take into account processes underlying agreement and disagreement between maternal and paternal ratings. For both problem behaviors, a Psychometric model fitted the data better than a Rater Bias model, implying that parents, in addition to the behaviors they similarly observed, also assessed unique aspects of their children's behaviors. Relatively large genetic influences were found for Externalizing problems, explaining over 50% of the variance in both boys and girls. For internalizing problems, the heritability was over 30% in both sexes. Shared environmental factors were nearly as important as genetic influences in explaining the variation in behavioral problems. For both Externalizing and Internalizing problems, around 30% of the variance was accounted for by the shared environmental factors.

AB The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for psychosocial problems in siblings of paediatric cancer patients. One and 6 months after diagnosis, sibling self-reported anxiety, social-emotional problems and quality of life (QoL) were assessed, as were the predictor variables: sibling prediagnosis functioning, age and gender and the ill child's diagnosis. At 1 month, siblings reported a lower QoL and adolescent girls reported more emotional problems compared with peers. At 6 months, adolescent QoL remained relatively impaired. Over time, adolescent brothers reported fewer emotional and total problems and young girls reported decreased anxiety. No significant amelioration in QoL was found over time. The older the siblings were, the lower their observed QoL at both measurements and in several domains. The occurrence of life events predicted sisters' QoL at 1 month. Changes in sibling functioning were predicted by none of the investigated risk factors. Thus, QoL is impaired shortly after diagnosis. Adolescent siblings risk persisting problems in daily functioning. Further prospective research on other risk factors such as coping and family functioning over time is needed.

AB An initial study of young adults with high and low exposure to community violence found that aggression was related to increased baseline heart rate variability (HRV), reduced baseline heart rate (HR), and increased poststressor cortisol level. Based upon previous research on biosocial interactions, this study tested specific predictions that the cardiovascular-aggression link would be found only in nonvictims and the cortisol-aggression link only in victims. Forty-seven victims and nonvictims completed self-reports of aggression and two stressor tasks. Results supported the hypotheses for HRV and cortisol. However, reduced HR was associated with aggression in both victims and nonvictims, and its variance was explained by increased HRV Findings support biosocial theories of violence and are discussed in terms of vagally mediated HR underarousal and emotion dysregulation in antisocial populations.

AB Whereas school-based Prevention Programs often target deficits in individual children's social skills in order to limit their aggression or exposure to peer victimization, there is increasing evidence that school-wide and classroom-level factors can also affect the success of these programs. This short-term longitudinal study involved 432 elementary school students from 44 classrooms in 17 urban schools'. We investigated whether classroom characteristics (average levels of social competence, emotional problems, and behavioral problems) and school-wide characteristics (proportion of children on income assistance and implementation of a peer victimization prevention program-the Walk away, Ignore, Talk, and Seek help [W.LTS.] program) experienced in Grade I influences changes in children's reports of relational and physical victimization at the end of Grade 2. Findings showed that classroom levels of emotional problems predicted increases in relational victimization (beyond individual differences in emotional and behavioral problems). Classroom levels of behavioral problems predicted reports of increases in physical victimization (beyond individual differences). Classroom levels of social competence also interacted with individual levels of emotional Problems such that children with higher levels of emotional problems in classes with more socially competent children reported more relational and physical victimization. Higher school levels of poverty and lack of program involvement also predicted higher levels of physical victimization, beyond individual and classroom effects. The capacity of the W.I.T.S. program to influence classroom level characteristics and the moderating effects of school poverty on victimization were also assessed. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Israeli Jews and Arabs live in one country with surprisingly little knowledge of each other. Representative samples of the Israeli Jewish (n = 485) and Arab (n = 384) populations responded to a questionnaire regarding the importance and availability of different social support functions, the quality of different social relationships, and to whom they would turn with different problems. Results show that despite similarity in the value attributed to the different support functions, there were consistent differences in the perceived availability and utilization of support. Israeli Arabs were less likely to discuss emotional problems or use professional help and more likely to use familial help. Israeli Jews were more likely to turn to a spouse, a friend, a professional, and a superior. These findings have theoretical and practical significance.

AB This study examines age and gender differences in descriptions of emotional reactions and reports of the intensity and duration of those emotional responses to interpersonal tensions. As part of a larger study, 185 (85 male and 100 female) participants aged 13 to 99 described the last time they were upset with members of their social networks. Participants then described how they felt and rated the intensity and duration of their distress. Participants' reported emotions were grouped by use of theoretically derived categories and empirically derived post hoc categories. Three emotion categories were examined: anger, sadness, and nonspecific negative emotions. Adolescents and young adults were more likely than older adults to describe anger. Adolescents and young adults also reported more intense aversive responses than older adults. Women rated their distress as more intense than men. With the exception of middle-aged and oldest-old adults, women reported that they experienced distress for a longer duration than men. Findings are interpreted in terms of theories regarding age and gender differences in emotion regulation and interpersonal tensions.

AB Asthma is known to have a direct impact on the quality of life of children with asthma and their families as a consequence of the attacks on day-to-day life. Psychopathological factors may be associated with poor quality of life by modulating the handicap and the patient's experience of it. The authors' objective was to evaluate the relationship between emotional and behavioral problems and quality of life, as assessed by the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire. The study group consisted of 100 adolescent outpatients with asthma who were undergoing regular checkups: 70 boys and 30 girls, ages 12 to 19. They were evaluated by means of self-administered questionnaires completed by their parents. Path analysis was used to propose a model of relationships between psychopathology and quality of life. The quality of life of the children with asthma and their parents was clearly associated with the presence or absence of psychological problems in the patients. Emotional problems were associated with the quality of life of both the patients and their parents; behavioral problems had a smaller effect on the quality of life of the parents only. The authors proposed a structural model of the quality of life of adolescents with asthma and their parents in which quality of life is dependent on psychological variables and is responsible for emotional problems. Multivariate analyses indicated that the quality of life of the children with asthma and their parents and the correlation between quality of life and psychopathology depended little on medical variables such as the duration of illness, its pretreatment severity, or hospitalizations in the past year In contrast, the quality of life of the parents depended on that of the children and vice versa. This study showed that scores on the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire reflected not only the medical status of the patients but also psychological variables, which appeared to be a consequence of the functional handicap associated with asthma. Patients who assess the quality of their lives as poor would benefit from psychological evaluation and support.

AB We suggest that the core feature of bipolar disorder (BPD) is marked state fluctuations. The pathophysiology of switches into depressed, irritable, and extreme positive valence states requires study, with the latter deserving particular focus because it represents a pathognomonic feature of BPD in both adults and children. Hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of pediatric BPD must account for these marked state fluctuations as well as for specific developmental aspects of the illness. These developmental aspects include marked irritability (in addition to euphoria and depression) and very rapid cycles, along with high rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We review research on neural mechanisms underlying positive valence states and state regulation, focusing on those data relevant to BPD and to development. Researchers are beginning to explore the response of manic patients and control subjects to positive affective stimuli, and considerable research in both nonhuman primates and humans has focused on the cortico-limbic-striatal circuits mediating responses to rewarding stimuli. In control subjects, positive affect affects cognition, and data indicate that prefrontal electroencephalogram asymmetry may differ between control subjects with consistently positive affect and those with more negative affect; however, this latter generalization may not apply to adolescents. With regard to the pathophysiology of state switching in pediatric BPD, data in control subjects indicating that attention regulation plays a role in emotion regulation may be germane. In addition, research detailing physiologic and psychological responses to negative emotional stimuli in bipolar patients and control subjects may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying both irritability and rapid cycling seen in children with BPD. Potential foci for research on the pathophysiology of pediatric BPD include reactivity to standardized positive and negative emotional stimuli, and the interaction between emotion regulation and attentional processes.

AB When cancer is diagnosed in a parent, this may also have consequences for the children. The purpose of this pilot study was to gain more insight into the psychosocial consequences for children of a parent with cancer, from the perspective of both the children and their parents. For this study, 14 families participated in semistructured interviews and completed standardized questionnaires. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using content analysis techniques. No significant difference was found in behavioral and emotional problems between the children in these families and the normative sample. However, parents reported problems on a borderline and clinically elevated level in one third of the children, and three of seven children self-reported problems on these levels. The interview results showed that parents reported (temporary) behavioral problems in most children during the acute stage of their parents' illness. Other problems, such as anxiety, sleeping disorders, and compulsive behavior, persisted for longer. Parents reported that their children had more problems than the children themselves reported. This finding was not supported by the quantitative analysis. The results from the Child Behavior Checklist and the Dutch version of the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales showed that children of families with poor family functioning were more vulnerable. In particular, extremely high adaptation (chaotic) and extremely low family cohesion (disengaged) seemed related to the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in these children. Absence of home healthcare was an additional burden for adolescent children.

ID NATION OUTCOME SCALES; ROUTINE
AB Objectives: To assess the health and social functioning of patients attending a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and to measure the impact of attendance using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA).
   Method: HoNOSCA was completed on 73 consecutive patients attending for initial assessment with a review assessment being completed after six months or at discharge from the clinic if this occurred sooner on 53 of these. The impact of attendance at the clinics was determined by comparing initial and review mean HoNOSCA Scores.
   Results: Of the 53, 66% were male and 34% female. Boys were more highly rated with regard to aggressive behaviour, performance in peer relationships and family life relationships whilst girls were rated as having more nonorganic and emotional symptoms. Older children showed the highest rates of poor school attendance, non accidental (self) injury and emotional problems while younger children showed the greatest aggressive behaviour and language skill problems. An improvement in the total HoNOSCA score from initial assessment to review was seen in 92%. There was an improvement in the HoNOSCA mean score from initial assessment to review.
   Conclusions: Age, sex and symptom profiles of patients attending the service were similar to other CAMHS. Attendance at CAMHS produces improvements in patient outcomes over a six month period as measured Using HoNOSCA, which proved to be a useful if somewhat time consuming tool.

AB This article presents the results of a study that examined child and family influences on recidivism for 166 youths admitted to a shelter. The youths fell into two groups: (1) those who had run away before (repeat runaways) and (2) those who had run away for the first time (first-time runaways). Results indicated divergent pathways to shelter use and return within a 12-month period between these subgroups. Youth emotional problems were significantly related to recidivism for repeat runaways, whereas family changes and length of stay at the shelter were significantly related to recidivism for first-time runaways. Implications for design and delivery of a system of care to meet the complex mental health needs of runaway adolescents are discussed.

AB The present study documented the extent of gang involvement and gang membership in a sample of 602 homeless and runaway youth from four midwestern states. The study also compared gang members, gang-involved youth who were not members, and nongang youth on several dimensions including sociodemographic characteristics, family background, school experiences, street experiences and exposure, emotional problems, alcohol and drug use, and other delinquent and deviant behaviors. Findings indicated that a significant number of these youth were gang members (15.4% of the sample) or involved in gangs (32.2% of the sample). Youth gang members and gang-involved youth reported more family legal problems, had been suspended from school more, ran away at a younger age, used more alcohol and drugs, were exposed to more deviant peers, and attempted suicide more than did nongang youth. In addition, youth gang members reported less parental monitoring, more severe abuse, more street victimization, and more deviant subsistence strategies than did either gang-involved or noninvolved youth.

AB Objectives: To estimate the 12-month prevalence of suicidal behaviours by gender and to investigate the gender-specific factors associated with suicidal behaviours and to describe health service utilization by suicidal adolescents.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The baseline data of the Adolescent Health Study conducted in northern Nova Scotia were used.
   Results: Female students were more likely to report suicidal behaviours than male students (p<0.005). There was no gender difference in injurious suicide attempts. Depression was the strongest risk factor for suicidal behaviours in the two genders (p<0.005). Female students who reported drug use and living in a non-intact family were at higher risk of suicide attempts. Low self-esteem was positively associated with suicidal ideation and suicide planning among male students. Suicidal girls were more likely to seek professional help for emotional disturbance than boys. Family doctors were the most frequently contacted professional by suicidal adolescents.
   Conclusions: Some factors associated with suicidal behaviours among adolescents may be gender specific. Suicidal behaviours have been considered a depressive symptom. Most suicidal students, however, had not contacted a health professional for an emotional problem in this population. This presents challenges for prevention of suicidal behaviours among adolescents.

AB Objective To facilitate understanding of disagreement between mothers and adolescents when they report on adolescents' mental symptoms, discrepancy of reports were studied in relation to depressive symptoms of mothers and self-esteem of adolescents.
   Participants Sixty-eight mother-adolescent pairs participated. All the adolescents (11-17 years) were referred to child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics in Norway for emotional or behavioural disorders.
   Methods The adolescents completed the questionnaire Youth Self Report (YSR), and mothers completed the corresponding Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Maternal depression was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales and adolescent self-esteem was measured with Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents.
   Results Mothers' level of depression emerged as a significant variable (P < 0.001) predicting CBCL-YSR discrepancy on internalizing disorders, explaining 41% of the variance. With increased levels of depression mothers tended to report more internalizing problems compared to the adolescents. For mother-adolescent discrepancy on externalizing problems, adolescents' age was the most significant variable. With increasing age the adolescents were more in agreement with their mothers when reporting their externalizing problems. But also self-esteem problems concerning their looks made adolescents inclined to admit more externalizing problems, thus being more in agreement with their mothers.
   Conclusions Subjective, psychological variables such as mothers' level of depression and self-esteem of adolescents may be useful to consider when interpreting informant discrepancy concerning the mental problems of adolescents.

AB Background: Little evidence is available on factors associated with persistence and change of psychopathology, and little is known about the predictive value of factors regarding change once problem behaviours exist. This study aims to evaluate change in level of scores of empirically derived problem patterns and to study factors that influence this change for children and adolescents referred to mental health services. Method: A referred sample (N = 1,652), aged 4 to 18 years at initial assessment, was followed up after a mean interval of 6.2 years. We used standardised information from parents, teachers and subjects, including the CBCL, YSR and TRF at both assessments. Results: Subjects at follow-up scored significantly above the expected mean norm scores, although for most scores improvement was found. The strongest predicting factor for time 2 psychopathology was the corresponding time 1 score, odds ratios ranging from 1.6 to 21.7. Males and children older at intake improved more than females and younger children, respectively. Conclusions: Few child, family and treatment-related factors had additional predictive value over and above earlier psychopathology, and their contribution to the prediction of outcome was small. Findings indicate continuity of behavioural and emotional problems in clinically referred children and adolescents, and these problems should be viewed as chronic conditions. Girls referred for behavioural and emotional problems may form a group especially at risk for poor outcome.

AB The spectrum of diabetes in the young has widened; it now includes monogenic diseases, for example the various forms of permanent and transient neonatal diabetes and MODY as well as the emerging obesity-associated Type 2 diabetes in late childhood, but the main form is still Type 1 diabetes. Age-related major medical, physiological, social and emotional problems make the clinical management of diabetes in children and adolescents a difficult task for the physician and the family. Overall glycaemic control remains moderate or poor despite a treatment schedule, which interferes with several elements of "normal" childhood.
   There is an up to tenfold geographical variation in the incidence of childhood Type I diabetes within Europe with relatively stable incidence rates in some countries (mainly northern), but dynamic increases in incidence in other countries (mainly central European).
   A number of nongenetic (environmental) factors have been associated with the risk of Type 1 diabetes. Among these, perinatal factors, early nutrition, growth and vaccinations, atopic diseases and vitamin D are discussed in detail. The important interplay between genes, organism and environment is illustrated with new genetic data supporting the importance of environmental pressures in the evolution of this major disease.
   Although Type 1 diabetes usually accounts for only a minority of the total impact of diabetes in a population, it is the predominant form of the disease in younger age-groups in most developed countries. It is estimated that on an annual basis almost 100 000 children younger than 15 years of age develop Type I diabetes worldwide. The autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells in Type 1 diabetes leads to absolute insulin dependence and a high rate of complications typically occuring at a relatively young age. Therefore, Type 1 diabetes places a particulary heavy burden on the individual, the family and health services.

AB Primary Mental Health Workers (PMHWs) have been deployed to address the mental health needs of young offenders referred to Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) in two UK areas. The mental health characteristics of 60 young people consecutively referred to these PMHWs, the assessment outcome and interventions offered, are described. In addition to the anticipated concerns about oppositional/aggressive behaviour, young people were referred for a range of mental health problems. There were high levels of emotional problems, self-harm, peer and family relationships difficulties, and school non-attendance. PMHWs offered a range of direct interventions, as well as consultation to YOT staff. The service findings indicate the usefulness of such an inter-agency model in strengthening the links between specialist CAMHS and YOTs, and providing an accessible, responsive and effective service to a needy group of young people.

AB Health-related quality of life in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) was compared to that of healthy children. Furthermore, agreement between child and parent reports was examined. In addition, differences in quality of life related to the severity of CHD were evaluated. One hundred children with CHD aged between 8-18 years and their parents answered a health-related quality of life-questionnaire during their visit to the paediatric cardiology outpatient department. CHD children reported reduced motor functioning and autonomy compared to healthy children. Parents of children with CHD reported their children to have a reduced quality of life in the domains of. motor functioning, autonomy and cognitive functioning. Agreement between child and parent reports was moderate. Children systematically reported lower health related quality of life on the domain of positive emotions than did parents. Health related quality of life in children with CHD appeared not to be influenced by severity of the disease. In conclusion, regardless of the severity of the disease, children with CHD reported their health related quality of life on several domains to be lower than that of healthy children. This means that on several domains, the emotional impact of problems in health status is greater for children with CHD than for healthy children. When CHD patients visit the clinic, it is important that physicians actively ask patients as well as parents about the child's motor functioning, autonomy and cognitive functioning. Children with problems in these domains can then be identified, and psychological interventions can take place at an early stage.

ID VICTIMIZATION; LINK
AB This article draws on data from a 1999 survey on youth victimization, crime and delinquency in Alberta conducted by the Canadian Research Institute for Law and the Family in collaboration with researchers from the University of Alberta. The survey included 2,001 youth attending Grades 7 to 12 in public and Catholic schools in selected urban and rural areas in the province. Analyses focus on self-reported past-year delinquency. Statistically significant results were found for relationships between extent of delinquency and gender, grade level, psychosocial problems (as measured by conduct, hyperactivity, and emotional problems), and extent of past-year victimization. For low/moderate delinquency, females were comparable to males, and even reported slightly higher rates for low/moderate violence-related delinquency. Younger students were more likely to indicate engaging in violence-related delinquency, while older students were more likely to report property-related delinquent acts. Overall, Grade 9 students had the highest rates of delinquency. For personal characteristics, a high score on conduct problems was most strongly correlated with moderate/high delinquency. The relationship between high levels of delinquency and victimization was stronger for violence-related delinquency than for property-related delinquency.

AB Our knowledge of longer term outcome in psychogcnic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) patients is limited; we know less still about factors predicting prognosis. This study was intended to describe outcome in a large cohort and to identify predictive clinical and psychological factors to generate new ideas for treatment. One hundred sixty-four adult patients with PNESs (66.7%) responded to outcome, personality, and psychosymptomatology questionnaires (Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire [DAPP-BQ], Dissociative Experiences Scale, and Screening Test for Somatoform Symptoms) a mean of 11.9 years after manifestation and 4.1 years after diagnosis of PNES. Additional clinical data were retrieved from hospital records. The responses showed that 71.2% of patients continued to have seizures and 56.4% we're dependent on social security. Dependence increased with follow-up. Outcome was better in patients with greater educational attainments, younger onset and diagnosis, attacks with less dramatic features, fewer additional somatoform complaints, and lower dissociation scores. Better outcome was associated with lower scores of the higher order personality dimensions "inhibitedness," "emotional dysregulation," and "compulsivity" but not "dissocial behavior" (DAPP-BQ). Outcome in PNESs is poor but variable. Clinical and personality factors can be used to provide an individualized prognosis. By generating a patient-specific profile, they show particular maladaptive traits or tendencies that can identify goals for psychological therapy.

AB A diathesis-stress interaction model is used to describe multifinality in adolescent internalizing and risky behavioral outcomes. Problematic behavior associated with adolescent insecure preoccupation (a diathesis) was expected to interact with the level of maternal autonomous discourse (a stressor) to predict specific adolescent outcomes. Assessments of adolescent preoccupied attachment organization, observations of maternal displays of autonomy in mother-adolescent interactions, and adolescent reports of internalizing symptoms and risky behaviors were obtained at age 16. As predicted, maternal autonomy in the mother-adolescent relationship helped to explain multifinality in dysfunctional symptoms among preoccupied adolescents. Adolescent preoccupation was more strongly linked to internalizing behavior when mothers demonstrated low levels of autonomy in interactions with their adolescents and more strongly linked to risky behavior when mothers displayed extremely high levels of autonomy. Implications for autonomy processes in increasing our understanding of how adolescent insecure-preoccupation relates to profiles of specific problems during adolescence are discussed as is the importance of exploring the role of attachment in different contexts.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; FAMILIES
AB Epilepsy has a significant impact on a child's life, the extent to which is based on four factors: epilepsy, cognition, behavioral, and physical/neurologic function. This study evaluates the ability of the 44-item Impact of Childhood Neurologic Disability Scale (ICND) to assess each of these four realms. Parents of children (aged 2 to 18 years) with epilepsy rated their child's overall quality of life and completed the ICND. External validation compared the ICND with (1) neurologists' reports of children's behavior, cognitive abilities, physical/neurologic disability, and epilepsy; and (2) parents, teachers, and children's ratings on six 'criterion standard' questionnaires. Families of 68 children with epilepsy only and 29 children with 'epilepsy-plus' (additional cognitive, behavioral, or physical/neurologic disability; 39 males, 58 females; mean age at testing 10 years 3 months [SD 4.5] age range 2 to 17 years) participated. Internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach's alpha=0.92) as was test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation=0.89). Caregivers distinguished the impact of each of the four realms. Scores were negatively related to quality of life (Pearson's r=-0.59). Children with high ICND scores had more difficulties at home and school. Their parents saw them as less rewarding and adaptable and the children saw themselves as less intelligent and less popular with more emotional problems. In addition, children with 'epilepsy-plus' had significantly higher total ICND scores as well as markedly elevated scores within each of the four realms when compared with the epilepsy-only group. It is concluded that the ICND is an accurate, quick measurement tool reflecting the impact of behavior, cognitive learning ability, physical/neurologic disability, and epilepsy on children and their families.

AB Background The Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) is a 96-item instrument designed for assessing behavioural and emotional problems among young people with intellectual disability.
   Methods The present study investigated the validity of the DBC as a measure of change. Changes in individual's DBC scores were correlated with changes in expert clinicians' ratings of the same subjects.
   Results A high correlation was found between expert clinician ratings of change in behaviour and change in the total behaviour problem score of the DBC.
   Conclusions The DBC is able to measure changes in behaviour and emotions which are recognized by an experienced clinician who is following the progress of a child with ID.

AB Specific parenting dimensions were explored of parents with adolescents (11-17 years old) referred to outpatient clinics for behavioural and emotional problems. Eighty-seven parent-adolescent pairs participated. Parents completed a parenting interview, and the adolescents were administered a diagnostic interview, the Child Assessment Schedule. Parents of adolescents with behaviour disorders showed impairment in 8/10 parenting dimensions compared to parents of adolescents with emotional disorders or parents of adolescents with no disorder. Parents with behaviour-disordered adolescents had more problems with Appreciation, Involvement, Setting Limits, Consistency, Monitoring Contact, Parenting Priority and Negative Attributions than did other parents. Impaired parenting by the same-gender parent was more related to the adolescent's problems than the opposite-gender parent. Fathers' lack of contact with their sons strongly correlated with their sons' expression of anger.

AB To study the psychosocial factors and illness variables associated with children's and parents' perceptions of and ways of coping with cancer, in 38 childhood cancer patients aged 5-15 years, coping was studied in relation to sociodemographic variables and self-perception in terms of competence, behaviour and self-worth. Less optimal coping was found to be associated with poor family communications and lack of sharing/expression of emotions (P=0.005), presence of behavioural and emotional problems in the child (P=0.008) and parental lack of hope (P=0.001). No association was found with gender, parental education or occupation, socioeconomic status, or child's self-perception including global estimation of self-worth. Furthermore, none of the illness variables was found to be associated with coping. Awareness about health-related issues was found to be strongly associated with parental education (P=0.000). Our findings suggest that parental hope and both social and family communication are integral to helping patients and families cope with the illness experience.

AB This study investigated young adolescents' perceptions of their peers' prosocial behaviours. In eight focus groups, 53 11- to 13-year olds described specific prosocial acts of their peers. Results suggest that traditional research has not addressed the diversity of prosocial behaviours that youth enact, nor emphasized behaviours that are salient to young adolescents. Such behaviours included standing up for others, encouraging others, helping others develop skills, including others who are left out, and being humorous. Facilitating emotional regulation of others emerged as an important component of prosocial behaviour. These data can help guide future research on prosocial development to include a broader array of authentic behaviours of young adolescents.

AB Background: Scale scores in studies of emotional and behavioural. problems often possess highly skewed distributions. The long upper tails of these distributions place a small proportion of the population at some distance from the main body of the distribution. This invites an interpretation of their forming an abnormal group, one that may be qualitatively distinct. Methods: Item-response models were fitted to data on parent and self-rated depression and delinquency from four large samples of children or adolescents. Results: We found that underlying liability distributions show very little or no evidence of non-normality. Conclusions: The results suggest that (i) the skewed nature of the scale scores may be largely measurement artefacts, (ii) the distributions provide no evidence of a qualitatively distinct process generating abnormality as compared to normal variation and (iii) for characterising the whole distribution, including normality and abnormality, the selection of items in typical current assessments of emotional and behavioural problems is not optimal.

AB Information about the relationship of experiencing abuse or witnessing domestic violence in childhood to the risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) in adulthood is scant. The relationship of childhood physical or sexual abuse or growing up with a battered mother to the risk of being a victim of IPV for women or a perpetrator for men was studied among 8,629 participants in the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study conducted in a large HMO. Each of the three violent childhood experiences increased the risk of victimization or perpetration of IPV approximately two-fold. A statistically significant graded relationship was found between the number of violent experiences and the risk of IPV Among persons who had all three forms of violent childhood experiences, the risk of victimization and perpetration was increased 3.5 fold for women and 3.8-fold for men. These data suggest that as part of risk assessment for IPV in adults, screening for a history of childhood abuse or exposure to domestic violence is needed.

AB Little theory and research exists on the developmental processes that occur during adolescents' participation in extracurricular and community based-activities. As a step in that direction, we conducted 10 focus groups aimed at getting high school students' descriptions of their "growth experiences" in these activities. The youth reported both personal and interpersonal processes of development. The personal experiences included experimentation and identity work, development of initiative skills such as learning to set goals and manage time, and learning strategies for emotional regulation. The interpersonal experiences included acquiring new peer relationships and knowledge, developing group social skills such as taking responsibility and how to work together as a team, and developing valuable connections to adults. Across domains, adolescents described themselves as the agents of their own development and change. Youth activities appear to be a context in which adolescents are active producers of development.

AB Despite considerable interest in Rett syndrome, there have been few studies of associated behavioral and emotional problems. In the present study, 143 girls with Rett syndrome were compared on the Developmental Behavior Checklist with 85 girls with severe to profound mental retardation of mixed etiologies. After controlling for the effects of physical disabilities, we found that the girls with Rett syndrome presented more "autistic-relating" and fewer antisocial behaviors. A subsample of children with autism was also compared to the girls with Rett syndrome on autistic-relating behaviors, revealing that the Rett syndrome group did not present with classic autistic behavioral features The implications of these results for the identification of a Rett syndrome behavioral phenotype are discussed.

ID SCHOOL-CHILDREN; QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY; PREVALENCE; ADOLESCENTS
AB Background: Low back pain (LBP) in schoolchildren with no apparent clinical cause is known to be a common problem, but considerably less is understood regarding the aetiology of such pain.
   Aim: To assess the role of both mechanical and psychosocial factors (including emotional and behavioural problems and other somatic pain complaints) in childhood LBP.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out in a population of 1446 schoolchildren aged 11-14 years. Information on these potential risk factors for LBP was sought using a self complete questionnaire and a five day bag weight diary.
   Results: Mechanical factors such as physical activity and school bag weight were not associated with LBP. However, strong associations with LBP were observed for emotional problems, conduct problems, troublesome headaches, abdominal pain, sore throats, and daytime tiredness.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that psychosocial factors rather than mechanical factors are more important in LBP occurring in young populations and could possibly be a reflection of distress in school-children.

AB One significant limitation in research extending the construct of psychopathy to youth has been the absence of longitudinal studies testing the stability of psychopathic traits prior to adulthood. To begin to address this limitation, the current study estimated the stability of psychopathic traits over a 4 year period in a sample of non-referred children in the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh grades at the first assessment. For parent ratings of psychopathic traits, stability estimates using intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.80 to 0.88 across 2-4 years, with a stability estimate of 0.93 across all four assessments. There were also distinct trends in the patterns of stability found in the sample. Specifically, children rated as being initially high on these traits were more likely to be rated lower at later assessments than was the case for children rated initially low on these traits. Finally, the child's level of conduct problems, the socioeconomic status of the child's family, and the quality of parenting the child received were the most consistent predictors of stability of psychopathic traits.

AB The present study examined common childhood fears in 9- to 13-year-old South-African children (N = 404) from white, coloured, and black cultural groups. Fears were assessed by means of two methods - the fear list method and the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R). Results showed that fear rank orders as obtained with the fear list method were quite different from those derived from the FSSC-R. Furthermore, clear differences in fear levels were found among the three cultural groups. More specifically, coloured and black South-African children displayed significantly higher fear levels than white children. Finally, differences were also found as to the content of prevalent fears in the three cultural groups. For example, common fears in coloured and black children were more frequently related to violence than in white children.

AB A diathesis-stress model was proposed in which the joint forces of individual vulnerability (anxious solitude) and interpersonal adversity (peer exclusion) predict depressive symptoms in children over time. Children's (N = 388; 50% female) social behavior, peer exclusion, and emotional adjustment were assessed at kindergarten entry and every spring thereafter through 4th grade, primarily by teacher report. Results indicated that anxious solitude and peer exclusion co-occur in children soon after kindergarten entry and that anxious solitary children who are excluded early on, in comparison with their nonexcluded anxious solitary counterparts, display greater stability in their subsequent display of anxious solitude. As hypothesized, the joint influence of anxious solitude and exclusion predicted the most elevated depressive symptom trajectories.

AB This study sought to identify ways in which adolescent attachment security as assessed via the Adult Attachment Interview, is manifest in qualities of the secure base provided by the mother-adolescent relationship. Assessments included data coded from mother-adolescent interactions, test-based data, and adolescent self-reports obtained from an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of moderately at-risk 9th and 10th graders. This study found several robust markers of adolescent attachment security in the mother-adolescent relationship. Each of these markers was found to contribute unique variance to explaining adolescent security, and in combination, they accounted for as much as 40% of the raw variance in adolescent security. These findings suggest that security is closely connected to the workings of the mother-adolescent relationship via a secure-base phenomenon, in which the teen can explore independence in thought and speech from the secure base of a maternal relationship characterized by maternal attunement to the adolescent and maternal supportiveness.

AB Study objective. To assess the course of chronic benign pain in childhood and adolescence longitudinally.
   Setting. Cohort of children with chronic pain recruited from the open population.
   Patients. A cohort of 987 children and adolescents aged 0-18 years with chronic pain (continuous or recurrent pain > 3 months), who were identified in a previous population-based prevalence study, were approached for a two-year follow-up study. Subjects were asked to keep a 3-week diary on their pain and to fill out questionnaires about background factors, pain and pain-related consequences. This assessment was repeated annually for two years.
   Results. At baseline, 254 subjects reported chronic benign pain; of these, 124 (48%) and 77 (30%) subjects still experienced chronic benign pain at one-year and two-year follow-up, respectively. Except for the estimated pain intensity, which decreased marginally, pain remained stable over the follow-up period. Minor changes occurred in the consequences of pain; the main changes were a decrease of the impact of pain on the child's behavior, social functioning and use of health care. Subjects with persistent pain (9.4%) differed from those with non-persistent pain in frequency, history and location of the pain, emotional problems and their mother's health.
   Conclusions. Chronic benign pain in childhood and adolescence is common, and seems to persist in a considerable proportion (30-45%), although pain generally does not deteriorate over time.

AB In comparison to most other groups with intellectual disability individuals with Down syndrome are at lower risk for significant psychopathology, although relative to their typically developing peers they have higher rates of behavioural and emotional problems. A total of 43 Down syndrome patients (21 females and 22 males), who ranged in age from 5.33 to 30.58 years, were examined for the presence of age-related changes in the spectrum of externalizing and internalizing problems. Intelligence tests included Hamburg-Wechsler-Intelligenz Test fur Kinder III (HAWIK-III), Hamburg-Wechsler-Intelligenz Test ffir Erwachsene (HAWIE-R) and Kaufman-Assessment-Battery for Children, German Version (K-ABC). Behavioural and emotional problems were assessed by the the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for Parents, German Version (SDQ) and the Clinical Assessment Scale for Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CASCAP). IQ was significantly inversly related to the age of patients. Externalizing behaviours (dominant, opposing/refusing, impulsiveness, inattention and increased motor activity) were significantly higher in the 5-10 years old group, whereas internalizing behaviours (shy/insecure, low selfconfidence, decreased motor activity) where more prevalent in adolescents and adults (10-30 years). Possible relationships between this age-related changes and increased risks of later-onset psychopathology (depression and dementia) are discussed.

AB A prominent feature of depression is the disorder of mood and emotion regulation. However, emotion regulation is frequently neglected in the conceptionalizing of depression and its treatment. In this article emotion regulation in the development of depression is discussed, focusing especially on thought suppression as one possible intent of emotion regulation. The intentional suppression of thoughts that are feared to worsen mood leads to an increase in the occurrence of these thoughts and a loss of mental control. Beside this, there are several other cognitive and emotional effects of thought suppression that may play an important role in the development of depression. The implications of these findings arc discussed and Pennebaker's expressive writing is presented as a tool to enhance emotion regulation in prevention programs of depression like JES! (a youth prevention program with expressive writing).

AB Social and emotional competence were evaluated using self-report and behavioral measures in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls. Adults with ADHD viewed themselves as less socially competent but more sensitive toward violations of social norms than controls. Films depicting emotional interactions were used to assess linguistic properties of free recall and perceived emotional intensity. Although adults with ADHD used more words to describe the scenes, they used fewer emotion-related words, despite rating the emotions depicted as more intense than did controls. In contrast, no group differences for words depicting social or cognitive processes were observed. Overall, adults with ADHD appear more aware of their problems in social versus emotional skills. Findings may have implications for improving the psychosocial functioning of these adults.

AB Objective. This study explores relations between mild parental symptoms of anxiety and depression and the temperament and behavior patterns in preschool age children. Design. Parental report and laboratory observations were collected in a community sample (N = 65) of Head Start and other preschool attendees, ages 3-5 years. Results. Mild parental dysphoria is associated with measures of both child temperament and problem behaviors and these child personality measures vary with parental symptomatology. Mild parental depression was diffusely associated with increased levels of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and with attention and emotion regulatory difficulties in children's temperament. Mild parental anxiety was more circumscribed in its association with child problem behavior but was specifically related to children's temperamental difficulties in attention and emotion regulation. Patterns differentiating association with depression and anxiety symptoms were evident from both parental and observer sources of information. Conclusions. Even mild levels of parental distress may relate to both parental perceptions of child temperament and behavior as well as what is observed by others.

AB Impulsivity, closely related to the construct of response (dis)inhibition, is central to conceptions of both attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD) and aggressive-spectrum or disruptive behavior disorders. The multifaceted nature of inhibitory deficits requires careful specification in any explanatory accounts of psychopathology. A host of brain regions and neural interconnections are involved in response inhibition; neural models are likely to be complex at the levels of neurotransmitter systems and white-matter tracts. Despite the substantial heritability of ADHD and the substantial continuity of early-onset forms of aggression, developmental processes (including gene-environment correlations and interactions) and transactional models are crucial to the unfolding of regulated versus dysregulated behavioral outcomes. Thus, stressful prenatal and childhood environments must be investigated with as much precision as genetic loci and neural pathways. Differentiating executive inhibition (believed to be largely dopaminergic and frontal/frontal-striatal in nature) from motivational inhibition (believed to be largely noradrenergic/ serotonergic and limbic in nature) is necessary to distinguish subtypes of youth with attentional and aggressive problems, and to differentiate key etiologic processes. Indeed, the executive function deficits in children with ADHD appear to independent of their emotion dysregulation, which is specific to an aggressive subgroup. Sex differences in response inhibition and sex differences in its linkages to psychopathology are relatively unexplored. For progress in subsequent research to occur, the following are required: precision in measurement at both biological and behavioral levels; contrasts with clinical comparison samples and comorbid groups (as well as normal control samples); prospective longitudinal investigations; and attention to both developmental processes and contextual variables, including stressful life events, socialization practices, and cultural parameters.

AB Objective. The aim of this paper is to describe drug and associated factors use among adolescents ( 12 to 17 years of age). Material and Methods. Data come from the recent Encuesra Nacional de Adicciones, 1998 (National Survey on Addictions) undertaken in urban areas of Mexico, A probabilistic, multi-stage, stratified cluster sampling design was used to select the study population. The sampling unit was the individual in each household, Statistical analysis consisted of the estimation of prevalences of drug use, with 95% confidence intervals, Associations were analyzed using logistic regressions models. Results. Excluding tobacco and alcohol, 3.57% of males and 0.6% of females have used one or more drugs; 2.14% and 0.45% used them in the 12 months previous to the survey, and 1.4% and 0.3% in the previous 30 days, respectively. Marihuana was the drug more often used by males (2.4%) and females (0.45%), followed by inhaled solvents (1.08% and 0.20%), and cocaine (0.99% and 0.22%), respectively. The risk of using illicit drugs was associated to being male, having dropped out from school, perceiving availability, drug use by family and friends, social tolerance among friends, and symptoms of depression. Conclusions. Adolescents between 12 to 17 years of age are exposed to increasing drug use, The rates of drug use have risen, especially in the northern region of Mexico and in the big urban areas (Tijuana, Mexico City and GuadalaJara). These findings emphasize the need to develop campaigns to detect emotional problems. Preventive measures should provide appropriate care to prevent drug use as a mechanism to cope with such emotional conflicts. Also, more intense preventive interventions should be targeted to adolescents with a high probability of developing drug abuse.

AB Background: There, is some evidence that a disregulation of emotional development may be part of the etiology of anxiety disorders. Objective: The aim of our study, was to investigate aspects of emotional competence in socially anxious children and their mothers. Methods: Fifty socially anxious and 25 socially non-anxious children and their mothers participated in a series' of three experimental tasks. The first task was a: facial expression posing task. In the second task the spontaneous facial expression was investigated in,a frustrating achievement situation and during a funny movie. In the third task the children themselves had to classify facial expressions of emotions. Results: The socially anxious children differed qualitatively from controls in their deliberate facial expression of emotions. Furthermore, for the socially anxious children it seems to be more difficult to show spontaneously positive emotions like happiness than, negative emotions like anger. In classifying facial expressions of emotions the socially anxious children reported significantly more often that they saw emotions when neutral faces were presented. Moreover, reaction times were longer. Conclusions: The results show socially anxious children's deficits in emotional, competence. If the results could, be could be confirmed they should have consequences for therapy of socially anxious children.

AB In this article, the author sought to use a high-risk study design focused on the children of parents with opioid or alcohol use disorders and children of parents with no substance use disorder (SUD) to evaluate the specificity of the risk conferred by the hype of parental SUD. Using structured psychiatric interviews, cognitive assessments, and measures of social, academic, and family functioning, the authors studied 96 families ( 187 parents and 183 children, mean age of 11.6 years). Sixteen families had parental opioid dependence (22 children, 64% male), 14 families had parental alcohol dependence (22 children; 59% male), and 66 families had no SUD (controls; 139 children; 58% male). Fifty-nine percent of children of opioid-dependent parents had at least one major psychopathological condition, compared to 41% of the alcohol group and 28% of the control group (p < 0.01). The children of opioid- and alcohol-dependent parents were of lower socioeconomic status and had significantly more difficulties in academic, social, and family functioning than did controls. Children of opioid- and alcohol-dependent parents have significantly, higher rates of psychopathology as well as more difficulties in academic, social, and family functioning compared to the children of non-SUD parents. In addition, notable trends emerged for the opioid group to have more psychopathology and functional impairment than the alcohol group. With a growing consensus that certain risk factors for later SUD start in childhood with potentially treatable childhood-onset disorders, new preventive approaches for individuals at risk may be developed targeting childhood precursors of SUD.

AB Aims: To evaluate behavioural outcome and quality of life in children aged 8-14 years after neonatal arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries.
   Methods: Sixty children operated as neonates with combined deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and low flow cardiopulmonary bypass were evaluated at age 7.9-14.3 years by the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Inventory for the Assessment of the Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (IQCL).
   Results: Parent reported behavioural outcome on all CBCL problem and competence scores was worse, whereas quality of life on self reported IQCL scores was not reduced compared to the normal population. On multivariate analysis, severe preoperative hypoxia was related to parent reported social problems; peri- and postoperative cardiocirculatory insufficiency was associated with internalising, externalising, attention, and total behavioural problems. Reduced expressive language was associated with total behavioural problems, and poor academic achievement was related to parent reported deficits in school performance. Impaired neurological status and reduced endurance capacity both predicted self reported stress by illness.
   Conclusions: The neonatal arterial switch operation with combined circulatory arrest and low flow bypass is associated with parent reported long term behavioural impairment, but not with self reported general reduction in quality of life. This discrepancy may be a result of different perception of illness. In our experience, increased risk of long term psychosocial maladjustment after neonatal corrective cardiac surgery is related to the presence of neurological impairment and reduced endurance capacity.

AB Suicide rates for adolescents have doubled since 1970 and tripled since 1960, even as rates for other age groups have declined. Using a Becker-type model of household production and consumption, we demonstrate conditions under which utility maximizing parents allocate time away from time-intensive commodities like children's well-being, and towards market work and less time-intensive consumption commodities. This reallocation of time towards market work has mixed effects on children' mental health: higher money income tends to improve family and children's wellbeing, but the loss of parental time has an opposite effect on children's mental health and increases the risk of adolescent suicide. Empirical evidence using state panel regressions of adolescent suicide rates on economic, social and demographic variables is consistent with predictions based on our model; our results indicate that the favorable effect of higher incomes has more than offset the negative effect of lost parental time.

AB There are several converging reasons to focus on sleep regulation in relation to healthy adolescent development: (a) Sleep appears to be particularly important during periods of brain maturation; (b) there are substantial biological and psychosocial changes in sleep and circadian regulation exist across pubertal development; (c) interactions between physical and psychosocial domains can lead to dramatic alterations in sleep patterns and habits during adolescence; (d) increasing evidence that many adolescents frequently obtain insufficient sleep exists; (e) there is mounting evidence that sleep deprivation has its greatest negative effects on the control of behavior, emotion, and attention, a regulatory interface that is critical in the development of social and academic competence, and psychiatric disorders; (f) the most obvious direct health consequences of insufficient sleep are high-risk behaviors associated with substance abuse and automobile accidents; (g) substantial evidence for bidirectional effects between sleep and behavioral/emotional regulation exists. Although the past decade has seen research progress in these areas, there continue to be major gaps in existing knowledge and a paucity of well-controlled studies to guide specific health policy decisions and recommendations regarding sleep in adolescence. In particular, there is need for improved understanding of the acute and chronic effects of inadequate sleep in adolescents, guidelines for defining adequate sleep in adolescents, and a better delineation of the links among sleep, behavior, and affect regulation. Finally, this paper briefly examines one specific application of this knowledge area regarding early starting times among some high schools Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2002.

AB Examined reliability and validity of the parent version of the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI-4) in 247 boys between 6.0 and 10 years 11 months old referred for evaluation of behavioral and emotional problems. The CSI-4 is a behavior rating scale whose items correspond to the symptoms of disorders defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. (DSM-IV); American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Results indicated satisfactory internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and temporal stability over a 4-year period for most symptom categories. CSI-4 ratings converged and diverged in a theoretically consistent pattern with respective scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991a) and the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised-Parent Version (DICA-P; Reich, Shayka, & Taibleson, 1991). Discriminant validity was established in that boys with specific DICA-P diagnoses received significantly higher corresponding CSI-4 parent symptom ratings than boys not so diagnosed. Clinical utility (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive power, negative predictive power) was evaluated for screening cutoffs based on categorical (DSM-IV) and dimensional (normative distribution of Symptom Severity scores) scoring methods.

Reports by all informants concurred in showing small improvements in competencies and adaptive functioning and small declines in problems from 1989 to 1999. Correlations of 98 to 99 between mean problem item scores in 1989 and 1999 indicated very high stability for assessment via self-reports, parent reports, and teacher reports over 10 years. Cross-informant correlations were (a) YSR x CBCL = .38, (b) CBCL x TRF = .36, and (c) TRF x YSR = .20. No scales showed significant differences between scores obtained from any type of informant for youths assessed shortly before and after the Columbine High School shootings.

AB This study examined the role of pubertal development on depression, externalizing behavior problems, self-esteem, and body-image of 951 Mexican early adolescents. The 5th through 7th grade students were assessed at the beginning and end of the school year. The main finding of this study is that the acute experience of menarche adversely affected Mexican adolescent girls psychological well-being, most specifically in terms of depressive symptomatology. On the other hand, pubertal change in Mexican boys, as measured by voice-change, did not appear to adversely affect psychological well-being above and beyond a nonsignificant minimal and temporal readjustment and in fact had a positive effect on body-image. Results suggest that perceived maternal control, prior social-emotional adjustment, and menstrual attitudes may moderate the effects of pubertal change.

AB Research in other parts of the world suggests that adolescents invoke a multiplicity of causes to explain juvenile offending. The extent to which the different explanations are endorsed appears partly to be a function of cultural and demographic characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate South African adolescents' explanations for delinquency and to examine cultural differences in these explanations. A total of 554 secondary school pupils from two Eastern Cape high schools rated 39 explanations for juvenile offending on a Likert scale. Principal component analysis and a varimax rotation of the responses identified seven factors - Home Environment, Antisocial Tendency, Influencability, Social Control, Emotional Adjustment, Deprivation and Social Alienation. The results showed that there were large differences between the Black and White learners in terms of the perceived importance of a number of the explanatory causes.

AB This research addresses a new construct, co-rumination. Co-rumination refers to extensively discussing and revisiting problems, speculating about problems, and focusing on negative feelings. Friendship research indicates that self-disclosure leads to close relationships; however, coping research indicates that dwelling on negative topics leads to emotional difficulties. Co-rumination is a single construct that integrates both perspectives and is proposed to be related both to positive friendship adjustment and problematic emotional adjustment. Third-, fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-grade participants (N = 608) responded to questionnaires, including a new measure of co-rumination. Co-rumination was related to high-quality close friendships and aspects of depression and anxiety. Girls reported co-ruminating more than did boys, which helped to account for girls' more positive friendship adjustment and greater internalizing symptoms. Other analyses addressed whether co-rumination and the related constructs of self-disclosure and rumination had different relations with friendship and emotional adjustment.

AB Some authors argue that both substance dependence and eating disorders should be considered as dependent behaviours. Similarities and differences between these disorders, however, remain unclear. This study compares processes of emotion regulation in adolescents and young adults (15 to 25 years old) with substance dependence (SD) or eating disorders (ED). One hundred and thirteen SD, 50 ED and 86 non-clinical subjects (NC), recruited in four French and Swiss locations, completed a self-report questionnaire of emotion regulation strategies. This questionnaire addresses the subjects' relationships, concerning past and present family, and refers to Main's (1990) concept of primary strategy (balanced activation and deactivation of attachment behaviours), and of secondary strategies (hyperactivation or excessive deactivation of the attachment system). Participants were also questioned in structured interviews, about life events and DSM-IV classification criteria. SD reported more adverse events than ED and NC. SD and ED reported using fewer primary strategies than NC, and SD had secondary strategies that were different from those of ED. Patients with eating disorders reported more hyperactivation, and SD reported more deactivation of the attachment system. It is hypothesized that while subjects with SD and ED have in common poorly regulated strategies, they differ in the way they process emotion or relationship-related information.

AB Six waves of structured diagnostic assessments were conducted of 168 clinic-referred 7- to 12-year-olds, over 7 years. Wave-to-wave changes in the number of conduct disorder (CD) behaviors were paralleled by correlated changes in the numbers of symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. In addition, CD in Wave 1 predicted levels of ODD, ADHD, depression, and anxiety in later waves when initial levels of those symptoms were controlled, but only ODD in Wave 1 predicted CD in later waves when initial CD levels were controlled: These findings indicate a striking degree of dynamic comorbidity between CD and other types of psychopathology and provide an initial empirical framework for needed developmental models of comorbidity.

AB Background and method: The behaviour of 30 depressed 3- to 6-year-olds was observed in three play situations (solitary free play, interactive free play, and play narratives) and compared to the behaviour of 30 nondepressed clinical and 30 nondepressed nonclinical peers. Results: Depressed children showed significantly less play, particularly less symbolic play, than nondepressed children. Instead, they exhibited more nonplay bchaviours, such as exploration and undirected behaviours, than the control children. Moreover, the behaviour of the depressed children was less coherent than that of the nondepressed children, as evident from a greater number of shifts from one type of behaviour to another. Conclusions: Differences between depressed and nondepressed children were most prominent during the play narratives and were particularly striking when a sad mood was presented.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems based on parents information from the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were investigated in a large epidemiological sample of 4363 six year old preschool children from the area of Heidelberg and Rhein-Neckar county. An overview about symptom frequencies of boys and girls is given, taking age specific evaluations into account. Considdering symptoms and syndromes, externalizing and attention problems show high prevalence, especially for boys. Family problems are the most important predictors of child global symptomatology, explaining about 10% of variance of the CBCL total score. Other factors like gender, chronical illness, adverse living conditions, family constellation or amount of TV consumption prove as additional independent predictors. An overall model explains about 20% of variance of child symptomatology. Results are discussed from the view of normal child development, developmental psychopathology, changing norms and altered socio-cultural conditions.

ID DEVELOPMENTAL COORDINATION DISORDER; MOTOR
AB Parents and physicians often dismiss seemingly minor motor difficulties in children. Approximately 6 percent of school-aged children have coordination problems serious enough to interfere with academic performance and social integration. These problems often arise during the early school years and manifest in difficulties with such simple motor tasks As running, buttoning, or using scissors. Increasing evidence shows that rather than improving over time, these motor difficulties remain stable throughout adolescence and adulthood. While these children are initially singled out for motor difficulties, their problems are rarely limited to poor motor coordination. Many of them have a range of associated deficits, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, poor handwriting and drawing skills, and emotional immaturity. Associated problems magnify with time, and as teenagers, these children have higher rates of educational, social, and emotional problems. Diagnosis is determined by taking a careful history that includes a review of fine motor, visual, adaptive, and gross motor milestones, and performing a physical examination. Formal, standardized testing may be indicated. Referral to occupational therapy that is appropriately individualized to the needs of each child appears to be effective. To aid in management, the family physician must be aware of this condition, as well as the associated coexisting deficits. Copyright (C) 2002 American Academy of Family Physicians.

AB The reduction of coercive or inadequate parenting is essential if the mental health status of Australian children and adolescents is to be improved.
   Of the available approaches that address parenting practices, behavioural family interventions have the strongest empirical support and are effective in reducing parenting practices that contribute to the development of behavioural and emotional problems in children. However, only a small proportion of parents access such interventions.
   A comprehensive multilevel, evidence-based parenting and family support strategy needs to be implemented on a wide scale to reduce the prevalence of mental health problems in children and youth.
   The Triple P - Positive Parenting Program is an example of a population-level strategy that can be used to improve the mental health status of children and their parents.

AB Studies on nonepileptic seizures (NES) provide dichotomous data sets: extensive observational findings, but a paucity of controlled treatment data. Psychosocial stressors, whose full impact may lie outside a patient's awareness, often underlie NES. These stressors, along with patient's learned patterns of coping, may bring forth or potentiate comorbid psychiatric disorders. Patients with NES often have dysfunction in emotion regulation and family dynamics, as well as unemployment/disability. High percentages of comorbid disorders such as major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and cluster B personality with impulsivity (all disorders associated with scrotonin system function) also exist in the NES population. The preliminary observational evidence suggests that specific psychotherapies and pharmacotherapy directed at comorbid conditions may be the most effective treatment for NES.

AB Objective: To assess the prevalence and demographic and psychological correlates of Internet use as a help-seeking resource for emotional problems in a community sample of adolescents. Method: A self-report survey was completed by 9th- through 12th-grade students (n = 519) enrolled in health courses in six New York State high schools in the fall/winter of 1999. The relationship between Internet help-seeking behavior and demographic characteristics, hopelessness, functional impairment, and use of various treatment services was examined. Results: Nearly one fifth (18.2%) of the adolescents sought help on the Internet for emotional problems in the previous year. The proportions of males and females seeking help on the Internet did not significantly differ (15.6% and 20.8%, respectively). Internet help-seekers were significantly more likely than non-help-seekers to score above the clinical threshold on the Columbia Impairment Scale (34% versus 20.6%; chi(1)(2) = 7.4, p < .01) or Beck Depression Inventory (16.1% versus 9.1%; chi(1)(2) = 3.8, p < .05). These at-risk youths tended to combine Internet help-seeking with other sources of help, rather than substituting it for other resources. More than 20% of Internet help-seekers were dissatisfied with the help they received, and only 14% thought it had helped them very much. Conclusions: For the Internet to realize its potential as an effective resource for teenagers struggling with emotional problems, further development is needed.

ID PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE; IDENTIFICATION; PREVALENCE; DISORDERS
AB Context The 1999 surgeon general's report on mental health concluded that insufficient attention to mental health disorders is being paid in children's primary medical care services. This lack of attention has occurred despite considerable attention to this issue in the planning documents of many federal agencies.
   Objective To assess the extent to which federal agencies' portfolios of funded research grants were consistent with the directives for primary care-based mental health services for children and adolescents featured in their planning documents.
   Data Source A cross-sectional review of the 66749 abstracts listed in the April 2001 Computer Retrieval of information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) database of currently funded research grants supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Abstracts were rated by whether they targeted primary care, examined behavioral or emotional issues, and examined or modified a facet of primary care.
   Data Synthesis Of the 45022 research abstracts in the CRISP database, 2720 (6%) contained the words children, adolescents, or youth. Sixty-three abstracts contained work on children, adolescents, or youth in primary care (0.14% of the portfolio). Of these 63 abstracts, only 21 (0.05% of the portfolio) addressed behavioral or emotional issues. Of the 21 projects, only 11 examined aspects of the primary care process. When the distribution of child and adult studies on the treatment of depression within primary care settings was examined, it was found that adults received 15 times the research attention compared with children.
   Conclusion Even though the importance of primary care as a system for identifying and treating behavioral and emotional problems in children has been recognized for more than 20 years, little attention is being paid to this topic in the research portfolios of the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies that support research.

AB Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, the current study examines behavioural and emotional problems of immigrant children, in comparison with non-immigrant children. Multi-level analyses (children nested within cities) showed that immigrant children fared better in behaviours and emotions than non-immigrant children. Gender was the most important child-level variable responsible for behavioural and emotional problems of immigrant children. City characteristics had much stronger effects with population characteristics, socio-economic conditions, social climate, and social services conditions being responsible for behavioural and emotional problems of immigrant children. In contrast, child characteristics were more important than city characteristics for non-immigrant children. Social equity was a critical issue for non-immigrant children, whereas social environment was important for immigrant children.

AB This research investigated an integrative model of race- and gender-related influences on adjustment during early adolescence using a sample of 350 Black and White youth. In the proposed model, prejudice / discrimination events, as well as race and gender daily hassles, contribute to a general stress context. The stress context, in turn, influences levels of emotional and behavioral problems in adjustment, with these associations mediated (in part) by intervening effects on self-esteem. Racial and gender identity similarly have positive effects on adjustment via their intermediary linkages with self-esteem. Structural equation modeling analyses provided support for all of these aspects of the model. Findings also revealed theoretically predicted differences in model parameters across race by gender subgroups. These include a direct effect of prejudice / discrimination events on emotional problems specific to Black youth and an effect of gender identity on self-esteem specific to girls. Black girls appeared to be most vulnerable to exhibiting significant adjustment difficulties as a result of the processes under investigation.

AB This paper addresses the role of family-based studies of preventive and therapeutic interventions in our understanding of normal development and psychopathology. The emphasis is on interventions designed to improve parent-child and/or marital relationships as a way of facilitating development and reducing psychopathology in children and adolescents. Intervention designs provide the gold standard for testing causal hypotheses. We begin by discussing the complexity of validating these hypotheses and the implications of the shift from it traditional emphasis on theories of etiology to developmental psychopathology's newer paradigm describing risks --> pathways --> outcomes. We summarize correlational studies that document the fact that difficult and ineffective parent-child and marital relationships function as risk factors for children's cognitive, social, and emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. We then review prevention studies and therapy evaluation studies that establish some specific parenting and marital variables as causal risk factors with respect to these Outcomes. Our discussion focuses on what intervention studies have revealed so far and suggests an agenda for further research.

AB This study focuses on the relationship between the use of specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies and emotional problems. Two samples were included: 99 adults from a clinical population and 99 matched non-clinical adults. Data was obtained in both groups on the use of nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies: self-blame, other-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, putting into perspective, positive refocusing, positive reappraisal, acceptance, and refocus on planning.
   Logistic regression analyses show that self-blame, catastrophizing, and positive reappraisal were, relative to the other strategies, the most important variables for distinguishing between the two samples. While the first two strategies were reported significantly more often by the clinical than by the non-clinical sample, positive reappraisal was reported significantly more often by the non-clinical sample. The results suggest that cognitive emotion regulation strategies may be a useful target for prevention and intervention. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: One hundred and twenty-two children identified by teachers as at risk for behavioural or emotional problems were randomly allocated to drama-group therapy or to a curriculum-studies control, based in school. Methods: One hundred and seventeen completed the intervention phase of the trial, which comprised 12 hour-long sessions. Post-intervention self-reports showed significant effects associated with both interventions. Results: However, there was a clear advantage of group therapy over both a waiting list control and curriculum studies, according to teacher reports. This was true also of categorical analyses focusing on those with the most severe symptoms. Conclusions: These analyses confirmed sustained teacher-reported improvement over a year-long follow-up period.

AB Objective: Conventional wisdom among pediatricians has been that children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who receive their diagnosis and are managed in the primary care setting have fewer comorbid psychiatric disorders and milder impairments than those seen in psychiatric clinics. The authors sought to determine whether comorbidity and clinical correlates of ADHD differ among children in these two settings. Methods: A case-control study design was used. Participants were 522 children and adolescents of both sexes, six to 18 years of age, with (N=280) and without (N=242) ADHD. Participants were drawn from pediatric and psychiatric clinics in a tertiary care hospital and a health maintenance organization in a large metropolitan area. Assessments were conducted with standardized measures of psychiatric, cognitive, social, academic, and family function. Results: The number, type, clusters, and a e at onset of ADHD symptoms were nearly identical for youths at pediatric and psychiatric ascertainment sources. Regardless of source, participants with ADHD were significantly more likely than controls to have a higher prevalence of mood disorders, other disruptive behavior, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. Significant impairments of intellectual, academic, interpersonal, and family functioning did not differ between ascertainment sources. Conclusions: Children with ADHD from both psychiatric and pediatric practices have prototypical symptoms of the disorder; high levels of comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders; and impairments in cognitive, interpersonal, and academic function that do not differ by ascertainment source. These findings suggest that children cared for in pediatric practice have similar levels of comorbidity and dysfunction as psychiatrically referred youth.

AB This study examined the associations among sleep duration, insomnia, and behavioral problems in a sample of 1359 Chinese adolescents. Participants completed a self-administrated questionnaire that included questions on sleep duration and insomnia symptoms and the Youth Self-Report of Child Behavior Checklist. It was found that adolescents who complained of insomnia reported sleep duration only half an hour shorter than did those without insomnia. Sleep duration did not differ among adolescents reporting three different types of insomnia (difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening). Adolescents with insomnia reported more behavioral problems than did those without complaints of insomnia. After adjustment for age and sex, sleep duration of less than 7 It a day was significantly associated with most behavioral problems in those without complaints of insomnia but with only a few behavioral problems in adolescents reporting insomnia. Results suggest that sleep duration in adolescents with insomnia is short, but not as short as reported in previous clinical studies. Insomnia and short sleep duration are associated with a wide range of behavioral and emotional problems in adolescents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This 7-year follow-up study examined the behavioral and emotional adjustment of 29 adolescents who experienced regular moderate seizures during middle childhood. Compared with national nonreferred norms on Achenbach checklists. both mothers and adolescents reported clinically significant difficulties in multiple areas regardless of current seizure status. Adolescents who currently experience regular seizures (N = 10) reported no differences on psychological outcomes compared with nonseizing counterparts; in contrast, current seizure status was a strong predictor of mother-reported externalizing problems. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that feelings about having or having had a seizure disorder and mother-adolescent relationship factors were significant predictors of current adjustment over and above current seizure status. Early mother-child relationship process variables and early medical risk were not associated with current adolescent outcomes. The findings are discussed in terms of the multidetermined nature of psychological adjustment to chronic medical illness and factors that may produce versus maintain behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents with seizure disorders.

AB The aim of this study was to identify groups of children at increased risk of behavioural or emotional problems on the basis of socio-demographic characteristics, family characteristics, and recent life events with a focus on unemployment and divorce or separation. We obtained data on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) from a community-based national sample of 4480 parents of school-aged children and interviewed them about their demographic and family characteristics and about the child's recent life events. Results showed that family characteristics and recent life events were more strongly associated with children's risks of behavioural and emotional problems as measured by the CBCL than other demographic characteristics. Risks were somewhat higher for children who had experienced parental unemployment and divorce or separation recently, as compared to those who had experienced these events in the more distant past. We conclude that children with recent experience of parental unemployment or parental divorce or separation are at a relatively high risk of behavioural and emotional problems as reported by parents. Although relatively high, the risks that were found do not justify restriction of screening for behavioural and emotional problems to these children.

AB This study examined the relationship of perceived parenting practices to anger and coping in a sample of 70 African-American adolescents. Regression analyses reveled that perceptions of parental strictness were negatively related to anger temperament, anger-out, and avoidance (all p<0.05), and was positively associated with engaging in demanding activities (p<0.02). Additionally, perceptions of parental involvement were positively related to seeking diversions (P<0.04), and perceptions of parental autonomy granting were negatively related to anger-out (p<0.02). These findings highlight the potential importance of the perceived parent-adolescent relationship for African-American adolescents.

   METAANALYSIS; DISTURBANCES
AB Objective: The objective of the study was to examine specificity, order of appearance, and developmental changes in the relationships between sleep problems and behavioral problems in children. Method: Four hundred ninety children were selected from a large-scale longitudinal study of children growing up in adoptive and nonadoptive (biological) families in Colorado. Parental ratings of children's sleep and behavioral problems on the Child Behavior Checklist were obtained from ages 4 to 15 years. Results: Sleep problems decreased from age 4 years to mid-adolescence, but there was modest stability of individual differences across this age range (r = 0.29). Regression analyses indicated that sleep problems at age 4 predicted behavioral/emotional problems in mid-adolescence after accounting for child sex, adoptive status, and stability of behavioral/emotional problems. Finally, the correlation between sleep problems and depression/anxiety increased significantly during this age period from r = 0.39 at age 4 years to r = 0.52 at mid-adolescence. Conclusions: Early sleep problems may forecast behavioral/emotional problems, and there may be important developmental change in the overlap between sleep problems and behavioral/emotional problems.

AB As a common component of mood disorders, aggression can have many adverse effects on the child's or adolescent's life, including disrupting school performance and causing personal rejection by family, peers, and teachers. The problems of children and adolescents with mood disorders are compounded by comorbid aggressiveness. Without effective treatment for both problems, many of these aggressive, depressed children and adolescents go on to experience multiple failures in life leading to disturbances in character and the inability to establish fulfilling interpersonal relationships. This article is intended to heighten clinician awareness of the complex relationship between mood disorders and aggression.

DE homosexual; same-sex partners; risk behavior; add health
ID SCHOOL; BEHAVIOR; ORIENTATION; VIOLENCE; SAMPLE; HEALTH
AB Purpose: To compare the risk status on health and behavior for those with same-sex partners and those without.
   Methods: Add Health data provide a sample of 20,745 adolescents in grades 7 through 12 interviewed at home. The risk statuses of respondents with no partners, same-sex-only partners, and partners of both sexes were compared to respondents with opposite-sex partners only. Respondents were evaluated on selected personal and social attributes (verbal IQ, family structure, masculinity, popularity), and risk status (substance use, depression, suicidal thoughts, anal sex, general delinquency, being physically attacked, perceived risk of being killed or getting AIDS). Data were analyzed by logistic and linear regression using STATA to adjust for clustering and sampling weights.
   Results: Compared to boys with opposite-sex-only partners, boys with same-sex-only partners were at high risk for emotional problems, but not delinquency or substance use. Boys with partners of both sexes were at high risk for delinquency and substance use, but not for emotional problems. Neither group of boys with same-sex partners is at high risk of being attacked compared to those with opposite-sex partners only. Girls with only same-sex partners are never a high-risk group, while girls with partners of both sexes are the high-risk category in every case.
   Conclusions: Adolescents with same-sex-only partners do not resemble those with partners of both sexes in risk status. Combining the two categories obscures the unique risk profile of those with both-sex partners, and obscures the low risk on most variables but the high emotional risk of boys with only same-sex partners.

AB Background: The objective of this prospective study was to assess the changes of personality traits in children suffering from solid tumors. Patients and methods: For evaluation we used a self-rating personality questionnaire for children between 9 and 14 years. 39 children with solid tumor compared to 67 healthy children of the general community were examined. For the assessment of children we choose three points in time: 1. Immediately after diagnosis, 2. at the end of therapy and 3. one to three years after. Results: Initially, the children had significantly more behavioral and emotional problems than children of the community. At the end of therapy the patients showed unambiguous changes in personality traits. In the patients population we noticed to have a higher tendency to behave aggressively and egocentric. Patients tended to isolate themselves socially compared to healthy children in the community. No significant differences between children suffering from cancer and the control group were found one to three years after finishing the therapy. Conclusion: The distress of cancer patients during therapy seems to influence the personality development. In the longer term, the prevalence of psychological problems experienced by children treated for cancer does not differ from that found in children of the general community.

AB Study Design. A study on the quality of life of 82 patients with idiopathic scoliosis treated with Harrington instrumentation.
   Objective. To analyze long-term health-related quality of life and low back pain an average of 16.7 years after surgery.
   Summary and Background Data. Quality of life evaluated by self-assessment questionnaires is an accepted outcome measure of surgical procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the health status with the German version of internationally accepted and psychometrically tested questionnaires.
   Methods. Quality of life was measured with the Short Form-36 health profile. Low back pain was assessed using the Roland-Morris Questionnaire. Demographic data (age, sex, follow-up time), radiographic analysis (Kings classification, Cobb angle, extension and site of fusion), and rib cage deformity were correlated with these data. Radiologic parameters were analyzed longitudinally.
   Results. In comparison with the age-matched healthy population, there was no significant difference in the physical Short Form-36 scale (P = 0.98). Surgically treated patients showed significantly lower scores than at baseline in the psychologic Short Form-36 scale (P = 0.005); vitality (P < 0.001), general mental health (P = 0.003), and role activities because of emotional problems (P < 0.001) were significantly different from those of the age-matched population. Sixty-five (79.3%) of the 82 patients reported no or occasional back pain in the Roland-Morris Questionnaire. Five patients (6.1%) reported chronic back pain. Neither patient age at the time of surgery (P = 0.74) nor time of follow-up (P = 0.44), type of scoliosis (P = 0.56), or extent of fusion (P = 0.12) was associated with health-related quality of life or pain. The size of the preoperative (P = 0.06) and postoperative (P = 0.12) curves and preoperative (P = 0.28) and postoperative (P = 0.7) rib cage deformities did not correlate with the data of the Short Form-36 scale and the Roland-Morris Questionnaire.
   Conclusions. In comparison with the age-matched population, the long-term effect of surgery does not affect the physical quality of life. The psychologic health status is, however, significantly impaired. Neither the type of curve, the size of scoliosis, nor the rib cage deformity influences the data.

   PUBLIC-POLICY; ATTACHMENT; PRESCHOOLERS; RISK
AB Objective: This article highlights the manner in which child neglect, the most common form of maltreatment, affects children's development.
   Method: The review is organized according to three developmental periods (i.e., infancy/preschool, school-aged and younger adolescents, and older adolescents and adults) and major developmental processes (cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral). Although the focus is on specific and unique effects of various forms of child neglect, particular attention is paid to studies that allow comparisons of neglect and abuse that clarify their similarities and differences.
   Results: Past as well as very recent findings converge on the conclusion that child neglect can have severe, deleterious short- and long-term effects on children's cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral development. Consistent with attachment and related theories, neglect occurring early in life is particularly detrimental to subsequent development. Moreover, neglect is associated with effects that are, in many areas, unique from physical abuse, especially throughout childhood and early adolescence. Relative to physically abused children, neglected children have more severe cognitive and academic deficits, social withdrawal and limited peer interactions, and internalizing (as opposed to externalizing) problems.
   Conclusions: The current review offers further support for the long-standing conclusion that child neglect poses a significant challenge to children's development and well-being. Limitations with regard,to the state of the knowledge are discussed and directions for future research are outlined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Despite that adolescent substance use is increasingly prevalent throughout the world and leads to increased risk of progression to illicit drug use. few, Studies have examined in detail individual features that are associated with such use. We aimed to examine personality traits. incompetence, and behavioral/emotional problems in relation to adolescent substance use and possible interactions between these factors. Methods: Junior high school adolescents (N = 905) randomly selected from Taipei in 1996 completed a questionnaire consisting of substance use experience. the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (JEPQ). and the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Students' parents (N 854) were asked to complete the Child Behavior Checklist. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between substance use and personality traits or behavioral problems. Results. The most commonly used substance was liquid substance (alcohol and refreshing beverage), followed by tobacco and betel nut with an age-related trend in boys. Associated factors of substance use included higher Extroversion and lower Lie Scale (as measured in the JEPQ). higher Novelty Seeking (as measured in the TPQ), poorer School Competence, and more Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior. and Somatic Complaints. The associations remained unchanged with potential confounders controlled for. Conclusions: Adolescents who use substance have specific individual features that are readily assessable by existing instruments. This bears important implications for the early intervention Of Substance abuse in adolescents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to investigate whether behavioural or emotional problems in adolescents detected by their teachers are signs of a common psychosocial maladjustment and of the beginning of social marginalization. Altogether, 171 pupils (15 years of age) from the eastern part of Finland participated in the survey, Behavioural and emotional problems and academic achievements were assessed separately by two teachers. Pupils filled in a questionnaire about alcohol use, smoking, physical exercise and fitness, self-rated health, psychosomatic symptoms, social relationships and future educational plans. Results showed that poor success at school and the absence of or limited educational plans were associated with both externalizing and internalizing problems. Externalizing problems were associated with health-damaging behaviour and with bullying others. Internalizing problems were associated with poor perceived health and a low level of exercise, with mental symptoms, and with problems in social relationships, Thus, the pupils in both problem groups had a clustering of different risk factors. We conclude that the accumulation in adolescents of self-reported health-damaging behaviour, problems related to school, to future educational plans and to social relationships are already obvious in pupils with externalizing and/or internalizing problems detected by their teachers at the age of 15 years. The capacity of teachers to identify pupils at risk as early as possible should therefore be utilized. The development of a vicious circle might be prevented through early intervention at school, by offering pupils guidance, counselling and treatment.

AB Describes the development and psychometric properties of the Target Symptom Rating (TSR), a brief multi-informant measure of commonly observed symptoms in child and adolescent clinical work. In a large sample of children and adolescents in inpatient and residential treatment, the 13 TSR items fell into 2 subscales: Emotional Problems and Behavior Problems, which were associated in expected ways with the Internalizing and Externalizing factors of the Achenbach scales and the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS). The measure was sensitive to change in brief and extended treatment, as rated by parents, patients, primary clinicians, and family therapists, and shows promise as a tool for outcome research in applied settings.

The STEP was given to 90 adolescents residing with their biological mother and stepfather. Negative events were significantly related to adolescent report of maladjustment, and positive events were significantly related to mother and adolescent report of internalizing problems, above and beyond the effects of several covariates. Also, the effects of negative and positive events were uniquely predictive of adolescent maladjustment. Events reflecting interactions within the adolescent's dyadic family relationships were most strongly predictive of adolescent maladjustment.

AB Introduction In daily clinical experience with addicts it is very common to find certain childhood conditions that seem to be related to substance use and abuse later in life. Identifying conditions during childhood or early adolescence leading to future drug use is a very important subject that needs to be studied in order to prevent and treat this disorder.
   In Mexico, there are only a few research studies about high-risk factors influencing illegal drug dependence or abuse. Thus the Centro de Integration Juvenil (CIJ), a specialized institution in the field of addiction prevention and treatment, decided to carry out a study that included the variables mentioned in international literature and those identified among its own patients. The variables are as follows: a) domestic violence; b) sexual abuse; c) elementary school difficulties, and d) alcohol and/or illicit drug abuse present in one or both parents and/or older siblings
   Methodology We used the operative research method based on paired groups in order to compare variables between a group of illegal drug users and a group of non-users. The user group was made up of patients classified as "substance dependent", according to the criteria of the Mental Disorders Statistical Manual, Fourth Version (DSM-IV).
   The control group (non-users) was paired according to four criteria: place of residence, gender, age, and social status. We used a non-self applicable questionnaire in both groups that explored the four variables included in the study. Each of those variables was defined as follows: 1) Domestic violence: recurrent physical maltreatment (blows) among parents or from these tu their children during the childhoods of the subjects; 2) sexual abuse: rape during childhood from a relative or stranger, as an isolated or recurrent event; 3) elementary school difficulties: failing at (one or more school grades at the elementary level; 4) alcohol and/or illegal drug abuse in one or both parents and/or older siblings. For the purposes of this investigation, alcohol abuse is referred to as alcohol consumption to the point of drunkenness at least once a week, and illegal drug use is referred as the consumption of any illegal drug at least once in life.
   Results Domestic violence was the variable most frequently found in the addict group (70%). This leads us to assume this is a high-risk factor for illegal substance use. Sexual abuse was reported only in the addict group. Even though child tape was perpetrated only in two cases, another two subjects reported tape attempts and another one said he was forced to witness how his older brother raped a girl in various occasions.
   School failure was more frequent in the addict group, but it was not reported as resulting from learning problems, but from rebellious, restless or disobedient behaviors that ended up in subjects being expelled from school or just quitting to avoid adaptation problems.
   Frequent alcohol abuse among parents was similar in both groups (addicts and non-users), but we observed a qualitative difference between the two. Addicts perceived this abuse as a "problem", while non-users considered it as "normal". These different perceptions can result from the fact that addicts associate alcohol use with domestic violence, according to what they reported during the therapeutic interviews.
   Only the addict group reported illegal drug use among family members (parents and/or siblings); this amounted to 20 addicts from the sample (50%). This high-risk variable is the second in importance from the four variables investigated in our study.
   Conclusions Domestic violence was the variable that presented more differences between the addict and the control groups. This could imply an association between physical maltreatment from parents and/or older siblings and illegal drug use.
   This finding is interesting because the frequency was very high even though we used a limited definition of domestic violence by considering only physical maltreatment. It would be interesting to know the results bid the definition of domestic violence included subjective elements such as psychological maltreatment through words, behaviors or attitudes.
   The second risk variable showing a significant difference between the two groups was the use of illicit drugs among family members. This is an extremely relevant data both for prevention and treatment. Regarding prevention, it is evident that treatment for alcohol and/or illegal drug adult users is an intervention that could help to prevent children or younger siblings front imitating this behavior. As for treatment, it reinforces the need to achieve higher therapeutic efficiency rates by including the family in the treatment model.
   Although they were not so common (two cases of rape, two cases of rape attempt and one case of rape witnessing), the findings associated with sexual abuse during childhood in the addict group, made a qualitative difference with the non-user group, where no one reported such an experience during childhood.
   To understand the significance of this information, it is important to consider that this variable was delimited in very precise terms by investigating only actual rapes. The purpose of doing it in such fashion was to analyze the most evident and concrete data as possible. Doubts remain about the results that would have come up had the definition of sexual abuse been broader.
   Concerning elementary school difficulties, we found out that the addict group presented higher failure levels. However, as mentioned before, this failure was unrelated to learning problems, but it did have an association with behavioral ones. Multiple causes explain such a behavior during childhood: alterations or lack of neurological maturity, emotional problems, family conflict, etc. From a qualitative point of view, these are data that could have a relation with illicit drug use and so we recommend its further study and analysis.
   The four variables were not found simultaneously in any of the addicts or non-users. The presence of two or three of them was most frequently reported in the addict group, which allows us to suppose there is no causal association between each separate variable. It is more common that illegal drug use predisposition results from a combination of various complex variables.

AB Aims: To compare the long term functional and psychosocial outcomes following surgical treatment for total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) with those in an age and gender matched group of patients with rectosigmoid aganglionosis (RSA).
   Methods: Fifteen patients with TCA matched for age and gender with 15 patients with RSA were studied 7-17 years after the definitive operation. The internal and external sphincters were examined using anal endosonography. Functional outcome (faecal continence) was assessed by a surgeon not involved in the patients' care, and by a research psychologist in separate assessment sessions. The behavioural and emotional status of the patients was also assessed.
   Results: Based on the surgeon's assessment, 6/15 TCA and 7/15 RSA patients were continent. In comparison, based on the psychological interview, 2/15 TCA and 6/15 RSA patients were continent. The TCA patients reported significantly more behavioural/emotional problems and lower levels of self esteem than the RSA patients. The parent and teacher assessments of psychosocial status revealed no differences between the groups. There was no association between incontinence and psychosocial adjustment in either group. There was no association between the assessments of functional outcome, and the endosonographic appearance of the anal sphincters.
   Conclusions: The proportion of patients with faecal incontinence 7-17 years after definitive surgery was high in both groups, but no association was found between incontinence and the psychosocial outcome measures. TCA patients perceived themselves as less well adjusted than their matched pairs. Differences between the groups in length of hospitalisation and severity of illness, especially in infancy and early childhood, may account for these differences.

AB It has been found that university students who were the least skilled at managing their emotions also had the lowest intention of seeking help from a variety of nonprofessional sources (e. g. family and friends). The present study sought to extend these findings by focusing on adolescents, examining a larger number of emotional competencies, and exploring the possibility that social support explains the relationship between emotional competence and help-seeking. A total of 137 adolescents (aged 16-18) completed an anonymous survey that assessed social support, emotional competencies, and intention to seek help from a variety of professional and nonprofessional sources. As expected, adolescents who were low in emotional awareness, and who were poor at identifying, describing, and managing their emotions, were the least likely to seek help from nonprofessional sources and had the highest intention of refusing help from everyone. However, low emotional competence was not related to intention to seek help from professional sources (e.g. mental health professionals). The significant results involving nonprofessional sources were only partially explained by social support, suggesting that even adolescents who had high quality support were less likely to make use of that support if they were low in emotional competence.

SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The chronic shortage of foster families is exacerbated by the underutilization of foster families. Better utilization may be linked to the willingness of families to foster children with special needs and teenagers. This study used data from the National Survey of Current and Former Foster Parents to examine the extent of foster family underutilization and the relationship between willingness to foster particular types of children and utilization. Findings showed that over one-third of licensed families did not have foster children in their homes. Families willing to foster special-needs children and teenagers had fostered more children and more types of special-needs children, had more foster children in their homes, were licensed to care for more children, had fostered longer, and were less likely to report an intention to discontinue fostering. In particular, utilization was predicted by willingness to foster children who were physically handicapped or seriously ill, children who had serious behavioral or emotional problems, or children who were sexually abused. Implications for recruitment, training, placement, and support are discussed.

A cluster analysis with these composites on 87 initially rejected boys identified 4 subgroups with different developmental pathways of prosocial behavior and aggression that were associated with different patterns of sociometric acceptance and rejection over time and with social emotional adjustment in the last measurement wave. Changes in acceptance and rejection tend to precede changes in aggression and prosocial behavior. Cluster differences on social emotional adjustment indicators converged into I moderately discriminating factor, Social Maladaptation in Peer-Oriented Behavior.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to test a hypothetical model of alcohol problems in German adolescents. Among 180 offspring, family history of alcoholism, parenting styles, behavioral and emotional problems, peer-group characteristics, feelings of self-esteem, behavioral problems and psychiatric comorbidity of the parents were examined. Method: Data were generated from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP), in which families were randomly selected if 12-18 year old biological offspring were members of the household; a smaller group of subjects was selected from local outpatient treatment centers. Members of 133 families, including 180 (50.6% male) offspring who were appropriate for the current analyses, received personal semistructured diagnostic interviews and several self-rating questionnaires. Analyses compared offspring with alcohol problems (AP; n = 40) and with no alcohol problems (NAP; n = 140), and used structural equation modeling to test a hypothetical model. Results: The comparisons revealed that the AP group had significantly more behavioral problems (e.g., aggression/delinquency), more perceived parental rejection and less emotional warmth, a higher amount of alcohol consumption, were more likely to associate with substance-using peers and more often received a diagnosis of conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Whereas the family history of alcoholism did not differ significantly between groups, parents of offspring with an alcohol use disorder had significantly more additional diagnoses on DSM-IV Axis 1. The evaluation of the model supported the importance of aggression/delinquency and association with substance-using peers for alcohol problems in people. An additional diagnosis in the parents was directly and indirectly (through aggression/delinquency) related to alcohol problems of the adolescents. Conclusions: The data indicate that alcohol problems in the offspring are associated with several domains of influence in their environment. Prospective studies measuring both biological and environmental factors using sufficient sample sizes will be needed for optimal understanding of the development of alcohol problems in youth.

AB BACKGROUND. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) is a modular instrument designed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2-18 years. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the PedsQL disease specific modules. The PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale was designed to measure fatigue in pediatric patients. The PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module was designed to measure pediatric cancer specific HRQOL.
   METHODS. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales, Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and Cancer Module were administered to 339 families (220 child self-reports; 337 parent proxy-reports).
   RESULTS. Internal consistency reliability for the PedsQL Generic Core Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.88 child, 0.93 parent report), Multidimensional Fatigue Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.89 child, 0.92 parent report) and most Cancer Module Scales (average alpha = 0.72 child, 0.87 parent report) demonstrated reliability acceptable for group comparisons. Validity was demonstrated using the known-groups method. The PedsQL distinguished between healthy children and children with cancer as a group, and among children on-treatment versus off-treatment. The validity of the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale was further demonstrated through hypothesized intercorrelations with dimensions of generic and cancer specific HRQOL.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results demonstrate the reliability and validity of the PedsQL Generic Core Scales, Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, and Cancer Module in pediatric cancer. The PedsQL may be utilized as an outcome measure in clinical trials, research, and clinical practice.

The positive relation between disaster exposure and emotional sequelae was found to be mediated by ascribing to a depressogenic attributional style in which negative outcomes were attributed to internal, stable, and global causes. Ascribing to a depressogenic attributional style did not mediate the relation between PTSD symptoms and disaster exposure, thus providing some support for an attributional-style-symptom-specific relation in the context of postdisaster adjustment.

AB We tested associations in structural models among parent individual problems (severity of drug problems, medical problems, psychiatric symptoms), family problems, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Results were compared for cocaine versus opiate dependent parents, mothers versus fathers, boys versus girls, and older versus younger children. Cocaine and opiate dependent parents in treatment (N=211) were interviewed about their substance use, psychiatric symptoms, and interpersonal problems and completed a measure of family problems. Parents also rated children's internalizing and externalizing problems. In structural models controlling for the significant correlations between parent and family problems and between children's internalizing and externalizing problems. family problems but not individual parent problems predicted children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Models were similar across all groups compared with the exception of parent gender, with significant relations between parent and family problems for mothers but not for fathers. In addition. older girls were more deviant relative to their same-age and gender peers than the younger girls and boys. These results suggest that the personal problems of drug dependent mothers may influence children's problems indirectly by increasing family problems. For drug dependent fathers, family problems were an independent predictor of children's problems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The PedsQL(TM) 4.0 (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory(TM)) Generic Core Scales are child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2-18. The PedsQL(TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 items applicable for healthy school and community populations and pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions. The 4 PedsQL(TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales (Physical, Emotional, Social., School) were administered to 209 children and 269 parents (289 subjects accrued overall) recruited from pediatric cardiology, orthopedics, and rheumatology clinics. Sensitivity, responsiveness, and the impact on clinical decision-making were determined. The PedsQL(TM) was differentially sensitive to increasing degrees of cardiac disease severity in the cardiology clinic setting and responsive to clinical change over time in the pediatric orthopedics clinic setting. In the pediatric rheumatology clinic setting, the PedsQL(TM) demonstrated an impact on clinical decision-making, resulting in subsequent increases in HRQOL.

AB Objective: To examine, in children, relationships between self-reported recurrent pain and emotion regulation indicated by rated internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors and adjustment.
   Method. Finnish 11-12-year-old schoolchildren (N = 414) completed a questionnaire measuring recurrent pain. Emotion regulation was assessed by a Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory, Teacher Rating Form. Relationships between recurrent pain and emotion regulation were examined in logistic regression analyses, after controlling for past injuries and chronic illnesses.
   Results: Independent of injuries and chronic illnesses, externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors related to recurrent pain, and more so together than separately. Gender differences were found; constructive behavior associated with recurrent pain only in girls.
   Conclusions. Low self-control of emotions, indicated by internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, was related to pain in both boys and girls; high self-control of emotions, indicated by constructive behavior, associated with pain only in girls.

   SYMPTOMS; ADOLESCENTS; MOOD; CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; UTILITY
AB Objective: To examine whether the two-factor model of affect presented by Watson and colleagues is applicable to school children. Method: A child self-report scale of symptoms of depression and anxiety was administered to 624 school children in the third and sixth grades. Factor analyses were applied to extract factors of positive and negative affect. Reliabilities, correlations, and longitudinal analyses were performed to examine the developmental pathway of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Results: In contrast to Watson's early findings, our results indicate that the PA and NA scales are significantly negatively correlated cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. Moreover, our findings indicate that children with high NA and low PA in the third grade display a worse prognosis than children who have either high NA or low PA. Conclusions: A new affect model is needed for describing children's mood status. In addition, an important implication of these findings is that the occurrence of comorbid mood status in children confers a high risk for later emotional problems,

AB Objective. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) is a modular instrument designed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2-18 years. The 23-item PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the PedsQL disease-specific modules. The 22-item PedsQL 3.0 Rheumatology Module was designed to measure pediatric rheumatology-specific HRQOL. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the PedsQL 3.0 Rheumatology Module in pediatric rheumatology.
   Methods. The 4 PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (physical, emotional, social, and school functioning) and the 5 PedsQL 3.0 Rheumatology Module scales (pain and hurt, daily activities, treatment, worry, an communication) were administered to 231 children and 244 parents (271 subjects accrued overall) recruited from a pediatric rheumatology clinic.
   Results. Internal consistency reliability for the PedsQL Generic Core total scale score (alpha = 0.91 for child self report, alpha = 0.93 for parent proxy report), physical health summary score (alpha = 0.87 for child self report, alpha = 0.89 for parent proxy, report), and psychosocial health summary score (alpha = 0.86 for child self report, alpha = 0.90 for parent proxy report) were acceptable for group comparisons. The Rheumatology Module scales also demonstrated acceptable reliability for group comparisons (alpha = 0.75-0.86 for child self report, alpha = 0.82-0.91 for parent proxy, report). Validity was demonstrated using the known-groups method. The PedsQL distinguished between healthy children and children with rheumatic diseases as a group. The responsiveness of the PedsQL was demonstrated through patient change over time as a result of clinical intervention.
   Conclusion. The results demonstrate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and the PedsQL 3.0 Rheumatology Module in pediatric rheumatology.

AB Explored the consequences of divorce on children in China. In contrast to Western countries, divorce in China is relatively rare, occurring in approximately 10% to 15% of the population. Children from divorced families (n = 174) and matched intact families (n = 174) were selected from a larger sample of 1,294 children between 8 and 14 years of age. Divorce was relatively low in this sample (13.45%) of participants, consistent with rates observed in epidemiological studies in China. Mothers of divorced children reported higher levels of education but lower levels of income than mothers in intact families. Children in divorced families reported higher levels of anxiety and depression, and their mothers and teachers rated them as possessing more behavior problems on the Achenbach (1991) Child Behavior Checklist scales. Regression analyses revealed that rejecting and inattentive parenting styles, along with family status (divorce or intact), high maternal depression, and sex (boys) predicted significant amounts of variance associated with these negative outcomes. Results are discussed in terms of familial and cultural issues associated with these findings.

Data analyzed were collected from 1,260 parents of sixth graders from 26 rural Iowa communities. Hierarchical linear modeling results indicated that both family- and community-level factors were significant predictors of Parent support seeking. Findings at the family level indicated that household income, parent gender, and number of children were significantly predictive of informal suppport seeking; parent education and parent gender were significantly predictive of formal support seeking. In addition, significant community population size effects on informal Parent support seeking were found. (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.

AB Adult attachment orientation has been associated with specific patterns of emotion regulation. The present research examined the effects of attachment orientation on the perceptual processing of emotional stimuli. Experimental participants played computerized movies of faces that expressed happiness, sadness, and anger. Over the course of the movies, the facial expressions became neutral. Participants reported the frame at which the initial expression no longer appeared on the face. Under conditions of no distress (Study 1), fearfully attached individuals saw the offset of both happiness and anger earlier, and preoccupied and dismissive individuals later, than the securely attached individuals. Under conditions of distress (Study 2), insecurely attached individuals perceived the offset of negative facial expressions as occurring later than did the secure individuals, and fearfully attached individuals saw the offset later than either of the other insecure groups. The mechanisms underlying the effects are considered.

AB Objective: To examine associations between dieting frequency and eating disorder behaviors, body satisfaction, and related factors. Method: Females (N = 345) whose average age and body mass index (BMI) were 20.58 and 21.79, respectively, were grouped into three categories of lifetime dieting frequency (never, 1 - 5 times, or 6 or more times) and matched on current BMI across categories. Results: Positive associations were found between dieting frequency and eating disorder symptoms and related problems such as body dissatisfaction, current body size perception, depression, exercise preoccupation, and feelings of ineffectiveness and insecurity. Dieting frequency was inversely associated with self-esteem, ideal body size, emotional regulation, and impulse control. Discussion: Independent of current BMI, frequency of dieting behaviors is strongly associated with negative emotions and problematic behaviors. As this study is correlational in nature, future longitudinal studies should ascertain the sequence of onset of these experiences. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine two core assumptions of attachment theory. First, internal working models of attachment should increase in stability during the course of development. Second, attachment is related to the adaptive solution of stage salient issues, in adolescence, specifically to identity formation. Adolescence as a developmental period of change and reorganization might lead to changes in attachment representations by re,evaluating one's life experiences in the course of general identity development. In a longitudinal study, the stability of attachment representations (assessed by the Adult Attachment Interview) between ages 16 and 18 was examined. In addition, the concurrent and longitudinal associations of identity status at age 16 with attachment representations at ages 16 and 13 were tested. Results showed high stability of attachment representation during that age period. Secure attachment representation was positively associated with the identity status achievement, whereas a dismissing status was positively associated with identity diffusion. Longitudinally, identity diffusion at age 16 predicted attachment representation at age 18 even after controlling for earlier attachment representation, (C) 2002 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Objective: Few studies exist that examine continuities between child and adult psychopathology in unselected samples. This study prospectively examined the adult outcomes of psychopathology in an epidemiological sample of children and adolescents across a 14-year period. Method: In 1983, parent ratings of behavioral and emotional problems were obtained for 1,578 children and adolescents aged 4 through 16 years from the Dutch general population. At follow-up, 14 years later, subjects were reassessed with a standardized DSM-IV interview. Results: High levels of childhood problems predicted an approximate 2- to 6-fold increased risk for adulthood DSM-IV diagnoses. The associations between specific childhood problems and adulthood diagnoses were complex. Social Problems in girls predicted later DSM-IV disorder. Rule-breaking behavior in boys predicted both mood disorders and disruptive disorders in adulthood. Conclusions: High levels of childhood behavioral and emotional problems are related to DSM-IV diagnoses in adulthood, The strongest predictor of disorders in adulthood was childhood rule-breaking behavior. Attention Problems did not predict any of the DSM-IV categories when adjusted for the associations with other Child Behavior Checklist scales.

AB The study offers the first investigation of cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between attachment and religiosity with adolescent participants. Adolescence is a life period linked to attachment transitions and religious changes. The research was conducted to help resolve inconsistent results from previous cross-sectional versus longitudinal studies and studies on attachment to parents versus peer attachment. Time I questionnaire data was collected from 196 Swedish adolescents (M age = 16 years); 143 participants completed the 15-month follow-up. Results from the cross-sectional analyses generally supported the socialized correspondence and emotional compensation hypotheses, Particularly in relation to attachment to mother. Results from the longitudinal analyses were more mixed. The discussion integrates the hypotheses with Kirkpatrick's previous proposal, argues for a main focus on attachment to parents rather than peer attachment, and offers suggestions for future attachment and religion studies.

AB Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is based on a transactional model of the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). It assumes that the associated emotional dysregulation is not simply biological or family induced but the result of a dynamic interaction between the biology and characteristics of an individual with the individual's social environment. This paper discusses the theoretical issues and empirical research relating to a synthesis of family therapy and DBT with adolescents. A review of the literature identifies support for a greater understanding and inclusion of families in treatment, attention to relational aspects of affect, and a dialectical framework for synthesizing individual-oriented and systemic-oriented theories and practice. Some implications for the development of a DBT family therapy model are discussed.

ID SUPPORT; STRESS; SELF
AB This article examined adolescents' reports of how they cope with a specific social stressor: authority conflict with parents. This situation was presented to 626 adolescents as part of a larger study on coping with stress. Students were requested to report on the intensity of the stress experienced, intensity of emotions, emotion regulation, perceived availability of social support, goal framing, and coping strategies used. Coping strategies split up factor-analytically into two coping patterns, namely fighting the stressor and coming to terms with the stressor. The relations between these two coping modes and various aspects of the students' mental representation of the stressor were examined. It was predicted that the way students frame the coping goal would affect their choice of coping strategies. Direct effects of coping strategy, emotion regulation and social support on intensity of stress were tested as well as moderating effects of the type of coping mode used on the relationship between emotion regulation and experienced stress. It is suggested that some youngsters consider an authority conflict with their parents as a normal aspect of daily functioning, whereas other view it as a developmental challenge.

AB Parent training is often used to treat non-compliance and social problems in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Smith and Barrett (2000) found that a parent training intervention led to improved compliance and core ADHD symptoms in 3 school-aged girls. The current study extended findings from Smith and Barrett (2000) by directly examining changes in hyperactivity and inattentiveness in the same 3 girls. Five child behaviors indexing inattention and hyperactivity were assessed from home observations of parent-child interactions made before, during, and after the parent training program. Body Fidgeting (gross motor movements and leaving one's seat) declined significantly. It was the only child behavior variable correlated with parent reports of attention, behavior, and emotional problems on the Child Behavior Checklist. Off-Task behaviors grew worse over the course of parent training. Such findings suggest that parent training programs may narrowly focus on overt behaviors at the expense of other symptoms. Further, it may be that increasing parent intervention with some child behaviors (e.g., fidgeting) reduces the family's ability to manage other ADHD-related problems (e.g., inattention).

AB The study focuses on the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents from a secondary educational level, and on the changes of such variables according to age and gender. The Youth Self Report (YSR) designed by Achenbach (1991) was administered to an urban sample of 1342 Catalan adolescents aged 11 to 16, recruited from 15 schools located throughout all of the municipal districts of Barcelona, Spain. The purpose of this study is to offer descriptive data for each YSR syndrome, and to analyze age and gender differences in behavioral and emotional clusters of problems as defined in the YSR. The results show that with age self-perceived maladjustment increases progressively in females from 11 to 16 years, and that the progression is only detected in boys between 11 to 14 years. The age differences on the behavioral and cognitive domain are similar for both genders. while age differences in emotional problems diverge.

AB Emotional competence and deficits that may disrupt interpersonal interactions were evaluated in 28 adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 28 demographically equivalent controls. Participants completed tasks assessing affect recognition and experienced emotional intensity. Adults with ADHD performed worse in affect recognition than did adults without the disorders however, the impairment was unrelated to gross perceptual processes, fundamental abilities in facial recognition, or attentional aspects of affect perception, Moreover. intensity of experienced emotion moderated affect recognition: Among controls, experienced emotion facilitated affect recognition. Among adults with ADHD, who reported significantly greater intensity, experienced emotion was inversely related to affect recognition. Results are consistent with theories of ADHD as a deficit in behavioral inhibition: yet, results may merely reflect a constellation of deficits associated with the disorder.

AB Forty parentally bereaved youngsters (age 6-16; 22 girls, 18 boys) and their surviving parent were interviewed and administered standardized measures (BSI, CBCL, CDI, RCMAS, WISC) to assess their emotional adjustment approximately 18 months after their parent's death. The sample was predominantly middle class Caucasian, with children relatively free of prior confounding non-bereavement related major stresses. There were marked discrepancies between parent CBCL reports of their children's adjustment and the children's self-report, while teacher reports (TRF) were somewhat more closely correlated with parent reports. On average, these bereaved children appeared to be faring well, though with heightened internalizing problems: adolescent boys seemed to be having the most difficulty. Full sample means concealed important differences revealed in gender and age group analyses. Strikingly, the full sample of children scored below national norms for non-bereaved children on depression and anxiety measures. Parent adjustment was the best predictor of child adjustment.

DT Article
AB Objective. This research study tested a social cognitive model in which family socioeconomic status (SES) and neighborhood quality predicted parental efficacy, which then predicted the academic and social-emotional adjustment of adolescents through 3 parental behaviors (monitoring, parental involvement, and parent-adolescent communication). Design. The study investigated parental efficacy among a stratified random sample of 929 parents and their adolescent children in the United States. Parents and adolescents provided reports through telephone interviews. Structural equation modeling tested the model fit for the overall sample and for European American (n = 387), African American (n = 259), and Latin American (n = 283) subsamples. Results. The model fit for the overall sample and for each racial or ethnic group. Paths within each model also were examined. For the overall sample, neighborhood quality predicted parental efficacy, parental efficacy predicted reported parental involvement and monitoring, both of which predicted academic and social-emotional adjustment of adolescents, and parent-adolescent communication predicted social-emotional adjustment. Some racial or ethnic differences in paths emerged. Conclusions. Overall, the study supported predictions made by social cognitive theory. Given the link between parental efficacy, parenting behaviors, and adolescent outcomes, 1 important goal of programs for parents of adolescents might be to bolster parental efficacy.

AB The aims of this study were to examine family type (nonstep, stepfather, stepmother, and single mother) and sibling type (full- and half-siblings) differences in sibling relationship quality (positivity and negativity), and to investigate links between sibling relationship quality and child externalizing and internalizing problems. The sample included 192 families with a 5-year-old target child and an older sibling. In addition, 80 of these families included a third older child. Mothers and the older siblings (8 years and older) completed questionnaires and interviews regarding conflict and support in their sibling relationships, and parents and teachers reported on each child social-emotional adjustment. Sibling negativity (conflict, aggression) was highest in single-mother families and full-siblings were more negative than half- and stepsiblings. There was some evidence that sibling antagonism was associated with more child behavioral and emotional problems, but these effects were moderated by family type.

AB Objective: Few studies have examined the use of alternative therapies among adolescents. This study examines the predictors of Native Hawaiian healer preference in the treatment of physical or emotional problems as well as the predictors of healer use. Design: This study is a longitudinal cross-sectional design. Setting: The survey was conducted in five high schools in Hawai'i. Participants: 1,322 high school students selected preference for and/or use of allopathic or alternative practitioners. Main outcome measures: Grade level, gender, ethnicity and cultural identity were used to predict healer preference. Healer preference, socioeconomic status and health status were used to predict healer use. Results: Identification with the Hawaiian culture was the strongest predictor of healer preference for both Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian adolescents. Mental health was also predictive of healer preference for non-Hawaiians. Healer use by Native Hawaiian adolescents was also predicted by Hawaiian cultural identity. Gender, grade level, and socioeconomic variables were not predictive of healer preference or use. Conclusion: Cultural identity plays a significant role in the preference and use of alternative practitioners, especially for minority adolescent populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Previous studies of the gifted have been inconsistent, portraying them as both more and less well adjusted than the nongifted or less gifted. We examined behavioral, cognitive, attentional, and family history dimensions among four groups of 87 boys: High Gifted (IQ 140-154), Low Gifted (IQ 124-139), Learning Disabled, and a Normal control group. Findings indicated that High Gifted boys exhibit levels of behavior problems similar to the Learning Disabled, whereas Low Gifted boys demonstrate significantly lower levels of behavioral problems than do the Learning Disabled boys. These data provide support for the view of the gifted population as heterogeneous, with the High Gifted exhibiting more behavioral problems than the Low Gifted.

AB A sample Of 355 children with intellectual disability (ID) attending special schools in Cape Town, South Africa, were assessed on the Developmental Behavioural Checklist-Teacher Version (DBC-T). A prevalence rate Of 31% for psychopathology was found. Boys manifested more behaviour problems than girls, especially in relation to disruptive, self-absorbed and antisocial behaviours. Children with severe and profound levels of ID showed more behavioural difficulties than those in the mild and moderate categories. Specific behaviour problems were self-absorbed and autistic behaviours in children with profound ID, communication problems and anxiety in those with severe ID and antisocial behaviour in children with mild ID. Epilepsy, but not cerebral palsy was associated with higher total behaviour scores. Ambulant children were more disruptive and antisocial, while non-ambulant children were more anxious. Non-verbal children had higher scores on all of the subscales except for disruptive behaviour.

AB Objective: To compare the psychosocial adaptation of boys with hypospadias after genital surgery to a community sample.
   Methods: Boys (6 to 10 years) with a history of hypospadias repair (n = 175) were compared with a community sample (n = 333) in a postal questionnaire survey using the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Few significant differences between cases and controls emerged. Boys with hypospadias were (slightly) lower in social involvement but did not perform more poorly in school. Boys with hypospadias displayed fewer externalizing behavior problems than controls, but a significant difference in nocturnal enuresis was not detected. Level of behavior problems did not differentiate hypospadias severity subgroups, but greater surgical and hospitalization experiences were associated with increased internalizing problems. Poorer cosmetic appearance of the genitals was associated with worse school performance.
   Conclusions: Surgically corrected hypospadias should not be considered a risk factor for poor psychosocial adaptation in childhood, but emotional problems increase with the number of hospital-related experiences.

AB This study used 2 measures to examine 158 adults' (80 men, 78 women; ages 20 to 88 years) self-concept differentiation (SCD) across 5 role-specific self-representations. Findings revealed that the 2 measures did not assess SCD in similar ways and that they showed different associations with age. Specifically, the Ist measure was not significantly related to age, whereas the 2nd measure showed a curvilinear, U-shaped association with age. The 2nd SCD index also showed significant associations with several measures of emotional adjustment and 6 dimensions of psychological well-being. Additional analyses showed that age moderated the associations between SCD and positive and negative psychological well-being. A high level of SCD was associated with lower positive and higher negative psychological well-being for both young and older adults. However, this effect was significantly more pronounced in older adults.

AB Recent studies have showed that suicide behavior is present in students of junior and senior high school. In Mexico City, a prevalence of 4.3% in men and 12.1% in women has been reported. The motivations for suicide attempt are multiple, and sexual abuse has been recognized as one of them. This problem has been scarcely documented in students in our country. Nevertheless, a prevalence of 4.3% has been found in junior and senior high school students of both sexes. The present paper explores the association between suicide attempt and sexual abuse, and the impact that these problems can cause in the current mental health of the Students, particularly in terms of depression and suicide ideation.
   The objective is to identify in a population of two junior high schools in the downtown area of 'Mexico City: 1) the frequency of sexual abuse and suicide attempt experienced once in a lifetime; 2) the frequency of current depression and suicide ideation; 3} the association between sexual abuse and suicide attempt with current depression and Suicide ideation; and 4) the frequency of current depression and suicide ideation in students that reported sexual abuse or suicide attempt.
   A total of 936 students participated: 54% men and 46% women, with a mean age of 13.7 years. A survey was performed with the permission of the Ministry of Education and the school authorities. The instrument was self-administered. The participation was voluntary, and confidentiality and anonymity were assured.
   The results show that 7% of the women and 2% of the men had experienced sexual abuse, and that 11,0 of the women and 4% of the men had attempted to commit suicide. Among the male population, there were no cases of sexual abuse nor suicide attempt; but among the female population, from 49 girls that had attempted to commit suicide, 12% had also been victims of sexual abuse. Most of the cases reported that sexual abuse was experienced when they were around 10 years old and the suicide attempt yeas committed when they were around 12 years old. The frequency of current depression and suicide attempt were 14% and 15%, respectively in men and in women, 18% in both indicators. The association between sexual abuse and suicide attempt, and the indicators of current emotional problems was statistically significant. In men with suicide attempt, 50% showed current depression and suicide ideation; in women with sexual abuse and suicide attempt, the frequency was 67%. These results are discussed with the aim of malting evident the need to establish preventive strategies for the early detection and the promotion of emotional health among the school population.

AB Background: Regular drinking by age 14 years is a significant risk factor for alcoholism. and genetically informative data suggest that whether a young adolescent abstains or drinks is largely attributable to familial (or other shared) environmental factors.
   Methods: Three consecutive birth cohorts of Finnish twins, enrolled into a longitudinal study at age I I to 12 years, completed a follow-up questionnaire within 3 months of their 14th birthdays. The sample included 1380 twin sisters and 1330 twin brothers at age 14, and at that age, 35.4% reported using alcohol. Genetic analyses (model-fitting of twin pair data) and epidemiological analyses (logistical regressions of data from individual twins) were conducted to examine predictive factors of drinking versus abstinence at age 14.
   Results: Polychoric correlations were substantial across all same-sex twin pairs but were lower for brother-sister twins, suggesting significant influences of common environments, with some sex-specific effects. Common environmental effects were equivalent in male and female adolescents and accounted for 76% of the total variation in abstinence/drinking. Logistical regression analyses among 2206 individual twins with complete data on risk-relevant measures at both baseline and follow-up identified significant predictors of drinking or abstaining at age 14, including female sex, twin sibling of the opposite sex. accelerated pubertal development, and the twins' assessments, made at age 12, of reduced parental monitoring and a less supportive home atmosphere; drinking at age 14 was also predicted by behaviors rated by the twins' classroom teachers 2 years earlier, increasing with rated behavioral problems but decreasing with rated emotional problems.
   Conclusions: Our results show that environmental factors shared by twin siblings account for most of the variance in abstaining or drinking at age 14. We identify predictors of drinking in the adolescent twins' home environments and in their dispositional behaviors. sibling interactions, and pubertal timing.

AB Purpose: To report on the prevalence and correlates of smoking and sexual activity in a community sample of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: Participants (N = 4116) aged 13 to 18 years were surveyed regarding smoking and physical heterosexual activity, relationships with family members, family involvement, social support, school performance and emotional adjustment. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analyses.
   Results: About 30% of participants reported ever smoking and 3.5% reported sexual intercourse. Current smoking was correlated with age, school performance and quality of relationship with mother. Sexual intercourse was correlated with age, gender, family involvement and social support. Smoking and sexual activity were significantly correlated with each other. Smoking and increasing levels of heterosexual physical contact were negatively correlated with emotional adjustment, even after controlling for common predictors to health-endangering behaviors and emotional adjustment.
   Conclusions: Smoking and sexual activity among adolescents are far less common in Hong Kong than in the West and their presence in a Hong Kong adolescent should alert the health practitioner to the possibility of significant psychosocial stress and maladjustment.

AB In Hong Kong, prevocational schools serve as an alternative to mainstream schools to provide education with more emphasis on practical and technical subjects. In this paper, health-risk behaviors of prevocational school (PVS) students were identified, and comparisons of health-risk behaviors with or without adjusting the demographic factors from prevocational schools and mainstream schools were made. The PVS students were at higher risk for most categories of health-risk behaviors such as unintentional and intentional injuries, smoking, alcohol drinking, glue sniffing, inadequate physical activity, insufficient consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and early sexual activity with multiple partners. Female students of PVS reported higher prevalence of emotional problems and substance abuse. Findings suggest that the school environment is an influential factor on the lifestyle behavior of students. Comprehensive health education and intervention programs are needed for youth in Hong Kong prevocational schools.

AB International research on children's problems relies heavily on parent and teacher ratings. Such ratings are helpful to professionals who assess children but are subjected to biases emerging from adults' personal involvement with the children they rate, and their own cultural experiences. This study investigated whether ratings of teachers versus observers on Jamaican children ages 6-11 differed according to informant, urban versus rural area, gender, and age. Significantly higher total problem scores emerged for ratings by observers than those by teachers. Observers also rated younger children as more demanding and aggressive while both informants rated rural children as exhibiting more externalizing problems than urban children. Opportunity for discharging behavior in the environment may have caused rural children to present more externalizing problems. Media and training effects may have increased teachers' tolerance for problems in children nationwide, but in contrast to observers' circumscribed observation periods, teachers' ratings may reflect their perspectives on children's problems over an entire academic year.

AB Child Behavior Checklist questionnaires (Achenbach, 1992), filled in separately by mothers and fathers, were collected for an effective sample of 3501 Dutch 3-year-old twin pairs. To disentangle the child's phenotype from that of the rater, two contrasting models were fitted to the data. One model, called a Rater Bias model, is based on the assumption that both parents assess exactly the same behaviors in the child. A weaker alternative of this model, called a Psychometric model, assumes that apart from these common behavioral views, each parent also assesses a unique aspect of the child's behavior. A Psychometric model fitted the data of both Internalizing and Externalizing scales significantly better than a Rater Bias model. This implied that each parent provided unique information from his or her own perspective, apart from the common behavioral view. Using this best fitting model, the etiology of both the Internalizing and Externalizing scales was studied. Common factors (influencing behaviors similarly assessed by both parents) were more important than unique factors (influencing behaviors uniquely assessed by one parent). Common genetic factors explained about 50 % of the Variance of both scales, indicating a possible inborn Vulnerability to childhood psychopathology. Common environmental factors not shared between twins (free of unreliability and error) explained around 14 % of both scales, suggesting the importance of pure idiosyncratic experiences even for children as young as 3 years. Common environmental factors shared between twins (unconfounded by rater bias) were only found for the Externalizing scale, explaining 18 % of the variance. Rater bias and unreliability, if present in the data. were included in the estimates of the unique factors. Unique genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors each explained around 8 % of the variance for both scales. These small effects could be detected because of the large sample of twin pairs used.

AB Young people learn from their interactions with their parents how to initiate and maintain satisfying and warm friendships. Attachment with parents thereby plays an important role in adolescents' social and emotional adjustment. The model tested in this study proposes that the relation between parental attachment and emotional adjustment is mediated by social skills and relational competence. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the models and paths between concepts using data from a sample of 412 12-18-year-olds. In the 12-14-year-old age group, no effects of parental attachment on social skills and relational competence were displayed. However, in the 15-18-year-old age group, parental attachment was moderately related to social skills, which, in turn, affected middle adolescents' competence in friendships and romantic relationships. Parental attachment and relational competence were significant predictors of adolescents' emotional adjustment in both age groups.

AB Ongoing or impending litigation may have a substantial impact on treatment, affecting parents' and children's interactions with the therapist and the structure and content of treatment. Psychologists must be prepared to think forensically as well as clinically and have the requisite expertise to support children's needs, accomplish interventions, and, if appropriate, provide information to the forensic evaluator or the court. S.(.)Greenberg and D.

AB An overview is given of the social and emotional adjustment in young survivors of childhood cancer. The results are described in terms of self-esteem, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress (emotional adjustment), and in terms of behavioral functioning, social competence and school performance (socio-behavioral adjustment). Furthermore, factors related to survivors' adjustment are reported: demographics, illness- and treatment-related factors, coping and social support, and family and parental functioning. Limitations of the studies and consequences for future research are discussed. On the whole, the adjustment of young cancer survivors as a group was reasonably good, but the findings with respect to the emotional and social adjustment were inconsistent. This might be attributed to limitations of the study designs and the fact that the studies were not all directly comparable. In order to gain more insight into the predictors of adjustment, longitudinal studies are recommended, which should include control groups or standardized instruments with norm data, and use cancer-specific measures in addition to generic measures.

AB Early puberty is frequently observed in adopted children. This randomized trial treated 30 adopted children with early puberty and short stature with either gonadotropin-re leasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) alone or in combination with growth hormone (GH) for 3 y. Before the start of treatment (TI) in the trial and at discontinuation (T2) the children and their parents underwent a psychological evaluation. At the start of treatment the children did not have increased levels of behavioural or emotional problems as assessed by the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). During treatment the CBCL scores did not increase. Self-perception of the children appeared to be normal, and after 3 y a significantly higher score for acceptance by peers was observed. At T1, an overestimation of future height was present in 80% of the children and 17% of the parents. Lower family stress was observed at T1 and T2 compared with reference values. Intelligence quotient levels decreased significantly during treatment. The findings are discussed with reference to the reported levels of behavioural and emotional problems in adopted children and the psychosocial effects of precocious puberty.
   Conclusion: This psychological evaluation did not reveal any consistent abnormalities in adopted children with early puberty. Treatment with GnRHa with or without GH did not increase emotional and behavioural problems in adopted children, nor was their self-perception decreased.

AB Objectives To establish the relation between recurrent peer victimisation and onset of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the early teen years.
   Design Cohort study over two years.
   Setting Secondary schools in Victoria, Australia.
   Participants 2680 students surveyed twice in year 8 (aged 13 years) and once in year 9.
   Main outcome measures Self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression were assessed by using the computerised version of the revised clinical interview schedule. Incident cases were students scoring greater than or equal to 12 in year 9 but not previously. Prior victimisation was defined as having been bullied at either or both survey times in year 8.
   Results Prevalence of victimisation at the second survey point in year 8 was 51% (95% confidence interval 49% to 54%), and prevalence of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression was 18% (16% to 20%). The incidence of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in year 9 (7%) was significantly associated with victimisation reported either once (odds ratio 1.94, 1.1 to 3.3) or twice (2.30,1.2 to 4.3) in year 8. After adjustment for availability of social relations and for so cio demographic factors, recurrent victimisation remained predictive of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression for girls (2.60, 1.2 to 5.5) but not for boys (1.36, 0.6 to 3.0). Newly reported victimisation in year 9 was not significantly associated with prior self report of symptoms of anxiety or depression (1.48, 0.4 to 6.0).
   Conclusion A history of victimisation and poor social relationships predicts the onset of emotional problems in adolescents. Previous recurrent emotional problems are not significantly related to future victimisation. These findings have implications for how seriously the occurrence of victimisation is treated and for the focus of interventions aimed at addressing mental health issues in adolescents.

AB Adolescent mental health service utilization has received increasing attention recently, with epidemiological studies revealing rates of service use that fall far below rates of psychopathology. Our primary aim in this article is to review and integrate current conceptions of the function that parents can serve in obtaining mental health services for adolescents. The review highlights the importance of developing a process-oriented model of service seeking. The initial parental help-seeking steps of gaining awareness of adolescents' distress and identifying specific emotional or behavioral problems receive particular attention. We stress that only by focusing on the role of parents and attending to specific developmental influences can the phenomenon of adolescent mental health service utilization be truly understood.

AB The aim of the study was to provide a standardisation of self-reported competencies and emotional/behavioural problems among Swedish adolescents, using the Youth Self-Report (YSR). The YSR was completed by 2522 adolescents aged 13-18 years, recruited from secondary and upper secondary schools in different regions in Sweden. The results showed that effects of gender and age were small but significant with girls scoring higher than boys on most problem scales, and 15- to 16-year-olds scoring higher than younger and older adolescents on the problem scales. Small effects were also found for residence as well as for parental SES. The correlations between internalising and externalising problems were 0.51 for boys and 0.49 for girls, whereas the correlation between competence and problem scores was low. We conclude that the individual variation in YSR-scores is much greater than can be attributed to factors such as gender, age, SES, or residential area. Consequently, the YSR has the potential to serve as an instrument for assessing individual adolescents' self-reported competencies and problems in Sweden. Given the almost orthogonal relation between self-reported competencies and problems, the competence scale is surprisingly little used in psychopathology research.

AB BACKGROUND. The PedsQL (Pediatric Qualify of Life Inventory) (Children's Hospital and Health Center, San Diego, California) is a modular instrument for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2 to I8. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic care measure to be integrated with fine PedsQL Disease-Specific Modules. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 items applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions.
   METHODS. The 4 PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (Physical, Emotional, Social, School) were administered to 963 children and 1,629 parents (1,677 subjects accrued overall) recruited from pediatric health care settings. Item-level and scale-Level measurement properties were computed.
   RESULTS. Infernal consistency reliability for the Total Scale Score (alpha = 0.88 child, 0.90 parent report), Physical Health Summary Score (alpha = 0.80 child, 0.88 parent), and Psychosocial Health Summary Score (alpha = 0.83 child, 0.86 parent) were acceptable for group comparisons. Validity was demonstrated using the known-groups method, correlations with indicators of morbidity and illness burden, and factor analysis. The PedsQL distinguished between healthy children and pediatric patients with acute or chronic health conditions, was related to indicators of morbidity and illness burden, and displayed a factor-derived solution largely consistent with the a priori conceptually-derived scales.
   CONCLUSION. The results demonstrate the reliabiity and validity of the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Care Scales. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales may be applicable in clinical trials, research, clinical practice, school health settings, and community populations.

AB This article begins with a discussion of attachment theory and childhood depression and the link between the two. Emphasis is placed both on pediatric and parental depression and their associations with attachment difficulties throughout the developmental periods, from infancy through adolescence. This information provides a backdrop for a discussion of family-oriented interventions for depressed young people and their parents that targets the enhancement of attachment relationships in an effort to address the problem of depression. Specific modifications of developmentally informed interventions that address attachment issues within the context of various constellations of family members are presented. These interventions include infant-parent psychotherapy, toddler-parent psychotherapy, other parent-child interaction therapies, variations of the use of play in family therapy, and modifications of interpersonal psychotherapies to be used with adolescents within a family context.

AB The goal of the present study was to examine the relations between different forms of children's nonsocial play behaviors and adjustment in kindergarten. The participants in this study were 77 kindergarten children (38 boys, 39 girls; mean age = 66.16 months, SD = 4.11 months). Mothers completed ratings of child shyness and emotion dysregulation. Children's nonsocial play behaviors (reticent, solitary-passive, solitary-active) were observed during free play. In addition, teachers rated child behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing) and social competence; academic achievement was assessed through child interviews. Results from regression analyses revealed that different types of nonsocial play were differentially associated with child characteristics and indices of adjustment. For some forms of nonsocial play, the nature of these associations differed significantly for boys and girls.

AB This study looks at adolescents' emotion regulation patterns during a joint problem-solving situation with a friend, based on data from a longitudinal study. Specifically concurrent attachment representation, as assessed by the Adult Attachment Interview and earlier infant-father and infant-mother attachment patterns, as assessed by the strange situation procedure are used as predictors. A total of 41 adolescents participated in a complex problem-solving situation with their friends and were videotaped during their work. Emotional expression and cooperative and uncooperative, disruptive behaviour were assessed from the videotapes. Each participant completed an emotion self-rating during the task. The results show that the concordance between the two levels of assessment of emotion relates to attachment representation for the emotions sadness and anger. Depending on the intensity of specific emotions, adolescents with insecure attachment representations showed more disruptive behaviours towards their friend. This was also true for adolescents with insecure infant-father attachment patterns. The findings suggest that attachment organisation in adolescence and infancy influences the balance between autonomous and cooperative problem solving between friends.

AB This Annotation highlights recent research on the role of peer group and friendship factors in the development of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. Several processes are considered. including peer rejection (e.g., exclusion and victimization), social withdrawal and avoidance of peer interaction. and the socialization of deviant behavior and internalizing problems. The mediating influences of several proximal components are examined, including cognitive-perceptual factors and emotion regulation. In addition, the moderating influences of close friendship. age, gender, ethnicity, and group norms are considered. Several promising avenues for future directions in research are highlighted, including the examination of heterogeneity in developmental processes. further investigation of gender-based norms. and the application of multi-level modeling techniques and gene-environment process models.

AB Objective: This study examined behavioral and emotional problems in Chinese adolescents. Method: A sample of 1,694 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years participated in this study in 1997. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Results: For both parent and teacher reports. internalizing syndromes were scored higher in girls and externalizing syndromes were scored higher in boys. Scores on most of the CBCL and TRF subscales were higher for the older adolescents. The overall prevalence rates of parent- and teacher-reported behavioral problems were 23.1% and 19.2%, respectively. The eight cross-informant syndromes were highly comorbid, with a significant association across syndromes (mean odds ratio = 16.1 for CBCL and 22.5 for TRF). Correlations between parent and teacher reports were 0.51 for eight subscales and 0.68 for Total Problems. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that behavioral and emotional problems tend to increase with age and cluster in the same individuals. The prevalence rates of behavioral problems in Chinese adolescents are comparable to those reported in Western countries. In contrast to findings for Western samples, parent reports of behavioral problems were highly correlated with teacher reports.

AB Objective: This review discusses the role of general practitioners and primary care health staff in the assessment, treatment and prevention of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and to consider implications for service delivery.
   Method: Literature review. Papers were selected as having an empirical evidence base or as describing and documenting new initiatives in general practice.
   Results: A small proportion of about 3% of children present to general practice with behavioural or emotional problems, but psychiatric disorders in the context of somatic presentations are considerably more common. They are probably higher than in the general population reflecting an increased tendency by children with disorders to consult. Recognition by general practitioners is limited and few children with disorders are referred to specialist clinics. However, referrals are mostly appropriate: the more severely affected children in difficult psychosocial circumstances. A number of pilot studies have shown the feasibility and potential usefulness of setting up shifted specialist clinics in primary care and of training primary care doctors and other staff in the recognition or management of child mental heath problems.
   Conclusion: Primary care is an appropriate resource to help increase attention to child and adolescent mental health problems. Its potential requires further development and rigorous evaluation. Areas lending themselves to development include: improved medical undergraduate teaching and postgraduate training; suitable information and advice-giving on child mental health problems by the primary care team; the development of specific child and adolescent psychiatric interventions for use in the primary care setting; careful and discriminating development of shifted outpatient clinics for selected child psychiatric disorders; the development of focused protocols for referral to specialist services; further development of mental health promotion clinics in primary care.

AB Objective. The purpose of this study is to detail the natural coping strategies used by children involved in everyday road traffic accidents (RTAs). The relationship between coping strategies, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gender and age was investigated.
   Design. Children aged 7-18 who attended an accident and emergency department following involvement in a RTA were assessed, G weeks after their accident (N = 97). A subgroup of 36 children were re-assessed approximately 8 months after the trauma.
   Methods. The presence of PTSD was determined via a semi-structured interview incorporating the Clinician Administered post-traumatic Scale for Children (CAPS-C). Self-completed psychometric assessments were undertaken to assess the presence of clinically significant levels of depression (Birleson Depression Inventory), anxiety (Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale) and coping style (Kidcope).
   Results. Children involved in RTAs used between 5 and 7 different coping strategies. Younger children and those with PTSD used more strategies than older children and those not suffering from PTSD. Children with PTSD were more likely to use the strategies of distraction, social withdrawal, emotional regulation and blaming others.
   Conclusion. The limitations of Kidcope are discussed and the need to develop more complex ways of assessing childhood coping within a developmental framework highlighted.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological adjustment among immigrant adolescents. The subjects were 170 Russian-speaking adolescents, all born in the former Soviet Union, aged between 12 and 19 years, who immigrated to Finland between 1987 and 1996. According to the results, self-esteem served as ii major mediator between perceived discrimination and psychological adjustment. The adolescents' experiences of parental support influenced their perceptions of discrimination and enhanced their self-esteem, especially among the boys. Adherence to traditional values increased experiences of parental support, and also directly enhanced psychological adjustment. In addition, experiences of paternal support were found to be the most important for the boys, whereas experiences of maternal support were important for the girls.

AB Aims: To examine the influence of psychosocial functioning and dental factors in adolescents with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) versus healthy, subjects. Methods: The TMD sample comprised 63 patients (21 boys and 42 girls, 33% and 67%, respectively, with a mean age of 14.9 years; range 12 to 18 years) and was compared with 64 healthy control subjects (17 boys and 47 girls, 27% and 73%, respectively, with a mean age of 14.8 years). Subjects in the TMD group had to report pain once a week or more and to have a TMD pain diagnosis according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD. Participants were clinically examined and filled out a questionnaire in which self-reported psychosocial functioning was assessed on standardized measures, including the Youth Self-Report (YSR), somatic complaints, and stress. Results: No significant differences were found in dental factors among adolescents in the TMD group compared with those in the control group. Multiple pains in the body and fatigue were significantly more common in the TMD group compared with the control group. Adolescents with TMD also reported significantly higher levels of stress, somatic complaints, and aggressive behavior than their counterparts in the control group. In particular, young adolescents with TMD reported high levels of psychosocial problems. Conclusion: In adolescents with TMD, psychosocial factors such as increased levels of stress, somatic complaints, and emotional problems seem to play a more prominent role than dental factors.

The first sample had observers from the same setting (N = 71); the second sample (N = 182) had observers from different settings with no concurrent observation. Regular and special education teachers and aides completed the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA; McDermott, Marston, & Stott, 1993). Inter- and intraclass correlations were generally significant for both samples, with some exceptions. Substantial interobserver agreement was found for the same-setting sample; however, agreement coefficients were lower for the different-setting sample and some level effects were noted. Overall, interobserver agreement for the ASCA was supported in common settings, but rating variability was evident across classrooms and appears indicative of contextual influences on behavior.

AB Background: Road rage is a concept recently popularised by the press. An association with psychiatric illness is implied from reports of such drivers being "mad". Previous literature has demonstrated a link between road traffic accidents and mental illness. This study examines the relationship between road rage and psychiatric morbidity. It aims to estimate the prevalence of road rage by self-report and elucidate demographic and psychiatric factors associated with road rage. Method: This is a cross-sectional study of attendees at general practice clinics that examines self-reported road rage and psychiatric morbidity. Assessment was based on the total score on the Clinical Interview Schedule (revised version; CIS-R), Aggression Questionnaire, Screening Test for Comorbid Personality Disorders, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test and Life Events Schedule. Results: Fifty-three percent of 131 subjects reported a recent incident of road rage. Perpetrator and victim groups differed from controls. Perpetrators had increased aggression scores and psychiatric morbidity. There was a strong association with male sex and illicit drug use, and a strong negative association with driving experience. A weaker association was found with youth. Victims showed increased psychiatric morbidity and were more likely than perpetrators to seek help for emotional problems. Life events stress, social class, alcohol use and personality disorder had no significant effect. Conclusion: There is an association between road rage and psychiatric morbidity.

AB Recent case reports of individuals with early-onset damage to the prefrontal cortex have suggested that such early insults could result in severely impaired social behaviour in later childhood and adolescence. The investigators speculated that the acquisition of complex social conventions and moral rules had been impaired, In a large cohort of children, we sought to determine whether early focal brain insults might result in clinically significant behavioural or emotional problems. This study reports on 39 children with pre- or perinatal-onset unilateral brain damage (focal lesion) from cerebral infarction or intraparenchymal haemorrhage, using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist to assess the presence or absence of behavioural and emotional difficulties. Two-thirds of the subjects had left hemisphere (LH) lesions and one-third had right hemisphere (RH) lesions, Age range was 4.0-15.4 years at the time of questionnaire completion. Their results were compared with those of 54 control children. Analyses were conducted on focal lesion versus controls, RH versus LH lesion, frontal versus non-frontal lesion, and seizure versus non-seizure groups. When the effect of IQ was partialled out, there were no significant differences on the nine Behavior Problem scales, the Internalizing-Externalizing dichotomy or the Total Problem score for any of the group comparisons. Our subjects showed no evidence of clinically significant behavioural or emotional problems, even when the frontal lobe was involved. Individuals with more extensive and bilateral damage may be at higher risk of significant behavioural and emotional dysfunction than were those in our study population. In future studies of brain-behaviour relationships in developing children, all potential causes for any observed behavioural abnormalities, such as genetic and environmental factors and toxin exposure, must be considered before concluding that specific anatomical lesions are causally related to specific behavioural outcomes.

AB We sought to determine the relationship between emotional competence and willingness to seek help for emotional problems and suicidal ideation. A survey of 300 university undergraduates assessed emotional competence (skill at emotion perception, managing self-relevant emotions, and managing others' emotions), hopelessness, willingness to seek help from health professionals (e.g. counsellor) and nonprofessionals (friends, family), and perceived usefulness of past help-seeking experience. Those who reported feeling less skilled at managing emotions were less willing to seek help from family and friends for both emotional problems and suicidal ideation and less willing to seek help from health professionals for suicidal ideation. These relationships held even after controlling for hopelessness, sex, and past help-seeking experience. Mediational analysis suggested that people low in managing others' emotions were less willing to seek help from professionals because they had had poorer experiences with mental health professionals in the past. There was no significant relationship between emotion perception skill and willingness to seek help. People most likely to be in need of help (those poor at managing emotions) were the least willing to seek it, and if they did seek it, were the least likely to benefit from it.

AB In this research, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to address how school context influences the likelihood of transitioning between stages of cigarette smoking as well as modifies the individual level risk factor of self-regulation. Survey data were collected from 25,186 middle and high school students attending 38 public schools in Kentucky. Results show that students are less Likely to increase use in schools with higher levels of teacher discipline and faculty involvement. The analyses of the multi-level interactions between self-regulation and school context reveal that students possessing low emotional regulation are more likely to initiate experimental smoking in schools with poor levels of discipline and involvement than similar types of students in schools with higher levels of these characteristics. This study illustrates how psychological risk factors for substance use may vary across social environments.

AB Objective: This report describes the development of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI-2), a brief screening measure to identify youths with potential mental, emotional, or behavioral problems at entry points in the juvenile justice system. Method: This 52-item self-report measure, with content relevant to common mental health problems in delinquent populations, was administered to 1,279 male and female youths, aged 12 to 17, in Massachusetts juvenile justice facilities. A subsample of youths also received the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). The instrument was subsequently administered to 3,804 male and female youths in California Youth Authority custody. Results: Factor analyses of the 52 items identified seven scales that were conceptually associated with various mental, emotional, and behavioral problems of youths, which were generally confirmed by separate factor analyses with the California sample. The scales manifested adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Most scales were substantially correlated with conceptually similar scales in the MACI and YSR, and they identified most youths who scored at clinically significant levels on those instruments. Conclusions: The MAYSI-2 shows promise as a reliable and valid screening tool to assist juvenile justice staff in identifying youths who may need an immediate response to mental or emotional problems.

DT Article
AB A translated, shortened version of the Gray-Wilson Personality Questionnaire was administered, along with an abbreviated adult Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, to 251 Russian schoolchildren aged 14-16 years. Girls were significantly higher than boys on passive avoidance, flight, and N, suggesting higher levels of anxiety/emotionality. In accord with British and Japanese results, principal component analysis of individual items largely failed to identify the six theoretical animal learning paradigms on which the GWPQ was constructed. Nor did intercorrelations among scale scores support the a priori three-dimensional structure of the test, instead there was evidence for two major systems under lying reactions to reward and punishment: Inhibition, with strong loadings on passive avoidance, extinction and flight, and Activation, with positive loadings on fight and approach and a negative loading on active avoidance. Correlations with Rutter Teacher scores, the Child Behaviour Checklist and Youth Self-Report are also presented and discussed. As predicted, anxiety and emotional problems wet e associated with Inhibition, while conduct disorder and attention deficits were associated with Activation. Multiple regression analysis showed that GWPQ scores were superior to Scores On this version of the EPQ as predictors of teacher ratings and added significant predictive power to parent and self-report measures of adolescent adjustment.

AB Context Although violence among US youth is a current major concern, bullying is infrequently addressed and no national data on the prevalence of bullying are available.
   Objectives To measure the prevalence of bullying behaviors among US youth and to determine the association of bullying and being bullied with indicators of psychosocial adjustment, including problem behavior, school adjustment, social/emotional adjustment, and parenting.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data from a representative sample of 15686 students in grades 6 through 10 in public and private schools throughout the United States who completed the World Health Organization's Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey during the spring of 1998.
   Main Outcome Measure Self-report of involvement in bullying and being bullied by others.
   Results A total of 29.9% of the sample reported moderate or frequent involvement in bullying, as a bully (13.0%), one who was bullied (10.6%), or both (6.3%). Males were more likely than females to be both perpetrators and targets of bullying. The frequency of bullying was higher among 6th- through 8th-grade students than among 9th- and 10th-grade students. Perpetrating and experiencing bullying were associated with poorer psychosocial adjustment (P<.001); however, different patterns of association occurred among bullies, those bullied, and those who both bullied others and were bullied themselves.
   Conclusions The prevalence of bullying among US youth is substantial. Given the concurrent behavioral and emotional difficulties associated with bullying, as well as the potential long-term negative outcomes for these youth, the issue of bullying merits serious attention, both for future research and preventive intervention.

AB Objectives: To assess the degree to which physicians and nurses working in preventive child health care (child health professionals [CHPs]) identify and manage psychosocial problems in children, and to determine its association with parent-reported behavioral and emotional problems, sociodemographic factors, and general and mental health history of children.
   Design: The CHPs examined the child and interview ed parents and child during their routine health assessments. The parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Setting: Nineteen child health care services across the Netherlands, serving nearly all school-aged children routinely.
   Subjects: Of 4970 children aged 5 through 15 years, eligible for a routine health assessment, 4480 (90.1%) participated.
   Main Outcome Measures: Identification and management of psychosocial problems by CHPs.
   Results: In 25% of all children, CHPs identified 1 or more psychosocial problems. One in 5 identified children were referred for further diagnosis and treatment. Identification of psychosocial problems and subsequent referral were 6 times more likely in children with serious parent-reported problem behavior according to the Child Behavior Checklist total problem score (89;1 of total sample). However, CHPs identified no psychosocial problems in 43% of these children and therefore undertook no action. Other child factors associated with CHPs' identification and referral were past treatment for psychosocial problems, life events, and academic problems. After adjustment for these, sociodemographic characteristics did not predict referral.
   Conclusions: The CHPs identify psychosocial problems in school-aged children frequently and undertake actions for most of them. Screening for psychosocial problems may be a promising option to reduce these problems, but accurate identification should be enhanced.

AB This article briefly describes the current status and limitations of the organ transplant process that has now become a routine medical procedure. The article discusses how transplantation is not a cure for end-stage organ disease but an alternative form of treatment with both potential medical and psychosocial problems. Both transplant candidates and recipients encounter psychosocial problems. The article examines how these psychosocial problems affect transplant patients prior to transplant, immediately following surgery, and posttransplant. The psychosocial problems include psychiatric diagnoses, individual and family adjustment and relationship problems, sexual dysfunction, return-to-work (RTW) difficulties. and compliance problems and variables related to noncompliance. The article also reviews the special problems of pediatric and adolescent transplant recipients. The need for empirically supported interventions is noted in each of the problem areas. The author outlines problems with previous research studies that hamper solid interpretations of the data, and discusses literature suggesting that the psychosocial problems of transplant candidates and recipients are likely to be underreported. The article concludes with recommendations about the need to switch research efforts toward intervention studies in the problem areas already solidly identified by the literature.

AB This study examined the association of low birth weight (LBW) and developmental milestones with behavioral and emotional problems in a general population sample of 3344 Chinese children and adolescents aged 6-16 years in 1997, Parents completed a self-administrated questionnaire including information about birth weight and develop mental milestones (i.e. lifting the head up, tooth eruption, speech, walking and bedwetting cessation), and the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL). Teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) to assess classroom behavior problems. Results indicated that LBW and delayed developmental milestones were significantly associated with an increased risk for almost all parent- and teacher-reported behavioral problems after controlling for the potential effects of child's gender, age and birth order, parental ages at birth, education, occupation, complications at birth and number of children in the family. LBW was significantly associated with delay in achieving all developmental milestones including lifting of the head, tooth eruption, sitting without support, walking without help, speech as saying words with meaning, and bedwetting cessation. It is concluded that LBW and delayed early childhood development may predict the occurrence of a wide range of behavioral and emotional problems in later childhood and adolescence.

AB This study examined gender differences in the effects of menarche in females and voice change in males, specifically with regard to depression, self-esteem, body image, and externalizing problems (i.e., behavioral disturbances). In addition, possible modifying variables (relationship with parents, social-emotional adjustment, level of parental education, and menstrual attitudes) were assessed. Participants were 1,102 Mexican youths aged 9 to 14. Analyses indicated that there were no gender differences among prepubertal youths in depression, body image, or self-esteem, but prepubertal males had more externalizing problems than did premenarcheal females. Females increased in depression, externalizing problems, and negative body image postmenarche, while males showed no change in depression, a trend toward fewer externalizing problems, and felt better about their bodies following voice change. Relationship with parents, social-emotional adjustment, parental education, and menstrual attitudes did not modify the relation between menarche and body image or depression. Based on these findings, suggestions for designing interventions aimed at early adolescent females are presented.

AB This article describes a comprehensive drug abuse preventive intervention called the Early Risers "Skills for Success" Program. Early Risers is an example of an indicated prevention strategy designed to alter the developmental trajectory leading to drug use and abuse in high-risk children as indexed by the presence of early-onset aggressive behavior. An "early-starter" developmental model to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs provides the theoretical underpinnings for selection of the program's child and family intervention targets, Social development and social ecology theories provide the conceptual foundation for content of the major intervention components, CORE and FLEX, respectively. CORE is a coordinated set of standardized child-focused interventions that promote developmental competence by teaching skills pertinent to emotional regulation, prosocial peer affiliation, and school adjustment. This component is delivered within the context of child- and parent-focused education and skills training programs during summer and regular school year periods. The FLEX component is a family support, empowerment, and service-brokerage intervention that is individually tailored in response to the unique assets and needs of individual families. Access to services is organized by home-visiting family advocates who provide consultation, support, and brief interventions to assist families in solving daily hardship and stress-related problems. When more serious basic living and health problems are identified, family advocates broker specialized services with community agencies.

AB Aims: To assess the cognitive, and behavioural and emotional functioning of children aged 3 months to 7 years shortly before elective cardiac surgery or elective interventional catheterisation. Methods. We used the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, to measure cognitive functioning. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess behavioural and emotional problems. Results:. We found no significant differences in mean cognitive scores for children scheduled for cardiac surgery or interventional catheterisation when compared with reference groups. This was also the case for children awaiting cardiac surgery as opposed to those awaiting interventional catheterisation, and for those below as compared to those above the age of 2.5 years. Overall, our results regarding behavioural and emotional functioning were comparable to those of normative reference groups. The only difference found was that the children scheduled for cardiac surgery and aged from 2 to 3 years had significantly higher scores on the Child Behavior Checklist than did peers from normative groups. Conclusion. Cognitive, and behavioural and emotional functioning, both for young children awaiting elective cardiac surgery and interventional catheterisation, can be considered as quite favourable.

AB The introduction of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the end of the 20th century constituted a fundamental change in the way in which families could be created, and by the start of the new millennium an increasing number of children have been (and are being) born as a result of this procedure. This article presents findings of a longitudinal study of the first cohort of children conceived by IVF to reach adolescence. Thirty-four IVF families, 49 adoptive families, and 38 families with a naturally conceived child were compared on standardized interview and questionnaire measures of parent-child relationships and children's psychological well-being. The few differences in parent-child relationships that were identified appeared to be associated with the experience of infertility rather than with IVF per se. The IVF children were found to be functioning well and did not differ from the adoptive or naturally conceived children on any of the assessments of social or emotional adjustment.

AB A developing body of research points to the role of family relationships and interactions as factors relevant to understanding unipolar depressive symptomatology and disorder in adolescents. This paper is focused on examining mechanisms by which adverse family processes may operate to increase adolescents' vulnerability to depression. The review is organized into a description and evaluation of four potential mechanisms by which families may influence adolescents' risk: (a) Stress/Support, (b) Social Interactional, (c) Cognitive, and (d) Affect Regulation. The presentation of the individual mechanisms is followed by a brief discussion of how they could be integrated to develop a fuller understanding of familial processes relevant to the etiology and maintenance of depressive conditions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of overall limitations in the literature and recommendations for future research.

AB Background: To study the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal behaviour among 580 adolescents. Methods: An 8-year longitudinal study included questions about suicidal attempts and thoughts at age 16. Children were evaluated with parent and teacher Rutter scales and self-reported Child Depression Inventory at age 8. At age 16, parents filled in the Child Behaviour Check List and adolescents the Youth Self Report. Results: 14% of girls and 7% of boys reported suicidal thoughts or preoccupations at age 16. Emotional and behavioural problems at age 8, especially antisocial symptoms, reported by parents and teachers and depressive symptoms reported by the child were correlated with suicidal thoughts and behaviour 8 years later. At age 16, internalizing and externalizing problems and low social competence were associated with suicidal features. Only about 20% of those who reported suicidal features had been referred to child mental health services. Conclusions: Many adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviour had a high rate of behavioural and emotional problems already at age 8. Clinical implications: The early school years represent an opportunity for interventions which may prevent self-destructive behaviours in adolescence. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Personality-environment interactions figure prominently in theories of development and psychopathology, yet they have rarely been examined in empirical work. In this study. parenting behaviors, five-factor model personality characteristics, and internalizing and externalizing problems were examined in a community sample of 14- to 21-year-olds (N = 402). A comprehensive sweep of the multivariate space defined by the five-factor model revealed numerous conditional effects for parental behavior in the prediction of problems that varied depending on adolescent personality characteristics. The interactions occurred primarily for males and for aggression and delinquency. Examinations of the interaction patterns provided preliminary answers to questions about the relative frequency of problem-prone child personality types, personality resiliency, and the varying effects of parental behavior.

Cross-sectional and 1-year longitudinal analyses were conducted using data from 230 female and 230 male sixth- and seventh-glade students (50% non-Hispanic white, 27% Hispanic, 22% African American, and 3% other) attending a large ethnically and socioeconomically diverse middle school. Positive perceptions of school climate moderated the negative effects of self-criticism on both internalizing and externalizing problems and of a lack of efficacy on internalizing problems. Youth with high levels of self-criticism did not show expected increases in internalizing and externalizing problems when the perceived a positive e school climate. Results were consistent with the idea that careful attention needs to be given to the social-emotional environment of middle schools, particularly for young adolescents preoccupied with issues of self-definition.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the behavioral and emotional problems of former unaccompanied refugee children who had repatriated to Vietnam from refugee centers in Hong Kong and South East Asia. The children were compared with a matched sample of children who had never left Vietnam.
   Method: The participants consisted of 455 Vietnamese children aged between 10 and 22 years; 238 of the children had formerly resided in refugee camps without their parents. Data were collected using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Cowen Perceived Self-Efficacy scale, a Social Support scale as well as an Exposure to Trauma scale.
   Results: No significant difference was found between the two groups of children on the YSR Total Score. The former refugee children had significantly lower Externalizing scores and failed marginally to report significantly higher Internalizing scores than the local children. The study showed that the perceived self-efficacy, number of social supports and experience of social support did not differ between the two groups of children. Further analysis showed that a significant interaction between the immigration status of the children and the children's subjective perception of their current standard of living explained the differences in the YSR.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the experience of living without parents in a refugee camp does not lead to increased behavioral and emotional problems in the immediate years after repatriation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To test the cross-national generalizability of these relationships, 625 young, South African mothers residing in black townships with different levels of community danger and material hardship rated their 6-year-olds an emotional functioning and behavioral problems. Most mothers were African, employed and of low educational attainment. Community danger was confirmed as a risk factor for anxiety, depression, aggression, opposition and low affability in children. A composite measure of socioeconomic status as indexed by education and job status was unrelated to behavioral and emotional adjustment. However, children experiencing material hardship had fewer problems related to behavioral self-control than children in families with greater access to material resources.

AB Background. Young people suffer from psychiatric symptoms and illness, and the frequency of both may be higher than currently is recognized. The frequency with which young people consult GPs with emotional problems is not established.
   Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify the number of 15-year-olds who consult their GP directly or indirectly with psychiatric symptoms or illness.
   Methods. A two part survey was carried out involving (i) general practice casenote review; and (ii) questionnaires self-report. The subjects comprised all adolescents aged 15 years from 34 randomly selected general practices and a randomly selected subsample of these adolescents. The main outcome measures were a purpose-designed data collection sheet, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and a purpose-designed self-report questionnaire.
   Results. In phase 1, the general practice casenotes of 2359 adolescents were examined. Five per cent of subjects were identified as attending the GP with mental health problems; 1% had attempted suicide during the year. In phase 2, 99 subjects returned completed self-report questionnaires. Although over a quarter (26%) were rated as GHQ-12 'cases' and approximately half reported having felt 'sad, unhappy or low' or 'anxious or worried' in the previous year, on ly one subject reported attending his/her GP with any of these concerns.
   Conclusions. Fifteen-year-olds rarely consult their GP about their emotional well-being, yet, with the GHQ-12, the self-reported rate of psychiatric morbidity was nearly seven times greater than that suggested by these same subjects' medical records. Although the majority of adolescents consult their GP throughout the course of a year, those with mental health problems, including those who attempt suicide, are indistinguishable in the frequency of their GP consultations from adolescents without mental health problems.

AB This study investigated family interaction patterns associated with adolescent depression. Twenty adolescent-mother dyads with clinically depressed adolescents participated in the study. Twenty dyads with externalizing youths and 20 nonclinic dyads were included as controls. Dimensions of autonomy and relatedness were rated during a videotaped mother-adolescent problem-solving task. Adolescent perceptions of parent attachment were also evaluated. Results indicated that depressed adolescents and their mothers did not differ in their behavior compared with nonclinic adolescents. Dyads with externalizing adolescents showed the highest impairment in autonomy and relatedness. Depressed adolescents perceived the quality of their relationships with their parents to be impaired relative to nonclinic dyads, as did externalizing adolescents.

AB Many children suffer an injury to the head at some time, but relatively few of these cause major problems. However, in a few cases the sequelae can be far reaching. This review considers how to evaluate the significance of a head injury. Factors to consider are (1) injury variables: cause, severity and type of injury; (2) child variables: premorbid functioning; age, and developmental level of the child both at injury and at assessment; and (3) the cognitive, behavioural, and emotional problems that may arise. parental beliefs and knowledge about the injury as well as the overall effect of an injury on the family as a whole are also considered.

AB A follow-up study of behavior and emotional problems in a cohort of young people with Williams syndrome 5 years after first assessment is described. Using a between-/within-subjects factorial layout, we compared scores on the Developmental Behaviour Checklist between young people with Williams syndrome and a large epidemiological control sample of young people with mental retardation due to other causes from Time 1 (1990/1991) to Time 2 (1995/1996) Results showed substantial persistence of the overall level of behavior and emotional problems. However, there were changes in certain types of behavior. Participants with Williams syndrome had significantly higher overall behavioral and emotional problems, communication disturbance, and anxiety over the 5-year period. Further, 10 or 13 checklist items maintained significantly higher levels among the Williams syndrome sample.

AB Employing a quasi-experimental design, this study explored the long-term effects of different childrearing ecological contexts. Participants were 131 adolescents (aged 16-18) from four groups: some who lived in a city, some from a kibbutz familial setting, some from a kibbutz communal setting, and a transitional group that included adolescents raised in a communal setting as young children who moved to a familial sleeping arrangement before the age of six. Adolescents' state of mind with regard to attachment and representations regarding separation were examined. Participants were administered the Adult Attachment interview the Separation Anxiety Test, and background questionnaires. The group raised in a communal setting in the kibbutz showed a higher incidence of nonautonomous attachment representations and less competent coping with imagined separations than did the other groups. By contrast, the transitional group was comparable to the city and the kibbutz familial groups. These results are discussed in light of the plasticity and adaptability of children to changed circumstances.

AB The relationship between the quality of early attachment and later psychological adaptation is frequently emphasized. To date, the significance of attachment during infancy and adulthood has been a central focus in the literature, with remarkably little attention being given to adolescence. The aim of this selective review is to introduce and critically consider the key concepts of attachment theory, and to then discuss the relevance of attachment to the period of adolescence. More specifically, an emphasis will he placed upon the importance of early attachment experiences in the development of adolescent psychopathology. Theoretical explanations for this relationship are considered alongside implications for clinical practice and research. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHRONICALLY ILL CHILDREN; CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY;

AB Purpose: There is no brief, global instrument available that specifically measures the psychosocial impact of pediatric epilepsy on the family. An 11-item scale was coated for parents' use to evaluate the influence of epilepsy on the major aspects of their family and child's life. This will be a helpful tool both in the clinical setting and as an outcome measure for research studies.
   Methods: Mothers rated their child's quality of life on a visual analogue scale (1-6) and completed the Impact of Pediatric Epilepsy Scale (IPES), which assesses the impact on academic achievement, participation in activities, health, relationships with family and with peers and siblings, social activities, self-esteem, and the caregiver's hopes for their child's future adapted from the scale developed by Jacoby. External validation was determined by comparison of the IPES with physicians' reports of the characteristics of the child's epilepsy and neurological limitations and parents' ratings on the Family Environment Scale or Parenting Stress Index. In addition, each school-aged child completed the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, Brother-Sister Questionnaire, and Loneliness Scale. Teachers of children completed the Academic Performance Rating Scale. Seven days later, retest reliability of the IPES was evaluated.
   Results: Ninety-seven mothers of children aged 2-16 years completed the IPES and the appropriate family and age-related questionnaires. Internal validation on the IPES yielded a Cronbach's a for the scale of 0.92. A significant Pearson's correlation indicated that total scores were consistent over time (r = 0.81). Spearman's correlations for the individual items were also significant, ranging from 0.48 to 0.78. Significant Spearman's correlations also indicated that quality of life was negatively related to impact on each of the 11 items of psychosocial function. Children with IPES scores above the median differed in some psychosocial aspects from those who scored below. Their parents were more stressed, their siblings were more respectful, they had lower self-esteem, and they experienced more emotional problems. Total impact was also significantly related to seizure frequency, total number of medications taken, number of visits to a physician in the previous year, and number of nights spent in hospital for neurological reasons.
   Conclusions: The IPES is an accurate, acceptable, and quick measurement tool that reflects the way in which childhood epilepsy has an impact on the child and on family life. It may be helpful in routine clinical care and may be useful in thr research setting to find ways to improve the lives of children with epilepsy.

AB Research and theory on behaviour problems in children with intellectual disabilities (IDS) have tended to focus on maintaining variables and present correlates of disorder. The present study focused on potential early correlates of behavioural problems. The parents of 188 children attending schools for those with 'severe learning difficulties' completed the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC), and a questionnaire asking for demographic details and information about present and early correlates (i.e. epilepsy and physical ability, and early developmental progress, early feeding problems and obstetric complications). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to explore whether potential early correlates from infancy could add to the prediction of behaviour problems from established correlates and diagnostic variables. Potential early correlates across all of the DBC domains did not add significantly to the prediction of behaviour problems. However, there were effects of sex, physical ability and diagnostic categories. A number of methodological factors (i.e. poor response rate, focus only on severe ID and retrospective data collection) are discussed in terms of how they impact on the results. However, analyses of large samples such as that reported in the present study may still provide a useful addition to research on the early development of behaviour problems. Such data may help in the identification of children at risk who may benefit from early intervention.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this research was to examine the social, educational, and psychological correlates of weight status in an adolescent population. It was hypothesized that obese adolescents would differ on psychological, social, and educational variables compared with their non-overweight peers:
   Research Methods and Procedures: In this cross-sectional study, a population-based sample of 4742 male and 5201 female public school students in the 7th, 9th, and 11th grades responded anonymously to a classroom administered questionnaire. Body mass index was calculated from self-reported height and weight and categorized into four classes of weight status: underweight (< 15th percentile), average weight (15th to 85th percentile), overweight (>85th to 95th percentile), and obese (> 95th percentile). The questionnaire also included questions about social experiences, psychological well-being, educational experiences, and future goals. Associations of weight status with social, psychological,and educational variables and future goals were explored.
   Results: After adjustment for grade level, race, and parental socioeconomic status, obese girls, when compared with their average weight counterparts, were 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16, 2.30) times less likely to hang out with friends in the last week, 1.49 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.98) times: more likely to report serious emotional problems in the last year, 1.79 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.65) times more likely to report hopelessness, and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.98) times more likely to report a suicide attempt in the last year. Obese girls were also 1.51 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.10) times more likely to report being held back a grade and 2.09 (95% CI: 1.35, 3.24) times more likely to consider themselves poor students compared with average weight girls. Compared with their average weight counterparts, obese boys were 1.91 (95% CI: 1.43, 2.54) times less likely to hang out with friends in the last week, 1.34 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.70) times more likely to feel that their friends do not care about them, 1.38 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.76) times more likely to report having serious problems in the last year, 1.46 (95% CI: 1.05, 0.03) times more likely to consider themselves poor students, and 2.18 (95% CI: 1.45, 3.30) times more likely to expect to quit school. Compared with average weight boys, underweight boys were 1.67 (95% CI: 1.30, 2.13) times more likely to report hanging out with friends in the last week, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.49) times more likely to report disliking school, and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.86) times more likely to consider themselves poor students.
   Discussion: Associations of weight status with social relationships, school experiences, psychological well-being, and some future aspirations were observed. Among girls, the pattern of observations indicates that obese girls reported more adverse social, educational, and psychological correlates. Obese as well as underweight boys also reported some adverse social and educational correlates. These findings contribute to an understanding of how adolescent experiences vary by weight status and suggest social and psychological risks associated with not meeting weight and body shape ideals embedded in the larger culture.

AB In this investigation, fifth- and sixth-grade children (N = 289) completed a measure to assess aspects of their relationships with teachers and bonds with schools. Children and teachers also completed measures related to children's social and emotional adjustment. Analyses of responses to these measures indicated that students with disabilities had greater dissatisfaction with their relationships with teachers, poorer bonds with school, and perceived higher school danger than did students without disabilities. Comparisons involving students who were receiving services for emotional disturbance (ED), learning disabilities (LD), mild mental retardation (MMR), other health impairments (OHI), and no disabilities indicated that students with ED and students with MMR had poorer affiliation with teachers and greater dissatisfaction with teachers than students without disabilities. Students with ED also had poorer bonds with school than did students without disabilities. Students with LD and students with MMR had significantly higher ratings of perceived school danger than did students without disabilities. Results of correlational analyses indicated that student-teacher relationship and school bonding variables were associated with social and emotional adjustment variables for students with and without disabilities.

AB This article assesses the validity of the claim that welfare in itself has deleterious psychological consequences for single mothers. The analysis compares single mothers who are recipients of AFDC with single mothers who are not recipients in terms of their depressive symptoms (as measured by the CES-D) and hopelessness (as measured by Pearlin Mastery Scale). The analysis uses data fi om the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the National Survey of Families and Households. The authors find that higher levels of both depression and hopelessness among welfare recipients can be explained by their material hardship rather than the stigma attached to welfare. They show that AFDC recipients report similar levels of depression and hopelessness as jobless non-recipients as well as low-wage non-recipients. An additional finding is that long-term welfare recipients do not experience greater emotional problems than short-term welfare recipients. Finally, the paper shows that feelings of hopelessness mediate the relationship between material deprivation and psychological distress for both recipients and nonrecipients.

AB Objective: To compare problem behaviour in Turkish immigrant children living in the Netherlands versus problem behaviour in Dutch children from the general population as reported by teachers.
   Method: Teacher's Report Forms (TRF) were filled out by Dutch teachers, and for a subsample also by Turkish immigrant teachers, concerning 524 Turkish immigrant children selected randomly from the immigrant population in two large cities in the Netherlands. TRFs completed for Turkish immigrant children were compared with TRFs filled out for 1625 children selected randomly from the Dutch general population.
   Results: No significant differences were revealed between children from both cultures on the TRF total problems, internalizing, externalizing and specific syndrome scales. Turkish immigrant teachers, however, reported higher total problems, internalizing and anxious/depressed scores for immigrant children than did Dutch teachers for the same immigrant children.
   Conclusion: No significant differences were found in the levels of behavioural and emotional problems reported by Dutch teachers for Turkish immigrant versus Dutch children. However, Turkish immigrant teachers reported high levels of anxiety and depression in immigrant children which go largely undetected by their Dutch teachers.

AB Research has demonstrated that children who experience familial sexual maltreatment are at risk for developing psychological difficulties characterized by emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Surprisingly, however, little attention has been directed toward identifying processes in emotional development that differ in maltreated and nonmaltreated children. From a developmental psychopathology perspective, the present study examined emotion management skills (i.e., emotional understanding, emotion regulation) in 21 sexually maltreated girls and their nonmaltreated peers to determine how the experience of sexual maltreatment may interfere with normative emotional development. Findings indicated that sexually maltreated girls, in comparison to their nonmaltreated peers, demonstrate lower emotional understanding and decreased ability to regulate their emotions in accordance with cultural expectations. Further, maltreated girls expected less emotional support and more relational conflict from parents in response to sadness displays and from parents and peers in response to anger displays. These findings will be discussed from the functionalist approach to emotional development, emphasizing the importance of social context (e.g., maltreating, nonmaltreating) in the development of children's emotion management skills.

AB Aim: This study aimed at establishing the mental health profile among 322 Arab children living in the Gaza strip.
   Method: Children were selected in four age bands, i.e. 3, 6, 1 1 and 16 years of age. The relevant forms of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was completed by parents, teachers and 16-year-olds.
   Results: Factor analyses of the parent-related questionnaires identified similar general factors as in the UK-based studies of validating the SDQ. Certain items did not load as highly on the general factors, i.e. distractability, feeling scared, feeling unhappy, stealing, and being picked or bullied. Emotional problems items were rated differently in the pre-school group (aches, nervousness-clinging, worries) than in previous studies. Using previous optimal cut-off scores, parent SDQs revealed higher rates of children with emotional and conduct problems falling above the 90th centile established in the UK sample, but lower rates according to self-report SDQs by 16-year-olds.
   Conclusions: Western categories of mental health problems did not clearly emerge from the factor analysis. The main difference from western epidemiological studies appeared to operate in parents' perceptions of emotional problems in preschool children. The SDQ is very promising as a screening measure or rating scale in different cultural populations. However, future research should identify and establish indigenously meaningful constructs within this population and culture, and subsequently revise measures of child mental health problems.

AB This study examined associations of life events and locus of control with behavioral problems among 1365 Chinese adolescents by using the Youth Self-Report (YSR), Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Checklist (ASLEC). and the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for Children. Results indicated that the overall prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems was 10.7% (95% CI = 9.9-11.5%). Logistic-regression analyses showed that a total of 13 negative life events mainly coming from academic domain and interpersonal relationships. high life-stress score, and high external locus score significantly increased the risk for behavioral problems. Life stress and locus of control significantly interacted with behavioral problems. These findings support the linkage between stressful life events and psychopathology in a general population of adolescents from mainland China, and demonstrate the stress-moderating effects of locus of control on psychopathology as well.

AB The authors examined how well 394 triads of male youths, caregivers, and teachers agreed about youth problems reported on the Achenbach checklists. Dyadic agreement was measured through difference scores (subtracting the raw score of youth self-report from the caregiver's or teacher's score for shared items), q correlations between pairs of raters across items, and D-2 (generalized distance between item profiles) for both externalizing and internalizing items. Teachers reported fewer internalizing and externalizing problems than did caregivers or youths. Teacher-youth disagreement was higher for African American than European American males about externalizing criteria. Caregiver depression and stress (but not paternal antisocial behavior or maternal substance abuse) correlated with higher disagreement with other informants about all criteria. These factors appear to increase disagreement about the level of problems but not about specific symptom patterns.

The treatment condition (53 children, mean age = 10.5 years) and control condition (53 children, mean age = 10.0 years) were compared with regard to rates of linear and curvilinear change for psychopathology, adaptive functioning, and consumer satisfaction. Although both conditions showed curvilinear as well as linear improvement in behavioral and emotional problems, relatively little support was found for the effectiveness of traditional child psychotherapy or for the presence of a psychotherapy "sleeper effect."

AB This article reports on the Adolescent Unresolved Attachment Questionnaire (AUAQ), a brief questionnaire that assesses the caregiving experiences of unresolved adolescents (as recipients of caregiving). The AUAQ was developed and validated in a large normative sample (n = 691) and a sample of 133 adolescents in psychiatric treatment. It is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 3 scales with Likert-type responses ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The Aloneness/Failed Protection Scale assesses the adolescent's perception of the care provided by the attachment figure. The Fear Scale taps the fear generated by the adolescent's appraisal of failed attachment figure care. The Anger/Dysregulation Scale assesses negative affective responses to the perceived lack of care from the attachment figure. All scales demonstrated satisfactory internal reliability and agreement between scores for adolescents (n = 91) from the normative sample who completed the AUAQ twice. Adolescents in the clinical sample also completed the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; C. George, N. Kaplan, & M. Main, 1984/1985/1996); the AUAQ demonstrated high convergent validity with the AAI.

AB Based on research noting the importance of sibling relationships throughout the lifespan and grounded in basic research on attitudes structure, a self-report instrument called the Lifespan Sibling Relationship Scale (LSRS) was developed. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the LSRS. A sample of 711 participants completed the LSRS, which measures three dimensions of the sibling relationship in childhood and adulthood: frequency and positivity of behavior toward the sibling, affect toward the sibling, and beliefs about the sibling and the sibling relationship. Results suggested that the LSRS possesses good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency of all six subscales and the total instrument, as well as evidence supporting a coherent factor structure and stability of responses over time. Significant correlations with social support, overall relationship satisfaction, closeness of the sibling relationship, the degree to which the sibling served as a role model, and a measure of various sibling relationship qualities supported the construct validity of the LSRS. Lack of correlations between the LSRS, social desirability, and theoretically unrelated scales demonstrated discriminant validity. Correlations with personality traits and psychological well-being indicated that satisfactory sibling relationships were associated with emotional adjustment. The utility of the LSRS for use in future research is discussed.

AB Objective: To estimate the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis and to examine associations between nocturnal urinary control or enuresis and behavioral problems in Chinese children. Method: A community sample of 3,600 children aged 6 through 16 years was drawn from Shandong Province of China in 1997; 3,344 (93%) returned completed questionnaires. The Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher's Report Form were used to measure children's behavioral problems. Results: The proportion of children attaining nocturnal urinary control before age 2 was 7.7%; by age 3, this had increased to 53.1%, and by age 5 to 93%. The overall prevalence of nocturnal enuresis was 4.3%, with a significantly higher prevalence in boys than girls. There was no significant decrease in the prevalence of enuresis between 6 and 16 years of age. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that attaining nocturnal urinary control after age 4 and current enuresis were significantly associated with an increased risk of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems. Conclusions: Chinese children attain nocturnal urinary control earlier than Western children. The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is low but fairly stable in children between 6 and 16 years. The findings support the link between nocturnal enuresis and psychopathology in children and adolescents.

AB This study explored the relationships between perceived family processes (parental bonding: and parental discipline styles) and adolescent emotional and behavioural adjustment among a sample of youth. Respondents were 92 (53 female, 39 male) high school students, aged 13-17 years. Significant sex differences were noted regarding levels of self-reported delinquency and parental induction style. After controlling for sex, perceptions of low care and love withdrawal were significantly related to delinquency, while low care, overprotectiveness and love withdrawal were found to be related to poor well being. Structural equation modelling was used to further assess the relationships between perceptions of family life and the outcome variables. It was concluded that adolescent perceptions of family processes form a coherent and integrated network with implications for behavioural and emotional adjustment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID UNITED-STATES; PREVALENCE
AB Purpose: To study the health status and risk behavior in an adolescent population of Madrid, Spain.
   Methods: An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was completed by 2831 pupils aged 14-20 years from urban, suburban, and rural populations in the north of Madrid. A large number of questions were from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey questionnaire, which included sociodemographics, health status, drug use, sexual practices, suicidal thoughts, emotional problems, and injury risk. Student's t-test, analysis of variance, and Chi-square statistics are used for analyzing associations between the different variables.
   Results: A majority (80%) of students thought they are in good or very good health (better for males than females); 18.3% had had intercourse, the average age of the first intercourse was 15.4 years +/- 1.68 SD for males and 16.1 years +/- 1.46 SD for females. Most (73%) had used some kind of contraception. Eighty-five percent had tried alcohol, and regular use (frequently or every day) was as high as 24%. Males drank more than females (28% vs. 20%); 58.2% of the population drink only during weekends, the percentage increasing with age. Seventy percent of the sample had smoked at least once; 34.5% reported regular tobacco use and this increased with age. Males smoked less than females (27% vs. 42%); 3.2% smoked more than 20 cigarettes/day. The consumption of illegal drugs was very low (20% had tasted cannabis and use by males was higher). Cocaine, heroin, etc, were used by less than 5%.
   Conclusion: In general, our adolescents are in good health with most problems being preventable. Sexual activity was lower than in other European and American countries. The consumption of tobacco and alcohol started early and in general was high. Our study confirms the relationship among different health-compromising behaviors. There is a need to implement health promotion and preventive programs for adolescents. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2000.

AB There is extensive evidence of the adverse effects of domestic violence across all age groups and cultural backgrounds.
   The impact of domestic violence may be long-term, affecting emotional adjustment, physical health and subsequent relationships.
   Health professionals should be aware of the confounding effect of youth, age and cultural diversity on presentation.
   Shame and isolation militate against disclosure.
   Specific, sensitive questioning that incorporates awareness of cultural and social issues is essential to detect domestic violence and initiate appropriate assistance.

AB The study asked how well Achenbach's 8-factor cross-informant model for the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach, 1991a, 1991b, 1991c) fits clinic data in the USA, Holland, and Australia. DeGroot et al.'s Dutch 8-factor model (DeGroot, Koot, & Verhulst 1994) was also tested for its cross-cultural generalizability. Achenbach's matched clinical sample data (N = 21 10) were analyzed and contrasted with the previously reported Dutch findings (N = 2335), as well as a new data set collected on clinic referred children and adolescents in Australia (N = 2237). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the Dutch as much as the American model in the USA, Holland, and Australia. Although about 90% of items showed convergent validity across models and countries, the attention and especially the social problems factor found least support. Most double loadings in the current models were not upheld. Instead, additional analyses discovered a number of unmodelled loadings including many cross-loadings. This led to the redefinition of the social problems factor as a mean aggression factor (with associated social problems) whereas the original aggression factor focuses on emotional acting out and the delinquent factor describes an evasive, covert type of antisocial behavior. Overall most support was obtained for the withdrawn, somatic, anxious/depressed, thought problems, and aggressive factors.

AB Despite recent suggestions that depression can be conceptualized as a disorder of affect regulation, relatively little research has focused on affect regulation skills in depressed individuals. This paper investigated whether depressed adolescents (N = 25) differ from nondepressed adolescents (N = 25) on two indices of affect regulation (i.e., duration of negative affective states and reciprocity of maternal negative affect) as well as whether these indices are related to microsocial family interactional processes. Analyses revealed that depressed teens differed from their nondepressed peers with regard to duration of negative affective states but not in their likelihood of reciprocating negative affect. Additionally, indices of adolescent affect regulation were related to family interactional processes. Duration of depressive affect was positively associated with maternal display of facilitative behavior contingent on adolescent depressive behavior. Duration of aggressive behavior was inversely related to maternal problem-solving responses to aggressive behavior. Finally, adolescent reciprocity of maternal depressive and aggressive behaviors was strongly associated with mothers' reciprocity of adolescents' negative affective behavior.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the moderating role of individual differences in negative emotionality in the relations of behavioral and attentional (emotional) regulation to externalizing problem behaviors. Teachers' and one parent's reports of children's regulation (attentional and behavioral), emotionality, and problem behavior were obtained when children were in kindergarten to grade 3 and two years later (N = 169; 146 in major analyses); children's behavioral regulation also was assessed with a measure of persistence. According to the best fitting structural equation model, at two ages behavioral dysregulation predicted externalizing behavior problems for children both high and low in negative emotionality, whereas prediction of problem behavior from attentional control was significant only for children prone to negative emotionality. There were unique, additive effects of behavioral and attentional regulation for predicting problem behavior as well as moderating effects of negative emotionality for attentional regulation.

AB The Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) was used to compare a sample of 103 Danish children of alcoholics (CoA) to a Danish population-based sample (N = 780). The CoA had a significantly greater incidence of symptoms on 17 of the 118 CBCL items. Compared to the reference population, daughters of alcoholics were more impaired than sons of alcoholics on most CBCL measures. In families with maternal alcoholism daughters had higher internalising and depression scores than sons, and in families with paternal alcoholism, sons had higher internalising and depression scores than daughters. The CoA also had a significantly greater risk of scoring above the 95th percentile on internalising behaviour, depression symptoms and socially deviant behaviour. On all CBCL dimensions, almost half of the CoA samples functioned as well as the average of the reference population. The results from this study suggest that CoA should be regarded as a risk group but with very heterogeneous consequences in response to parental alcoholism.

AB A sample of children, initially 12 years old, in the People's Republic of China participated in this 2-year longitudinal study. Data on parental warmth, control, and indulgence were collected from children's self-reports. Information concerning social, academic, and psychological adjustment was obtained from multiple sources. The results indicated that parenting styles might be a function of child gender and change with age. Regression analyses revealed that parenting styles of fathers and mothers predicted different outcomes. Whereas maternal warmth had significant contributions to the prediction of emotional adjustment, paternal warmth significantly predicted later social and school achievement. It was also found that paternal, but not maternal, indulgence significantly predicted children's adjustment difficulties. The contributions of the parenting variables might be moderated by the child's initial conditions.

AB Objective: To examine factors that influence emotional adjustment, adherence to diabetic care, and glycemic control in Hong Kong youths with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).
   Methods: Seventy youths, their mothers, and matched controls provided information on health beliefs, authoritarian parenting style, parent-child conflict, emotional adjustment, and adherence to medical regimen. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels were obtained to measure glycemic control.
   Results: Predictors explained 34% of the variance in emotional adjustment and 39% of the variance in glycemic control. The data supported a pathway from emotional adjustment to self-efficacy to adherence behaviors to glycemic control. In contrast to Western culture and consistent with prediction, parenting style did not associate with negative outcomes, and even relatively low levels of parent-child conflict correlated negatively with emotional adjustment in this culture.
   Conclusions: Management of conflict and self-efficacy enhancing interactions are suggested interventions to enhance adherence to diabetic care in Hong Kong youths with IDDM.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine aspects of children's social and contextual experience in schools. Children (N = 289) in elementary schools completed a measure designed to assess qualities of their relationships with teachers as well as their perceptions of school environments. Students were then grouped into categories based on these perceptions and comparisons were made between groups on measures of social and emotional adjustment. Findings indicated that student classifications resembled classifications reported by other researchers for student-teacher relationships. Students classified as having poor relationships with teachers and poor bonds with school had poorer scores on self- and teacher ratings of social and emotional adjustment than children classified as having positive relationships and bonds. These findings add to a growing body of research focused on understanding children's social and contextual experience in schools by providing a descriptive typology that could be used by researchers and practitioners interested in identifying students who are having nonoptimal experiences in school settings.

AB Objective: To compare parentally bereaved children with a disaster comparison group and a nontrauma control group on measures of emotional adjustment. Method: Children and adolescents who had lost a parent (n = 39), had experienced a tornado disaster (n = 69), or were coping with an ongoing social or academic stressor (n = 118) completed measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, anxiety, and depression. Risk factors for symptoms among the bereaved children also were evaluated. Results: Parentally bereaved children reported significantly more PTSD symptoms than the disaster and nontrauma control groups. Among the bereaved children, girls, younger children, and children living with a surviving parent who scored high on a measure of posttraumatic stress reported more symptoms. Conclusion: Children and adolescents who have lost a parent could be vulnerable to PTSD symptoms.

AB A number of recent studies have shown avoidant coping to be related with diverse types of somatic and mental pathology, In order to investigate the relevance of coping for both psychological and somatic problems in delinquent subjects, 185 boys from juvenile correction and 96 boys from secondary schools in Arkhangelsk, Northern Russia, were assessed by means of the Coping Scale for Children and Youth, the Youth Self-Report and the Giessen Subjective Complaints List - youth form, The results from the delinquent subjects partly confirmed previous findings on the dominant role of behavioural avoidance in the relationships between coping styles and both behavior/emotional problems and somatic complaints.

TI Australian adolescents' explanations of juvenile delinquency
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LAY THEORIES; CRIME; ATTRIBUTIONS; PERSONALITY
AB Research suggests that lay people invoke a multiplicity of causes to explain crime and juvenile offending. The extent to which the different explanations are endorsed appears to be partly a function of demographic characteristics. Abrams, Simpson, and Hogg (1987) suggested that those who are in psychological proximity to delinquency are more likely to invoke situational type explanations for juvenile offending rather than dispositional ones. This study tests this proximity hypothesis and provides information on Australian adolescents' explanations of juvenile delinquency. A total of 3,171 secondary school pupils from 25 state high schools in New South Wales rated 39 explanations for juvenile offending on a Likert scale. Principal component analysis and a varimax rotation of the responses identified six factors: home environment, emotional adjustment, social control, impulsivity, innate, and social alienation. Analysis of the scores on these factors showed that there was some support for the proximity hypothesis.

AB This study reports a cross-sectional investigation of the relation between community violence exposure and peer group social maladjustment in 285 inner-city children in Grades 4-6 (mean age = 10.3 years). Children completed an inventory assessing exposure to community violence through witnessing and through direct victimization. A peer nomination inventory was then administered to assess social adjustment with peers (aggression, peer rejection, and bullying by peers). In addition, social-cognitive biases and emotion regulation capacities were examined as potential mediators. Analyses indicated that violent victimization was associated with negative social outcomes through the mediation of emotion dysregulation. Witnessed violence was linked only to aggressive behavior. Social information processing, rather than emotion dysregulation, appeared to mediate this association. These results demonstrate that violence exposure is Linked to multiple levels of behavioral and social maladjustment and suggest that there are distinct patterns of risk associated with different forms of exposure.

Patterns of coping-strategy use were found to be similar across the various stressors, with wishful thinking, problem-solving, and emotional regulation being among those most frequently used. Older adolescents, compared to younger children, tended to use a broader range of coping strategies, regardless of stressor. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

ID REPORTED PROBLEM BEHAVIORS; FOLLOW-UP
AB Background For children referred to mental health services future functioning may be hampered.
   Aims To examine stability and prediction of behavioural and emotional problems from childhood into adulthood.
   Method A referred sample (n=789) aged 4-18 years was followed up after a mean of 10.5 years. Scores derived from the Child Behavior Checklist,Youth Self-Report and Teacher Report Form were related to equivalent scores for young adults from the Young Adult Self-Report and Young Adult Behavior Checklist.
   Results Correlations between first contact (TI) and follow-up (T2) scores were 0.12-0.53. Young adult psychopathology was predicted by corresponding Tl problem scores. Social problems and anxious/depressed scores were predictors of general problem behaviour.
   Conclusions Problem behaviour of children and adolescents referred to out-patient mental health services is highly predictive of similar problem behaviour at young adulthood. Stability is higher for externalising than for internalising behaviour and for intra-informant than for inter-informant information. Stabilities are similar across gender. To obtain a comprehensive picture of the young adult's functioning, information from related adults may prove valuable.

DE attachment style; illness behaviours; affect regulation
ID SOCIAL SUPPORT; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; STRESS; PERSPECTIVE; SAMPLES; QUALITY;
   LOVE
AB There is substantial evidence that health status and health outcomes are related to the availability and quality of personal relationships. The proposition that attachment relationships in childhood and adolescence have health-related implications fits within this research tradition, and has guided recent attempts to develop models linking attachment style with emotional regulation, coping mechanisms, and illness behaviours. The present paper discusses these theoretical models, together with relevant empirical findings. It is argued that measures of attachment security are related to symptom-reporting, health-care utilization, and restriction of normal activities, and that these links can be explained, in part, by individual differences in emotional and behavioural responses to stress. It is further noted that researchers have proposed physiological and biochemical pathways which may explain some of the effects of attachment style on physical health. The quality of parent-child attachment also predicts family responses to children's illness, as reflected in parents' visitation rates and in family participation in studies of health and illness. The implications of the findings for research and for practice in the health professions are briefly discussed.

AB This study investigated the effects of acculturation on the psychological well-being of immigrant adolescents. The respondents were 11 to 20 years old, originally from the former Soviet Union, Turkey, Somalia, and Vietnam, and now living in Finland (N = 588). To gain an understanding of the complexity and specificity of the relationship between acculturation and psychological well-being, a large range of existing psychological well-being scales measuring acculturative stress, behavioral problems, self-esteem, life satisfaction and sense of mastery were used as dependent variables. Most indices of psychological well-being were clearly and negatively related to perceived discrimination, and some of them were also positively related to second-language proficiency In addition, the adolescents' experiences of parental support and adherence to traditional family-related values promoted their psychological well-being. However the impact of this adherence was found to depend on both the specific aspect of well-being measured and the specific family-related values in question.

AB Even early-treated patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. This study was performed to determine whether emotional and behavioural problems are specific in phenylketonurics and whether they depend on the quality of biochemical control. This comparative study covered 42 PKU patients aged 10-18 years (mean 14.7 years) and 42 diabetic patients matched for sex, age and socioeconomic status. Patients' groups were compared with a control sample of healthy controls (n = 2900) from an epidemiological study. We used the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) according to Achenbach, intelligence quotient (IQ) test according to Weiss, and monitoring of blood phenylalanine concentrations and HBA1 concentrations. Internalizing problems such as depressive mood, anxiety, physical complaints or social isolation were significantly elevated in both phenylketonuric and diabetic patients, whereas externalizing problems were not. The two patient groups did not differ significantly either in the degree or in the pattern of their psychological profile. In both groups no significant correlations could be computed between the psychological characteristics and the biochemical control, the IQ, and the socioeconomic status. No patient was undergoing psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy. Our results strongly support a psychological perspective for the development of behavioural and emotional problems in both phenylketonuric and diabetic patients. Thus, medical treatment should be accompanied by psychological support for the families.

AB Objective: To test the 14-year continuity and change of behavioral and emotional problems from childhood into adulthood. Method: For 1,615 children and adolescents aged 4 to 16 years from the general population, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at initial assessment. At follow-up 14 years later, subjects completed the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR), and their parents completed the Young Adult Behavior Checklist (YABCL). Results: Of the subjects who were initially classified as deviant, 14 years later 41% were classified as deviant according to their YABCL Total Problem score, and 29% according to their YASR Total Problem score. Intrainformant (CBCL/YABCL) Withdrawn, Social Problems, Delinquent Behavior. and Aggressive Behavior scores, and cross-informant (CBCL/YASR) Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, and Delinquent Behavior scores were independent predictors of general levels of problem behavior. Conclusions: Childhood and adolescent problems persisted to a considerable degree into adulthood, although the majority of children who were deviant at initial assessment could not be regarded as deviant 14 years later. Children who were adolescents at initial assessment (12-16 years) showed higher stability of problem behaviors than subjects who were children at initial assessment (4-11 years).

ID CHILDREN
AB Twentyeight 10- to 14years old boys from divorced families (separation of the parents was two years before the investigation) were compared with 26 10- to 14years old boys from two-parent families on the basis of interviews about attachment related themes and daily situations, and by means of the California Child Q-Sort (CCQ). The interviews were analyzed with regard to coherence of language, emotional problems, reflectivity supportive representation of their parents, verbal and nonverbal emotional openness and social network, as well as for personality variables. The boys of the divorced group did barely talk about relations, had problems in coping with emotional stress, and were less reflective about themselves and others. They felt insufficiently supported by their parents and did not show their emotions openly. They talked about themselves as dependent from their social environment and as less adaptive to new situations. These indications suggest an insecure attachment representation predominantly as a result of the parents' behavior leading to divorce (Table 1). The results show that separations and family disruptions, as a group effect, strongly affect pre-adolescent boys' state of mind. A minority of boys from the parental divorce group, however, show secure mental representations, comparable to a majority in the control group. Tables 2-5 show, independent of parental divorce, the major differences between boys with secure and boys with insecure mental representations.

AB Background: Understanding factors that contribute to high suicide risk holds important implications for prevention. We aimed to examine the sociodemographic and medical predictors of attempted suicide (severe enough to require hospitalization) and of completed suicide in a large population-based sample from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in northern California, USA. Method: We designed a cohort study, including 87,257 women and 70,570 men aged 15 through 89 years old at baseline (in 1977-1985) with follow-up for hospitalizations and mortality through the end of 1993. Results: After a median of 10 years, 169 first hospitalizations for attempted suicide (111 among women, 58 among men) and 319 completed suicides (101 among women, 218 among men) were identified. There was a greater incidence of hospitalization for suicide attempt in women than in men and, conversely, a greater incidence of completed suicide in men than in women. The predominant methods of attempted and completed suicides were ingestion of psychotropic agents and use of firearms, respectively. In gender-specific multivariate analysis of hospitalization for suicide attempt, statistically significant associations were seen for age 15-24 years (women), 65-89 years (men), white race (women), 12th grade or less education (both genders), technical/business school education (men), never being married (men), history of emotional problems (both genders), history of family problems (women), history of job problems (men) and presence of one or more comorbidities (men). The independent predictors of completed suicide were: age 15-24 years (both genders), Asian race (women), Caucasian race (both genders), never being married (both genders), being separated/divorced (women), prior inpatient hospitalization for suicide attempt (both genders) and history of emotional problems (both genders). Conclusion: These findings could help health professionals be more effective in the prevention of suicide morbidity and mortality.

AB This study investigated the relationship of emotional disturbance and pre- and postmigration environment to the scholastic achievement of adolescent refugees of very different cultural backgrounds. One hundred fifty-two Central American and Cambodian students in six Canadian high schools, as well as their parents, were interviewed to assess the students' emotional problems (using the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist) and to determine the pre- and postmigration family environment. The findings indicated that the relationship between the emotional problems and scholastic achievement of teenaged refugees was tenuous. It was concluded that a connection between young refugees' symptomatology and their functional capacity should not be assumed. Nonetheless, certain pre- and postmigration variables, particularly trauma experienced in the homeland, seem to be associated with the academic achievement of some refugees.

AB In a sample of 2918 adolescents aged 12 to 24 years, the relation between parental and friends' social support was studied specifically with regard to emotional problems. In addition, age and sex differences were examined. Results indicated that parental and friends' support seem to be relatively independent support systems. Although the degree of perceived support changes in the expected direction (with parental support decreasing and friends' support increasing) during early adolescence, parental support remains the best indicator of emotional problems during adolescence, The effect of friends' support appeared to depend slightly on the level of perceived parental support, with the high parental support group showing a slightly positive effect of friends' support, and the low parental support group showing a negative effect of friends' support.

AB A sample of 6th-grade children (N = 470), initially aged 12 years, in Shanghai, People's Republic of China, participated in this longitudinal study. Data on children's sociability and prosocial orientation were collected from peer assessments. Information on indexes of adjustment was obtained from multiple sources. The results indicated that sociable and prosocial functions were 2 overlapping, but distinct, dimensions of social competence and had common as well as unique contributions to the prediction of adjustment in specific areas. Whereas prosocial orientation was mainly predictive of social and school adjustment and externalizing problems, sociability uniquely contributed to the prediction of internalizing problems and emotional adjustment. Finally, prosocial orientation and sociability might moderate the development of adjustment difficulties.

AB Psychotherapeutic intentions with children have not been as successful in practice as laboratory studies suggest. Two weaknesses frequent cited include the failure of treatment gains to generalize to other times and settings and the lack of individualization Although social skills interventions have inherent appeal and appear appropriate to address many of the social and emotional problems encountered by children and youth, they have not demonstrated effectiveness despite their widespread use. This article outlines four steps to improve social skills interventions that take advantage of the unique environments of schools and increase the likelihood that social skills interventions can achieve individualization and generalization.

ID POPULATION PREVALENCE; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB Background For several decades. researchers and clinicians have been aware of an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorder in children with intellectual disability. However, there are few research studies Exploring this issue.
   Methods The parents of 123 children attending schools for children with 'severe learning difficulties' completed the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) in order to identify those children with clinically significant behavioural and emotional problems. Comparisons were made with norms for the DBC and a range of child variables were investigated as possible correlates of disorder.
   Results Some 50.4% of the children scored above the cut-off on the DBC for psychiatric disorder. The child's severity of physical disability was related most strongly to parental ratings of behavioural and emotional problems. There were also effects for the child's age and the absence of Down's syndrome.
   Conclusions The present study confirms previous research findings of a high prevalence of behavioural and emotional difficulties amongst children with intellectual disability, and identifies a number of correlates of disorder which require further investigation.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of epilepsy in psychopathology among an epidemiological sample of young people with intellectual disability (ID), The study also compared behavioural and emotional problems in young people on medication to control their epilepsy with those not on medication, and young people with epilepsy who were having current seizure activity with those with no current seizure activity.
   Methodology: An epidemiological cohort of 392 participants. representative of the general Australian population of young people with ID, were used in the study. One hundred and fifteen individuals from this cohort were identified as suffering from epilepsy. The Developmental Behaviour Checklist was used to measure symptoms of behavioural and emotional disturbance.
   Results: Results confirmed that young people with ID and epilepsy did not differ from controls without epilepsy on measures of psychopathology. Furthermore, those with epilepsy on medication had no difference in levels of problem behaviours than epileptics not on medication.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that epilepsy has little or no influence on problem behaviours for young people with ID. Our attempt to understand the pathogenesis of behaviour problems in persons with 1D may be better directed towards understanding genetic mechanisms than epilepsy pathologies.

SO COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Researchers are currently applying dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), originally developed for adult chronically parasuicidal women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), to a suicidal adolescent population diagnosed with BPD or borderline features. The four characteristic problem areas often found among these multiproblem patients are (a) confusion about self, (b) impulsivity, (c) emotional instability, and (d) interpersonal problems. DBT employs four corresponding behavioral skills modules aimed at increasing adaptive behaviors while simultaneously reducing maladaptive behaviors, The four skill modules include mindfulness skills, distress tolerance skills, emotion-regulation skills, and interpersonal effectiveness skills. The present study examines adolescent self-report of the helpfulness and overall effectiveness of these skills by using pre- and posttreatment evaluations. Consistent with prior research of DBT with adolescents, this study found significant reductions in BPD symptoms in all four problem areas, The four most highly rated skills included distress tolerance and mindfulness skills. Relationships found between the helpfulness of specific skills and improvement in particular problem areas are described. Lastly, implications for future research of DBT skill comprehension and application among adolescents are discussed.

AB Thirteen children and adolescents with diagnoses of Asperger syndrome (AS) were matched with 13 nonautistic control children on chronological age and verbal IQ. They were tested on their ability to recognize simple facial emotions, as well as facial emotions paired with matching, mismatching, or irrelevant verbal labels. There were no differences between the groups at recognizing simple emotions but the Asperger group performed significantly worse than the control group at recognizing emotions when faces were paired with mismatching words (but not with matching or irrelevant words). The results suggest that there are qualitative differences from nonclinical populations in how children with AS process facial expressions. When presented with a more demanding affective processing task, individuals with AS showed a bias towards visual-verbal over visual-affective information (i.e.? words over faces). Thus, children with AS may be utilizing compensatory strategies, such as verbal mediation, to process facial expressions of emotion.

AB Objective: To evaluate outcome and follow-up of 55 subjects who attended a classroom-based, adolescent psychiatric day treatment unit school program (ADTU) situated in a community high school by examining pre-post changes in emotional, behavioral, family, and academic functioning and to identify preadmission and family variables associated with outcome. Method: Student-patients were assessed on clinical/academic variables at admission, discharge, and follow-up, using standardized assessment measures. Patient satisfaction was also evaluated. Results: Significant improvements in emotional-behavioral and academic functioning were found at discharge and follow-up. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that parent and clinician ratings at admission, total number of separations from family greater than 3 months, parental history of mental illness, and patient history of treatment for emotional problems were significantly associated with outcome. Satisfaction questionnaires revealed a high degree of satisfaction with the program. Conclusions: The ADTU is a successful treatment program for adolescents with chronic, severe emotional and behavioral disorders, despite limitations of the study.

AB Objective: To investigate competence and behavioral/emotional problems among nonreferred adolescents in Taiwan, using a Chinese version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-C) and the Teacher's Report Form (TRF-C). The psychometric properties of these instruments and cross-cultural differences were also examined. Method: Parents of 854 junior high school students aged 12 to 16 years in Taipei, Taiwan, were asked to complete the CBCL-G. Among these students, 162 had their teachers' ratings on the TRF-C. Results: The internal consistency and 1-month test-retest reliability were satisfactory for both the CBCL-C and TRF-C, which were moderately correlated. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis provided same support for the validity of Achenbach's cross-informant model. Parents' reports showed that compared with their American counterparts, Taiwanese adolescents tended to have lower scores on most competence scales, higher scores on scales that reflect covert behavior problems, and lower scores on scales that reflect more overt behavior problems; However, teachers' reports showed no significant differences on most competence and behavior problem scales. Conclusion: The CBCL-C and TRF-C are useful tools for assessing the mental health status of Taiwanese adolescents. The cross-cultural differences in adolescent behavior problems are discussed.

ID SCREEN
AB 61 children, aged between 14 and 18 years, completed the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, a scale of anxiety disorders symptoms, and the Youth Self-report, a measure of internalizing, i.e., emotional, and externalizing, i.e., behavioral, problems. Analysis showed that, with the exception of the Social Phobia and the Specific Phobia subscales, Screen total and subscale scores were significantly related to Internalizing problems (rs between .40 and .77). Thus, the more frequently children reported Anxiety Disorder symptoms, the more often they reported emotional problems. Furthermore, in particular, anxious-depressed problems as measured by the Youth Self-report were significantly associated with scores on Screen scales. These results further support the concurrent validity of the Screen.

AB The relative contributions of aggression and victimization to the prediction of self-reported emotional and behavioral difficulties over and above self-reported prior problems were investigated in a 1-year longitudinal study. Fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders (N = 171) completed peer nominations of aggression and victimization as well as self-report measures of social, behavioral, and emotional problems at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Peer aggression added to the prediction of externalizing problems, specifically, self-report of aggression and delinquency. In contrast, victimization by peers contributed to self-reported unpopularity but not depression. Victimization among girls was also predictive of subsequent self-reported delinquency. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings, as well as future directions for research, are discussed. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Research and theory on the role of emotion and regulation in morality have received considerable attention in the last decade. Much relevant work has concerned the role of moral emotions in moral behavior. Research on differences between embarrassment, guilt, and shame and their relations to moral behavior is reviewed, as is research on the association of these emotions with negative emotionality and regulation.
   Recent issues concerning the role of such empathy-related responses as sympathy and personal distress to prosocial and antisocial behavior are discussed, as is the relation of empathy-related responding to situational and dispositional emotionality and regulation. The development and socialization of guilt, shame, and empathy also are discussed briefly. In addition, the role of nonmoral emotions (e.g. anger and sadness), including moods and dispositional differences in negative emotionality and its regulation, in morally relevant behavior, is reviewed.

AB Objective: Examine behavioral adjustment and emotion regulation among 6-year-old children with asthma and a group of healthy controls.
   Method: Subjects were 81 children with asthma and 22 healthy controls. Asthma and allergy statuses were confirmed by objective measures. Emotional and behavioral functioning were assessed through parent report, child interview, and child participation in an emotional regulation paradigm.
   Results: Maternal report revealed more internalizing and total behavior problems for children with asthma compared to controls. Child interview and behavioral observations of emotion regulation yielded no differences between groups. Severity of asthma was related to increased emotional difficulties by clinician interview and observation but not by maternal report.
   Conclusions: Two groups of children with asthma who have psychological difficulties include those with increased anxiety and those with poor emotion regulation and more asthma symptoms. Different measures of child adjustment yield a complex picture of the behavioral difficulties associated with pediatric asthma.

AB This study investigated whether friendships with deviant peers, in addition to being related to adolescents' behavioral adjustment problems, would also be negatively related to adolescents' emotional adjustment. Three hundred five adolescents who had either no mutual friends, nondeviant friends, or deviant friends were compared, with respect to their levels of delinquent behavior, depression, and loneliness at age 13. As expected, adolescents with deviant friends were more delinquent than the other 2 groups. In addition, adolescents with deviant friends showed similarly problematic levels of depression as friendless youth, but they were less lonely than the latter. The results are discussed in terms of the possible mechanisms underlying the relation between the association with deviant friends and adolescents' behavioral and emotional adjustment.

AB This cross-cultural, ecologically framed study (Bronfenbrenner, 1989) examined relations between adolescents' involvement in misconduct and their perceptions of others' behavior and attitudes toward youths' misconduct (i.e., family members, close friends, school peers, and neighborhood adults). Participants were 16- to 17-year-olds in the Los Angeles area (n = 201), Seoul, Korea (n = 391), and Tianjin, China (n = 502). As anticipated, U.S. youths engaged in more misconduct than Korean and Chinese youths, and Koreans exceeded Chinese. In multivariate analyses, perceived behavior and sanctions of close friends were the strongest predictors of misconduct across all 3 cultural settings. An independent effect of school peers on misconduct was detected only among Chinese youths, whereas a unique effect of neighborhood adults was found only among U.S. adolescents. The absence of perceived neighborhood effects for Korean and Chinese youths was due primarily to shared variance between perceived behavior of neighbors and family members. Results of this study suggest that living in settings with closer links to the global economy is associated with lax conduct and the perception of more lenient attitudes toward adolescent misbehavior.

AB Background: Earlier research has shown that psychiatric problems in children tend to persist over years. This investigation assessed the persistence of psychiatric deviance among children over a 7-year period from the age of 8 to the age of 15 years. We also explored the relationship between problems leading to special attention at the well-baby clinics before school age and future psychiatric deviance. Methods: The study material consisted of three questionnaires filled out by the parents, teachers and children themselves (N = 1268) at three time points, together with data concerning the children gathered from the records of well-baby clinics. Results: At the age of 15 years, girls scored higher than boys on the parental scale and on the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), while boys scored higher than girls on the teachers' scale. Parental ratings had a high correlation over 3 years and a moderate correlation over 7 years. Teachers' and children's ratings correlated moderately over 3 years, but did not correlate significantly over 7 years. The probability of being deviant at the age of 15 years was elevated if the child scored high on the parents' or teachers' scale at the age of 8 or 12 years, or on the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) at the age of 12 years. Problems noted by health professionals (problems in growth, somatic diseases, emotional/behavioural problems of the child, psychosocial problems of the family) before school age were related to future deviance on the parental scale. Emotional/behavioural problems before school age elevated the probability of scoring high on the teachers' scale at the age of 15, and problems in psychomotor development elevated the probability of scoring high on the BDI. Conclusions: Psychiatric deviance is persistent over several years in children. Primary health care professionals can identify children who are at risk for future psychiatric problems.

AB Maladjustment in adolescents is manifested in two main forms - extrinsic and intrinsic. Symptoms of maladjustment are grouped into several factors. The study is focused on the structure and dimensions or adjustment problems in adolescents. The research sample consisted of 957 girls and 894 boys, aged approximately 15 years. We administered Magnusson and Duner's self-report symptom questionnaire (Magnusson, Duner, Zetterblom, 1975), consisting of 122 (for girls) and 123 (for boys) questions focused on the occurrence and intensity of various adjustment problems. Principal components factor analyses with varimax rotation were computed for girls and boys separately. We found that factors concerning antisocial behavior, relationships with parents and peers were similar in boys and girls. Regarding emotional problems, some symptoms of emotional problems and worries created similar factors in boys and girls, but, as expected, depressive tendencies and psychosomatic problems were more pronounced in girls. Similar structure of factors was found in the Slovak and the Swedish girls.

AB Social-control-based deviance theories highlight parental bonding as a protective factor for problem behaviors in that bonds are viewed as reflecting the adolescent's adoption of conventional societal attitudes and values. Developmental theory and research suggest an alternative conceptualization of the linkages between family bonding and adolescent risk behaviors. This conceptualization requires concurrent examination of a range of adolescent competencies as well as consideration of parent and peer contexts. Support is found for several hypotheses derived from a developmental approach proposing: (a) positive associations between adolescent-parent attachment and adolescent competencies-autonomy, peer relationship competency, and coping; (b) coherence in the pattern of negative associations between attachment/competencies and substance use problems; and (c) a disjunctive pattern of associations with substance use reflected by positive associations with peer competencies but not with parental attachment.

AB We describe a follow-up of a study of behavior and emotional problems in a cohort of young people with Fragile X syndrome over 7 years. The study demonstrates that there is substantial persistence of the overall level of behavior and emotional problems, However, there are changes in certain types of behavior. Scores on the "disruptive" subscale of the Developmental Behavior Checklist decline significantly, whereas those on the "antisocial" subscale increase significantly. These changes parallel those seen in a large epidemiological control sample of young people with intellectual disability due to other causes. Further, two individual behaviors that distinguished the Fragile X individuals from the control individuals in the original study, namely "shy" and "avoids eye contact," continue to do so 7 years later.

AB Response sets as well. as cognitive and academic deficits compromise the validity of child and adolescent self-report of emotional adjustment. Three studies using clinical and asymptomatic samples of 4th to 12th grade students detail applications of the four validity scales of the Personality Inventory for Youth (PIY), namely, (a) Validity (VAL) a scale of six highly improbable statements, (b) Inconsistency (INC) consisting of pairs of highly correlated statements, (c) Dissimulation (FB) constructed of statements that were infrequent and characteristic of intentional distortion, and (d) Defensiveness (DEF) an extension of the Lie scale of the parent-report Personality Inventory for Children. The effects of minimizing, malingering, and random. response sets on the PN validity scales are reported. The importance of such validity scales derived from child and adolescent response is discussed.

AB Risk and protective factors of psychosocial development in children in different residential care settings need to be further studied internationally, in order to develop working methods for social and health care services. Standardized methods of the CBCL, TRF, and CGAS, were used to evaluate psychosocial functioning of children in children's homes in Finland. Further, data on sociodemographic situations and traumatic events in their lives were assembled. The percentage of behavioural and emotional problems within clinical or borderline range in the different ratings was 55-80%. Combined traumatization: sexual abuser school difficulties. male sex, older age (> 11 years) and older age at first and on-going placement (> 7 years), as well as difficulties in relationships with parents are likely to be associated with more severe behaviour problems and lower general functioning. The results of this study show that children and adolescents in social service residential settings are a highly vulnerable group and that these children have extensive mental health needs.

AB This research compared two forms of psychodynamic psychotherapeutic interventions for 67 clinically referred infants and their mothers. One was an infant-led psychotherapy delivered through a program called Watch, Wait, and Wonder (WWW). The other was a mother-infant psychotherapy (PPT). Infants ranged in age from 10 to 30 months at the outset of treatment, which took place in weekly sessions over approximately 5 months. A broad range of measures of attachment, qualities of the mother-infant relationship, maternal perception of parenting stress, parenting competence and satisfaction, depression, and infant cognition and emotion regulation were used. The WWW group showed a greater shift toward a more organized or secure attachment relationship and a greater improvement in cognitive development and emotion regulation than infants in the PPT group. Moreover, mothers in the WWW group reported a larger increase in parenting satisfaction and competence and decrease in depression compared to mothers receiving PPT. Both WWW and PPT were successful in reducing infant -presenting problems, decreasing parenting stress, and reducing maternal intrusiveness and mother-infant conflict. Some potential reasons for the differential treatment effects and the theoretical, clinical, and methodological implications from the findings are discussed.

AB Counseling services are now considered to be professional activities in Japan. yet little attention has been paid to studies of help-seeking preferences and help-seeking behaviors. Research on these topics has been conducted over the last 20 years in the United States. In the present article, studies of help-seeking preferences and help-seeking behaviors in the United States are classified into 4 categories: 1) demographic variables, 2) network variables, 3) personality variables, and 4) one's own symptoms or the seriousness of the problems. The focus of further research should be 1) on consistency in the definition of help-seeking preferences and help-seeking behaviors, and 2) on intervention methods for increasing help-seeking preferences and on helping systems for those people who prefer not to get help from counseling services. It is expected that professional psychology services will develop in Japan through such research on help-seeking preferences and help-seeking behaviors.

AB Objective: To investigate the stability and predictive strength of behavioral and emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. Method: A referred sample (N = 1,652), aged 4 to 18 years at initial assessment, was followed up after a mean interval of 6.2 years. Problem scores derived from Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report, and Teacher's Report Form at initial assessment (T-1) were related to scores on the same instruments at follow-up (T-2). Results: Correlations between T-1 and corresponding T-2 problem scores averaged 0.41 intrainformant (range 0.22-0.61) and 0.22 interinformant (range -0.09-0.57). Stabilities were similar across gender, and larger for Externalizing versus Internalizing scores, except on youths' self-reports. Psychopathology scores at follow-up were predicted by corresponding T-1 scores. Girls were predicted to have higher T-2 Somatic Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, and Internalizing scores than boys. Children younger at intake were predicted to have higher scores than older children on T-2 Social and Attention Problems. Conclusions: Findings indicate continuity of specific behavioral and emotional problems in clinically referred children and adolescents.

AB Purpose: We describe the impact of bladder exstrophy on the behavior, self-esteem and quality of life of children as well as on the parents, and analyze the need for psychological intervention.
   Materials and Methods: All 7 boys and 8 girls 3 to 18 years old (median age 11) under treatment at a tertiary pediatric surgery clinic were included in our followup study. Medical and psychological evaluations were performed. Behavior was assessed using the semistructured Hok-Cederblad Child Behavior Interview and the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire. Self-esteem was assessed by the self-rating I Think I Am questionnaire. Children and parents were interviewed separately. Quality of life was estimated using the Multiattribute Health Status Mark II classification system.
   Results: After repeat operations and hospitalization 10 children were dry, although 9 required catheterization. Four children had some behavioral problems, which were manifest in 2. All but 1 male adolescent had good or very good self-esteem. Quality of life was decreased in most cases due to limited self-care, although emotional problems were few. All mothers had experienced the birth as a traumatic event and 5 parents had had psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions: Self-esteem may be maintained despite multiple operations, urinary leakage and deviant genitalia but the abnormality had a great impact on children and on the lives of the families. Parents and children required individual intervention from a multidisciplinary team during different stages of childhood.

AB juvenile offenders (n= 266) confined to a juvenile detention facility were interviewed using a structured questionnaire about personal, home, and school characteristics and experiences that may have placed them at risk for delinquency. The sample was divided into two groups-those who had special education experience and those who had not Characteristics and experiences of the entire sample as well as comparisons between the special education and non-special education groups are reported and discussed. Most of the participants experienced multiple risk factors that predispose them to delinquency. A high proportion (37.1%) had been in special education, with most classified as having behavioral disorders (BD) learning disabilities (LD) or both. Males were more likely than females to have special education experience and to be classified as having ED, and African Americans were more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to be so classified. Although the experiences of special education and non-special education groups were similar in most ways, where differences were apparent, the special education group appeared to be at higher risk. juvenile offenders with special education experience were more likely to need corrective lenses, to have been identified as having attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to have taken medications for emotional problems. They had more foster placements, had attended more schools, and were more likely to have assaulted school officials. They got into trouble in school, were suspended and made their first court appearances earlier than juvenile offenders without special education experience. Implications for prevention and intervention are suggested.

AB The study compared general population samples of Jamaican children ages 6-18 years, via Jamaican versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) parent-, teacher-, and self-report forms. Repeated measures ANOVAs with informant as a repeated measures factor, assessed base-rate problem score differences according to children's area of residence (i.e., urban vs rural), gender, and age. No between subjects residence effects emerged for total problem score. However, adolescents self-reported higher total problem scores compared to the ratings they received from their parents and teachers. No gender total problem score effects emerged for any of the three informants, but girls received higher internalizing, and Somatic Complaints scores. Similar total problem scores across genders, and the high ratio of boys to girls in clinic samples suggest that Jamaican girls may not be receiving adequate services. Age X within subjects interactions revealed higher teacher reported problem scores for adolescents, reflecting possible developmental changes within the classroom context and teachers' low thresholds toward these problems. The d statistic revealed base rate syndrome, internalizing, externalizing, and total problem score differences in most Jamaican vs US sub-samples. In addition to the non-CBCL problems observed in earlier studies, these findings clearly indicate a need to ascertain syndrome structure and other psychometric properties of the Jamaican instruments.

AB Inflicted traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent consequence of physical child abuse in infants and children. Twenty-eight children who were 2-42 months of age when hospitalized for moderate to severe TBI were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study of neurobehavioral outcome following acquired brain injury. Relative to a comparison group, the children with inflicted TBI had significant deficits in cognitive, motor and behavioral domains when assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II 1 and 3 months after the injury. Nearly half of the injured children showed persisting deficits in attention/arousal, emotional regulation and motor coordination. Greater injury severity, as indicated by lower coma scale scores, longer periods of unconsciousness and the presence of edema/cerebral infarctions was associated with poorer outcomes in all domains.

AB Unmanaged emotional reactions to stress not only lead to behavior problems in young people but also create physiological conditions that inhibit learning and potentially increase the risk of disease later in life. For these reasons, the integration of emotional selfmanagement skills training programs has become an increased priority in some schools. In this study, middle school students enrolled in a course in emotional competence skills learned techniques designed to intercept stressful responses during emotionally challenging situations. Behavioral outcomes were assessed using the Achievement Inventory Measure and autonomic function was measured by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during and after a stressful interview. Following the program, students exhibited significant improvements in areas including stress and anger management, risky behavior, work management and focus, and relationships with family, peers and teachers. These improvements were sustained over the following six months. Students using the skills taught in the course to recover from acute emotional stress were also able to positively modulate their physiological stress responses. As compared to a control group, trained students demonstrated significantly increased HRV and more rhythmic, sine wave-like heart rhythm patterns during recovery. This response pattern reflects increased parasympathetic activity, heart rhythm coherence, and entrainment of other biological oscillatory systems to the primary heart rhythm frequency. Increased physiological coherence is associated with improved cognitive performance, emotional balance, mental clarity and health outcomes. These physiological shifts could promote the sustained psychological and behavioral improvements associated with the use of emotional management skills. It is suggested that learning emotional competence skills in childhood establishes healthier physiological response patterns which can benefit learning and long-term health. Results provide support for the integration in school curricula of courses designed to teach effective self-management skills to children.

AB Background: The focus of Dutch child health care among schoolchildren has shifted from preventing somatic diseases to early diagnosis of psychosocial problems. Studying psychosocial problems often requires the use of extensive questionnaires. The LSPPK is a short: questionnaire developed for the purpose of school doctors examining five year olds. Methods: A study was carried out comprising data from 2,528 children visiting school doctors. Answers from the children's parents who filled in the LSPPK questionnaire were compared to those of a health care professional (school doctor). Results: One or more problems were mentioned by 50% of the parents, while 5% indicated severe problems, Internal consistency of the questionnaire was good; Cronbach's as were 0.66 and 0.71 respectively for parent's and professional's answers. Furthermore, 75% of the school doctors indicated that the LSPPK provides a dialogue-oriented interaction between health care professionals and parents, because ii: helps parents to express their worries. Conclusion: The LSPPK invites parents to raise their worries about the behavioural and emotional problems of their children. In Dutch child health care the LSPPK is a useful instrument for indicating psychosocial problems among children as experienced by their parents and confirmed by school doctors. This article discusses the usefulness of the LSPPK for child health care in schools in European countries.

AB Objective: To describe the relationship between psychiatric status and the use of alcohol, drug, and mental health (ADM) services among a sample of American Indian (AI) juvenile detainees. Method: A structured diagnostic and service use interview was administered to 150 Al youths detained in a juvenile detention center located on a Northern Plains reservation. Results: Forty percent of Al youths with a diagnosed substance use disorder and 34.1% with a diagnosed anxiety, mood, or disruptive behavior disorder reported lifetime use of services for substance use and emotional problems, respectively. While services for substance use problems were most commonly provided in residential settings, services for emotional problems were most commonly provided in outpatient settings. Traditional healers and pastoral counselors provided services to 23.7% and 29.6% of youths who received services for substance use and emotional problems, respectively. Detained youths were more likely to receive ADM services than Al adolescents living at-large in another, comparable Northern Plains reservation community. Still, the vast majority of youths in detention who suffered from psychiatric disorders did not report use of ADM services. Conclusions: Detention facilities serving Al adolescents need to screen carefully for the presence of psychiatric disorders and facilitate the use of ADM services.

AB Objective. This study, like earlier studies that focused on younger abused children, ascertained whether physically abused adolescents exhibited increased internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Relevance to pediatric practice is discussed.
   Design. A cross-sectional design was used to compare the behavior of physically abused adolescents and comparison adolescents using self-reports, parent reports, and teacher reports. The level of agreement among raters was also examined.
   Participants. The subjects were 99 physically abused adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years, who were recruited from Child Protective Services. Comparison subjects were 99 community-recruited nonabused adolescents who were matched for age, gender, and income with the abused adolescents,
   Measures. The behavior of the adolescents was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist, and the comparable Youth Self-Report and Teacher Report Form, which are widely used measures of behavioral and emotional problems. The Child Global Assessment Scale was also used as a measure of functional impairment and of the need for mental health services.
   Results. Parents and teachers rated the problems of abused adolescents as significantly greater than the problems of nonabused adolescents on all checklist subscales. Abused adolescents reported significantly greater problems only on externalizing behavior subscales. In addition, based on interviewer ratings, physically abused adolescents exhibited significantly greater functional impairment.
   Conclusions. Similar to previous research on abused children, physically abused adolescents exhibit externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and experience greater functional impairment. Parent, teacher, and adolescent reports of externalizing behaviors were similar, but physically abused adolescents reported fewer internalizing behaviors than did the other informants.

AB The Differential Test of Conduct and Emotional Problems (DT/CEP) was utilized as a treatment outcome evaluation tool for the severely emotionally and behaviorally handicapped clients served by Specialized Youth Services of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. A significant change was found in both conduct problem and emotional disturbance scales, indicating improvement for both modalities over a nine-month period. No significant difference in improvement was indicated between males and females. The DT/CEP was established as a justified treatment evaluation tool, with attention given to cautions of scale interaction provided by the test authors (Kelly and Vitali, 1990).

AB Context: American Indians and Alaska Natives have the highest suicide rates of all ethnic groups in the United States, and suicide is the second leading cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native youth.
   Objective: To identify risk and protective factors associated with suicide attempts among native male and female adolescents.
   Design: The 1990 National American Indian Adolescent Health Survey.
   Setting: Schools of reservation communities in 8 Indian Health Service areas.
   Participants: Eleven thousand six hundred sixty-six 7th-through 12th-grade American Indian and Alaska native youth.
   Main Outcome Measures: Responses were compared among adolescents with and without a self-reported history of attempted suicide. Independent variables included measures of community, family, and individual characteristics. Separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls.
   Results: Ever attempting suicide was reported by 21.8% of girls and 11.8% of boys. By logistic regression done on boys and girls separately, suicide attempts were associated with friends or family members attempting or completing suicide; somatic symptoms; physical or sexual abuse; health concerns; using alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs; a history of being in a special education class; treatment for emotional problems; gang involvement; and gun availability. For male and female youth, discussing problems with friends or family, emotional health, and connectedness to family were protective against suicide attempts. The estimated probability of attempting suicide increased dramatically as the number of risk factors to which an adolescent was exposed increased; however, increasing protective factors was more effective at reducing the probability of a suicide attempt than was decreasing risk factors.
   Conclusions: A history of attempted suicide was associated with several risk and protective factors. In addition to targeting youth at increased risk, preventive efforts should include promotion of protective factors in the lives of all youth in this population.

AB The present study examined the correspondence among adolescent/young adult and parental figure, professional, peer and partner reports, in their rating of emotional and behavioural problems of 195 young people aged between 12 and 25 years who attended a community-based psychotherapy centre. Data from young people were obtained at intake by participants completing the Youth Self Report Form and from significant others by them completing the Significant Other version of the Teacher's Report Form. professionals rated internalizing (emotional) problems lower than peers, partners or parental figures. Externalizing (disruptive) problems were rated lowest by professionals, highest by partners with parental figures and peers in between. Agreement for internalizing problems was highest between self and professionals and lowest for partners and peeps; parental figures were in between these two extremes. For externalizing problems, agreement was highest between self and friends bur very low for partners. Professionals' ratings of internalizing problems showed a strong association with clinicians' assessment of global functioning and there was a strong association between partner ratings of total problems and clinicians' ratings of global functioning. The study showed the value of using a wider range of informants for assessing emotional and behavioural problems presented by young people seeking treatment than used in the assessment of pre-adolescents.

SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS

ID ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; NF1
AB Objective: To describe social and emotional problems in children and adolescents with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and propose interventions. Our hypothesis is that children with NF1 will have significantly more social and emotional problems, compared with their unaffected siblings and children in the general population.
   Study design: Ferry-three children with NF1 and 22 unaffected siblings (ages 5 to 18 years) were assessed with a standardized test completed by parents and teachers (the Child Behavior Checklist).
   Results: As with other aspects of NF1, there was variable expressivity. However, when rated by parents, children with NF1 had significantly more problems in comparison with test norms or unaffected siblings on 7 of 8 scales: Social Problems, Attention Problems, Anxiety/Depression, Withdrawal, Thought Problems, Somatic Complaints, and Aggressive Behavior. Children with NF1 also scored lower than unaffected siblings on measures assessing sports and other activities. Teachers reported fewer differences.
   Conclusions: We propose interventions in the form of information for parents; early screening and treatment for speech, motor, and cognitive problems; and an increased level of intervention to prevent and treat psychologic problems, including systematic screening with standardized tests.

DT Article
DE behavior problems; emotional problems; psychiatric disorders; Vietnam
AB Objective: To determine the distribution of behavioral and emotional problems and competencies among a sample of Vietnamese children aged 4 through 18 years living in Hanoi. Method: A representative community sample of 1,526 children and adolescents was selected from 2 precincts in Hanoi. Problems and competencies were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: Vietnamese children had lower mean raw scores than U.S. norms on the CBCL's Total, Externalizing, Internalizing, and Competence scales. Boys were reported to have more externalizing problems and girls more internalizing problems. Girls' levels of internalizing problems increased significantly with age. Conclusion: The lower levels of problems and competencies reported in Vietnamese children may represent differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, in parental perceptions of what constitutes deviant behavior, or in parental comfort with reporting psychopathological behaviors. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between the reported behavioral and emotional problems of Vietnamese children and the presence of psychiatric disorders. From a clinical perspective, the study's results suggest that levels of problems and competencies may vary significantly between different ethnic and cultural groups. Specific clinical cutoffs used to identify children requiring further psychiatric assessment need to be established separately for different ethnic groups.

AB All health care professionals with clinical responsibility for the care of children and adolescents must be able to recognize, as early as possible, associated health problems or concerns in children of substance-abusing parents, and to be able to assist these children and families in seeking treatment and promoting health. Health care providers can have a tremendous influence on families of substance-abusing parents because of their understanding of family dynamics and their close longstanding relationship with the family. Information about family alcohol and other drug use should be obtained as part of routine history-taking and when there are indications of family dysfunction, child behavior or emotional problems, school difficulties, and recurring episodes of apparent accidental trauma, and in the setting of recurrent or multiple vague somatic complaints by the child or adolescent. In many instances, family problems with alcohol or drug use are not blatant; rather, their identification requires a deliberate and skilled screening effort.
   Combining the principles of anticipatory guidance, screening, and early identification, with the acknowledgment that families should be included in the process, leads to a clear conclusion that screening for children affected by parental substance abuse must occur at all ages across infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Health care providers need to be trained in the identification and management of children and youth exposed to parental addiction. Such training must begin during undergraduate education in the health professions and be reinforced by role-modeling among health professions faculty as well as practicing providers.

AB The increasingly early initiation of penetrative sexual practices and the implication for prevention of HN and sexually transmitted diseases requires the study of childhood sexual behavior and its determinants. In adolescence, early sexual initiation is associated with other "problem behaviors" (Jessor & Jessor, 1977). To explore an analogous association for the middle childhood years, we studied 126 boys aged 5 to 11 years at increased risk for the development of conduct-disorder-related behavior with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/4-18 (Achenbach, 1991) and reevaluated 112 of them 15 months later. At both time points, the boys scored higher on the Sex problems scale as well as on the nonsexual CBCL scales than Achenbach's nonclinical norm sample. Within the at-risk sample, the Sex Problems scale was significantly related to externalizing problem behaviors, but also to the other CBCL scales of behavioral/emotional problems. These data point to childhood precursors of the association observed by Jessor and Jessor (1977) in adolescence.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare syndromes of parent-reported problems for children in 12 cultures. Method: Child Behavior Checklists were analyzed for 13,697 children and adolescents, ages 6 through 17 years, from general population samples in Australia, Belgium, China, Germany, Greece, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Results: Comparisons of nine cultures for subjects ages 6 through 17 gave medium effect sizes for cross-cultural variations in withdrawn and social problems and small effect sizes for somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior, Scores of Puerto Rican subjects were the highest, whereas Swedish subjects had the lowest scores on almost all syndromes. With great cross-cultural consistency, girls obtained higher scores than boys on somatic complaints and anxious/depressed but lower scores on attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior. Although remarkably consistent across cultures, the developmental trends differed according to syndrome. Comparison of the 12 cultures across ages 6 through II supported these results. Conclusions: Empirically based assessment in terms of Child Behavior Checklist syndromes permits comparisons of problems reported for children from diverse cultures.

AB Objective: To test associations between parental drug abuse and children's problems, children of cocaine- and opiate-dependent parents were compared with demographically matched referred and nonreferred children. Method: Cocaine- and opiate-dependent parents in treatment completed the Child Behavior Checklist for 410 children (218 boys, 192 girls) from ages 2 through 18 years (mean = 7.9 years). Children of drug abusers (CDAs) were demographically matched to referred (RCs) and nonreferred children (NRCs). Results: RCs scored lower than CDAs and NRCs on most competence scales, and higher than CDAs and NRCs on all problem scales. CDAs scored lower than NRCs on most competence scales, and higher than NRCs on Withdrawn, Thought Problems, Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. Group status also predicted clinical range scores on most competence and all problem scales. Conclusions: CDAs showed more internalizing and externalizing psychopathology relative to matched NRCs, but they showed significantly less psychopathology than shown by matched RCs. CDAs are an important group to target for preventive interventions.

AB Background: Pregnant adolescents have a higher risk of complications of pregnancy and labor. There is also a higher risk of child abuse and neglect among this age group. Aim: To study the psychological and social context, biographical impact and the prevalence of mental disorders among pregnant teenagers. Subjects and methods: A semi structured clinical interview was applied to 60 pregnant or puerperal adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years old, assisting to maternal outpatient clinics in the Western District of Santiago. Results: All 18% prevalence of mental disorders was found in these girls. Five percent had emotional problems as a reaction to the pregnancy. The most important psychological and social factors associated to pregnancy were a low educational level, economic dependence and a precocious and unprotected sexual life. Fifty seven percent of pregnancies were accidental, due to inadequate use for contraceptive methods or unforessen sexual intercourse iii the context of all informal or unstable couple. Those girls that planned becoming pregnant had better quality couples, higher maternal responsibility and a better biographical repercussion of their pregnancies. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of psychological and social disorders among pregnant adolescents.

AB Objective: To compare the identification of psychiatric disorder as informed by parents versus teachers in children aged 6-11 years and parents versus adolescents in youth aged 12-16 years in clinic versus community samples.
   Method: Study data come from parallel surveys in Hamilton, Ontario, of children aged 6-16 years. The surveys included consecutive referrals (N = 1150) between 1989 and 1991 to the region 's 2 agencies providing outpatient child mental health services. Also, a simple random sample (n = 1689) was used, drawn in 1989 from students attending public schools. Conduct disorder hyperactivity, emotional disorder and somatization disorder were assessed by informants using the original Ontario Child Health Study scales.
   Results: The percentage of children identified with a disorder was markedly higher in the clinic sample, irrespective of the type of disorder, the age and sex of the child and who provided the assessment. Also there was a statistically significant differential shift between parents and teachers in the percentage of children identified with disorder. The ratio of children aged 6-11 years identified with conduct disorder or hyperactivity, by parents versus teachers was higher in the clinic sample than in the community sample. Among youth aged 12-16 years, a similar pattern emerged for parents as informants versus the adolescents themselves, but it was statistically nonsignificant.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that the relative contribution of informants to the identification of childhood psychiatric disorder varies by sample type: clinic and community. If risk factors for child disorder are influenced by contextually specific factors wedded to informants, then studies conducted in clinic versus community samples may lead to discrepant information about the determinants of psychopathology. The extent of this problem need to be assessed by comparing the results of parallel studies conducted in clinic versus community samples.

AB This study set out to investigate the behavioural and emotional problems and competencies of Irish children and adolescents using Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR). The Child Behaviour Checklist was completed by parents of 481 Irish school children aged 7-9 years and 13-15 years, and the Youth Self Report was completed by 240 adolescents. The schools were selected to represent a wide social and cultural spread. Irish young people of all ages scored significantly lower than their American counterparts on measures of competence, whether rated by themselves or their parents. The parents of the 7-9 year olds rated their children as having significantly lower total problem scores than their American counterparts, but for 13-15 year olds there were no differences in total problem scores between the Irish and American samples, whether rated by parents or the adolescents themselves. Total problem scores and externalizing scores increased with age on the CBCL and the YSR, a pattern in which Irish young people differed from those in most other cultures. Despite differences in sampling and methodology, the Irish results are similar in many respects to those seen in a number of other European studies.

AB Over the course of two years, researchers conducted two qualitative studies to investigate the impact of moving on gifted children. Participants were five families, each of which included gifted children and at least one parent presently or recently in the military. Study 1 involved elementary students living on a military base, and students in Study 2 attended suburban high schools. While academic performance was not hindered by moving, parents and students reported that organizational inconsistencies among schools (e.g., widely varying criteria for admittance to gifted programs) were a frequent cause of frustration. Frequent relocations had little impact on parent and student perceptions of the gifted children's long-term social, emotional, and academic development. In the short term, however, certain children experienced varying degrees of social difficulties that appeared to result from the relocations.

AB The utility of two teacher rating scales, the Differential Test of Conduct and Emotional Problems and the Emotional and Behavior Problem Scale, to discriminate between emotional disturbance (ED) and social maladjustment (SM) was investigated in the study reported here. Participants were 135 students in the age range 12 to 15 years. The ED group was composed of 85 students, all of whom were classified as emotionally disturbed and received full-time special education services. The SM group was made up of 50 students who were in regular education middle school settings. Ail students in the SM group had experienced either internal or external suspension during the school year in which the data were collected. The overall pattern of scores on these scales suggests that students who are socially maladjusted and students who are labeled emotionally disturbed do not display separate, distinguishable behavioral syndromes. implications for educators and for public policy makers are discussed.

AB This study compared scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) for samples of youths in 3 out-of-home placements with varying levels of restrictiveness. Mean CBCL T scores were more than a standard deviation higher than mean YSR T scores on the broadband scales and about 2/3 of a standard deviation higher on the syndrome scales. The magnitude of the discrepancy varied between placements for several scales, with the least restrictive placements having the largest difference between CBCL and YSR ratings for the Externalizing scale. For the Internalizing scale, the discrepancy was larger for older youths (ages 15-18) than for younger youths (ages 11-14) These results support previous findings that in clinical samples, adults rate children's behavioral and emotional problems as more severe than do children themselves. This study extends prior research by demonstrating the occurrence of this discrepancy across a continuum of care.

Subjects were initially assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). At follow-up, a subsample of 131 subjects were assessed for DSM-III-R Axis 1 diagnoses with the SCAN (a semi-structured interview), while the Global Assessment of Functioning scale and the Groningen Social Disabilities Schedule were used to assess functioning in daily life.
   Scores on the CBCL scales Withdrawn, Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Social Problems and Thought Problems in adolescence were associated with DSM-III-R symptomatology or dysfunctioning in young adulthood.

In general, adults'(teachers and parents) reports of young adolescents 'sympathetic tendencies were associated with high regulatory abilities, low negative emotionality, and constructive social behaviors contemporaneously and to some degree, 2, 4, and 6 years previously. Furthermore, in regression analyses, regulatory abilities during early adolescence as well as 2 years earlier uniquely predicted young adolescents' sympathetic tendencies after controlling for the effects of negative emotionality Although findings were fairly similar across contexts, the majority of findings at school were for girls whereas the pattern of findings at home was somewhat more consistent for boys than for girls.

AB BACKGROUND. Pediatric patients' self-report of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has emerged as an important patient-based health outcome. A practical, validated generic measure of HRQOL facilitates assessing risk, tracking health status, and measuring treatment outcomes in pediatric populations.
   METHODS. The PedsQL is a brief, standardized, generic assessment instrument that systematically assesses patients' and parents' perceptions of HRQOL in pediatric patients with chronic health conditions using pediatric cancer as an exemplary model. The PedsQL is based on a modular approach to measuring HRQOL and consists of a 15-item core measure of global HRQOL and eight supplemental modules assessing specific symptom or treatment domains. The PedsQL was empirically derived from data collected from 291 pediatric cancer patients and their parents at various stages of treatment.
   RESULTS. Both reliability and validity were determined. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the core measure (alpha = .83 for patient and alpha = .86 for parent) were acceptable for group comparisons. Alphas for the patient self-report modules generally ranged from .70 to .89. Discriminant or clinical validity, using the known-groups approach, was demonstrated for patients on- versus off-treatments. The 11 scales showed small-to-medium positive intercorrelations, supporting the multidimensional measurement model. Further construct validity was demonstrated via a multimethod-multitrait matrix using standardized psychosocial questionnaires.
   CONCLUSION. The results support the PedsQL as a reliable and valid measure of HRQOL. The PedsQL core and modular design makes it flexible enough to be used in a variety of research and clinical applications for pediatric chronic health conditions.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and related material, developed by Achenbach and Edelbrock in Vermont, was validated in a mailed survey. A population based sample of 779 children between the age of four and 17 years was compared to a sample of 146 children referred for child psychiatric service. Danish children scored very much like our Scandinavian and German neighbours, but low compared to most others. The CBCL mean 'total behavior problem score' in the population was 17.7. The checklists, especially the patent and teacher versions, provided good construct validity. Youths generally reported more emotional problem behavior than their parents and teachers did about them. In general, parents and youths agree more, reporting emotional problems, and parents and teachers agree more, when scattering externalizing behavior. Short screening constructs are introduced, and by the use of latent trait analysis, four clinically relevant sub-scales were generated. Predictive value, sensitivity, specificity and clinical validity must be undertaken in a future two-phase study.

AB Development of problem behaviour in early adolescence was predicted from change in pubertal stage and timing of pubertal development. Parent-reported (Child Behavior Checklist) and self-reported (Youth Self-Report) problem behaviour, pubertal stage and life events were assessed twice from a community sample of nearly 1300 Dutch children, aged 10-12 years at T1 and 12-14 years at T2. Pubertal change was a significant predictor of development in most parent-reported problems. Once initial differences in problems had been accounted for, the slower the progress in pubertal development, the higher the problem score at T2. Development of self-reported problems was independent of pubertal change, Pubertal timing predicted development of two parent-reported and three self-reported problem scales. Of the parent-reported problems, early maturation was associated with a decrease in boys' social problems and attention problems. Late maturing increased girls' social problems. Of the self-reported problems, early maturation was associated with an increase in girls' withdrawn and delinquent behaviour. Late maturing increased boys' attention problems. We conclude that pubertal development has small but significant effects on the development of problem behaviour in early adolescence.

AB Smoking and drinking habits were studied among 1098 14-15-year-old adolescents using a mailed questionnaire. The subjects were drawn from a representative population of 5813 randomly selected X-year-old children previously studied in the National Epidemiological Child Psychiatry Study in Finland in 1989. The questionnaire included items on the adolescents' smoking habits and alcohol consumption. Regular smoking was more common among boys (and girls) who, in childhood, had been rated by their parents (Rutter Parent Questionnaire) (RA2) as disturbed, 14.6% (30.3%), than among the nondisturbed, 6.6% (8.4%). Similarly, more of the previously disturbed (according to the RA2) adolescent boys drank alcohol regularly, 19.7%, as compared to the nondisturbed boys, 9.3%. Among girls, regular alcohol consumption was more common among those who previously had behavioural or mixed type problems (according to the RA2), 70.7%, as compared to those who previously had emotional or no problems, 12.2%. More of the previously depressed girls smoked regularly, 45.1%, than those who had not been depressed, 7.9%. Behavioural and emotional problems in childhood seemed to predispose to smoking and drinking in adolescence. The parents were more sensitive than the teachers in recognising the long-lasting problems of their children.

AB The aim of this study was to elucidate the nature of comorbidity between internalising and externalising syndromes and its meaning in the course of these syndromes from 8 to 12 years of age in a school setting. The children in the cohort (N = 1320) were born in 1981. They were first surveyed in second grade (N = 1284) and followed up in sixth grade (N = 906). Teachers were the informants, and the study was carried out by means of a questionnaire. Data from both points of time were available on 861 subjects. The Rutter Teacher Questionnaire (RB2) measured behavioural and emotional symptoms at Time 1, and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) at Time 2. Comorbidity was more prevalent in boys than girls. Childhood comorbidity predicted externalising syndrome and comorbidity, but not internalising syndrome in early adolescence. It changed the course of boys' internalising syndromes to an externalising direction over time. The data suggest a gender difference in the pattern of comorbidity. When comorbidity was partialled out, it was very rare for internalising and externalising syndromes to develop into contrasting syndromes over time. The recovery rate for childhood comorbidity was poor. Special attention should be paid to making schools recognise and help these children.

AB Historically, health-related quality of life (HRQL) assessment in pediatrics, including the few validated instruments in pediatric oncology, has been based on proxy reporting, relying primarily on parental assessment. Children have been deemed incapable of providing consistent and reliable information about their level of functioning or state of well-being. Previous studies have been hampered by either limited or poor correlation among the proxy reporters, i.e., teachers, parents and physicians, and in comparisons to disease severity. Simply stated, proxy reporters have greater agreement about what the child can do vs. what the child thinks or feels. Comparisons among proxy reporters have been hindered also by a lack of parallel content in the instruments used, which may result in poorly congruent assessments simply because the instruments measure different constructs. In addition to the measurement issues, the emotional milieu of the parent, particularly the mother, has been shown to influence assessments of the child's functioning. Maternal distress, marital adjustment and health locus of control all co-vary with reports of the child's behavior. What, then, is the proxy reporter telling us about the child? We conducted a cross-sectional study of school-aged pediatric bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients at our institution to evaluate children's self-reported HRQL and functional status, We formally tested the Child Health Rating Inventories (CHRIs), a recently developed generic hearth-status measure, with its companion measure, the Disease Impairment Inventories-Bone Marrow Transplant (DSII-BMT). Separate questionnaires were administered to patients, parents and physicians at a scheduled outpatient visit after BMT. The questionnaires were designed to have parallel content. All responses were confidential, The psychometric properties of the CHRIs and DSII-BMT are reported elsewhere. In brief, the responses of all raters were reliable, based on measurements of internal consistency. The children's self-reported health status was correlated significantly with the physicians' disease severity rating (DSR) across all generic and disease-specific domains. In contrast, parental reports of child health status were not correlated significantly with the DSR for disease-specific problems or the child's pain. Parental ratings deviated most from the children's ratings within the dimensions of mental health and quality of life (p < 0.001), For the entire sample, parental ratings were significantly lower than the children's ratings. Within the subgroup "early after transplant (<6 months)", parental ratings were significantly lower than the children's self-reports in all categories. in the subgroup "> 12 months after transplant", with the exception of mental health and quality of life, parental scores were the same as or higher than the children's ratings. Our results confirm previous studies that the parental reporting of children's health status is a complex construct and that valuable information can be elicited directly from the children. Further research is needed to substantiate these findings, particularly in longitudinal applications with adequate sample sizes. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 12:46-51, 1999, (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Measurement of pediatric cancer patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL) in phase III randomized, controlled clinical trials is being recognized increasingly as an essential component in evaluating the comprehensive health outcomes of modern anti-neoplastic treatment protocols. Use of a brief core measure of HRQL plus disease-specific symptom modules is a way to assess specific HRQL outcomes with a minimum of subject burden. Demonstrating a measure's feasibility, reliability and validity also represents children's ability to provide reliable and valid responses to HRQL questions. The Pediatric Cancer Quality of Life Inventory (PCQL) Modular Approach consists of a 15-item core measure of HRQL and 2 specific symptom modules: pain and nausea. To validate a patient-report form and a parent-report form, the PCQL was administered to 291 pediatric cancer patients and to their parents. Feasibility and range of measurement, as well as patient-parent concordance, were assessed. Internal consistency reliability was assessed via Cronbach's alpha. Validity was determined by the known-groups approach and by correlating PCQL scores with days missed from school. Patients had minimal missing data, and the range of measurement for the items was good, Patient-parent concordance was large but not perfect. For both patient and parent forms, internal consistency reliability of the PCQL core scale (0.83 and 0.86, respectively) was strong. The internal consistency reliabilities of the 2 symptom modules for both patient and parent forms were in the acceptable range for group comparisons, Regarding clinical validity, the core scale and the 2 symptom modules distinguished between patients on and off treatment for both patient and parent reports. Further, both patient and parent reports correlated with days of missed school in the past 6 and 12 months, The PCQL Modular Approach has demonstrated acceptable internal consistency reliability and clinical validity for both patient-report and parent-report forms. By implication, children are capable of providing reliable and valid responses to these HRQL questions. Int. J. Cancer Suppl. 12:71-76, 1999, (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB We present a comparison of levels of emotional and behavioural disturbance in children and adolescents with four genetically determined causes of intellectual disability (ID) and a control group of epidemiologically derived young people with ID as a consequence of a range of known and unknown causes. The behavioural and emotional disturbances were reassessed 4 years later providing one of the few follow-up studies of these genetic disorders. The study shows that genetic cause of ID has a strong influence on the severity of behaviour problems. Persons with Down syndrome have significantly less behaviour disturbance than controls, and young persons with Prader-Willi or Williams syndrome have significantly more disturbance than controls. These patterns persist over time, although there are non-specific trends for the level of disturbance to improve or worsen in particular syndromes.

AB Personal narratives are receiving considerable interest as reflections of important psychological processes. Less attention, however, has been paid to how narratives are constructed among family members and serve as markers of family relationship functioning that directly affect child development. As a group activity, the telling of family stories may be one way that families regulate social interactions. As reflections of individual and family beliefs, family stories also may be a way that representations of relationships are passed down across generations. The Family Narrative Consortium was formed by a group of family researchers who aimed to devise a system by which family stories could be coded reliably. The consortium members were interested in how narratives about personal experiences could be considered a central aspect of the family's attempt to make sense of their social world and to share representations of relationships with their children.
   The narratives used in the collaborative project came from family interviews conducted with four different samples using four different interview protocols. The data sets were originally part of larger research projects aimed at studying a variety of family processes including intimate couple formation, family rituals, family adoption, and effects of parental psychiatric illness on the family. Three dimensions were proposed as part of the coding scheme: Narrative Coherence, Narrative Interaction, and Relationship Beliefs. Family narratives are proposed to involve the process of creating a coherent statement about family events, the exchange of information among family members, and attribution of meaning to family experiences. Analyses conducted across the samples and within each site provided support for the reliability and validity of the narrative scales.
   The consortium members conclude that narratives provide access to the insider's view of the family, can detect interactional and representational aspects of family process, and are important markers of family functioning. Furthermore, the study of family narratives emphasizes how the meaning-making process comes to life in family interaction and transacts with representations of family relationships.

AB The investigation assessed psychiatric symptoms in children at two time points and the persistence of symptom groups over an interval of 4 years. We studied 1128 children by using parental questionnaires (Rutter Scale A2) in both studies (mean age of the children was 8.5 years in Study 1 and 12.5 years in Study 2). There was a tendency for the frequency of symptoms to decrease over the 4-year period. Most of the symptoms reported in Study 1 were also found in Study 2. Sex differences were similar in both studies. Four factors were constructed out of the items on Rutter Scale A2, reflecting externalizing, hyperactive, internalizing, and poorly socialized behaviours. Externalizing, hyperactive, and internalizing behaviours were moderately persistent in the sample studied. The stability of externalizing and internalizing behaviour was high among deviant children. Hyperactivity was not persistent among deviant boys but highly persistent among deviant girls. Poorly socialized behaviour was not persistent in the sample studied, but girls scoring high in this factor in Study 1 scored high on the externalizing factor in Study 2.

AB Research focused on studying the relationship between type of parental childrearing and emotional and psychosomatic problems in adolescents. The sample consists of 954 girls and 879 boys. We administered the Magnusson and Duner's symptom questionnaire and Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The results showed the importance of the gender of the parent as well as the child in upbringing. We found that strict upbringing of the parent of the opposite gender negatively affects emotional well-being and psychosomatics of the adolescent.

AB Aims. To test an extended version of Pomerleau's (1997) hypothesis that children with mental health problems are at higher risk of smoking in preadolescence and adolescence. Design. Information concerning mental health from 5 to 13 years, smoking at ages II and 15, and family disadvantage at age 7 was available for 773 children enrolled in a longitudinal study of children and adolescents. Participants. Participants were enrolled into the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which is a longitudinal investigation of the health, development and behaviour of a large group of New Zealand children born between I April 1972 and 31 March 1973. Measurements. Assessment of mental health problems in childhood was based upon parent and teacher report of behavioural and emotional problems. In pre-adolescence, mental health was assessed by self, parent and teacher report. Smoking was assessed by self-report. Findings. None of the potential risk factors of gender, childhood disadvantage or childhood mental health problems predicted onset of smoking in pre-adolescence. Daily smoking at age 15 was best predicted by smoking in preadolescence, being female and experiencing childhood disadvantage. Pre-adolescent mental health was only weakly predictive of later smoking and this association appeared to be confounded with background disadvantage. Conclusions. We found little support for the extension of Pomerleau's (1997) hypothesis to childhood mental health. Our findings also run counter to recent suggestions for targeting smoking prevention at groups of children with mental health disorders.

AB Because little is known about the mental and emotional functioning of delinquent adolescents in Thailand, 400 incarcerated youths (300 boys and 100 girls) and 400 nonadjudicated controls of equivalent age, gender; socioeconomic status, and religion completed newly normed measures of self-concept (Tennessee Self-Concept Scale), ego defense mechanisms (Life Style index), and personality traits (Adjective Checklist). Among delinquents, gender contrasts revealed that girls, although less self-confident than their male peers, had better social skills and were more aware of their emotions. Relative to controls, the self-perceptions of delinquents were rigid and distinguished by feelings of impulsiveness and being misunderstood by family members. Denial, repression, and regressive emotionality characterized the coping of the criminally involved youths, and personality test data revealed that the jailed adolescents had impaired introspective and interpersonal abilities. implications of the findings for the prevention of delinquency and the treatment of adolescents with disorders of conduct are discussed.

AB Family risk-related variations in proximal parent and young adolescent outcomes of a universal family-focused preventive intervention were examined using a cumulative index of risk incorporating sociodemographic characteristics and social-emotional adjustment measures. Results of an initial investigation involving 209 families of young adolescents suggested that intervention efficacy was largely unrelated to cumulative family risk. These findings were replicated with a second sample of 428 families. Implications for future intervention applications and outcome research are discussed.

   health
ID CHILDREN; ADJUSTMENT; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to compare levels of emotional and behavioural problems and competencies among immigrant and non-immigrant adolescents, and to determine factors that may contribute to any differences reported.
   Method: Subjects were selected randomly from students aged 12-16 years attending a high school with a high proportion of immigrants in Perth, Western Australia. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), and students completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and a Personal History Questionnaire.
   Results: On univariate analyses, non-immigrant adolescents had significantly higher CBCL and YSR scores than immigrant adolescents. Multivariate analyses suggested that CBCL scores were predicted by a number of variables other than immigration, including family intactness, socioeconomic status (SES) and gender. Higher YSR scores were predicted by non-intact families, school setting and non-immigrant status, and higher competencies scores were predicted by higher SES and parents not being immigrants.
   Conclusions: In assessing the effects of immigration on adolescent mental health, it is important to control for factors associated with adolescent behavioural and emotional problems and to use multiple informants. Overall, immigrant adolescents report fewer total and externalising problems and fewer competencies than native-born adolescents. This finding may reflect strict immigration policies or cultural differences in definitions of psychopathology and the social expectations for adolescents' behaviour.

AB Examined agreement among secondary school teachers' behavior ratings for 66 adolescent boys with a history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Behavior ratings consisted of the Teacher Report Form, Iowa/Abbreviated Conners, and the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale. Ratings from 2 to 5 teachers were collected for each adolescent. In contrast to previous studies, agreement was examined using statistical indices that corrected for chance agreement and discrepancies in scores (i.e., intraclass correlation [ICC], kappa) in addition to traditional indices (i.e., Pearson correlation and percentage agreement) typically used in the relatively sparse literature on teacher agreement for adolescent behavior ratings. Agreement was poor for dimensional subscale scores (Pearson correlations were in the .40-.50 range, and ICCs were in the .20-.50 range) as well as for categorization of youth as above or below clinical cutoffs (percentage agreement was between 52% and 96%, but ICCs and kappas ranged from .17 to .57). Findings suggest that, regardless of behavior rating scale used, a multiple teacher assessment strategy should be adopted for clinical assessment, treatment design, and evaluation of treatment efficacy.

AB Psychosocial dysfunction in children, first recognized more than 20 years ago as the "new morbidity" in pediatric practice, is now the leading cause of disability in childhood and adolescence.(15-17, 30) Epidemiologic research indicates that 14% to 20% of American children have one or more psychiatric disorders in the moderate to severe range,(10) and the overall prevalence is rising.(1) As many as half of all pediatric office visits reflect behavioral, psychosocial, and educational concerns, and most children in the United States with a psychiatric disorder receive care only from their pediatricians, making primary care clinics the "de facto mental health service" for most children in need of such care.(14) In addition, with the advent of managed care, pediatricians are increasingly becoming "gatekeepers" who identify and refer children with mental health problems.
   Despite the growing prevalence of psychiatric illness in children, four out of five children with diagnosable behavioral and emotional problems are not identified by their pediatricians, and even fewer receive mental health services.(14) Furthermore, children are more likely to be recognized and treated if their behavior upsets or annoys adults than if their psychiatric symptoms lead to school failure and poor functioning at home. Poor children are among the least likely to receive adequate mental health attention.(44) Numerous studies have shown that untreated mental health problems result in high rates of medical services(29) and place children at high risk for chronic psychosocial morbidity, including antisocial and self-injurious behavior.(31, 33, 40)
   Some obstacles to recognition by pediatricians are long-standing. Parents may be reluctant to raise psychosocial concerns, pediatricians map wish to avoid stigmatizing labels, pediatric training underemphasizes mental health and behavioral problems, and reimbursement for psychosocial services is low or unavailable for pediatricians. New hurdles have emerged as efforts to contain medical costs, such as managed care systems and capitation, have led to shortened office visits, larger panel sizes, constraints on referrals, and even disincentives to recognize children in need.(23)
   This introduction describes the most common psychiatric conditions presenting to pediatric clinics and discusses approaches to identification, assessment of severity, and treatment planning. Within treatment planning are highlighted guidelines for consulting a pediatric psychopharmacologist because medication is often an important feature of a comprehensive treatment plan.

AB Recent studies based on the psychobiological theory of personality by Cloninger postulate a relationship between certain personality traits and various psychopathological manifestations. To test this theory, we administered the Temperament and Character Inventory and the Youth Self-Report to 188 male delinquents from a juvenile correction centre in Northern Russia, and to 111 age-matched male controls recruited from among schoolchildren. As assumed by previous studies, psychological symptoms were primarily positively correlated with harm avoidance and negatively correlated with self-directedness. At the same time, the higher levels of aggressive and delinquent behaviour were positively correlated with novelty-seeking and negatively correlated with co-operativeness. The possible mechanisms underlying these findings are discussed.

ID AMERICAN-CHILDREN; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Nonreferred adolescent samples for ages 12 to is from Jamaica and the United States were compared via syndromes, syndrome groupings, and total problem scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form. and Youth Self-Report. No significant total problem score differences were found between Jamaican and U.S. adolescents in reports by any informants. However, adolescents in both societies reported significantly more problems than their parents or teachers. Jamaican adolescents received and endorsed higher problem ratings for the Withdrawn and Somatic Complaints syndromes and on internalizing scores. These findings suggest that by virtue of the time spent in their society, Jamaican adolescents may develop problems their country facilitates. The results further indicate the need to test whether similar CBCL-based syndromes and syndrome groupings are evident in the Jamaican youth population. If such groupings are identified for Jamaican adolescents, different clinical cutpoints on some scores may be needed for Jamaican than for U.S, adolescents.

AB Tourette's syndrome (TS) and tic disorders have been studied intensively but most findings appear in the medical rather than school psychology literature. A strong knowledge base exists regarding the etiology and manifestation of TS/tics and their co-existence with learning and behavioral-emotional problems. In this article, it is argued that TS/tics occur commonly among school age children, that students affected with the condition often experience recognizable school, behavioral-emotional and interpersonal difficulties, and that many would benefit if school psychologists identified the disorder and participated in treatment. It is suggested that by identifying and treating this condition school psychologists fulfill an important opportunity to solidify their role as health service providers.

   DEFINITION
AB Students with serious emotional disturbance (SED) art:identified at relatively low rates, perhaps because of confusion about how to meet the federal definition's elements. This article addresses a practical aspect of the SED definition: how to determine ii emotional disturbance has adversely affected educational performance. It is suggested that effects of emotional disturbance should not be equated with those of learning disabilities, especially if an emotional disorder begins late in a student's educational career or has a variable course. Three ways to determine whether an emotional problem has adversely affected educational performance are suggested: severe ability/achievement discrepancy, failure to master the curriculum, and chronic absence from school. Implications for professional practice are also addressed.

AB The recent attempts to implement the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act underscore the necessity for promoting good health in adolescents with disabilities. This article addresses the reasons why this concern has not been recognized and explores the concepts of good health, habilitation, and the effects of assistance in encouraging independence for youths with developmental disabilities. The article discusses how mobility, education, family adjustment social relationships and sexuality, and emotional adjustment to adolescence influence health adjustment. Social work implications suggest a holistic approach emphasizing the concepts of youth and family empowerment and quality of life as the key professional endeavors in practice with youths with disabilities.

AB The Youth Self Report (YSR) was used in a Swiss epidemiological study with 1093 subjects aged 10-17 years. Infernal consistency was good for the second-order factors "Internalizing Problems," "Externalizing Problems, " and the "Total Problem Score," whereas it was less satisfactory for almost all syndrome scales. In general, internal consistency coefficients were slightly lower in the Swiss sample than in the U.S. sample. Correlations between the syndrome scales resulted in good replications of the original findings as obtained in the U.S. normative sample. Effect analyses showed that sex is more important than age and nationality (indigenous vs. immigrant subjects). However, all effects were small. Correspondence between YSR and Child Behavior Checklist scores showed that agreement between adolescents' and parents' reports is relatively small.

AB Participants were 4 groups of early adolescents from middle-class backgrounds (European and Chinese Americans in southern California and Chinese in Taipei, Taiwan, and Beijing, China). The 591 adolescents (M age = 13.8 years) completed questionnaires about their involvement in misconduct and about family and peer characteristics. Mothers of a subsample of adolescents (n = 405) also completed a questionnaire about their relationships with their adolescents. The 4 groups of adolescents reported significantly different mean levels of family and peer correlates but showed strikingly similar levels and patterns of self-reported misconduct. Structural equation models revealed that 2 latent variables (family relationships and peer sanctions) accounted for more variance in misconduct among European and Chinese American adolescents (51%-62%) than among the 2 Chinese groups (15%-24%), mainly because of a greater contribution of peer factors in the former groups.

SO DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY

ID AMERICAN; PARENTS; SCHOOL
AB Cross-cultural comparison serves a crucial function as a final test of paradigms that emerge in intracultural studies of child and adolescent adjustment and maladjustment. Beliefs about child and adolescent adjustment are inextricably linked to cultural values regarding the place of the individual in society. Socialization practices and coping behaviors differ in adaptive significance according to the economic structure of a society and its value system. It is argued that the doorkeeper function of cross-cultural research is performed most effectively when a wide range of cultures are sampled, for which core beliefs are measured directly and not inferred from the general literature on each culture, and multiple sources of information are tapped.

AB The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among prepubertal children in Southern Finland was studied in a two-stage epidemiological survey. In the first stage of the study 3397 children aged 8 or 9 were screened with the Rutter A2 scale for parents, Rutter B2 scale for teachers and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). In the second stage a random sample of the children screened was drawn for more detailed assessment. Altogether 279 children were interviewed with the Finnish version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC), and their parents with the Isle of Wight Interview Schedule. In the parental interview the prevalence of psychiatric disturbance among children was 15.1%. The rate was higher for boys (23.7%) than for girls (5.3%). The prevalence of psychiatric disturbance verified with the child interview was 14.9%. The prevalence of psychiatric disturbance in boys based on the child interview was 20.5%. For girls the prevalence of psychiatric disturbance based on the child interview was 8.7%. The spectrum of psychiatric disturbance differed in the two interviews. Attention deficit disorder, depression and conduct disorder were the most common diagnoses in the parent interview, while anxiety disorder and depression were most common according to the child interview. In only 24% of the cases both the parent and child interview gave the same diagnosis.

Forty students enrolled in a rural Mississippi high school participated. Twenty were designated as the treatment group and twenty served as the control group. Results indicated that scores on both dependent variables (attitudes about seeking professional help and conceptions of mental illness) increased significantly for the treatment group and, further, these scores did not decrease significantly when the students were tested again twelve weeks later. The findings are discussed in the context of educating rural youth about mental illness with the express purpose of removing the stigma associated with the help-seeking process.

Reliability of the diagnosis (0.70 less than or equal to k less than or equal to 0.75) was good for ADHD, ODD, CD, and OAD, and excellent for MDD and SAD. Because of low base-rate, no kappa value was calculated for SPh. Both test-retest agreement, and reliability of the symptom scale (0.75 less than or equal to ICC less than or equal to 0.80) were very good for all 7 diagnoses. Internal consistency according to symptom scale (0.78 less than or equal to Cronbach a less than or equal to 0.90), was moderate for OAD, good for SPh, MDD, SAD, CD, and ODD, and excellent for ADHD. The Terry is a culturally-sensitive questionnaire with good reliability.

AB This correlational study explored the concurrent association between basic measures of child functioning (e.g., social competence, emotional and behavioral problems) that may be influenced by placement status (i.e., placement with, or separation from, an older sibling in foster care). Subjects were 38 preschool-aged foster children: 25 were placed with an older sibling and 13 were separated from an older sibling. ANOVA and Chi-Square tests revealed few significant between-group differences on the background and case history variables or between the two groups of foster mothers. One notable exception was that children placed with their siblings had a greater frequency of prior psychological problems. With respect to the measures of child functioning, the two groups did not differ on prosocial behavior. However, the children placed with their older siblings tended to have fewer emotional and behavioral problems but lower receptive vocabulary scores than children separated from their siblings. The results are discussed in terms of placement policy and decision-making issues.

AB The relationship between a range of prenatal and perinatal events and risk for psychopathology in offspring was examined. Prenatal and perinatal events investigated included maternal experiences, health, and substance use during pregnancy, obstetric complications, feeding practices, and infant health during the first year of life. Offspring diagnosis was based on structured interviews conducted with 579 adolescents on two occasions. Risk for later psychopathology was associated with a number of prenatal and perinatal factors. Major depression was associated with not being breast fed and maternal emotional problems during the pregnancy. Anxiety was chiefly associated with fever and illness during the first year of life and maternal history of miscarriage and stillbirth. Disruptive behavior disorder was associated with poor maternal emotional health during the pregnancy and birth complications. Risk for substance use disorder was associated with maternal use of substances during the pregnancy. Mediating effects of maternal depression, maternal-child conflict, and physical symptoms in the child, and moderating effects of gender of child and parental education were also evaluated. The limitations of this study are discussed and future research directions are suggested.

AB Adolescence is a time of major physical and psychological change. Young teenagers need to become comfortable with their developing sexuality, to begin moving towards independence with a greater reliance on peer group acceptance, to face the future and to make important decisions about their education, career and goals. Difficulties inherent in all of these steps to adult life are magnified by chronic ill health. It is harder for adolescent patients to break family ties, harder to feel accepted by their peer group, harder to plan realistically for the future. It must be the overriding aim of the professional health carers to encourage these patients to confront the problems of adolescence and to help them maintain their physical and emotional stability throughout this challenging period. Parents also must be supported, and encouraged gradually to devolve to their child responsibilities for decision making and for taking prescribed medication. A planned and sensitive transition from a paediatric to an adult health-care system will aid a successful evolution to an independent adult life. The paediatric hospital environment is not best equipped to deal with the problems of adolescence. Just as parents must allow their child to move on, so the paediatric caring team must loosen its ties with the patient and allow transfer to the adult team. There are several ways of effecting this transfer of care. None of them is proven to be better than any other, but the transfer should always be planned, smooth, efficient and expected by the patient. Ideally, all patients should have the opportunity to transfer to a properly equipped and properly staffed adult cystic fibrosis centre where they can continue to receive the highest standards of care from an experienced multidisciplinary team.

AB Objective: To compare the types and rates of psychiatric symptoms of young Central American and Cambodian refugees, as reported by both parents and children, and to examine parent-child agreement in reporting symptoms. Method: Interviews were conducted with 123 children aged 8 to 12 years and 158 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years and their parents. Parents assessed psychiatric symptoms via the Child Behavior Checklist, the 8- to 12-year-olds responded to the Dominic, and the adolescents answered the Youth Self-Report. Means of Internalizing and Externalizing scores were compared on the basis of ethnic origin, parent's sex, and child's sex, as were the Spearman correlation coefficients of parents' and children's ratings. Results: The Cambodian parents reported few symptoms in their children, and the Central Americans reported almost as many symptoms as did parents in U.S. clinical samples. The Cambodian children reported less symptoms than the Central Americans, but the interethnic difference was not significant in the adolescents' self-reports. Parent-child agreement varied considerably by sex and ethnic origin of the informant. Conclusions: The results underscore the need to involve multiple informants in assessing psychiatric symptoms of refugee children in spite of the difficulties inherent in field research with this population. They also show that data on multiple informants gathered from Western samples are not universally valid.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate psychosocial issues concerning puberty and motherhood among CF adult females, to see how they had obtained and conceived information on these matters and how they would like information to be given. Fourteen adult CF females were interviewed. The majority of the women felt socially accepted and did not remember being ashamed over their delayed puberty. Thirteen of the women had been or were living in stable sexual relationships. However, the study revealed problems with destructive behaviour during puberty due to thoughts about premature death, secret worries over delayed puberty, poorly received information about puberty and fertility, avoidance of close relationships with the opposite sex during adolescence and concerns about being a mother with a chronic illness. Information about puberty and fertility should be given individually and in small discussion groups with teenage girls combined with thorough medical and psychological guidance concerning motherhood.

AB Aims The aim of the present study was to determine which medical variables were predictors of long-term behavioural/emotional outcome after surgical correction for congenital heart disease in infancy and childhood.
   Methods The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to predict parent-reported behavioural/emotional problems in 125 10-15 year-old congenital heart disease children from: (1) biographical status (2) medical history (3) heart surgery (4) short-term post-operative course and (5) number of heart operations and (6) extra cardiac concomitant anomalies.
   Results Higher CBCL total problem scores at follow-up were associated with a greater number of heart operations and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (<22 degrees). 'Internalizing problems' were associated with a greater number of heart operations, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, a short gestational age, low systemic oxygen saturation, and older age at surgical repair. 'Externalizing problems' were associated with a greater number of heart operations only.
   Conclusion Several medical variables were significant predictors and can be used to identify those congenital heart disease children who are at risk of long-term behavioural/emotional maladjustment.

AB Attachment style differences in psychological symptomatology, self-concept, and risky or problem behaviors were examined in a community sample (N = 1,989) of Black and While adolescents, 13 to 19 years old. Overall, secure adolescents were the best-adjusted group, though not necessarily the least likely to engage in risky behaviors. Anxious adolescents were the worst-adjusted group, reporting the poorest self-concepts and the highest levels of symptomatology and risk behaviors. in contrast, avoidant adolescents reported generally high levels of symptomatology and poor self-concepts but similar levels of risk behaviors to those found among secures. Mediation analyses suggested that the observed differences in problem behaviors were at least partially accounted for by the differential experience of distress symptoms (primarily hostility and depression) and by social competence. Finally patterns of attachment effects were similar across age, gender, and racial groups, with some important exceptions.

AB Intensive antineoplastic treatment protocols have been developed and implemented in controlled clinical trials with the goal of improving the survival of pediatric cancer patients, Multidimensional health outcome evaluation of this cohort of pediatric cancer patients being treated with these modern regimens is essential in order to enhance health-related quality of life. The Pediatric Cancer Quality of Life Inventory (PCQL) was developed to be a standardized assessment instrument to assess systematically pediatric cancer patient's health-related quality of life outcomes. The PCQL was administered to 291 pediatric cancer patients and their parents at various stages of treatment The aim of the present study was to present the development, descriptive statistics, and cross-informant variance for the PCQL items. Large variability in symptoms and health-related problems were found as expected given the wide heterogeneity in the patient population sampled. patient/parent concordance on individual items averaged in the medium effect size range. The findings underscore the importance of measuring both patient report and parent report of patient symptoms and problems in pediatric cancer health-related quality of life assessment.

AB Objective: Compare behavioral and emotional problems of children and adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and clients consulting mental health centers (MHC) and related behavioral and emotional problems to the children's personality in the PWS group.
   Methods: Participants were 39 children with PWS and 585 matched MHC clients. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) syndromes were related to the Big-Five personality factors measured with the California Child Q-sort (CCQ)
   Results: Mean CBCL Total Problems scores were not different for the PWS and MHC groups, but differences were found for several of the CBCL subscales. Patterns of correlations among CBCL scales were similar in both groups, although coefficients were generally higher in the PWS group, indicating higher comorbidity or co-absence of CBCL syndromes in children and adolescents with PWS. Personality profiles were specific for Internalizing and Externalizing problems of children and adolescents with PWS.

AB In adolescence, antisocial and depressive symptoms are moderately stable and modestly correlated with each other. We examined the genetic and environmental origins of the stability and change of antisocial and depressive symptoms and their co-occurrence cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a national sample of 405 adolescents. Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins and full, half, and unrelated siblings 10-18 years of age from nondivorced and stepfamilies were studied over a 3-year period. Composite measures of adolescent self-reports, parent reports, and observational measures of antisocial and depressive symptoms were analysed in multivariate behavioural genetic models. Results indicated that the majority of the stability in and co-occurrence between dimensions could be accounted for by genetic factors. Nonshared environmental risks and, for antisocial symptoms, shared environmental risks also contributed to the stability. Genetic influences on change were observed, but only for antisocial behaviour. In addition, the longitudinal association between antisocial behavioural and later depressive symptoms was also found to be genetically mediated, but this effect was nonsignificant after controlling for stability. Results are discussed in light of the potential contributions of developmental behavioural genetic research in understanding individual differences in the stability and change of maladjustment.

AB OBJECTIVE - To evaluate whether the family system variables of adults with diabetes relate to the adequacy of metabolic control or the psychosocial adaptation to the illness.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 150 insulin-requiring adults were assessed on a single occasion. They completed two family system measures (the Family Environment Scale [FES] and the Diabetes Family Behavior Checklist [DFBC]), two quality-of-life measures (the Diabetes Quality of Life Scale and the Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey-36), and one measure of cognitive appraisal (the Appraisal of Diabetes Scale). Glycemic control was assessed using HbA(1c) results. Demographic data (age, sex, diabetes type, duration of diabetes, and number of diabetes-related medical complications) were gathered from the patients' charts.
   RESULTS - Concerning glycemic control, none of the family system measures were significant predictors of HbA(1c). Older age and longer duration of diabetes predicted higher HbA(1c) values. For psychosocial adaptation, when family members behaved in ways that supported the diabetes care regimen (measured by the DFBC), the individual with diabetes was more satisfied with his or her adaptation to the illness and reported less interference in role function due to emotional problems. Family cohesion (measured by the FES) also related to better physical function. Women reported higher levels of diabetes satisfaction: The Appraisal of Diabetes Scale predicted glycemic control and psychosocial adaptation.
   CONCLUSIONS - For insulin-treated adults with diabetes, family system variables do not relate to glycemic control, but they do relate to psychosocial adaptation. Future work should explore the impact of family-centered interventions on adaptation, sex differences in adaptation, and the use of the Appraisal of Diabetes Scale as a first-line clinical screening tool.

AB In this study data from a large representative community sample of adolescents were analysed to investigate the relationship between a history of sexual abuse and adolescent functioning. Emotional problems, behavioural problems, suicidal thoughts and behaviour of boys and girls with a history of sexual abuse were compared to those in a matched control group of boys and girls without such a history. Both sexually abused boys and girls reported significantly more emotional problems, behavioural problems, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts than their non-abused counterparts. The results also indicated that the experience of sexual abuse carried far more consequences for boys than for girls regarding the use of alcohol, aggressive/criminal behaviour, use of drugs, and the amount of truancy, as well as regarding suicidal thoughts and behaviour. For example, whereas 2.6% of the non-abused boys reported a former suicide attempt, this percentage was 13 times higher for the sexually abused boys (26 .5%). The results of this paper lend support to the call for further research investigating gender differences in response to sexual abuse.

AB Background: Various studies find relationships among anxiety and depressive disorders of adolescence and adulthood. This study prospectively examines the magnitude of longitudinal associations between adolescent and adult anxiety or depressive disorders.
   Methods: An epidemiologically selected sample of 776 young people living in upstate New York received DSM-based psychiatric assessments in 1983, 1985, and 1992 using structured interviews. The magnitude of the association between adolescent and adult anxiety or depressive disorders was quantified using odds ratios generated from logistic regression analyses and from a set of latent Markov analyses. We focus on longitudinal associations among narrowly defined DSM anxiety or depressive disorders.
   Results: In simple logistic models, adolescent anxiety or depressive disorders predicted an approximate 2- to 3-fold increased risk for adulthood anxiety or depressive disorders. There was evidence of specificity in the course of simple and social phobia but less specificity in the course of other disorders. Results from the analyses using latent variables suggested that while most adolescent disorders were no longer present in young adulthood, most adult disorders were preceded by adolescent disorders.
   Conclusions: An anxiety or depressive disorder during adolescence confers a strong risk for recurrent anxiety or depressive disorders during early adulthood. Most anxiety and depressive disorders in young adults may be preceded by anxiety or depression in adolescence.

Analysis of a sample of calls (N = 10,717) shows that ERAN's helpline is used more often by single than by married persons; that singles are more likely to be seeking social support; and that single callers tend to repeat their calls. Most of the single callers present emotional problems, while married persons divide their calls between emotional and family problems. The needs of single persons for social support and the role of helplines for this population are discussed.

AB The 2 objectives of this study were the following: (a) to evaluate individual variations in adolescents' perceived security to parents, social support expectations, and socioemotional adjustment during the high school-college transition, and Cb) to test whether perceived security to parents predicts changes in support expectations and socioemotional adjustment across the transition. A unique aspect of this study was the comparison between adolescents who left home to attend college and those who did not. On 2 occasions, 298 adolescents were met: at the end of high school and during the first semester in college. Perceived security to parents showed high test-retest correlation stability, significantly more than did perceptions of social support and emotional adjustment. During the transition, the adolescents who had left their families to attend college experienced improved means of perceived security, decreased perceptions of social support, and increased feelings of loneliness and social anxiety. Finally, perceived security to parents at the end of high school predicts positive changes in expectations of support and socioemotional adjustment across the transition.

AB This study examines the behavior problems of children receiving services through an adoption preservation program for legally adopted children at risk of placement or dissolution. Two measures of behavior problems are used: a behavior problem rating scale, available on 368 children, and the Child Behavior Checklist, available on 201 children. Variables associated with severity of behavior problems include attachment problems, age at placement, experiencing multiple types of abuse and neglect, a history of sexual abuse, and experiencing a recent loss in the family. Children's scores on the CBC reflect the severity of behavioral and emotional problems among these children who have lived in their adoptive home for a mean of 8.9 years. Ninety-one percent score in the clinical range on at least one of the three summary scores of the CBC. These findings support the need for services for children and families beyond the finalization of adoption.

AB The effects of gender of subject, gender of suicide attempter, and physical attractiveness of attempter on justification, emotional adjustment, and liking were investigated in this study. One hundred forty-eight male and female undergraduates (average age = 21.93 years) read a brief case history describing an individual who attempted suicide one week ago. Two-thirds of the subjects also received a photograph. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six groups: attractive female attempter, unattractive female attempter, no photograph female attempter, attractive male attempter, unattractive male attempter, and no photograph male attempter. Ratings of justification, emotional adjustment, and liking were measured using 7-point Likert-type questions. The MANOVA revealed significant main effects of gender of subject and physical attractiveness. Univariate analyses of these effects showed that females rated attempters significantly more justified than males and that attractive attempters were liked significantly more than unattractive and no photograph attempters.

AB The main objective of this study was to determine whether positive attribution is characteristic of parents of children with a Life-threatening disease. Parents (n=321) and their children (n=205) in different conditions (cancer in remission and with a relapse, asthma, and healthy controls) completed questionnaires to investigate parents' attribution of positive characteristics to their children, children's depressive behavior, and the correspondence between these two sources of information. It was found that parents of children with cancer attributed significantly more cheerful behavior to their children than parents of children with asthma and parents of healthy children. The findings obtained were equivalent for the mothers and the fathers. The levels of depressive symptoms reported by the children in the four groups did not differ. The parents' attribution of depressive behavior to their child was significantly different from the children's reports in all cases except from the children in the healthy group. Parents' attribution of positive characteristics to their children with cancer, the children's own report of a low level of depressive feelings, and the low parent-child agreement supports a proposed mechanism of self-protection by parents of children with cancer. If parents of children with cancer need to see their children as strong, they will be less likely to accurately report their children's emotional feelings. More research is needed to determine whether positive attribution influences the emotional adjustment of parents of children with cancer.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the stress-coping model of addiction (Wills & Shiffman, 1985) is also applicable to smoking in the maintenance phase, or habituated smoking. The model predicts that smoking will be associated with stress, negative emotions and ineffective coping. In addition, the association between smoking and other health habits was investigated. The sample consisted of 726 Swiss university freshmen, who were experiencing the stresses of their first semester. The findings supported the stress-coping model quite well - but only so for heavy smoking. Heavy smokers differed from non-smokers regarding stress, negative emotions, problem-focused coping and dysfunctional coping. For light to moderate smoking, the results were more ambiguous. Light to moderate smokers differed from nonsmokers regarding stress and negative emotions, but only slightly so regarding coping. A comparison of health habits placed the three groups on a clear spectrum, with nonsmokers showing the best and heavy smokers the poorest habits.

AB The comparative validity of the child-report Classroom Screening Scale (CLASS) from the Personality Inventory for Youth (PIY), and the parent-report Adjustment Scale (ADJ) from the Personality Inventory for Children (PIG) was examined. The subjects were 111 children from fourth-through sixth-grade regular education classrooms. Children were classified as positive or negative for risk status on each screening scale using a cutoff of 60T.: Parent description identified a higher proportion of children as at risk. Those identified as "at risk" by either parent or child report were more likely than others to have clinically elevated scores on both the PIC and PIY clinical scales. High scores on CLASS were more likely to have clinically significant elevations than were high scorers on ADJ. Parent report appeared to be sensitive to overt behavioral problems, while self-report was sensitive to mood disturbances and withdrawal. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Psychological problems examined were anxiety, depression. emotional stress, physical symptoms, amount and consequences of alcohol consumption, eating problems, and psychological traits associated with eating problems. Personal-emotional adjustment was included as the potential opposite of maladjustment. Factor analyses generally found two broad independent patterns constant across genders. Internalized Distress consisted of anxiety; depression; emotional stress; personal maladjustment; physical symptoms; eating problems; and eating traits. Alcohol Abuse consisted of amount and consequences of alcohol consumption. Multiple regression analyses indicated that whereas stressors were correlates of both factors, female gender predicted higher scores on Internalized Distress, while male gender predicted higher scores on Alcohol Abuse.

AB In this study, the original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was modified slightly by rewording ten items to fit the vernacular of English employed by young men and women in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. The response alternatives were extended to include a ''don't understand'' answer in addition to ''true'' and ''false.'' To determine the effectiveness of the MMPI for use in this cultural setting, 202 male and 246 female high school students between the ages of 15 and 20 years were examined. Two clinical groups also were studied: 26 male and 32 female adolescents in psychiatric treatment, as well as 49 male and 14 female juvenile offenders incarcerated for various delinquent acts. The retest stability of the basic MMPI scores was evaluated by readministering the MMPI one week later to samples of normal males and females. Validity scale data indicated that these late adolescents were responding to the MMPI in ways comparable to normal and clinical groups in the United States. The results of this investigation support the use of the MMPI in the appraisal of emotional problems of adolescents seen in both the mental health and criminal justice systems in Trinidad and Tobago.

AB This paper reviews research published within the last 10 years on child and adolescent strategies for coping with commonly occurring stressors in nonclinical populations and the relationship of these strategies to adjustment. Current conceptual and classification schemes for children's coping strategies are analyzed and compared. Studies of child coping are reviewed in three clusters: (a) descriptive and taxonomic studies, (b) age-group comparisons, and (c) evaluations of coping-adjustment relationships. Developmental commonalities and changes are identified across studies and conceptual models. Conceptual models compatible with problem-focused/emotion-focused and approach/avoidance frameworks have proven to be useful for descriptive purposes. However, it is of concern that categories in the current classification systems do not distinguish coping strategies that promote adjustment from ones that limit adjustment. Future directions for addressing this issue and developmental considerations are suggested including an alternative model pertaining to coping competence. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Accelerated longitudinal analyses revealed both similarities and differences between the developmental trajectories of empirically based aggressive versus delinquent syndromes in childhood and adolescence. Syndromes were scored from standardized ratings obtained from parents five times at 2-year intervals for seven birth cohorts of Dutch children initially assessed at ages 4 to 10 years. Scores for both the aggressive and delinquent syndromes declined from ages 4 to 10. After about age 10 years, scores for the aggressive syndrome continued to decline, but scores for the delinquent syndrome increased until about age 17. The aggressive syndrome was significantly more stable than the delinquent syndrome. Long-term predictive correlations between matched subjects from different cohorts were as high as predictive correlations between scores obtained by the same subjects, thus supporting the validity of accelerated longitudinal analyses. The results highlight important developmental distinctions between aggressive versus delinquent conduct problems. Failure to distinguish between aggressive and delinquent conduct problems could generate misleading conclusions about their respective developmental courses and limit the generalizability of results.

AB This longitudinal study of 137 female high school seniors investigated the relationship of attachment cognitions, current psychological functioning, and psychological functioning 12 months later. Attachment cognitions, assessed with the Revised Adult Attachment Scale and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, were significantly associated with current symptomatology. The Revised Adult Attachment Scale, in interaction with initial symptomatology, predicted depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, and personality disorders 12 months later. The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment parent subscales predicted eating disorder and personality disorder symptomatology, whereas the peer subscales predicted substance abuse, eating disorder, and personality disorder symptomatology.

ID PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT; GIFTED-CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS
AB The highly able can be expected to be at least as well balanced-as any other children, but they do have special emotional problems arising both from other people's reactions to their exceptionality and from inappropriate education. This was investigated in a British 14-year comparative study. Children labelled as gifted were found to be from different home backgrounds and to have different emotional profiles than others of the same measured ability who had not been seen as gifted. From this and other research it can be seen that expectations of highly able children can be confusing, for example that they either have poor social relationships or are natural social leaders. Teachers and parents may over-pressure pupils to excel at all times, or raise their all-round expectations for a child, even though s/he is only gifted in a specific area. Stress may also come from always having to learn at an unstimulating level, producing boredom, apathy and underachievement. Suggestions are made for helping the emotional development and improving educational provision for the highly able.

AB Purpose: The goals of this study were to describe student access to health care services, identify populations of students who remained in need of health care services, and highlight particular unmet needs for health care identified by these adolescents.
   Methods: Students in Grades 9-12 attending 50 schools in Oregon completed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS). Questions requesting adolescents to report their need for specific types of health care, and access to general and specific types of care were added to the core YRBS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent relationships between student or community characteristics and health care access or unmet needs for care.
   Results: Almost 14,000 adolescents completed surveys, of whom 75% reported visiting one or more health care provider within the last 12 months. Nineteen percent of adolescents reported that they had not received 1 or more of 10 specific types of care when needed in the last year. Females, some racial/ethnic minorities, rural, and sexually active adolescents were more likely to report unmet needs for health care. Most frequently, adolescents reported they needed but did not receive care for an illness (7%) or for personal or emotional problems (6%). In addition, about 400 (3%) students reported they needed birth control that they did not receive.
   Conclusions: A majority of high school-age adolescents had visited health care providers within the year prior to study. However, the number of adolescents who reported unmet specific health care needs within the same time period remained substantial. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 1997.

AB The impact on the family of having a family member with serious emotional problems has been an area of concern as deinstitutionalization and managed care have shifted treatment to the community and primary caregiving to the Family. Measures are needed to assess caregiver strain in a way that can lead to a better understanding of the phenomena, improve clinical interventions, and examine the outcomes of new treatment modalities on the client's family. In order to study the effects of this treatment shift, the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (formerly the Burden of Care Questionnaire) was developed for use with families of children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral disorders. Findings from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support the existence of three related but unique dimensions of strain experienced by parents of this population. This study adds to the current body of knowledge by suggesting that subjective caregiver strain has two components, and not the single form claimed in previous research. The results also indicate that the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire is a reliable and valid scale for the measurement of caregiver strain among families of children with emotional or behavioral disorders.

AB This article uses the concepts of risk and resiliency to frame our understanding of how having a learning disability affects nonacademic outcomes such as emotional adjustment, family functioning, adolescent problems of school dropout, substance abuse and juvenile delinquency, and adult adaptation. The presence of a learning disability is viewed as a risk factor that, in and of itself, does not predict positive or negative outcomes. Rather, other risk and protective factors, as highlighted in the literature, interact with the presence of a learning disability to facilitate or impede adjustment. These risk and protective factors may be internal characteristics of the individual or external characteristics of the family, school and community environments. Implications for the development of proactive interventions and areas for future research are discussed.

AB Conceptually-driven investigations on the potentially modifiable predictors of individual differences among children with newly-diagnosed cancer may facilitate the identification of pediatric cancer patients at risk for maladjustment during the profound adversity associated with this life-threatening disease and aversive biomedical treatment. Within a risk and resistance theoretical framework, perceived stress and social support were investigated concurrently and prospectively within an exploratory design as predictors of negative affectivity (anxiety and depressive symptoms composite construct) in newly-diagnosed pediatric cancer patients at Time 1 (within one month after diagnosis), Time 2 (6 months postdiagnosis), and Time 3 (9 months postdiagnosis). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis findings indicate that perceived stress and social support have direct and independent effects on negative affectivity principally at the 9-month time interval. These findings are discussed in terms of the cognitive-behavioral treatment implications for enhancing child adjustment during the transition from the initial cancer diagnosis and aversive biomedical treatment to subsequent school and social reintegration.

AB College students (n = 132) and mothers (n = 64) listened to simulated hotline calls and rated level of suicide risk and the helpfulness of interventions. Students also rated their intent to take action in a similar situation; mothers rated their child's intent to take action. Students, more than mothers, perceived emotional problems to be associated with risk; mothers, more than students, perceived changes in behavior to be associated with risk. Students and mothers generally agreed regarding the helpfulness of different interventions, rating talking as most helpful. However, students, more than mothers, perceived social distraction as helpful. Mothers were generally accurate in their perceptions of their children's intended actions. Results suggest the need for additional research on the skills adolescents bring to crisis situations.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents in Germany Results of a representative study: Age, gender and rater effects. Method: A study on behavioral and emotional problems and competence in children and adolescents in Germany (PAK-KID study) is described. It is the first nationwide representative survey of this kind of children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years in Germany. For children aged 4 to 10 years the parents completed the German version of Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 4-18) developed by the Arbeitsgruppe Deutsche Child Behavior Checklist. Children and adolescents aged 11 years and older filled out the German version of the Youth Self-Report that is part of Achenbach's CBCL in addition to the parents completing the German version of the CBCL. A total of 2856 parent questionnaires and 1798 self-report questionnaires completed by children and adolescents were analyzed.
   Results: The sample was representative with respect to the main sociodemographic variables. On all problem scales children and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years reported significantly more problems than their parents did. The frequency of internalizing problems (social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety/depression) and delinquent behavior of children and adolescents reported by parents increased with the children's age, whereas aggressive behavior and attention problems decreased with age. Girls reported significantly more problems than boys on all internalizing scales of the Youth Self-Report. The effect was not totally replicated in the parent reports. In the parent reports, boys had more attention problems and more aggressive and delinquent behavior than girls.

   SOCIAL-CLASS; MORTALITY; CHILDHOOD; MEN; ILLNESS; GROWTH
AB Background Explanations for social inequalities in health are often explored but remain largely unresolved. To elucidate the origins of health inequalities, we investigated the extent to which adult-disease risk factors vary systematically according to social position over three decades of early life.
   Methods We used the 1958 birth cohort (all children born in England, Scotland, and Wales on March 3-9, 1958) with data up to age 33 years from parents, teachers, doctors, and cohort members (n=11 407 for age 33 interview).
   Findings Social class of origin was associated with physical risk factors (birthweight, height, and adult body-mass index); economic circumstances, including household overcrowding, basic amenities, and low income; health behaviour of parents (breastfeeding and smoking) and of participants (smoking and diet); social and family functioning and structure, such as divorce or separation of participants or their parents, emotional adjustment in adolescence, social support in early adulthood; and educational achievement and working career, in particular no qualifications, unemployment, job strain, and insecurity. With few exceptions, there were strong significant trends of increasing risk from classes I and II to classes IV and V. Self-perceived health status and symptoms were worse in participants with lower class origins.
   Interpretation An individual's chance of encountering multiple adverse health risks throughout life is influenced powerfully by social position. Social trends in adult-disease risk factors do not emerge exclusively in mid-life, but accumulate over decades. Investment in educational and emotional development is needed in all social groups to strengthen prevention strategies relating to health behaviour, work-place environment, and income inequality.

AB Using samples of twins and singletons totaling 715 individuals, the authors document heritable influences on various temperamental dimensions during the toddler and preschooler age ranges, which have been somewhat understudied relative to infants and older adolescents. In contrast to instruments on which prior literature is based, the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire and the Children's Behavior Questionnaire offer assessment of positive affectivity (separately from negative affectivity) and of emotional regulation. Positive affect reveals substantial shared environmental influence, and emotion regulation reveals additive genetic influence. Evidence for genetic variance in temperament is strengthened because intraclass correlations from many of these questionnaire scales show no evidence of ''too-low'' dizygotic correlations that imply contrast effects. Suggestive evidence is offered that psychometric characteristics of the questionnaires can affect biometric inferences.

AB We introduce an overlapping cohort sequential longitudinal study of behavioral development and psychopathology in a representative sample of 1412 pairs of twins aged 8 through 16 years. Multiple phenotypic assessments involve a full psychiatric interview with each child and each parent, and supplementary parental, teacher, and child interview material and questionnaires. For the first wave of assessments, the numbers of reported DSM-III-R symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Overanxious Disorder (OAD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), assessed through interviews, confirm patterns of age and sex trends found in other epidemiological samples, but underscore their dependence on whether the child or the parent is the informant. Correlations across domains for symptoms reported by the same informant are often as large as correlations across informants for the same domain of symptoms. Factor analyses of these symptom counts, taking account of informant view and unreliability of assessment, show the high degree of correlation between SAD and OAD, between MDD and OAD, and between CD and ODD. ADHD symptoms are relatively independent of the other domains, but show moderate correlations with CD, ODD, and MDD. Factorially derived dimensional questionnaire scales, based on child, parental, and teacher reports, show patterns of relationship to symptom counts consistent with both convergent and discriminant validity as indices of liability to clinical symptoms. Across informants, questionnaire scales provide as good a prediction of symptoms as do clinical interviews. Multitrait-multimethod confirmatory factor analysis reveals the patterns of relationship between symptoms of psychiatric disorder in children taking due account of informant and unique sources of variance. Gender differences are consistent within the correlated clusters of ODD/CD and MDD/SAD/OAD, although there are disorder-specific age trends. There are large informant-specific influences on the reporting of symptoms in clinical interviews. Dimensional questionnaire scales provide a useful source of additional information. In subsequent analyses of genetic and environmental etiology of childhood psychopathology we must expect that results may differ by informant and method of assessment. Multivariate and developmental analyses that explore the sources of these differences will shed new light on the relationship between genetic and environmentally influenced vulnerability and the manifestation of psychopathology in specific circumstances.

AB Objective: To examine the individual and family characteristics of children and adolescents with high levels of hopelessness. Method: One hundred inpatient youngsters participated in the study. Several measures, including the Hopelessness Scale for Children, Problem Behavior Scale of the Scales of Independent Behavior, Social Support Questionnaire-Revised, Pediatric Anger Expression Scale, and Differential Emotions Scale, were used to compare differences between youngsters who scored high or low on hopelessness. Results: The results indicated that youngsters with high hopelessness scores tended to perceive their families and peers as providing little support, to express their anger overtly and aggressively, and to demonstrate more negative emotions than youngsters with low hopelessness scores. Conclusions: Hopelessness in youths appears to be associated with a specific pattern of behavioral and emotional problems. Clinical implications of the findings include integrating anger management, emotional expression interventions, and involving the family in treatment to enhance the social support network of youngsters with high levels of hopelessness.

AB It is widely accepted that family influences are closely linked to emotional adjustment in the adolescent years. This study assessed the extent to which perceptions of family functioning at Time 1 predict self-esteem and psychoticism at Time 2. Respondents were 282 14-year-olds, traced for follow-up two years later. The follow-up success rate was more than 80%. The results of structural equation modelling suggested that perceptions of positive and negative family communication were not significantly linked to self-esteem and psychoticism at Time 2, although they were indirectly linked through the Time 1 measures. The results are discussed in the context of other findings questioning the role of environmental influences on the emotional adjustment of older children. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

On all problem scales adolescents report more problems than parents. For some scales the differences between girls and their parents are higher than between boys and their parents (social withdrawl, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, attention problems, internalizing and total score). Averaged Pearson correlations of the eight subscales are in a moderate rage (r<0.50). For all problem scales an agreement of 30% in the area of high problems (>PR95) is found. If one informant scores above PR95 the Relative Risk of the other one scoring in this range too is significantly higher than one for nearly all scales.

AB Teenage fertility rates in the UK are amongst the highest in Europe and have not altered significantly in the last 15 years, but the proportion of births outside marriage has risen rapidly. In this study we used longitudinal data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) to investigate the social, economic and educational backgrounds of young parents. The analysis showed there to be striking variations in the probabilities of becoming young parents but not with respect to whether the child was born within or outside marriage. Young mothers and fathers were more likely to come from economically disadvantaged families and to have lower educational attainment. Teenage mothers were more likely to have mothers who had a child in her teens and were more likely to have exhibited higher levels of emotional problems particularly in adolescence. Young women whose educational attainment scores deteriorated between childhood and adolescence had particularly high probabilities of becoming young mothers. For some teenage motherhood was unintended and the result of unprotected intercourse whilst other men and women who subsequently become young parents had expressed a preference for early parenthood whilst still at school.

A subgroup of 399 parents were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). The mean syndrome scale scores in the various sex/age groups were in the lower range of several international studies using the CBCL. Effect analyses revealed sex to be more important than nationality (indigenous vs. immigrant) and age. All effects had to be considered as being small. Convergence between syndrome scales of the CBCL and interview-derived DSM-III-R diagnoses was good for three major groups of disorders.

AB Parental support and conflictual relationships in a sample of 48 Black and White adolescent mothers between the ages of 14 and 19 were examined. Adolescent mothers were interviewed when their babies were 3 months old. Most adolescent mothers reported close relationships with both their mothers and fathers before and after the births of their babies. The perception of a supportive relationship with the mother after the birth of a baby increased more than the perception of a supportive relationship with the father. Perceptions of conflict were much higher for mothers than for fathers, and less conflict with parents was reported by Black than by White adolescent mothers. Older White adolescent mothers rated their fathers as more supportive than did younger White mothers, but these differences did not exist among Black adolescent mothers. The effects of self-esteem and parental relationships on adolescent depressive symptomatology were also examined. Self-esteem and supportive relationships with fathers were both negatively associated with depressive symptomatology among adolescent mothers. These data highlight the need to consider multiple factors that contribute to the emotional adjustment and psychological well-being of adolescent mothers. Implications of findings for mental health service delivery are discussed in this article.

AB Objective: To compare parent-reported problems for children in 12 cultures. Method: Child Behavior Checklists were analyzed for 13,697 children and adolescents, aged 6 through 17 years, from general population samples in Australia, Belgium, China, Germany, Greece, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Results: Comparisons of 12 cultures across ages 6 through 11 and 9 cultures across ages 6 through 17 yielded medium effect sizes for cross-cultural variations in Total Problem, Externalizing, and Internalizing scores. Puerto Rican scores were the highest, while Swedish scores were the lowest. With great cross-cultural consistency, Total and Externalizing scores declined with age, while Internalizing scores increased; boys obtained higher Total and Externalizing scores but lower Internalizing scores than girls. Cross-cultural correlations were high among the mean item scores. Conclusions: Empirically based assessment provides a robust methodology for assessing and comparing problems reported for children from diverse cultures. Age and gender Variations are cross-culturally consistent. Although clinical cutoff points should not necessarily be uniform across all cultures, empirically based assessment offers a cost-effective way to identify problems for which children from diverse cultural backgrounds may need help.

AB Background. Many social and demographic correlates of psychiatric disorder have shown marked secular changes in recent decades. This study was designed to explore some of the implications of these trends, focusing on the illustrative case of teenage motherhood.
   Method. Prospective data from two British birth cohort studies (the 1946 and 1958 cohorts) were used to examine the social, educational and behavioural precursors of teenage versus older age at motherhood, and the implications of teenage motherhood for women's later marital and social circumstances and risks of psychiatric morbidity, in samples born 12 years apart.
   Results. Educational and social disadvantage were associated with similarly increased risks of teenage motherhood in both cohorts, but the findings suggested an additional association with teacher-rated adolescent conduct problems in the more recent sample. Rates of teacher-rated emotional problems were not elevated among teenage mothers in either cohort. In adult life, teenage motherhood was associated with a range of adverse social outcomes, including partnership breakdowns, large family size, and poorer housing conditions. Relative risks of these adult adversities were similar for teenage mothers in the two cohorts, but absolute levels of adversity were higher in the more recent sample, reflecting general secular changes in many of the indicators involved. In the later, but not the earlier, cohort, teenage motherhood was also associated with increased risks for psychiatric morbidity in adulthood.
   Conclusions. The findings underline the importance of taking account of secular trends in examining the impact of psychosocial risks.

AB The relations of Ego control (EC), Ego resiliency (ER), and the Five-Factor Model of Personality (FFM) with behavioral and emotional problems were explored among 116 clinic-referred children. Within the EC-ER model, Ego undercontrol was most important in predicting externalizing problems, and both Ego brittleness (the relative absence of ER) and Ego undercontrol made equaI contributions to predicting internalizing problems. Within the FFM, Extraversion and Agreeableness were independent predictors of externalizing problems, whereas only Neuroticism predicted internalizing problems. When me EC-ER model was tested against the FFM, the latter model appeared to outperform the former in predicting externalizing but not internalizing problems; when clinical syndrome groups were examined, dimensions from both personality models were differentially salient for children with primary internalizing, externalizing, or comorbid problems.

AB Objective: To measure the effect of war trauma on the functional health and mental health status of Cambodian adolescents living in a refugee camp on the Thai-Cambodian border. Method: A multistage probability sample identified 1,000 households in the camp known as Site Two. interviews were conducted in each household with randomly selected adults 18 years of age and older, All adolescents aged 12 and 13 years old, along with one parent, were interviewed, One hundred eighty-two adolescents (94 girls, 88 boys) and their parents participated. Culturally sensitive instruments were used, including Cambodian versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Results: Parents and adolescents reported the latter having experienced high levers of cumulative trauma, especially lack of food, water, and shelter. Mean Total Problem scares were in ranges similar to those of adolescents receiving clinical care in the United States, Netherlands, and Israel. Nearly 54% (53.8%) had Total Problem scores in the clinical range by parent report on the CBCL and 26.4% by adolescent report on the YSR. The most commonly reported symptoms were somatic complaints, social withdrawal, attention problems, anxiety, and depression. The dose-effect relationship between cumulative trauma and symptoms was strong for parent reporting an the CBCL; the subscales on both the YSR and CBCL for Anxious/Depressed and Attention Problems revealed dose-effect associations. Dose-effect relationships between cumulative trauma and social functioning or health status were lacking. Conclusion: The high levels of emotional distress in this population of Cambodian adolescents and corresponding dose-effect relationships reveal the important negative psychosocial impact of violence on Cambodian adolescents. Lack of findings related to physical health status and the presence of positive social functioning of many youths should not deter health care providers and public health officials from diagnosing and treating underlying high levels of psychological distress.

AB The 10-year time trends in competencies and problem scores in children and adolescents were assessed. Children and adolescents randomly selected from the Dutch general population in 1983 were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Teacher's Report Form. Their problem scores and competence scores were compared with those obtained by the same method 10 years later. No significant differences were found between the 1983 and 1993 total problem scores obtained from parents or teachers. On the level of problem items and scales, a few differences indicating an increase in problems were found. However, the magnitude of these differences was very small. Our results did not provide evidence for a clear secular increase in malfunctioning of Dutch children and adolescents.

   VALIDATION
AB Relations among maternal depressive symptoms, family discord, and adolescent psychological adjustment were examined in a sample of 443 middle adolescents and their mothers. Histories of maternal depressive symptoms, gathered at 3 occasions with 6-month intervals, were related to subsequent adolescent reports of depressive symptoms, conduct problems, and academic difficulties for girls but not for boys. Mediational tests indicated that girls' greater vulnerability to family discord (e.g., marital discord, low family intimacy, parenting impairments) accounted for the impact of maternal depressive symptoms on their social and emotional adjustment. Analyses suggest that family discord is a strong mediator in the development of girls' conduct disturbances and a modest mediator of girls' depressive symptoms. Results are discussed within a framework that integrates interpersonal models of parental depressive symptoms with the gender intensification hypothesis.

AB Adolescent women (N = 1,025) in grades 7 through 12 in a stratified random sample of Alberta high schools completed measures of emotional problems and suicidal behavior in the past six months, and of frequency and type of sexual assault (including sexual harassment) experienced in school. It was found that 23% had experienced at least one event of assault (sexual touching, sexual threats or remarks, or an incident of indecent exposure); 4% had ''often'' experienced one or more of these assaults or harassments. Those experiencing a high number of sexual assaults or harassments were significantly more likely to have clinical profiles on the measures of emotional disorder; 15% of 38 women experiencing frequent, unwanted sexual touching had ''often'' made suicidal gestures or attempts in the previous six months, compared with 2% of 824 women with no experience of sexual assault.

AB This report summarizes the experience of 61 female adolescents recruited through a private adolescent family planning clinic, and 183 9th through 12th-grade adolescents recruited from a private suburban high school regarding their experiences with dating relationships, sexual communication skills. and psychological status. The samples were predominantly white and middle to upper income. Perceptions of interpersonal communication skills were analyzed according to gender, clinic versus school, and history of sexual coercion. The adolescents were generally confident that they could assert their own preferences and stand up to others regarding sexual issues with the exception of the small group of high school males reporting having had experienced sexual coercion. This group (N = 20) expressed difficulty in talking to their partners about safer sex, getting their partner(s) to listen to them, or turning down alcohol or drugs prior to having sex. These boys were also more likely to report missing classes or having other kinds of trouble with school, to be concerned about use of alcohol and drugs, and about feeling unpopular. None of the female groups had this profile of communication and emotional problems. Implications for preventive education programming on interpersonal skills and sexuality are considered.

ID TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY; FOLLOW-UP; RELATIVES; WORK
AB Thirty-one young people, who were experiencing chronic sequelae of a head injury sustained at least 1 year previously, were interviewed in-depth about the impact head injury had had on their lives. Their functioning was also assessed using the Offer Self-image Questionnaire (OSIQ-R). The main theme raised by subjects was that they had not received adequate explanation of the emotional problems associated with head injury and relevant support in coming to terms with their condition. Head injury had had a devastating effect on their lives, causing limitations in day-to-day activities, employment, education and relationships, and they scored significantly below norms on the OSIQ-R scale of self-confidence. However, these young people had a predominantly positive attitude towards life, which appeared to be related to their appreciation of how fortunate they had been to survive. They scored significantly above norms on the OSIQ-R scale of Social Functioning. Markers of poor functioning were identified and, in clinical practice, could be used as a method of highlighting those head-injured young people who potentially are most in need of support. The findings have implications for future research directions, service delivery and planning, in that particular weaknesses of current provision are demonstrated and recommendations made for improvements.

AB Using a 2-wave longitudinal design with a 6-month interval, associations were examined between substance use and emotional/behavioral adjustment among 138 inner-city ninth-grade students. Substance use was operationalized in terms of self-reported severity of problems associated with use of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. Adjustment was measured based on various sources including ratings by the self by peers, and by teachers, as well as school records. Cross-sectional data indicated that drug use showed associations in expected directions with all indices of adjustment with the exception of peer-rated sociability. Longitudinal analyses indicated that high level of drug use early in the year were related to subsequent increases in behavioral and emotional maladjustment. Early maladjustment, across different domains, conversely, was minimally associated with escalations in drug use. Results are discussed in terms of mechanisms potentially underlying prospective associations, as well as implications for interventions.

AB The Weinberger Adjustment Inventory (WAI; D. Weinberger & G. Schwartz, 1990) was designed as a hierarchical self-report measure of general social-emotional adjustment in older children and adults. The superordinate constructs of distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and low well-being) and self-restraint (i.e., impulse control, suppression of aggression, consideration of others, and responsibility) are each operationalized as a composite of 4 subscales. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using 6 samples (ns = 153-392; N = 1,486). The factor structure was highly comparable with a mean comparative fit index (CFI) of .968 for youth (ages 10-17), young adults (ages 18-30), and adults (ages 31;65) within both clinical outpatient and nonclinical populations. The results suggest that there may be little justification for the routine practice of using different measures of general adjustment when investigating older children vs. adults.

AB The aim of this study was to establish rates of behavioural and emotional problems, and of social maladjustment, in a population of deaf children, particularly in relation to different methods of communication. The parents of 84 children who attended two schools for the deaf took part. They completed the parents' checklist (PCL), a behaviour rating scale for deaf children, and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), a measure widely used in the general population. The two instruments were significantly correlated on the severity of behavioural and emotional problems, but their previously established cut-off scores detected different rates of possible clinical cases, i.e. children with mental health disorders. According to the CBCL, 40% of children were within the clinical range, and 82% were socially dysfunctional compared with the general population. The PCL identified a much higher percentage (77%) of caseness. Behavioural and emotional problems were significantly higher in Asian children. Although all subjects used sign language, the additional use of speech, which may indicate increased hearing ability, had a protective effect for adolescents. The findings are discussed in relation to the validation of the instruments and the development of intervention programmes for deaf children.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to describe the empirical results of a community consultation process designed to help a children's mental health agency review its mandate. We report in this article findings related to three essential ingredients of the renewal project: values, needs, and services. Data from 557 people representing various stakeholder groups were collected using mail-out questionnaires and 12 focus groups. Findings reveal that stakeholders envision a Center that is both accessible and responsive to its clients. In terms of the mental health needs of children and youth, three areas were highlighted: (a) conduct disorders and behavioral problems, (b) emotional problems, and (c) problems related to sexual abuse. Youth reported significant difficulties with substance abuse and family problems. Adult respondents recommended a change in the Center's budget to allow for more prevention-oriented services. The challenge for the Center was to incorporate the community's suggestions into their mandate and to continue to involve relevant stakeholders throughout the agency's renewal process. Some of the changes that have taken place since the mandate review are reported. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Objective: To generate rates of DSM-III-R disorders in a sample of preschool children from low-income families, examine impairment ratings for preschool children meeting criteria for DSM-III-R disorders, and compare rates of psychopathology using DSM-III-R criteria with rates generated by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Method: As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of 104 mother-child dyads from low-income families, data were gathered when children were 5 years of age. DSM-III-R disorders were diagnosed through the administration of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children to the mothers, and mothers competed the CBCL. Results: Rates of DSM-III-R disorders among preschool children from low-income families were higher than those reported in community samples, but comparable with rates for low-income school-age children and adolescents. Children meeting criteria for DSM-III-R disorders were rated as significantly impaired. The prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems was similar by both DSM-III-R criteria and the CBCL. There was some evidence, however, that the two systems identified different children. Conclusions: DSM-III-R criteria appear to adequately identify preschool children with serious behavioral and emotional problems. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore further the relative utility of the DSM and CBCL in the identification of psychopathology in preschool children.

AB Data from a large community sample of adolescents were analysed to investigate the differences between adolescents living in intact families, one parent families and stepparent families with regard to emotional problems and suicidality. The results indicated that, in general, adolescents from one parent and stepparent families reported a lower self-esteem, more symptoms of anxiety and loneliness, more depressed mood, more suicidal thoughts and more suicide attempts than children from intact families.
   Some differences between boys and girls were found. Boys from stepparent families had more emotional problems than boys from one parent families, whereas girls from one parent families had more such problems than girls from stepfamilies. Further, the lifetime prevalence rate of suicide attempts was much higher both for girls living in a one parent and stepparent family than for girls living in an intact family. For boys, living with a stepparent was related to a higher prevalence rate of suicide attempts, whereas living in a one parent family was not.

ID SYMPTOMATOLOGY; VICTIMIZATION; IMPACT
AB Objective: To compare sexually abused boys with sexually abused girls and with their non-sexually abused counterparts with regard to (1) the type of mental health problems they experience; and (2) the number and patterns of such problems. Method: The sample comprised 745 secondary school students, aged 12 to 19 years, with a self-reported history of sexual abuse (151 boys and 594 girls) and 745 matched students without such a history. Sexually abused and nonsexually abused boys and girls were compared with regard to four problem categories: emotional problems, aggressive/criminal behaviors, addiction-risk behaviors, and suicidality. Results: A larger proportion of sexually abused adolescents than nonabused adolescents reported problems in the separate categories and in a combination of problem categories. Sexually abused boys had considerably more emotional and behavioral problems, including suicidality, than their female counterparts. There were differences between the specific combinations of problem categories reported by sexually abused girls and boys. These differences could not be attributed to the finding that sexually abused boys were more often the victim of concurrent physical abuse than sexually abused girls. Conclusions: The results suggest that although there was a strong association between being sexually abused and the existence of a multiple problem pattern in both sexes, the aftermath for boys might be even worse or more complex than for girls.

AB Strategies used by 84 sexually abused children, ages 7 to 12, to cope with their abuse were evaluated, along with child reported abuse-related symptoms, parent-reported behavioral symptoms, and teacher-reported behavioral symptoms. Principal components analysis of coping yielded four strategies that were labeled avoidant coping, internalized coping, angry coping, and active/social coping. Each coping strategy was found to be associated with a unique set of abuse characteristics, abuse related social environment, and symptoms,In contrast to findings with adult survivors and adolescents, use of avoidant coping strategies among school-age children was found to be related to fewer behavioral problems, although it was also associated with greater sexual anxieties. Internalized coping was found to be associated with increased guilt and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms. Active/social coping was the only strategy found to be unrelated to symptoms, but neither was it associated with measured benefits. In contrast to some clinical opinion that externalizing blame and venting anger is a helpful strategy, angry coping was found to be associated with a wide range of behavioral and emotional problems as rated by the child's home-room school teacher. Results are discussed in terms of a proposed mediational model. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Turmoil for adoptees during their adolescence?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB During the last two decades in the Netherlands foreign adoptions have increased compared to domestic adoptions. In this paper, research studies concerning causes and characteristics of problem behaviour of adopted adolescents are discussed. Adopted adolescents, in particular, face more emotional problems compared to their nonadopted peers, as evidenced in parent reports. However, on the basis of reports from adopted adolescents, coping with four of Havighurst's developmental tasks is satisfactory. However, adopted adolescents report more feelings of insecurity and emotional tension concerning their gender experience with regard to their physical appearance compared to their Dutch peers. Based on the research reviewed and clinical experience at the Utrecht Adoption Centre, risk factors in adoption are summarised.

AB In a household community sample of 1,285, 9-17 year-olds with mental disorders who had received outpatient specialty mental health services in the past year were compared with youths with mental disorders who had not received those services to determine if samples drawn from clinical settings are representative of youths with mental disorders in the general population. Those who had used services were more impaired, less competent, more likely to have comorbid disorders, more likely to belong to non-Hispanic White relative to other ethnic groups, and less likely to be prepubertal girls. Their parents were more educated, but less satisfied with family life, engaged in less monitoring of their children, and more likely to have used mental health services themselves. These findings suggest the hypothesis that samples of youths with mental disorders drawn from outpatient clinical settings are not representative of all youths with mental disorders. If confirmed, this would indicate the importance of population-based samples for the study of psychopathology in youths.

AB Objective: Forty-four percent of adolescent girls who had been screened for absence of psychiatric disorder reported depressive symptoms on a structured interview. Girls reporting symptoms were assigned to a depression group and compared to those who were free of depressive symptoms on behavioral and neuropsychological measures to determine if there were meaningful differences in cognition, behavior and motivation/self-perception between groups. Method: Adolescent girls were randomly selected from local schools to participate in a study of neuropsychological development in adolescence. Those who volunteered and whose parents reported them to be free of psychiatric disorders were enrolled and completed a battery of behavioral, neuropsychological and motivation/self-perception measures. Results: The depressed group showed more behavioral problems, evaluated themselves as less competent, showed more extrinsic motivational orientation, had lower IQ and differed on a measure of visual spatial perception. Conclusion: The frequency of subclinical depression is high in adolescent girls, even when parents report no psychiatric/emotional problems. The increase in problem behaviors and extrinsic motivation, as well as the decrease in feelings of self-worth suggest that this group may benefit from intervention. Poorer performance on a measure of visual spatial perception needs further investigation to confirm its association with depression and understand its relationship to depressive symptoms.

AB Nosological (symptom overlap) and methodological (informant) artifact in the covariation of an empirically derived syndrome of anxious-depressed symptoms with 7 other syndromes of emotional and behavior problems was examined in reports by parents, teachers, and adolescents on a nationally representative sample of 908 adolescents. Although minor symptom overlap was observed and the effects of informant were significant, the anxious-depressed syndrome covaried significantly with all other syndromes after controlling for these effects. Indices of covariation controlling for informant effects were all significant and ranged for all syndromes except for delinquent behavior from .619 to .681, reflecting significant covariation of the anxious-depressed syndrome with both externalizing and internalizing syndromes. Covariation of the anxious-depressed syndrome and delinquent behavior was .470. Implications for research on the comorbidity-covariation of depressive syndromes during childhood and adolescence are highlighted.

AB Highly intelligent and creative persons have long posed interpretation difficulties for users of the Rorschach Inkblot Test. This study examined Exner's (1993) Schizophrenia, Depression, and Coping Deficit indices as adjustment measures in a sample of 43 female adolescents enrolled in an early college entrance program and a comparison group of 19 girls enrolled in public high school gifted programs. Contrary to conventional interpretation, higher scores on the Rorschach Schizophrenia Index among the accelerants were correlated with healthy emotional adjustment on both the California Psychological Inventory and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (SPPA). Further analyses offered support for the hypothesis that among accelerants, elevated scores on the Rorschach constellations did not indicate psychopathology, but rather their creative thinking style.

AB Move than 20 years ago, researchers first noted that children of alcoholics (COA's) appeared to be affected by a variety of problems over the course of their life span. Such problems include fetal alcohol syndrome, which is first manifested in infancy; emotional problems and hyperactivity in childhood; emotional problems and conduct problems in adolescence; and the development of alcoholism in adulthood, Although much has been learned over the ensuing two decades, a number of controversial research areas remain. In particular, debate stems from the fact that despite a common interest in COA's, clinically focused literature and research-focused literature have resulted in two distinct bodies of knowledge. This article reviews important research results, with emphasis on findings generated by the alcohol-research community. Attention also is given to examining the empirical validity of concepts that have been advanced by several influential clinicians from the COA field.

AB A Dutch nation-wide study on young haemophilia patients, whose former treatment placed them at risk for HIV infection, was done to examine the effect of HIV testing, HIV status, disclosure of HIV status and the child's experiences with disease-related information on emotional adjustment. In the Netherlands HIV tests are not routinely performed for paediatric haemophilia patients, but the number of HIV-infected children is estimated to be low (8%). Seventy-two boys with haemophilia, five HIV positive, 51 HIV negative and 16 not tested, and their mothers were interviewed and administered standardized questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses showed no differences in anxiety and depression between HIV-positive, HIV-negative or untested boys, nor between children who were informed or not informed about their HIV status. Conversely, children who experienced more difficulties to obtain information about the their disease were significantly more anxious and tended to be more depressed. No significant differences in emotional distress were found between the patients and a standardization sample of healthy peers. The data provide evidence that children and adolescents with haemophilia cope effectively with their disease and the emotional impact of the HIV threat. There seems to be no reason to protect children from testing or knowing their HIV status. In the absence of compelling medical reasons, however, health care workers should not forcefully advocate testing or early disclosure. Distinct disease and treatment-related factors as well as social factors modify disclosure practices.

Relational variables were expected to be more important in the development of social competence and emotional adjustment for Black students than for White students; there were no directional hypotheses for gender differences. Single-group analyses and multiple-group comparisons revealed that the model fit the data reasonably well for a large sample (N = 630) of Black and White late adolescents. Gender of parent differences emerged, in which attachment to father generally was a more important predictor of social competence than was attachment to mother. In all analyses, social competence was a significant predictor of emotional adjustment. There were no significant differences between groups in comparisons of the relative strengths of construct interrelations.

AB Prisons are receiving increased numbers of inmates with mental and emotional problems. This study describes some of the characteristics and treatment of such an outpatient population. It was determined that a typical patient is a white male, 19 years old, of average intelligence, with a sporadic work record and poor academic performance, who quits high school in his freshman year. He has a history of substance abuse and is likely to have a multidrug habit. He is likely to have had a traumatic childhood and had psychiatric treatment as a child or young adolescent, as well as having attended special classes in school and counseling for drug abuse. The great majority of patients were diagnosed as having either mood, adjustment, or psychotic disorders. All were treated with a psychotropic medication and case management and also with some type of accepted individual and/or group counseling. In this population, there is a high incidence of expression of aggression requiring medication and counseling with the patient's permission. Patients responded well to treatment, but usually requested to discontinue treatment when symptoms diminished. However, approximately half of them returned for medication when symptoms recurred.

ID ACCULTURATIVE STRESS; SELF-ESTEEM
AB In this article emotional problems - operationalized in terms of well-being and feelings of stress/depression - were investigated in secondary school pupils in the Netherlands. Girls, both autochthonous and allochthonous, appear to have more emotional problems than boys. Educational levels did not have an effect on emotional problems. Allochthonous pupils reported more emotional problems than autochthonous pupils. The difference was most pronounced between allochthonous pupils and autochthonous pupils in ethnic autochthonous ('white') schools. Ethnic self-identification is not by itself related to feelings of well-being or stress, but appears to serve as a moderator in this respect: in ethnic minority youngsters with a bicultural orientation (identification with both their own ethnic group and the Dutch), no effect of ethnic attitudes on stress was found, while in those identifying solely with their own ethnic group, negative attitudes towards their own group or towards the Netherlands increases feelings of stress.

AB The reciprocal effects among cognitive-behavioral, environmental, and biological influences on clinic-referred children's (N = 64; 34 boys; M age 12.71 years) short-term psychological and psychiatric adjustment were studied. At clinic intake and 6 months later, standardized measures of adjustment and control-related beliefs were assessed. Before and after conflict-oriented parent-child interaction tasks the children's saliva was sampled. Adrenocortical responses (i.e., increases in salivary cortisol) to the social conflict task predicted children's internalizing problem behaviors and anxiety disorders at follow-up. Consistently high adrenocortical reactivity at intake and follow-up was associated with deflated social competence over the B-month period. Also, specific patterns of discontinuity in children's internalizing behavior problems predicted individual differences in their subsequent adrenocortical responsiveness. Specifically, rising behavior problem levels across time predicted higher and declining behavior problem levels predicted lower adrenocortical reactivity at follow-up. Findings are among the first to suggest links among internalizing behavior problems, adrenocortical responsiveness to social challenge, and clinic-referred children's short-term cognitive-behavioral and emotional adjustment.

AB Investigated the effects of self-regulation as a moderator of the relations between coping efforts and psychological symptoms of children of divorce. The interactions of two dimensions of self-regulation (task orientation and approach-flexibility) and two dimensions of coping (active and avoidant) predicting children's postdivorce symptoms were tested using a sample of 199 divorced mothers and their children, ages 8 to 12. The approach-flexibility dimension moderated the relations of both active and avoidant coping with children's self-report of anxiety. At higher levels of approach-flexibility, active coping was negatively related to anxiety, while at lower levels of approach-flexibility, active coping was unrelated to anxiety Avoidant coping was unrelated to anxiety at higher levels of approach-flexibility, whereas at lower levels of approach-flexibility, avoidant coping was positively related to anxiety. The task orientation dimension did not interact with coping, but had direct, independent effects on children's self-report of conduct problems, depression, and parent-report of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The implications for understanding children's coping with divorce and future directions for research are discussed.

DE family; school; peers; adolescents
AB Objective: To examine (1) the extent to which negative perceptions of support from family, school, and peers differ with regard to their impact on emotional and behavioral problems and (2) the extent to which negative perceptions of multiple social support systems are related to the presence of multiple emotional and behavioral problems in adolescence. Method: The sample comprised 476 high school students, aged 16 to 18 years: 119 without any emotional and behavioral problems, 119 with emotional problems only, 119 with behavioral problems only, and 119 with emotional and behavioral problems. Possible differences between the subgroups were tested with regard to the perceived social support from family, school, and peers, and with regard to the number of negatively perceived support systems. Results: Whereas a negative perception of school was shown to be specifically related to behavioral problems and a negative perception of peers specifically to emotional problems, a negative perception of the family appeared to be strongly related both to emotional and behavioral dysfunction. A strong accumulating effect was found for multiple negatively perceived social environments. Conclusions: The results suggest a dominant role of negatively perceived family support. Therefore, to prevent emotional and behavioral problems in adolescence it is of paramount importance to identify families at risk at the earliest possible stage and to provide training and support for the parents involved.

AB In this study, we examined the demographic and psychological variables associated with seeking help from parents, friends and professionals for coping with emotional problems during early and middle adolescence. Two-hundred and twenty-one adolescents (109 males, 112 females), ranging in age from 13 to 18 years (mean age = 15.0 years), completed measures assessing self-worth, self-consciousness, and locus of control Adolescents were also asked to report whether or not they had sought help from mothers, fathers, fiends, and professionals for assistance in coping with a recent stress event Descriptive analyses revealed that more adolescent females and middle adolescents reported seeking assistance from mothers, fends and professionals than males and early adolescents. While no difference emerged between early and middle adolescent females in their utilization of mothers and fathers as support providers, middle adolescent males were more likely to report seeking help from their fathers than were younger adolescent males. A series of stepwise discriminant function analyses were conducted in order to determine the extent to which age, gender, self-worth, self-consciousness, and locus of control predicted seeking help. For example, females and adolescents with an internal locus of control were more likely to report seeking help from their mothers than males and adolescents with an external locus of control. With respect to fathers, adolescents who sought help from their fathers were less self-conscious than those who did not seek help. Those adolescents who reported seeking help from professionals were older, had lower self-worth, and were less self-consciousness than those adolescents who reported that they did not seek help from professionals. Results are discussed with regard to mechanisms of differential gender socialization during adolescence.

AB This contribution presents results obtained in a 4-1/2-year longitudinal study on 91 adolescents with diabetes and 107 healthy adolescents. We addressed the question of whether chronically ill adolescents show more psychopathological behaviors than healthy adolescents, and if so, whether there are changes within a time span of 4-1/2-years. In addition, we investigated whether adolescents with diabetes differ from healthy adolescents in their feelings of self-esteem and in their developmental status.
   The self-concept of healthy and diabetic adolescents proved to be very similar, and stable over time as well. As regards developmental status, the developmental delays seen in the diabetic subjects at the beginning of the study had disappeared by the end of the study. Throughout the study the diabetic adolescents appeared to be more <<normal>>, showing significantly fewer symptoms of psychopathology than the healthy control group.
   Furthermore, the consistently higher values in social desirability among the diabetic subjects show that the strong denial in these subjects was stable over the 4-1/2-year period.

AB Twenty-six of 30 participants (87%) who took part in a medication study for treatment of ADHD were followed up 2.9 to 4.8 years (Mean = 3.9 years) later: Parent ratings on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Community (ABC-C) indicated continued problems on the acting-out subscales, and parent assessments on the Stony Brook Checklist-3R showed a high rate of difficulty on domains called ADHD, Conduct Disorder; and Separation Anxiety Disorder: A high percentage of children (69%) were taking psychotropic drugs, substantial numbers of their families had sought nonmedical treatments, children's friendships were often rudimentary and a significant minority of children had disciplinary problems in school or difficulty with the law Using Pearson correlations we identified a number of initial variables that predicted follow-up parent ratings on the ABC-C and Stony Brook The ABC-C Irritability subscale was useful in predicting both internalizing and externalizing problems at follow-up, whereas parent and teacher hyperactivity subscales failed to predict later hyperactivity. Children identified with both low intelligence and ADHD appear to have significant behavioral and emotional problems in their early adolescence, and there may be some important qualitative differences in the outcome of these youngsters as compared with that of children identified with ADHD and normal IQ.

AB This study sought to identify which syndromes of initial problems predicted later syndromes among children and youths referred for mental health services. Standardized parent reports on the Child Behavior Checklist obtained at intake were compared to standardized parent, teacher, and self-reports obtained at follow-up. There were 1,103 subjects (774 males and 329 females) 4 to 18 years old, followed up ail average of 6 years after referral High quantitative and categorical stability was found for cross-informant syndromes within samples of younger and older subjects. Throughout childhood and into young adulthood parent ratings of most syndromes at the time of referral predicted the counterpart cross-informant syndrome construct at follow-up, controlling for other types of problems at referral. There were multiple additional independent predictors of many syndromes, including Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, and Shows Off for young adult males. Time I Social Problems and Attention Problems independently predicted diverse problems at Time 2 for younger males. A wide variety of problems also predicted younger males' self-ratings of withdrawal, anxiety, and depression. The stability of problems for the referred sample was similar to that found for demographically matched nonreferred subjects drawn from a national sample.

AB The processes by which children with emotional and behavioral disorders seek and obtain help have received little study; yet, they are critical for determining mental health policy and practice. In this article, help seeking pathways for children are defined and a pathway model is presented. Influences on help-seeking pathways are then reviewed, including illness profile variables, predisposing factors, and barriers to and facilitators of care. Research targets such as the role of informal supports, collateral services, and cultural influences on help-seeking are recommended. Methodological considerations are presented that include assessment of clinically defined mental health need as well as subjective assessment of need, use of complementary qualitative and quantitative methods, and use oi cross-system data. The implications for practice and policy of research on help-seeking pathways are described.

AB Objective: To assess the prevalence and types of psychiatric disorders in a representative sample of schoolage children with the combination of mental retardation (MR) and active epilepsy.
   Subjects and Methods: Ninety-eight children were identified with MR and active epilepsy in a population-based study from Goteborg, Sweden, which has a general population at risk of 48 873 children. They were born between 1975 and 1986 and were 8 to 16 years old at the time of psychiatric examination, Five children had died, 3 had parents who declined participation, and 90 were clinically examined.
   Results: Fifty-three children (59%) had at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis, and the conditions in 30 (33%) could not be classified because of profound severe MR. Twenty-four children (27%) had autistic disorder, and another 10 (11%) had an autisticlike condition. The combination of MR, active epilepsy, and autism or an autisticlike condition occurred at a rate of 0.07% in the general population. The most common seizure types in the group with autism or an autisticlike condition were complex partial, atypical absence, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic.
   Conclusions: Children with MR and active epilepsy suffered from a psychiatric disorder in a majority of those cases in which the children had enough skills and mobility to exhibit behavioral and emotional problems. Many such problems had been undiagnosed despite parental concern and the conviction that the psychiatric problems were the most burdensome in many cases. Neurologists and psychiatrists need to develop better programs for the adequate management of psychiatric disorders in this population.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate emotional distress and suicidal ideation among adolescents with and without chronic illness.
   Methods: Two groups were compared from the Barcelona Adolescent Health Survey (3,129 students aged 14-19 years) data base. The index group included 162 adolescents with chronic conditions (100 females and 62 males) including those with asthma, diabetes, seizures, or cancer. No differences in prevalence of emotional distress or suicidal ideation were found among the four categories of disease. The control group included 865 subjects (383 females and 482 males). No age differences were evident between the index and control groups. Chi-square and Student's t-test were used for intergroup comparisons, with the criterion value set at p < .01 to reduce the probability of type I error. Analyses were conducted separately by gender.
   Results: Compared with controls, a significantly greater proportion of females with chronic illness reported emotional problems, feeling in a bad mood, feeling sad, believing nothing amused them, having suicidal thoughts, expressing depressive symptomatology, and having personal problems needing professional help. In contrast, no significant group differences were found for males. No gender differences were found regarding recent contact with a mental health specialist.
   Conclusions: Chronic illnesses were associated with substantive emotional distress and suicide ideation in females but not in males. Females with chronic conditions did not, however, seek mental health services more often than their non-chronically ill counterparts. This suggests serious shortcomings in identification of ''at-risk'' youth and effective outreach to this population.

AB Short children are often described as having psychosocial problems. These reports may be inaccurate as former studies have relied largely on parental report. Psychosocial functioning of short children was assessed with the aim of using them and their peers as informants.
   Twenty two short (mean (SD) height -2.53 (0.28) SD score) prepubertal children aged between 6 and 11 years were recruited from growth clinics. Comparison children were recruited from each case child's class at school. Cognitive and psychosocial functioning was assessed. Peer relationships were measured using sociometry.
   There were no significant group differences in terms of peer acceptance, self perception, and social competence. Although cases described themselves as receiving less social support from teachers, no differences were evident in other areas of social support.
   Little evidence was found to suggest clinic referred prepubertal short children are psychosocially maladjusted. Further analysis revealed cognitive ability was a better predictor than height for most aspects of behavioural and emotional adjustment.

AB Objective: To review the literature on risk and protective factors as applied to children with chronic and disabling conditions so as to assist the health care professional in developing clinical strategies and interventions.
   Design: Literature review.
   Main Outcome Variables: Risk factors (eg, emotional problems, school failure) and protective variables (eg, family cohesion, school involvement).
   Results: Both risk and protective factors can be identified at multiple levels: the condition, the child, the family, and the community. Conditions that are invisible have remitting-relenting courses, and where the prognosis is uncertain, these conditions are associated with the greatest emotional problems. Males with chronic conditions appear to have more emotional sequelae than do females. Likewise, personality characteristics of sociability and flexibility and physical characteristics of attractiveness are protective. Families with clear boundaries and a capacity to balance competing family needs, maintain flexibility, and ascribe positive meanings to life events all are protective.
   Conclusion: As increasing numbers of children with chronic conditions survive through adolescence to adulthood, the creation of environments where children can optimally develop becomes ever more pressing. II is evident that a range of factors, many amenable lu interventions, can influence outcomes for these young people.

AB This paper reviews the evidence for changing patterns of mental health over time in childhood and youth in Western societies. The evidence suggests that the prevalence of major depression, substance abuse and offending behaviour, as well as the incidence of suicide, is increasing in adolescent populations, particularly among males. There are also indications that problem behaviours among younger children are becoming more common. There is no evidence of a deterioration in the adjustment of the pre-school population.

   SELF-REPORTS; ADOLESCENCE; PERSONALITY; STABILITY; REASONS; CONSUMPTION
AB Individual differences in social-emotional adjustment, jointly defined by levels of distress and self-restraint, were used to evaluate (a) patterns of alcohol use, (b) reasons for use, and (c) associated problems in two college samples of young adults (N = 287 and N = 215). As hypothesized, low self-restraint was associated with high levels of alcohol use, drinking to increase positive affect, and high levels of alcohol-related problems. Subjective distress was not related to levels of use; however, it was associated with drinking to escape negative moods and social discomfort and with excessive alcohol-related problems. Both high distress and low self-restraint predicted problem drinking beyond what could be accounted for by quantity or frequency of alcohol use or by peers' use. Within Weinberger and Schwartz's (1990) six-group typology, reactive individuals (high distress-low restraint) were especially likely to be problem drinkers, even when compared to groups with equivalent alcohol use. In a separate study, knowledgeable peers' reports validated the differences between reactive and repressive individuals, the two groups most likely to have inaccurate self-reports.

AB Objective. Adults with emotional disorders exhibit abnormalities in growth hormone secretion. if these abnormalities were to occur during childhood, they could affect growth. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between youth emotional disorders and stature in early adulthood.
   Methods. Using data from a prospective epidemiologic study of youth psychopathologic status, we used linear regression to examine the prospective relationship between anxiety disorders (separation anxiety and over-anxious disorders) or major depressive disorder in youth and stature in early adulthood.
   Results. Anxiety disorders during childhood prospectively predicted relatively short stature in early adulthood among females, accounting for more than 5% of the variance in adult height. However, these associations were not found among males.
   Conclusions. There may be an association between abnormalities in growth and emotional problems in youth. Further research should examine biological measures related to growth among youth with emotional disorders.

AB Child and adolescent Psychiatry on the one hand and Social Welfare Services and Child Protection on the other share common fields. The theoretical orientation of the Social Sciences differs from that of Psychiatric Medicine, producing a potential of conflict in areas of mutual operation. This report is based on an analysis of the tranferrals from Child and adolescent psychiatric in-patient treatment to foster care. The results show that the children concerned mainly present with conduct disorder plus emotional problems and that the process of transferral is impaired by a number of factors which can be clearly named.

AB This descriptive exploratory study was designed to gain insight into how young people experience growing up with cystic fibrosis (CF). The retrospective longitudinal, life-history method was used to generate grounded theory from 60 accounts by 21 informants (10 with CF and 11 of their family members). Data from repeated in-depth interviews were analyzed using the constant comparative method. An ordinary lifestyle model emerged. Youngsters with CF maintained a dynamic balance between their own perceptions of the disease, others' perceptions of them, and the influence of contextual factors. The disease was found to be of little centrality to their psychosocial lives, and their illness perception followed developmental changes. Managing disease-related information was related to the perceived ability of the listeners to deal with the information and the situational context. The model was compared with competing models, and implications for health care practice and research are discussed.

Data regarding intercourse were collected for lifetime and for 6-month periods at 4 occasions of measurement over a 2-year span. Significant differences in behavioral (e.g., delinquency) and emotional (e.g., depression) problems were indicated via repeated-measures MANOVA analyses. Significant interactions among intercourse patterns, gender, and time on emotional and behavioral problems indicated synergistic relations. Planned comparisons indicated that the transition to the onset of sexual intercourse was associated with increases in delinquency and a slower rate of increase for school grades. Earlier onset and a more persistent pattern of sexual intercourse were associated with more childhood problem behaviors, earlier alcohol use, and higher levels of preadolescent antisocial behavior.

AB Seventy-two members of staff working in children's residential units in a Local Authority were surveyed, to elicit their experiences and evaluations of working with child mental health professionals. Whilst the majority of staff held few or no formal educational qualifications, they emerged as an experienced group, with a level of confidence in their knowledge and skill base. Support was identified as coming predominantly from within units themselves; relatively few staff had direct contact with child psychiatrists or psychologists, although many children received a service. Staff in general felt that child mental health services were not helpful to them in terms of their work with young people. However, the majority of staff indicated a need for greater direct involvement across a range of child behavioural and emotional problems.

AB Scenario-based, self-report measures were developed to assess how people characteristically experience and manage anger from middle childhood through adulthood. The Anger Response Inventories (ARIs) for children, adolescents, and adults each assess (a) anger arousal, (b) intentions, (c) cognitive and behavioral responses, and (d) long-term consequences. Several independent studies provide support for the reliability and validity of the ARIs. Theoretically consistent patterns of correlations were observed with (a) global self-report measures of hostility, aggression, and anger-management strategies (adult version); (b) teacher reports of behavioral and emotional adjustment (child and adolescent versions); and (c) self and family-member reports of behaviors in specific anger episodes (adolescent and adult versions). Findings from additional personality and developmental studies are summarized, further supporting construct validity.

AB In a short-term longitudinal study of 314 U.S. military-dependent children (Grades 2-6) in Berlin, Germany, we examined whether children's coping strategies mediate the relations between their action-control beliefs and anxiety. The results provided only limited support for a mediational hypothesis. At both times of measurement, self-related agency beliefs related to (a) increased prosocial coping, (b) reduced antisocial coping, and (c) reduced anxiety. Prosocial coping was not uniquely related to anxiety. However, antisocial coping did partially mediate the relations between children's action-control beliefs and anxiety over time. Consistent with previous literature, boys reported using antisocial coping more than did girls, and younger children reported using primary control coping strategies more than did older children. Results are discussed in terms of lifespan differences in the development of coping strategies.

   Outcome Measures. Frequencies of student visits to medical providers and mental health and substance abuse counselors and frequencies of diagnostic assignments.
   Results. During a 38-month period, 3818 students attending senior high school made a total of 27 886 visits to three SBHCs. They represented 63% of students enrolled in the SBHCs and approximately 42% of the total school population. There were no significant demographic differences between students attending the SBHCs and the overall student body. However, compared with students who were enrolled in the SBHCs but did not use them, users were more likely to be female and Hispanic. Ninety-four percent of students using the services had visits with medical providers; 25% had visits with mental health counselors; and 8% of students had visits with substance abuse counselors. The fetal annual mean number of student visits was 4.7, and the annual mean numbers of visits for students who used the following services were: medical, 3.3; mental health, 5.8; and substance abuse, 6.8, An average of 1.4 diagnoses were made per visit. The most common major diagnostic categories were emotional problems (29% of all diagnoses), health supervision (13%), respiratory problems (11%), reproductive health problems (11%), and substance abuse problems (8%). Almost one fourth of the students had contact with more than one of the three categories of service provider. Visit frequency increased significantly for students who used two categories of provider (13 to 15 mean total visits compared with 4 to 5 mean total. visits for students who used just one category of provider) and escalated to a mean of 32 total visits if all three categories of service were used.
   Conclusions. Adolescents attending SBHCs had higher rates of visits for health and medical fare than adolescents using traditional sources of medical fare. The proportions of student users of SBHC mental health and substance abuse counseling services were commensurate with the estimated prevalences of these problems in this country's adolescent population. In addition, the mean numbers of visits to mental health counselors in SBHCs compared favorably with adolescent visit rates for mental health services in other settings. Too little information is available about adolescent use of substance abuse services in non-school-based settings to make similar comparisons. In summary, adolescent users of SBHCs seemed to have higher use of medical, mental health, and probably substance abuse counseling services than did adolescents in the general population. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that SBHCs do enhance adolescents' access to care for medical, mental health, and substance abuse problems.

AB The fears of childhood and adolescence may differ from one cultural context to another. We explored this possibility in 1200 American, Australian, Chinese, and Nigerian children and adolescents between 7 and 17 years of age. Responses to a standard fear survey schedule revealed significant differences in the number, content, pattern, and level of fears. Nigerian children and adolescents endorsed fears at higher levels than American, Australian, or Chinese youth who did not differ from one another. However, differences in the pattern and content of fears for boys and girls of different ages were noted across the countries. Results were interpreted within a cultural context, which suggested that cultures which favor inhibition, compliance, and obedience serve to increase levels of fear. Alternative interpretations are offered and limitations of cross-cultural research are explored.

AB Three groups of adolescents who were 14 years old in 1974 were formed on the basis of peer nominations and teacher ratings in an ongoing longitudinal study: 1) reactively aggressive (REA) individuals who displayed reactive, that is, self-defensive aggression but not proactive aggression (43 boys, 35 girls); 2) proactively aggressive (PROA) individuals who attacked another person without a reason (56 boys, 35 girls); and 3) nonaggressive (NONA) individuals who were low in proactive and reactive aggression (48 boys, 45 girls). The groups were compared at ages 8, 14, and 27 in variables representing the constructs of a two-dimensional model of emotional and behavioral regulation. The REA Ss were characterized by higher self-control, especially constructiveness, at each age and better adult adjustment than the PROA Ss. The PROA males were prone to externalizing problems and criminality in adulthood, whereas the PROA females were prone to internalizing problems and neuroticism in adulthood. Both exhibited conduct problems in adolescence, and became heavy users of alcohol in adulthood. The PROA Ss had more children at age 27 than the other Ss. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Three replicable personality types were identified in a sample of 300 adolescent boys and shown to generalize across African Americans and Caucasians. The types had conceptually coherent relations with the Big Five dimensions, ego resiliency, and ego control, and converged with three of the types identified by J. Block (1971). The behavioral implications of the types were explored using several independent data sources. Resilients were intelligent, successful in school, unlikely to be delinquents, and relatively free of psychopathology; Overcontrollers shared some of these characteristics but were also prone to internalizing problems; and Undercontrollers showed a general pattern of academic, behavioral, and emotional problems. This research demonstrates that replicable and generalizable personality types can be identified empirically, and that the unique constellation of traits defining an individual has important consequences for a wide range of outcomes.

AB This study examined family cohesion and power in relation to depressive affect, social self-concept, and behavioral restraint. Based on a sample of 99 young adolescents, cohesion and power were examined within the context of mother-child, father-child, and mother-father relationships. Correlations indicated that parent-child cohesion had a more consistent relation to adjustment for girls than for boys. In contrast, power differences in both of the parent-son dyads were related more consistently to boys' adjustment than to girls'. Egalitarian power relations in the marital dyad were related to the most optimal outcomes for both boys and girls. However, in comparison to girls, boys who perceived mothers to have more power than fathers reported significantly more depressive affect. The role of family functioning in young adolescent boys' and girls' social and emotional development and the use of family systems perspectives for studying adolescent adjustment are discussed.

The commonest problems reported by children were oppositional and depressive symptoms and problems at school. Children reported significant improvement in behaviour and emotional symptoms and in overall severity of dysfunction at follow-up. The correlation of total scores derived from FinnDISC was significant between admission and follow-up. However, the correlations of child interview total scores with parental, teachers', and clinical evaluations of children's behaviour and emotional problems and global functioning were nonsignificant.

AB This study tested the predictive power of a child interview combined with two standardized parent and teacher rating scales, for differentiating matched samples of children with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) or learning disabilities (LD), and nonreferred children. The Semistructured Clinical Interview for Children and Adolescents (SCICA) was administered to 178 subjects ages 6-12. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Most SCICA, CBCL, and TRF scales significantly discriminated between children with EBD and nonreferred children. Many scales also discriminated between children with EBD and LD. Discriminant analyses of combinations of SCICA, CBCL, and TRF scales produced exceptionally high classification rates for EBD versus nonreferred children, with overall misclassification rates of only 3.3-4.4%. Classification rates were lower for EBD versus LD, as expected. Implications are discussed regarding multimethod assessment and interventions for children with behavioral and emotional problems.

AB This study assessed the prevalence of a wide range of behavioral and emotional problems in 706 19- to 24-year-olds from the Dutch general population using the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR). The prevalence rates found can be used to make comparisons with data from individuals or other samples. Large or medium (variance > 5.9%) sex effects were found for alcohol use, for the items 'Brags' and 'Swears' (males > females), and for the items 'Cries a lot' and 'Fears' (females > males). With respect to socially desirable items, females more often reported attitudes or behaviors pertaining to helping other people, while males more often reported competitive behaviors or attitudes. For YASR syndromes, higher mean scores for females than males were found for the Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, and Anxious/Depressed syndromes, while mean scores on the Delinquent Behavior syndrome were higher for males than females. No age effects were found, indicating that normative data were similar across the 19- to 24-year age span. Compared to other problem areas, thought problems and delinquent behavior in males, and social problems and delinquent behavior in females were least likely to be associated with other types of problems. Hence, instruments for the assessment of psychopathology in young adults should include these areas to provide a comprehensive picture of behavioral and emotional problems.

AB In a study about psychosocial stress and coping in families with Cystic Fibrosis, results regarding the social support, the personal social attitudes and the family environment of 26 adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) was compared with a healthy control groups (n = 141). The assessment instruments were an adapted version of the Mannheim interview of social suppers (MISU), a multidimensional personality questionnaire (FPI-R) and the family environment scales (FES). The family status and environment and the social support by the family is comparable with the healthy control group. But the adolescents with CF have only almost half as much younger peers compared with healthy ones. With an average of less than two confidants (peers) they seem to be socially isolated. Their wish for more social support in crisis situations is therefore important. Beside a weak motivation for achievement, their personality traits and the social attitudes are in general appropriate to their age. There is a positive correlation between a good emotional and stimulating family environment and a high familia social support in crises; but also between the general state of health, the social competence and the peer social support.

AB The effects of parental divorce during childhood and adolescence on the mental health of young adults (age 23) were examined, using the National Child Development Study (NCDS), a longitudinal, multimethod, nationally representative survey of all children born in Great Britain during 1 week in 1958 (N = 17,414). Children were assessed at birth and subsequently followed up at ages 7, 11, 16, and 23 by means of maternal and child interviews, and by psychological, school, and medical assessments. Parental divorce had a moderate, long-term negative impact on adult mental health, as measured by the Malaise Inventory total score, and controlling for economic status, children's emotional problems, and school performance preceding marital dissolution. The likelihood of scoring above the clinical cutoff of the Malaise Inventory rose from 8% to 11% due to parental divorce. This indicated that the relative risk of serious emotional disorders increased in the aftermath of divorce, but that the large majority of individuals did not exhibit such risks. Path analyses revealed that the negative effects of divorce on adult mental health operated indirectly through higher emotional problems and lower levels of school achievement and family economic status at age 16. Results related to timing of divorce, remarriage, and interactions between age 7 emotional problems and divorce, and between age 7 emotional problems and child gender, are also discussed.

The 275 children were in kindergarten through eighth grade; they completed the Children's Depression Inventory and either the ''Fight'' or ''Game'' version of the Child Affect Questionnaire (CAQ-F or CAQ-G). Children who endorsed higher levels of depressive symptoms generally reported using affect regulation strategies significantly less often than did nondepressed children, and they rated these responses as significantly less effective in altering their negative mood. Depressed girls rated mother-initiated affect regulation strategies as less effective than did nondepressed girls. Younger children rated both self- and mother-initiated strategies as more effective than did older children. Several directions for future research are suggested.

AB This paper uses a functionalist view of emotion to consider family factors that create risk for depressive symptoms in adolescents. Two adolescent siblings and their mothers were assessed for emotion regulation during autonomy-related communication tasks, whereas their mother's attachment- and intimacy-related functioning was assessed through interview and self-report. The results indicate that older teens' failure to establish autonomous stances during communication and their mothers' dissatisfaction with intimate relationships increase risk for teenagers reporting depressive symptoms. Further, mothers' preoccupation with attachment-related issues was found to be associated with less autonomous communication from older teenagers. Implications of these findings and future directions for investigating the family factors associated with adolescent depression are discussed.

Method: Subjects from the general population (N=459), aged 13-16 years, were evaluated initially with the Child Behavior Checklist (completed by parents) and 8 years later with the Young Adult Self-Report. The scoring format and factor structure of the two assessment instruments are similar; syndromes constructed from the two instruments are based on parents', teachers', and self-report information derived from large clinical samples. Signs of maladjustment also were assessed at follow-up through interviews. Results: Of the individuals with total problem scores in the deviant range on the Child Behavior Checklist, 27.3% had total problem scores in the deviant range on the Young Adult Self-Report at follow-up. The probability of having a total problem score in the deviant range at follow-up was raised 7.4-fold by having deviant-range scores on the Child Behaviour Checklist somatic complaints and anxious/depressed syndromes (simultaneously) at the initial assessment. Referral to mental health services was predicted by deviant-range scores on the anxious/depressed syndrome, while suicide attempts were predicted by deviance on the withdrawn syndrome. Conclusions: Adolescent problems tended to persist into young adulthood to a moderate degree. High rates of withdrawal from social contacts, anxiety or depression, somatic complaints without known medical origin, social problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior during adolescence were risk factors for specific types of psychopathology and maladjustment at 8-year follow-tie. The presence of psychopathology in adolescence should not be regarded as normative.

AB Discrepancies between adolescents' and their parents' perceptions of family functioning were examined in a sample of 74 sixth- and seventh-grade students and their parents during the fall and the spring of the school year. The effect of both the adolescent's gender and the gender of the parent an differences in perceptions was explored. In addition the relation between discrepancies in perceptions of family functioning and adolescent emotional adjustment war examined. Results indicated that girls and boys perceived lower levels of family cohesion than did their parents. Girls also perceived lower levels of family adjustment than did both parents. Not surprisingly, mothers' and fathers' perceptions of family functioning were more similar to one another than the adolescents' perceptions (especially boys') were to either parent. Discrepancies in perceptions of family functioning also were related to the adolescents' reported levels of depressive symptomatology and anxiety particularly for girls.

AB There is ample empirical evidence supporting the view of emotional disturbances in children with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) as well as in their parents. However, controlled studies have reported that such manifestations can also be found in patients with other chronic ailments. In order to characterize further the nature of emotional factors in RAP patients, we conducted a controlled psychological evaluation of 46 consecutive new patients with RAP, aged 7-17 years, (group A) by means of structured interviews and questionnaires. Two control groups of pediatric patients with chronic illnesses were also assessed using the same methodology. Group B consisted of 22 individuals with chronic abdominal pain and endoscopy-proven peptic ulcer or duodenitis, and group C consisted of 24 individuals with chronic, stable, non-gastroenterological diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus or physical handicaps). Parents were evaluated for depressive symptoms. One-way analysis of variance and contingency tables were used for statistical comparisons. There was a higher proportion of female patients in group A than in group B (70 vs 41%; p<0.05). There were significantly more patients in group A than in group B that reported that their abdominal pain: a) never appeared during sleep, b) began soon after the patient's arousal in the morning, c) remitted completely or was alleviated during school holidays, d) its remission was usually spontaneous during the day and e) did never interfere with recreational activities. Emotional problems were significantly more prevalent in patients in group B than in those in group A (p = 0.016). Past diagnosis of depression was more frequent in group A mothers (40%) than in those group B (27%), or group C (17%), but these differences did not attain statistical significance. These results suggest that psychological profiles of children suffering from certain chronic conditions (and those of their parents) may be more complex and particular than hitherto recognized. The role of type II error and of some potential socioeconomic and demographic confounding factors must be considered when analyzing the validity of these data.

AB The purpose of this study was to test the applicability of a standardised procedure for assessing Icelandic children's behaviour/emotional problems and competencies, and to identify differences related to demographic variables. This study focuses upon the method of using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) by Achenbach to estimate the reported prevalence by parents and adolescents of emotional and behaviour problems in children from 2-16 years of age and self-reported prevalence of adolescents from 11-18 years, selected at random from the general population, both in urban and rural areas. The information was obtained by mailing checklists with a letter to parents of children 2-10 years of age. The checklists for adolescents 11-18 years of age were distributed by teachers in school. Those adolescents who were not in school received the checklists by mail at their homes. The Child Behavior Checklists used for analyses were completed by 109 parents of 2-3 year old children; 943 parents of 4-16 year old children, and 545 non-referred adolescents from the general population. The rate of response was lowest for the youngest age group, 47%, but increased to 62% with increasing age of the child. The response rate among the adolescents answering the Youth Self Report was 64%. Comparisons with the Child Behavior Checklist from this study are presented with Dutch, American, French, Canadian, German and Chilean samples and show striking similarities in four of these countries on the behaviour/emotional problems reported.

AB Objective: The prevalence of DSM-III-R traumas and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their impact on psychosocial functioning were examined in a community population older adolescents. Method: Subjects were 384 adolescents participating in an ongoing longitudinal study. When subjects were aged 18 years, the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, Version IIIR, was used to identify lifetime traumatic events and diagnoses of PTSD, major depression, phobias, and substance dependence. Behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning in later adolescence was evaluated through self-report measures and school records. Results: More than two fifths of adolescents experienced at least one DSM-III-R trauma by age 18 years; PTSD developed in 14.5% of these affected youths or 6.3% of the total sample. Youths with PTSD demonstrated widespread impairment al age 18, including more overall behavioral-emotional problems, interpersonal problems, academic failure, suicidal behavior, and health problems, as well as an increased risk for additional disorders. An equally striking finding was that youths who experienced traumas but did not develop PTSD also showed deficits in many of these areas when compared with their peers who had not experienced traumas. Conclusions: The substantial risk faced by youths in community settings for experiencing traumas and PTSD, along with associated impairments in later adolescence, underscores the need for programs of prompt intervention.

AB According to coping-competence theory, current challenge encounters determine future life outcomes and competence. This theory provides a testable causal model of the development of persistent aggression. The model suggests that protective circumstances enable resilient youth to cope prosocially (helping self without harming others) even with uncontrollable challenges. Unprepared for language-based prosocial coping, high-risk youths' antisocial coping yields adverse life outcomes (e.g., school expulsion, teen pregnancy, police arrest). Each adverse outcome increases future antisocial coping, threatens future competence (i.e., self-definition, social reputation, dominant coping strategy), and aggravates status on risk-protection variables (i.e., parent warmth and skill, child temperament and intelligence). The same structural model may apply across the lifespan with changes in indicators and weighting of constructs during key developmental transitions. Part 2 presents the model's prevention implications.

AB Previous studies of the general emotional adjustment of early college entrants have not investigated the social adjustment of adolescents who leave home to attend a residential program. This study assessed the social adjustment of female early college entrants using standard measures of adjustment and two comparison groups (traditional college students and boarding school students). Social adjustment was assessed in the areas of social activities, social skills, social confidence, social conformity, and social support. Although all groups evidenced good overall adjustment, there were noteworthy group differences. Early entrants evidenced higher social conformity and solitary activity than boarding students, who had more social activity. Early entrants and college students evidenced similar social adjustment, but early entrants reported a high level of dissatisfaction with their social lives. Overall, female early college entrants in a single-gender residential program are socially well-adjusted although there are specific areas in which their social adjustment could be improved.

AB A variety of sociocultural, familial and individual features associated with the eating disorders were examined in subjects with full syndrome (FS) and partial syndrome (PS) eating disorders and in normal high school students. The EAT-26 was administered to 995 high school students. This was followed by individual interviews with those who scored in the symptomatic range. Fifty-one students with PS eating disorders, 57 students without eating disorders (normal controls) and 30 hospital patients with FS, anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa were compared on subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory, the Diagnostic Survey for Eating Disorders and the Beck Depression Inventory. The three groups displayed statistically significant differences on dimensions of EDI subscales Ineffectiveness and Interoceptive Awareness and also with respect to depression, history of being overweight and past history of emotional problems, as well as having mothers with medical illnesses. On these characteristics, the FS subjects displayed higher levels than the PS subjects, who in turn were higher than the NC subjects. The PS subjects displayed elevations on Body Dissatisfaction (EDI subscale), past medical illnesses, and mother's over-concern with eating and weight. These data support a continuum model of the eating disorders, but a continuum of multiple associated features rather than of dieting.

AB A scale based on underlying core beliefs generated by the experience of epilepsy was developed. The scale, with measures of coping, adaptability, and knowledge, was used to examine the commonly-reported differences in emotional adjustment between patients (EP) and a non-epileptic population (NEP).
   The EP had significantly lower perceived self efficacy and was more depressed and anxious than the NEP controls. The NEP showed greater knowledge of medical aspects of epilepsy than the EP. Positive correlations between scale values and measures of mastery, self esteem, affect balance, felt stigma and impact of epilepsy were found. Factor analysis produced a three factor solution of emotion, knowledge and anxiety which explained 61.6% of the variance in scores.
   Results are discussed in terms of Bandura's theory of self efficacy as the motivating and sustaining force in the ability to change behaviour. Core beliefs are central to both the development and maintenance of anxiety and depression in epilepsy patients and need to be addressed in any attempts at remedial intervention.

AB We investigated the long-term effects of parental divorce in childhood on demographic outcomes in young adulthood, using a British longitudinal national survey of children. Our analyses control for predisruption characteristics of the child and the family, including emotional problems, cognitive achievement, and socioeconomic status. The results show that by age 23, those whose parents divorced were more likely to leave home because of friction, to cohabit, and to have a child outside marriage than were those whose parents did not divorce. Young adults whose parents divorced, however, were no more or less likely to many or to have a child in a marriage. Moreover, even in the divorced group, the great majority did not leave home because of friction or have a child outside marriage.

AB Development of somatic symptoms and associations with psychosocial risk factors were investigated in a longitudinal study of Norwegian children aged 4-10 years. Complaints of stomach-ache only were associated with emotionally well-adapted children, and mothers with low education and high emotional support. Children complaining of headache only behaved well as preschoolers, showed a tendency towards high achievement motivation at school and their mothers were employed outside the home. Children with the co-occurrence syndrome seemed to constitute a separate entity. They differed from the others as the syndrome was associated with previous behavioural and emotional problems, current emotional disturbances and mothers with less support. Family demographic stability, further child health problems and school factors were not associated with the co-occurrence syndrome.

AB We investigated the preference and perceived efficacy of coping strategies used to manage chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis in 57 pediatric oncology patients. Over 85% of children preferred ''Wishful Thinking,'' ''Emotional Regulation,'' and ''Distraction'' to cope with nausea and ''Emotional Regulation'' to manage emesis. Stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that the coping strategy used and its perceived efficacy depended upon patient age and gender; severity of symptom distress, time elapsed from last chemotherapy, experience and whether nausea or emesis was the identified problem. Successful copers, defined as those reporting high coping efficacy and minimal distress, composed only 25% of the sample These children most often used ''Problem Solving'' combined with ''Social Support'' for symptom management. Successful coping was also associated with lower emetogenic potential of chemotherapy. The significance of these results is discussed for identifying high-risk children who may benefit from coping interventions.

AB Few studies have examined social competence in adolescents utilizing multiple sources of data, or have examined the role of the internal representation of others in terms of social problem-solving skills and social competence. The purpose of this study was to examine how constructs within social-cognitive (i.e., the problem-solving skill involving perspective integration) and object relations theory (i.e., internal representation of others) are related to adolescents' social adjustment assessed via self-report, teacher ratings, and behavioral observations. Results indicated that adolescents (N = 56) with more advanced problem-solving skills reported fewer behavioral/emotional problems, were rated as less aggressive by teachers, and were rated as more competent in behavioral interactions. Furthermore, adolescents' problem-solving skills appeared to mediate the relationship between the representation of others and behavioral ratings of competence. These results suggest that a broader understanding of social competence in adolescence can be attained by including information on the internal representation of others, which is consistent with the approach that involves integrating concepts from different theoretical viewpoints (i.e., social cognitive and object relations).

SO EDUCATIONAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Adolescents face a range of problems in all industrialized nations In Japan, middle school teachers have a variety of committees and support systems available to assist them in counseling early adolescents. Beginning with two case studies, the author examines the specific systems teachers use. Due to the absence of formal counselors in Japanese schools, teachers are required to provide counseling for a variety of serious mental and emotional problems. Although the system works well on a preventative basis, it can substantially drain a teacher's time if a child's problems are severe in comparing Japanese and U.S, systems the author finds that some of the basic organizational elements used by the Japanese have been implemented in California schools. The author argues for a systematic effort at reform rather than trying to adopt certain techniques piecemeal.

ID CHILDREN
AB One hundred and seventy-four 8th grade students attending English-speaking intel national schools in Tokyo were surveyed to examine the relationship between their adjustment overseas and a number of factors believed to be associated with adjustment. Students who had lived in Tokyo less than 6 years completed a self-administered 98-item questionnaire which included questions related to preparation time, familiarity with culture and language, feelings about living in Tokyo, school performance, family and peer relationships, and emotional adjustment. Correlations and multivariate analysis revealed three main findings: children overall report high levels of satisfaction abroad and appear to fare well; the most important correlate of a child's sense of well-being relates to his or her family life; and the degree to which children like living in Tokyo does not correlate with their well-being while abroad. These findings refute some claims in the popular press, but they are consistent with research an within-country moves, which has found few significant or enduring negative effects on children. The implications for professionals working with children who have recently relocated overseas are discussed.

AB Describes issues related to application of the Child Behavior Checklist and its related instruments, the Teacher's Report Form and Youth Self-Report in research in clinical child psychology.  Salient issues include the following:  (a) limited sensitivity of the instruments to identify less serious behavioral problems or changes in level of behavioral problems that are below the threshold for disturbance; (b) limited and potentially misleading assessment of social competence; (c) possible bias in interpreting data concerning physical symptoms; (d) difficulties of interpreting data obtained from culturally, ethnically, and economically diverse samples; (e) problems created by using norms for the instruments in lieu of comparison groups; (f) difficulties raised by combining data across informants; and (g) subjectivity in scoring.  Investigators should be aware of these issues when collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data in clinical child psychology research.

AB The literature concerning three aspects of attachment (neurobiological influences, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors, and societal factors) in the psychological development of children with chronic disease and disability is reviewed. The literature suggests that these three attachment processes are reciprocally interactive, complicated by aspects of childhood disability, and potentially related to the development of emotional maladjustment. An understanding of attachment processes may have important implications for facilitating adjustment in the young child and ameliorating psychopathology in the adolescent and adult with a disability.

AB Objective: To test developmental paths from adolescent syndromes and other candidate predictors to young adult syndromes. Method: A national sample assessed at ages 13 through 16 and 16 through 19 years was reassessed at 19 through 22 years in terms of six syndromes derived empirically from parent and self-reports, two syndromes derived only from parent reports, and one derived from self-reports. Results: Several young adult syndromes were similar to adolescent syndromes and were strongly predicted by these syndromes. A new syndrome designated as Shows Off and an adult Aggressive Behavior syndrome were both predicted by the adolescent Aggressive Behavior syndrome. This indicates a developmental transition away from overt aggression among some aggressive youths but not others. A syndrome designated as Irresponsible was predicted by the adolescent Attention Problems syndrome and may be an adult phenotype of attention deficit disorder. Surprisingly, attention problems were associated with more diverse problems among females than males. Conclusions: There are strong predictive relations from adolescent to adult syndromes. Sex differences in predictive paths argue against basing assumptions about both sexes on findings for one sex.

AB Objective: To investigate the 4-year course of behavioral and emotional problems from adolescence into young adulthood in a general population sample. Method: The population consisted of 364 individuals, aged 15 to 18 years at the beginning of the study. Subjects filled out the Youth Self-Report at the first time of assessment. At follow-up, 2 and 4 years later, subjects aged 19 or older completed the Young Adult Self-Report, which was derived from the Youth Self-Report. Results: Almost 40% of the adolescents who were classified as deviant initially were still deviant 4 years later. There was no significant difference in the continuity of internalizing problems versus externalizing problems in this sample. Conclusions: All types of problems tended to persist to a similar degree. This holds also for problems that are often regarded as typical childhood problems, such as attention problems and hyperactivity. Because adolescent problems are likely to continue, we need more knowledge on the efficacy of interventions.

SO ADAPTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUARTERLY

DT Article
AB Measures of athletic identity and sport orientation, developed from self-schema theory, social role theory, and achievement motivation theory, were used to examine international adolescent swimmers with disabilities. The multidimensional Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (Brewer, Van Raalte, & Linder, 1993) was used to assess self-identity, social identity, exclusivity, and negative affectivity. The Sport Orientation Questionnaire (Gill and Deeter, 1988) measured competitiveness, win orientation, and goal orientation. Swimmers reported (a) a strong self-identity, (b) a moderate to strong social identity, (c) negative affectivity with lower levels of exclusivity, (d) strong competitiveness and goal orientation, and (e) moderate win orientation. Self-identity was correlated with competitiveness, suggesting that swimmers did not simply report an identification with an athletic role; they also reported a strong desire to attain competitive goals. Additionally, exclusivity was associated with negative affectivity, indicating that athletes without diversified self-schemas may be at risk for emotional problems when unable to compete. In general, the results indicated that these swimmers possess a strong athletic identity and that sport is important to them.

AB Previous literature describes Thai children as unusually polite, deferent, and behaviorally restrained. Yet, in a recent study employing teacher reports, Thai children were reported to show many more behavior problems than American children. Such a finding may reflect culture-linked differences in the perspective of Thai versus American teachers. To explore this possibility, we used trained observers to conduct direct observations of Thai and American children's school behavior, and we obtained teacher reports on the same children. Observational results were precisely the opposite of previous and present teacher-report findings: Observers reported twice as much problem behavior and off-task behavior in American children as in their Thai age-mates. This pattern may reflect Thai-U.S. differences in teachers' style, societal values and practices, even child temperament. The findings support the value of direct behavior observation in cross-national research on child problems.

AB In this 6-month prospective study of 138 ninth-grade inner-city students, associations among different aspects of school-based social competence were examined. In addition, links between initial emotional adjustment and subsequent social competence at school were explored. Aspects of social competence examined included academic achievement, peer reputation, and teacher-rated classroom behaviors. Emotional adjustment was measured based on self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Consonant with views positing continuity and coherence of development, high temporal consistency was found within each social competence domain. In addition, superior adjustment in one domain was sometimes associated with subsequent improvements in other spheres as well. Exceptions found to this pattern were that (a) both as an antecedent and as a consequent variable, peer-rated sociability was negatively linked with other indices of school-based functioning, and (b) among girls, high anxiety was related to improved performance at school over the year. Ecological influences in adolescent adjustment are discussed, and implications of the findings for future research are explored.

AB This paper provides an overview of empirically based assessment and taxonomy, as illustrated by cross-cultural research on psychopathology. The empirically based approach uses standardized assessment procedures to score behavioral and emotional problems from which syndromes are derived by multivariate analyses. Items and syndromes are scored quantitatively to reflect the degree to which individuals manifest them, as reported by particular informants. Although the approach to assessing problems and to constructing taxonomic groupings differs from the ICD/DSM approach, there are no inherent contradictions between either their models for disorders nor the criterial features used to define disorders. Cross-cultural comparisons have yielded relatively small differences in problem rates and syndrome structure, plus considerable similarity in associations of problems with sex and SES, as well as similar correlations between reports by different types of informants. Research on variations in problems in relation to culture, sex, age, SES, and type of informant can contribute to improving both the ICD/DSM and empirically based approaches and to a more effective synthesis between them.

AB The relationship between the severity and duration of asthma and psychological adjustment was investigated in 29 children with mild and 31 children with moderately severe asthma, who were compared with 60 healthy control children. The severity of asthma was evaluated using the Pearlman-Bierman classification. Psychological adjustment was measured using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a semi-structured interview. The results of the interviews indicated that regressive symptoms such as clinging, childish behaviour, dependence, and a demanding nature were widespread. Using the illness in the service of achieving other aims was also common in the asthmatic children. CBCL total problem behaviour scores, social competency, and broad band scores were significantly higher in the asthmatic group than the control sample. Problem scores for asthmatic children were significantly correlated with parental friction at home, unsatisfactory relationships with siblings and other health problems in children. However, neither the CBCL total problem scores nor the social competency scores were correlated with the severity and the duration of illness.

AB Behavior problems of adolescents have increasingly come to be examined as psychopathology. A medical/psychological view conflicts with a cultural interpretive approach. Material in the literature that bears on this topic is reviewed and analyzed critically The goal is to illustrate how the concept of culture has been used to enhance understanding of adolescent psychopathology. pertinent studies rely on differing methods, procedures, and conceptualizations of culture and psychopathology itself. Epidemiologists handle culture abstractly and in a static way as a type of independent variable, and psychopathology is operationalized in terms of discreet disorders. Other researchers handle culture more broadly as systems of meaning and tend to examine descriptive aspects of behavior that reflect problems of adjustment. Advantages and disadvantages of the differing approaches are discussed. The need for studies that balance methodologic rigor with interpretive sensitivity is emphasized. Suggestions for enhancing cultural sensitivity are presented.

AB Describes the development and validation of the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC), a standardized instrument completed by lay informants to assess behavioral and emotional disturbance in children and adolescents with mental retardation (MR). Items describing common behavioral and emotional problems in this population were generated by extracting descriptions from 664 case files of children and adolescents with behavior disorders seen at a specialist developmental assessment service over 12 years. These items were reduced to a set of 96 items administered to a sample of 1,093 children and adolescents with mental retardation and then submitted to a principal components analysis. Sir interpretable and partly validated subscales were obtained which explained 36% of the total variance and had satisfactory internal consistency. Interrater and test-retest agreement were satisfactory for both total scale score and for scores on each of the subscales. Good evidence of concurrent validity was provided by substantial positive correlations between total scores on the DBC completed by lay informants and the ratings of experienced psychiatrists based upon interviews and scores on two standardized instruments that must be completed by health professionals The discriminative validity of the total score as assessed by area under the ROC curve was excellent (92%). Standardized norms for the DEC are derived from an epidemiological study of behavior problems in children and adolescents with mental retardation undertaken in two Australian States. Norms are available for the mild, moderate, severe, and profound MR groups and for the MR population as a whole.

AB Investigated somatic and emotional symptoms, functional disability and health service utilization in 31 former RAP patients and 32 former well patients who had originally been interviewed 5 to 6 years earlier. Both former patients and their mothers were interviewed for this follow-up study. Medical records were obtained for those patients who reported receiving new diagnoses for abdominal pain since their initial assessment. Results indicated that only one of the former RAP patients was later diagnosed with organic disease that clearly accounted for his earlier abdominal pain. Nonetheless, at follow-lip former RAP patients reported significantly higher levels of abdominal pain, other somatic symptoms, and functional disability (including school/work absence) than did former well patients. Mothers reported higher levels of internalizing emotional symptoms in former RAP patients than in former well patients.
