AB The experience of cybervictimization is related to health, psychological, and behavioral problems among children and adolescents. Up to today research is scarce, how the persons affected by cybervictimization react and which determinants influence the choice for social, problem-focused, technical, or helpless coping behavior. The current online study with 428 adolescents considers age, sex, mean internet use, frequency of victimization, roles in cyberbullying, and emotional reactions to cybervictimization as potential determinants of the mentioned coping strategies. Based on the participant role approach, roles of cyberbullies, cybervictims, defenders or outsiders are frequently changing. Logistic regression analyses point out the important relevance of emotional reactions like anger or helplessness and the roles as cyberbully-victim or outsider. Further, younger participants reported cybervictimization more often, while the frequency of cybervictimization and sex did not and internet use only partially predict coping strategies. These findings corroborate the relevance of emotional reactions and the roles in the process of cyberbullying. As a starting point for prevention and intervention of cybervictimization, we suggest emotion regulation, teaching of technical coping behaviors as well as reflexion of roles in the context of cyberbullying. If feasible, different stakeholders should be engaged in this process: adolescents, parents, educational staff inside and outside of schools, experts from counseling and therapy as well as internet and mobile phone service providers.

AB This mixed methods study examined the phenomenon of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) of adolescents in Singapore. The researchers analyzed quantitative data to understand the functions of NSSI, the relationship of parental invalidation to NSSI, and the association between academic stress and parental invalidation. In addition, the researchers employed semi-structured qualitative interviews to provide supportive qualitative data. The participants were outpatients at the Child Guidance Clinic, Singapore, between the ages of 13 to 19 years old. Researchers compared 30 participants who engage in NSSI with 30 participants who do not engage in NSSI. The emotional regulation function was the most commonly endorsed function for NSSI. Adolescents who engage in NSSI have statistically significant (p < .01) higher mean parental invalidation scores than those who do not engage in NSSI. There is also a moderate, positive correlation between the level of parental invalidation and the level of academic stress for Singaporean adolescents. The researchers discuss the implications of this study for mental health professionals.

AB Developmental theories of borderline personality disorder (BPD) posit that transactions between child characteristics and adverse environments, especially those in the context of the parent-child relationship, shape and maintain symptoms of the disorder over time. However, very little empirical work has investigated the role of parenting and parent-child transactions that may predict BPD severity over time. We examined maternal and dyadic affective behaviors during a mother-adolescent conflict discussion task as predictors of the course of BPD severity scores across 3 years in a diverse, at-risk sample of girls (N = 74) oversampled for affective instability and their biological mothers. Adolescent girls completed a structured conflict discussion task with their mothers at age 16. Girls' self-reported BPD severity scores were assessed annually from ages 15 to 17. Mother-adolescent interactions were coded using a global rating system of maternal and dyadic affective behaviors. Results from multilevel linear mixed models indicated that positive maternal affective behavior (i.e., supportive/validating behavior, communication skills, autonomy-promoting behavior, and positive affect) and positive dyadic affective behaviors (i.e., satisfaction and positive escalation) were associated with decreases in girls' BPD severity scores over time. Dyadic negative escalation was associated with higher overall levels of BPD severity scores, but negative maternal affective behavior (i.e., negative affect, dominance, conflict, and denial) was not. These findings suggest that the mother-daughter context is an important protective factor in shaping the course of BPD severity scores during adolescence and may be valuable in assessment, intervention, and prevention efforts.

AB Disoriented, punitive, and caregiving/role-confused attachment behaviors are associated with psychopathology in childhood, but have not been assessed in adolescence. A total of 120 low-income late adolescents (aged 18-23 years) and parents were assessed in a conflict-resolution paradigm. Their interactions were coded with the Goal-Corrected Partnership in Adolescence Coding Scales. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the three disorganized constructs (punitive, caregiving, and disoriented interaction) were best represented as distinct factors and were separable from a fourth factor for collaboration. The four factors were then assessed in relation to measures of attachment disorganization, partner abuse, and psychopathology. Results indicate that forms of disorganized behavior first described in early childhood can also be reliably assessed in adolescence and are associated with maladaptive outcomes across multiple domains.

AB IMPORTANCE Pediatric disorders characterized by behavioral and emotional dysregulation pose diagnostic and treatment challenges because of high comorbidity, suggesting that they may be better conceptualized dimensionally rather than categorically. Identifying neuroimaging measures associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation in youth may inform understanding of underlying dimensional vs disorder-specific pathophysiologic features.
   OBJECTIVE To identify, in a large cohort of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth, neuroimaging measures that (1) are associated with behavioral and emotional dysregulation pathologic dimensions (behavioral and emotional dysregulation measured with the Parent General Behavior Inventory 10-Item Mania Scale [PGBI-10M], mania, depression, and anxiety) or (2) differentiate diagnostic categories (bipolar spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multisite neuroimaging study was conducted from February 1, 2011, to April 15, 2012, at 3 academic medical centers: University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants included a referred sample of behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study (n = 85) and healthy youth (n = 20).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Region-of-interest analyses examined relationships among prefrontal-ventral striatal reward circuitry during a reward paradigm (win, loss, and control conditions), symptom dimensions, and diagnostic categories.
   RESULTS Regardless of diagnosis, higher PGBI-10M scores were associated with greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity (r = 0.28) and anxiety with greater right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical (r = 0.27) activity to win. The 20 highest (t = 2.75) and 20 lowest (t = 2.42) PGBI-10M-scoring youth showed significantly greater left middle prefrontal cortical activity to win compared with 20 healthy youth. Disruptive behavior disorders were associated with lower left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win (t = 2.68) (all P < .05, corrected).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Greater PGBI-10M-related left middle prefrontal cortical activity and anxiety-related right dorsal anterior cingulate cortical activity to win may reflect heightened reward sensitivity and greater attention to reward in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth regardless of diagnosis. Reduced left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity to win may reflect reward insensitivity in youth with disruptive behavior disorders. Despite a distinct reward-related neurophysiologic feature in disruptive behavior disorders, findings generally support a dimensional approach to studying neural mechanisms in behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth.

AB Teachers can play a pivotal role in the early identification of children and adolescents with mental health problems. This study investigates how teachers perceive internalizing vs. externalizing problems among students. For this purpose, 345 sixth and tenth grade students in Germany completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Additionally, their teachers were asked to nominate two students per class they believed were most likely to have emotional problems, and which two students per class they believed were most likely to have behavioral problems. The results show that teachers are able to identify children with mental health problems moderately. However, the correlation between teacher nomination and students' self-report is considerably higher for externalizing symptoms than for internalizing symptoms. In addition, this correlation was higher for girls than for boys. Recommendations for teacher training and further research are presented.

AB Purpose Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequent disorders in childhood and adolescence. Both neurocognitive and environmental factors have been related to ADHD. The current study contributes to the documentation of the predictive relation between early attachment deprivation and ADHD.
   Method Data were collected from 641 adopted adolescents (53.2 % girls) aged 11-16 years in five countries, using the DSM oriented scale for ADHD of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach and Rescorla, Manual for the ASEBA school-age forms and profiles. University of Vermont, Research Center for Children, Youth and Families, Burlington, 2001). The influence of attachment deprivation on ADHD symptoms was initially tested taking into consideration several key variables that have been reported as influencing ADHD at the adoptee level (age, gender, length of time in the adoptive family, parents' educational level and marital status), and at the level of the country of origin and country of adoption (poverty, quality of health services and values). The analyses were computed using the multilevel modeling technique.
   Results The results showed that an increase in the level of ADHD symptoms was predicted by the duration of exposure to early attachment deprivation, estimated from the age of adoption, after controlling for the influence of adoptee and country variables. The effect of the age of adoption was also demonstrated to be specific to the level of ADHD symptoms in comparison to both the externalizing and internalizing behavior scales of the CBCL.
   Conclusion Deprivation of stable and sensitive care in infancy may have long-lasting consequences for children's development.

AB Recent evidence suggests that discordant patterns across multiple domains of emotion reveal important differences in socioemotional functioning. As a result of the social and emotional changes of adolescence, we examined how discordant patterns of self-reported experience, heart rate arousal, and expression of self-conscious affect related to internalizing behaviours and emotion regulation habits. Experience, arousal, and expression of girls (n = 49) aged 12-17 were recorded during social stress, a spontaneous speech. Experience referred to internal subjective feelings (self-reported feelings of self-consciousness), arousal reflected internal bodily changes (heart rate change from baseline to speech), and expression referred to observable self-conscious behaviours (e. g., hiding, nervous smiling). Consistent with previous research, between-subjects concordance was weak or nonexistent. Within-subjects tests of discordance revealed two major findings: (1) Greater experience than expression during the speech was related to girls' trait-like shame, and (2) Girls with high experience and expression, but low arousal had more difficulty regulating their emotions and more internalizing problems. This preliminary study with adolescent girls introduces the possibilities of multimethode motion research for the purpose of understanding the development of psychopathology in adolescents.

AB Prior research suggests that for youth in the general population, involvement in activities improves academic, health and social outcomes, but the impact of these activities on youth in out-of-home care is unknown. This study examines, among youth in foster, formal kinship, and residential care, associations between involvement in structured and unstructured activities and social and mental health measures. Among 134 youth in out-of-home care, only 40% were involved in structured activities, and racial/ethnic minorities and males were even less likely to participate (p <= 0.01). More youth reported involvement in general physical activity (76%), which was associated with higher social skills when compared to those not involved in such unstructured activity (b = -10.4; 95% C.I. = -18.22, -2.65, p = 0.09). Youth not involved in structured activities showed poorer performance on measures of loneliness (b = 5.6; 95% C.I. = 1.63, 9.47,p = .006), drug abuse (b = 0.95; 95% C.I. = 031, 1.59, p = .004), and depression (b = 3.5; 95% C.I. = .25, 6.76,p = 0.04). Participation in activities, particularly when structured, may help these vulnerable youth to achieve better social relationships and mental health. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Based on early pediatric medical checkups 144 children with an average age of 9.1 years were examined using the Mannheim parent questionnaire. In one third of the children eating and sleeping problems were detected as well as attention problems and a variety of anxieties. A follow-up investigation was carried out 3.2 years later regarding the psychological status of the children with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and a questionnaire to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view (36-Item Short Form Health Survey SF 36). The results demonstrate the stability of psychological and emotional difficulties from childhood to adolescence.
   Pediatricians play an important role ("gate keeper") in early prevention of psychiatric disorders. Based on these results diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge should be intensified and taken into consideration in medical specialist curricula.

AB Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) may increase accuracy of data compared with retrospective questionnaires by assessing behaviours as they occur, hence decreasing recall biases and increasing ecological validity. This study examined the feasibility and concurrent validity of an EMA tool for adolescents with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (HFASD). Thirty-one adolescents with HFASD completed a mobile phone EMA application that assessed stressors and coping for two weeks. Parents and adolescents also completed retrospective measures of the adolescent's coping/stressors. Moderate compliance with the EMA tool was achieved and some concurrent validity was established with the retrospective measure of coping. Concordance was found between the types of stressors reported by parents and adolescents but not the quantity. The results suggest adolescents with HFASD are capable of reporting on their stressors and coping via EMA. EMA has the potential to be a valuable research tool in this population.

AB Eveningness has been found to negatively affect adolescents' sleep and daytime functioning. Furthermore, eveningness is associated with greater impulsivity than morningness. Externalizing behavior could be chronotype-related, implying that the alteration of the circadian rhythm itself is connected to aspects of emotion and emotion regulation. The present study investigated chronotype-related differences in emotional and behavioral problems, especially aggression and antisocial behavior in children and adolescents. We conducted a comprehensive search via web of knowledge (MEDLINE, web of science), EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed, Google Scholar and PsycINDEX using the keywords: chronotype, chronobiology, morningness, eveningness, owls and larks as well as diurnal preference to fully capture every aspect of chronotype. For aggression we used the search terms: aggression, anger, hostility, violence, anti-social behavior, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, delinquency, social adjustment and externalizing behavior. N = 13 studies were included concerning chronotype, childhood, adolescence and antisocial behavior. Results showed that children and adolescents being E-types were more affected by daytime impairments. Additionally, behavioral and emotional problems as aggression or antisocial behavior were more pronounced in E-than in M-types. Our findings support an association of eveningness and the impact of aggression on children and adolescents. Longitudinal investigations should be conducted in order to insure causality of the effects in question. In addition, the elevated vulnerability toward aggression in evening types demonstrates the need for prevention and intervention programs that educate youths in proper sleep hygiene and evoke an awareness of the consequences of a habitually diminished sleep quality.

   STRATEGIES
AB Objective: Catastrophising is a repetitive cognitive process related to sleep disturbance in adult insomnia patients. More recently catastrophising has been associated with increased sleep disturbances in community samples of children and adolescents, with this association mediated by anxiety and depression. However, there currently is no evidence of these processes outside of community samples; impeding our ability to draw clinical conclusions. Knowledge on such dysfunctional cognitive processes in adolescents experiencing sleep disturbance would be clinically beneficial in aetiology and intervention. Our research examined the link between catastrophising, anxiety, depression and sleep latency in a sample of sleep-disordered adolescents. We also explored specific catastrophising themes which may impact the sleep latency of these adolescents.
   Method: Forty adolescents (age = 15.1 +/- 1.5 years, 53% boys) diagnosed with delayed sleep phase disorder completed a 7-day sleep diary, along with measures of anxiety and depression and a catastrophising interview with a trained sleep therapist.
   Results: Several catastrophisation themes were generated, the most common concerning interpersonal and performance aspects of school. Bootstrapping analyses showed depression did not mediate the relationship between catastrophising and sleep; however, an indirect relationship was found between catastrophising, anticipatory anxiety, and sleep latency.
   Conclusion: These findings have implications for the role of dysfunctional thinking in prolonging sleep onset for adolescents and providing a clinical framework for health professionals when assessing and treating adolescents with delayed sleep timing.

AB Objective: Early parenting experiences likely shape children's brain development, with consequences potentially extending into adulthood. Parents' affective disorders and expressions of positive affect could exert an influence on affect-related circuitry. The current study evaluated how maternal depression and maternal warmth assessed in early childhood and early adolescence were related to boys' reward function during early adulthood. Method: Participants were 120 boys at socioeconomic risk for emotional problems. Mothers' history of depression during the child's lifetime was measured when boys were 42 months old and 10 and 11 years old. Maternal warmth was observed during mother child interactions at 18 and 24 months and at 10 and 11 years. Results: Maternal warmth during early childhood was associated with less activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) when anticipating and experiencing reward loss. Maternal warmth during early adolescence was associated with less activation in the mPFC when winning rewards and greater activation in the caudate when experiencing loss. The association between maternal warmth during early childhood and early adolescence and reward function in the striatum and mPFC was stronger for boys exposed to maternal depression relative to boys who were not. Conclusions: The experience of warmth and affection from mothers may be a protective factor for reward function in boys exposed to maternal depression, possibly by engaging vulnerable neural reward systems through affiliation.

AB ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the effects of cognitive emotion regulation strategies on depressive symptoms in women with breast cancer.
   MethodsFive hundred and nine women with breast cancer completed a demographic survey, the Chinese version of Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-C), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at the initial assessment (T1). One month later (T2), 504 patients completed the CES-D. Patients were assigned to four groups: H-H (CES-D scores 16 at both timepoints), H-L (CES-D score 16 at T1, <16 at T2), L-H (CES-D score <16 at T1, 16 at T2) and L-L (CES-D scores <16 at both timepoints).
   ResultsOver 80% patients had mild or no depressive symptoms at both timepoints. There were significant group differences in cognitive emotion regulation strategies. CERQ-C subscale scores for adaptive strategies were higher, and scores for maladaptive strategies were lower among patients in L-L and H-L groups than among those in H-H group. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that cognitive emotion regulation strategies at T1 differentiated depressive symptoms at T2, accounting for 56.5% of variance after controlling for sociodemographic and biological variables and baseline levels of depression. Greater acceptance, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal at T1 were associated with fewer depressive symptoms at T2.
   ConclusionsCognitive emotion regulation strategies accounted for considerable variance in depressive symptom scores 1month later. The strategies of acceptance, positive refocusing, and positive reappraisal may be beneficial for women with breast cancer. Intervention studies are needed to confirm if these associations are causal. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder are psychiatrically hospitalized much more frequently than children in the general population. Hospitalization occurs primarily because of externalizing behaviors and is associated with behavioral disturbance, impaired emotion regulation, and psychiatric comorbidity. Additionally, a lack of practitioner and/or administrator training and experience with this population poses risks for denial of care by third-party payers or treatment facilities, inadequate treatment, extended lengths of stay, and poor outcomes. Evidence and best practices for the inpatient psychiatric care of this population are presented.

AB Purpose: To investigate whether teachers' assessments of children are predictive of subsequent self-reported mental problems in adolescence and how these problems are concurrently linked with adolescents' overall life satisfaction.
   Method: The study subjects originated from the prospective population-based Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (N=9,432). At age 8 years first-grade students' emotional and behavioral problems were assessed by their teachers with Rutter Children's Behavioural Questionnaires for teachers (RB2). At the age of 16 years, adolescents responded to the eight Youth Self-report (YSR) subscales and the one-item overall life satisfaction scale. Multivariate logistic regression was used to study the longitudinal relationship between RB2 and YSR.
   Results: Children who had emotional problems according to their teachers (RB2) were more prone to withdrawal and social problems in adolescence (YSR). Behavioral problems in childhood (RB2) were predictive of attention problems, and delinquent and aggressive behavior (YSR), while hyperactivity (RB2) was only predictive of attention problems and delinquent behavior (YSR). Additionally, each YSR subscale was strongly and linearly associated with concurrent self-reported life satisfaction in adolescence.
   Conclusions: Teachers' assessments of children were predictive of self-reported mental problems in adolescence, which, in turn, were strongly associated with concurrent self-reported life satisfaction. In order to support favorable growth of children to well-adjusted adolescents and to intervene as early as possible in the event of adverse progression, both teachers' assessments of children and adolescent's self-rated overall life satisfaction should be acknowledged.

AB Purpose of reviewThis article explores recent research in the field of childhood exposure to trauma and the development of borderline personality disorder in adolescence.Recent findingsAdolescence is a critical period of development. Exposure to trauma, specifically sexual abuse, prior to and during puberty has specific implications for personality development and heightens risk for borderline personality disorder. Elevated symptom levels in adolescence are likely to decline across adulthood, but social and vocational impairments remain. Impulsivity, difficulties in emotion regulation, and suicidality may characterize adolescent expression of borderline personality disorder, whereas negative affect and functional impairment are more stable features of the disorder.SummaryPreliminary findings in treatment models for adults have potential for benefit among adolescence. Further research is required to examine treatment effectiveness and efficiency. Greater attention to low-income and middle-income nations, which are disproportionately affected by adversity, is needed to determine cross-cultural validity and the impact of trauma in adolescent populations.

AB The way emotions are regulated might affect the engagement on risk behaviors in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, studying the relationship between these variables could be of great importance. Some of the less studied risky behaviors are pathological gambling, and Internet and videogame abuse. This research aims to analyze the existing relationship between such risky behaviors, emotion regulation, and dysfunctional psychological symptomatology (depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, somatization, obsessive compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism). In addition, it also looks to assess whether emotional regulation plays a mediating role between pathological gambling, and Internet and videogame abuse, and psychological symptomatology. The sample was composed of 1312 young adults and adolescents, aged between 12 and 30, recruited from scholar centers, universities and free time groups, and from associations and centers associated with FEJAR (Spanish Federation of Rehabilitated Gamblers). Participants completed measurements of impulsive behavior, emotion regulation, and dysfunctional symptomatology. Results showed that there is generally a positive and significant relation between these variables. Moreover, it has been pointed out that emotion regulation mediates the association between impulsive behavior and dysfunctional symptomatology among those young adults and adolescents who engage in these impulsive behaviors, except for the relation between videogame abuse and depressive symptomatology. Training in emotional regulation skills could be useful in dealing with and treating this type of behaviors in adolescents and young adults.

AB Theory has proposed that nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a response to intense frequent negative affect (NA) that is difficult to control. Therefore, individual differences that are related to emotion dysregulation should be higher in individuals who engage in NSSI compared to healthy controls. Though current research supports this prediction, this research could be strengthened by corroborating evidence from daily diary studies. The current study used a daily diary protocol to thoroughly examine the emotional correlates of NSSI. Individuals with and without a history of NSSI rated their affect daily for 14 days. This information was used to score multiple indices of emotionality (e.g., mean level, within-person variation, reactivity). The results showed that compared to controls, individuals who engaged in NSSI had higher mean levels, within-person variation, and lower emotional differentiation of NA, but groups did not differ on inertia of NA or reactivity of NA. Moreover, individuals with a history of NSSI reported lower levels of positive affect and lower inertia of positive affect. These results are discussed in terms of affect regulation models of NSSI and treatment implications.

AB Background: The pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is complex and not fully understood. Using diffusion tensor imaging, recent studies suggest that white matter abnormalities may occur in adult patients with BPD. However, deeper insight into the disorder-specific developmental psychobiology (e. g., analysis of adolescents with BPD; inclusion of clinical control groups) is missing.
   Methods: Twenty adolescent patients with BPD (aged 14-18 years), 20 healthy, and 20 clinical control subjects were assessed using diffusion tensor imaging. All subjects were right-handed girls, matched for age and IQ. Microstructural parameters were analyzed via tractography of the main bundles in the limbic system and using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, an explorative, global approach.
   Results: BPD was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy in the fornix when compared with clinical (p < .001) or healthy (nonsignificant trend) control subjects. Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, significant disorder-specific white matter alterations were found in the long association bundles interconnecting the heteromodal association cortex and in connections between the thalamus and hippocampus.
   Conclusions: The study strongly supports the hypothesis that white matter alterations play a key role in the pathogenesis of BPD. These disorder-specific alterations include white matter pathways involved in emotion regulation but also affect parts of the heteromodal association cortex that are related to emotion recognition. Our findings unify previously documented deficits in emotion recognition and regulation and suggest that a large-scale network of emotion processing is disrupted in BPD. Continued research is essential to evaluate the predictive value of these early disruptions in a clinical context.

DE Non-suicidal self-injury; Adolescents; Function; Adverse life events;

AB Background: This study has investigated the specific relationship between childhood adversities, individual trauma symptoms and the functions of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The aim was to examine whether different self-reported adverse experiences and trauma symptoms predict the need to engage in NSSI, either to regulate emotions or to communicate with and influence others.
   Method: The participants were a community sample of 816 adolescents aged 15-17 years with NSSI. Hierarchical multiple regression was used, controlling for NSSI frequency and gender. The dependent variables were the automatic and social functions of NSSI, respectively. The predictors entered in the model were several different maltreatment and adversity experiences as well as individual trauma symptoms. Mediation analyses were also performed using the bootstrapping method with bias-corrected confidence estimates.
   Results: Frequency of NSSI, gender (female), emotional abuse, prolonged illness or handicap during upbringing and symptoms of depression uniquely predicted the automatic functions of NSSI in the final regression model, but not the social functions. Symptoms of anxiety uniquely predicted social but not automatic functions. Having experienced physical abuse, having made a suicide attempt and symptoms of dissociation were significant predictors in both final models. The model for automatic functions explained more of the variance (62%) than the social model (28%). The relationship between childhood emotional, physical and sexual abuse and performing NSSI for automatic reasons was mediated by symptoms of depression and dissociation. The relationship between physical abuse and the social functions of NSSI was mediated by symptoms of anxiety and dissociation.
   Conclusions: It is important to understand the specific context in which NSSI has developed and is maintained. Experiences of emotional abuse and symptoms of depression could guide clinical work in the direction of emotion regulation skills since in this study these variables were uniquely associated with the need to engage in NSSI to regulate emotions, to self-punish or to generate feelings. The presence of physical abuse, a suicide attempt and symptoms of dissociation could alert clinicians to a broad treatment approach since they were associated with performing NSSI to regulate both social and automatic experiences.

AB Purpose of reviewPhenotypic features of borderline personality disorder may first emerge during childhood, alongside symptoms of common externalizing and internalizing disorders. Children with these borderline personality features (BPF) are, therefore, likely to come into contact with clinical services prior to adolescence. This raises the question of whether BPF may be clinically informative with respect to the formulation and treatment of childhood psychopathology.Recent findingsBPF in late childhood appear to be highly heritable, while also predicted by environmental risk factors that overlap with those related to both externalizing and internalizing disorders. These risk factors include hostile parenting, maternal insensitivity to infant attachment cues, and early peer victimization, thereby implicating both family and peer processes that play out across early development. Children with BPF appear to be further characterized by social-cognitive factors including social perspective coordination deficits, a shame-prone self-concept, and hypermentalizing, which may represent potential therapeutic targets.SummaryClinical research into the implications of BPF for the treatment of childhood psychopathology is a current priority. It is proposed that the research designs that have contributed to recent evidence for the clinical utility of childhood psychopathic traits may likewise aid in understanding the potential clinical utility of BPF in children.

AB Physiological correlates of behavioral and emotional problems, substance use onset and initiation of risky sexual behavior have not been studied in adolescents with prenatal drug exposure. We studied the concordance between baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at age 3 and baseline cortisol levels at age 11. We hypothesized that children who showed concordance between RSA and cortisol would have lower neurobehavioral disinhibition scores which would in turn predict age of substance use onset and first sexual intercourse. The sample included 860 children aged 16 years participating in the Maternal Lifestyle Study, a multisite longitudinal study of children with prenatal exposure to cocaine and other substances. Structural equation modeling was used to test pathways between prenatal substance exposure, early adversity, baseline RSA, baseline cortisol, neurobehavioral disinhibition, drug use, and sexual behavior outcomes. Concordance was studied by examining separate male and female models in which there were statistically significant interactions between baseline RSA and cortisol. Prenatal substance exposure was operationalized as the number of substances to which the child was exposed. An adversity score was computed based on caregiver postnatal substance use, depression and psychological distress, number of caregiver changes, socioeconomic and poverty status, quality of the home environment, and child history of protective service involvement, abuse and neglect. RSA and cortisol were measured during a baseline period prior to the beginning of a task. Neurobehavioral disinhibition, based on composite scores of behavioral dysregulation and executive dysfunction, substance use and sexual behavior were derived from questionnaires and cognitive tests administered to the child. Findings were sex specific. In females, those with discordance between RSA and cortisol (high RSA and low cortisol or low RSA and high cortisol) had the most executive dysfunction which, in turn, predicted earlier initiation of alcohol by age 16. Among boys, there also existed a significant baseline RSA by baseline cortisol interaction. Boys with low baseline RSA and high baseline cortisol had the highest levels of behavioral dysregulation. This increase in behavioral dysregulation was in turn related to initiation of alcohol use by age 16 and lower age of first sexual intercourse. We found sex-specific pathways to the initiation of alcohol use and risky sexual behavior through the combined activity of parasympathetic and neuroendocrine functioning. The study of multiple physiological systems may suggest new pathways to the study of age of onset of substance use and engagement in risky sexual behavior in adolescents. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB The present study reports the development of a questionnaire of social competencies in children and adolescents (self-report) allowing for the multidimensionality of social competencies. The questionnaire was validated by means of teacher's report on social competencies and classmates' reports on social status as well as other personality traits, social desirability, and cognitive skills. A total of 684 students aged between 12 and 17 participated in the study. A cross-validation of factor structures resulted in six scales of social competencies with good to satisfactory reliability coefficients: Social orientation, social initiative, self-control, emotion regulation, perception of others, and self-consciousness. Self-reported social competencies correlated with teacher's report on social competencies as well as classmates' reports on social status. The different scales of social competencies also correlated with theoretically related constructs (extraversion, shyness, social engagement, and aggressive behavior) while distinguishing from cognitive skills. Social orientation and self-control were prone to social desirability.

AB Purpose: Pain is commonly experienced in those with cerebral palsy (CP), and previous research suggests an increase in behavioural and emotional problems in children experiencing pain and pain anxiety. Therefore, it was hypothesised that pain intensity and pain anxiety would predict behavioural and emotional problems in children with CP. Method: Parents or guardians of 61 children (38 boys, 23 girls) with CP, aged 5-15 years completed an online questionnaire on pain intensity, pain anxiety and behavioural and emotional problems. Correlation and a multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine whether pain intensity and/or pain anxiety predicts behavioural and emotional problems. Results: A total of 59% of participants reported that their children with CP currently experiences pain. Multiple regression analyses revealed that pain intensity (p = 0.038) and pain anxiety (p<0.001) both made a significant and independent contributions in predicting anxiety in children, however, pain anxiety was the only predictor that made a significant and independent contribution to the depression (p = 0.001) and the behavioural and emotional problems measure (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Whilst pain intensity appears to be associated with behavioural and emotional problems in children, pain anxiety may be more strongly associated still.

AB Background: Traumatic exposure may modulate the expression of impulsive behavioral dispositions and change the implementation of emotion regulation strategies associated with depressive mood. Past studies resulted in only limited comprehension of these relationships, especially because they failed to consider impulsivity as a multifactorial construct.
   Objective: Based on Whiteside and Lynam's multidimensional model that identifies four distinct dispositional facets of impulsive-like behaviors, namely urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking (UPPS), the current study used a sample of community volunteers to investigate whether an interaction exists between impulsivity facets and lifetime trauma exposure in predicting cognitive emotion regulation and depressive mood.
   Methods: Ninety-three adults completed questionnaires measuring lifetime trauma exposure, impulsivity, cognitive emotion regulation, and depressive mood.
   Results: Results showed that trauma-exposed participants with a strong disposition toward urgency (predisposition to act rashly in intense emotional contexts) tended to use fewer appropriate cognitive emotion regulation strategies than other individuals. Unexpectedly, participants lacking in perseverance (predisposition to have difficulties concentrating on demanding tasks) used more appropriate emotion regulation strategies if they had experienced traumatic events during their life than if they had not. Emotion regulation mediated the path between these two impulsivity facets and depressive mood.
   Conclusions: Together, these findings suggest that impulsivity has a differential impact on emotion regulation and depressive mood depending on lifetime exposure to environmental factors, especially traumatic events.

AB Background: Recent studies have identified subthreshold forms of bipolar (BP)-I disorder and deficits in emotional regulation as risk factors for bipolar disorder in youth. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether emotional dysregulation and subthreshold forms of BP-I disorder increase the risk for BP switches in ADHD youth with non-bipolar MDD.
   Methods: We used data from two large controlled longitudinal family studies of boys and girls with and without ADHD. Subjects (N=522) were followed prospectively and blindly over an average follow up period of 11.4 years. Comparisons were made between ADHD youth with unipolar major depression (MDD) who did (N=24) and did not (N=79) switch to BP-I disorder at follow-up.
   Results: The rate of conversion to BP-I disorder at follow up was higher in MDD subjects with subthreshold BP-I disorder at baseline compared to those without (57% vs. 21%; OR-9.57, 95% Cl= 1.62 - 56.56, p=0.013) and in MDD subjects with deficient emotional self-regulation (OR =3.54, 95% Cl= 1.08 - 11.60, p=0.037).
   Limitations: The sample was largely Caucasian, so these results may not generalize to minority groups. The sample of youth with SED was small, which limited the statistical power for some analyses.
   Conclusions: Switches from unipolar MUD to BP-I disorder in children with ADHD and MUD were predicted by baseline subthreshold BP-I disorder symptoms and baseline deficits in emotional regulation. More work is needed to assess whether these risk factors are operant outside the context of ADHD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although previous studies have established that rumination influences responses to stressful life events, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain inadequately understood. The current study examines the relationship between trait rumination and affective, cognitive, and physiological responses to a standardized laboratory-based stressor in adolescents. A community-based sample of adolescents (N = 157) aged 13-17 completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Affective, cognitive, and physiological responses were obtained before, during, and after the TSST. Adolescents who engaged in habitual rumination experienced greater negative affect and more negative cognitive appraisals in response to the TSST than adolescents with lower levels of rumination. Rumination was unrelated to heart rate reactivity, but predicted slower heart rate recovery from the TSST, indicating that rumination might be specifically associated with physiological recovery from stress. Rumination is associated with negative affective, cognitive, and physiological responses following stressors, suggesting potential mechanisms through which it might increase risk for psychopathology.

AB Rumination involves the tendency to passively dwell on negative emotions along with their meanings and consequences. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema demonstrated the role of rumination in the development of several forms of psychopathology and suggested that cognitive control may be one factor that makes some individuals more prone to ruminate than others. Studies with adults have consistently found that rumination is associated with cognitive control difficulties, especially related to switching and inhibiting emotional information. Because rumination predicts psychopathology by adolescence, the present study examined whether ruminating youth would show similar cognitive control difficulties. Fifty-two adolescents completed two tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and reported on their depressive symptoms and tendency to ruminate. There was no effect of rumination on a task measuring general cognitive flexibility. However, rumination was associated with difficulty inhibiting negative information when switching from negative to positive blocks on an Affective Go/No-go task. Results suggest both similarities and differences compared to adult studies and are discussed in terms of clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of psychopathology.

AB Levels of sensation seeking peak in adolescence and there is a well-documented association of sensation seeking with delinquency and other risk-taking behaviours. The present study investigated the potential moderating effect of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) on this relationship. Trait EI encompasses high levels of empathy and emotion regulation and is associated with positive outcomes and well-being. Ninety-six young adults (48 females and 48 males; overall M-age = 19.76) completed measures of sensation seeking, trait EI and self-reported delinquent behaviours (DB) since age 12. Results indicated that sensation seeking and frequency of DB were positively associated, but this effect was moderated by trait EI for male participants - those with lower trait EI showed a greater increase in delinquency, in line with a rise in sensation seeking. No moderation effect was observed for females, and females with higher levels of trait EI reported more DB. The results are discussed in terms of the protective role of trait EI in supporting self-regulation and whether, for some females, high levels of emotional intelligence might predispose them to antisocial relational behaviours.

AB We investigated whether social relationships protect children against the effects of victimization on internalizing problems. We used data from the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children and Youths. Victimization at age 8 years was associated with internalizing problems at age 9 years. Victims who had siblings, warm parents, and a good relationship with the teacher had less severe internalizing problems than those who did not, providing evidence for a protective effect of social relationships. Friendships with classmates were not found to be protective. Furthermore, social relationships did not protect victims more than nonvictims.

AB Objective: To examine the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure and biological sex on adolescent risk-taking while controlling for early environmental risk.
   Methods: Adolescents (n = 114, mean age = 16) were grouped according to high and low risk-taking propensity as measured by the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Prenatal cocaine exposure was assessed at birth, while environmental risk was assessed at three points during early childhood.
   Results: A binary regression analysis indicated that males were 3.5 times more likely than females to be high risk-takers. Biological sex and prenatal cocaine exposure interacted such that exposed males were most likely to be high risk-takers while exposed females were the least likely to be high risk-takers. This pattern held after controlling for prenatal alcohol exposure and early environmental risk. Early environmental risk did not predict adolescent risk-taking.
   Conclusions: These findings complement and extend earlier research demonstrating that prenatal cocaine exposure interacts with biological sex in domains related to inhibitory control, emotion regulation, antisocial behavior, and health risk behaviors during preadolescence.

AB Objective. This study investigated associations between parental psychological control and aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms among adolescents from predominantly disadvantaged backgrounds. The indirect effects of psychological control on adolescent adjustment through adolescent emotion regulation (anger and sadness regulation) were examined, as well as the moderating effects of adolescent emotion regulation. Design. 206 adolescents (aged 10-18 years) reported on parental psychological control and their own depressive symptoms, and parents and adolescents reported on adolescent emotion regulation and aggressive behavior. Indirect effect models were tested using structural equation modeling; moderating effects were tested using hierarchical multiple regression. Results. The associations between parental psychological control and adolescent aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms were indirect through adolescents' anger regulation. Moderation analyses indicated that the association between parental psychological control and adolescent depressive symptoms was stronger among adolescents with poor sadness regulation and the association between psychological control and aggressive behavior was stronger among older adolescents with poor anger regulation. Conclusions. Psychological control is negatively associated with adolescent adjustment, particularly among adolescents who have difficulty regulating emotions. Emotion regulation is one mechanism through which psychological control is linked to adolescent adjustment, particularly anger dysregulation, and this pattern holds for both younger and older adolescents and for both boys and girls.

DT Article
DE depression; adolescents; auto-aggressiveness; urban populations
AB Background: The aim of the study was to explore the frequency of depression among the general population of adolescents who were high school students in the city of Zagreb. As depression is associated with increased suicidal risk we wanted to check to what extent depression, as an emotional problem among youth, is associated with auto-aggression in the general population of adolescents.
   Subjects and methods: The study was conducted on a sample of high school students in Zagreb and it included 701 students of both genders aged from 14-19 years of age. To test the depression a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered for youth between 11-18 years of age (Youth Self Report for ages 11-18). To test auto-aggression a Scale of Auto-destructiveness (SAD) was used.
   Results: Results obtained by this study show that about 20.7% of high school students have mild and borderline depressive disorders while moderate or severe depression shows about 5% of them, whereby depression is statistically significant among girls who, on average, report more symptoms of depression. It has also been proven a significant impact of depression levels (F (2,423)=35.860, p<0.001) on auto-aggression in subjects of both genders. In both genders, moderately depressed show more auto destructiveness than those without depression symptoms (p<0.01). In the group of heavily depressed (n=30), significantly higher self-destructiveness is shown by girls (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: The data suggest the importance of early recognition, understanding and treatment of depressive symptoms in adolescents in order to reduce the risk of subsequent chronic psychosocial damage.

AB In order to Test Fonagy's (Fonagy & Bateman, 2008) hypotheses on the relationships among borderline personality disorder (BPD), mentalization, and attachment, nonclinical adolescents were assigned to a high-BPD group (n = 29), an average-BPD group (n = 31) and a low-BPD group (n = 29). Participants in the three groups were administered the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RET), the Lack of Emotional Clarity Scale from the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). High-BPD adolescents scored significantly lower than low-BPD adolescents on the RET (d = -0.66), and significantly higher than both other groups on the DERS LEC. When the effect of the ASQ scales was controlled for, the high-BPD group did not show any significant difference from the other groups on mentalization measures. These findings were consistent with Fonagy's (Fonagy & Bateman, 2008) model of BPD.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is widely thought to serve an emotion-regulatory function. Method: The focus of the present paper is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding how NSSI might modify a person's emotions. Results: Drawing upon the process model of emotion regulation, we argue that 5 families of emotion regulation strategies may be engaged by NSSI. Individuals may engage in NSSI as an alternative to more distressing situations. They also may use NSSI to modify their social environment. Individuals may shift their attention away from unpleasant emotions or thoughts via NSSI. NSSI may change cognitions about the self via self-punishment or transformation of the self from higher-order to lower-order awareness. NSSI may also bring about various physiological effects, such as changes in endogenous opioids or parasympathetic nervous system activation, as a way of modulating emotional responses. Conclusion: Simply labeling NSSI as 'emotion regulatory' does not tell us precisely what is going on. This is because at any given moment, NSSI can serve to regulate emotions in many different ways. One key challenge is to clarify the precise functions NSSI may be serving for a given individual in a particular context. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB BackgroundThe incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing in young children. However, they are overlooked in treatment adherence and intervention research despite evidence that parents often experience difficulty securing their treatment cooperation, especially with the diet. We investigated positive and incongruent (i.e. the co-occurrence of contradictory verbal and non-verbal messages) communication in the mother-child dyad and their association with child adjustment and dietary adherence outcomes.
   MethodsParticipants were 23 6- to 8-year-old children with type 1 diabetes and their mothers. We conducted dietary adherence interviews with mothers and performed nutritional analyses to assess children's consumption of extrinsic sugars (e.g. confectionary). Mothers completed a standardized assessment of child psychological adjustment. Mothers and children engaged in a videotaped problem-solving task related to the dietary regimen, with maternal and child utterances and non-verbal behaviours analysed for positive dyadic and incongruent communication.
   ResultsPositive dyadic communication correlated with lower levels of child incongruent communication, fewer behavioural problems and better overall adjustment. Higher levels of maternal and child incongruent communication correlated with more behavioural and emotional problems and poorer overall adjustment. Higher levels of maternal incongruent communication correlated with poorer dietary adherence.
   ConclusionsResults converged to form a conceptually and empirically coherent pattern in that behavioural indices of poorer communication in both mother and child consistently correlated with poorer child adjustment outcomes. This study shows that specific features of dyadic, child and maternal communication could be targeted in developmentally sensitive interventions to promote positive communication in the home management of type 1 diabetes care for young children.

AB Background and aims: Adolescent Internet gambling is associated with concomitant addictive behaviors. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Internet gambling practices, its impact upon psychosocial development and to evaluate the association between gambling practices and Internet addictive behavior among Cypriot adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a convenience sample (n = 805) of adolescents attending selected public schools (9th and 10th grades) in Cyprus. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires were used including the Internet Addiction Test and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Among the study population (n = 805), approximately one third (n = 28; 34.9%) reported Internet gambling. Internet gamblers were twice as likely to utilize Internet caf portals (adjusted odds ratio for gender and age, AOR: 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 1.56-2.91) for interactive game-playing (AOR: 6.84; 95% CI: 4.23-11.07), chat-rooms (AOR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.31-4.85), and retrieval of sexual information (AOR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.42-2.81). Among Internet gamblers 26.0% (n = 73) reported borderline addictive Internet use and 4.3% (n = 12) addictive behavior. Internet gamblers more often had comprehensive psychosocial and emotional maladjustment (AOR: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.97-8.13), including Abnormal Conduct Problems (AOR: 3.26; 95% CI: 2.00-5.32), Emotional Symptoms (AOR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.02-3.11), and Peer Problems (AOR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.08-5.48) scores. The multivariate regression analyses indicated that the single independent predictor associated with Internet addictive behavior was Internet gambling (AOR: 5.66; 95% CI: 1.45-22.15). Discussion: Internet gambling is associated with addictive Internet use, as well as emotional maladjustment and behavioral problems, among Cypriot adolescents. Conclusions: Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate whether Internet gambling constitutes a risk factor for the development of Internet addictive behavior among adolescents.

AB Background: Although there are considerable researches on effectiveness of social skills training, little information is available on the effects of such training on perceived competence of adolescents with deafness.
   Objectives: This study was conducted in special school settings to determine the effects of social skills training on perceived competence of female adolescents with deafness.
   Patients and Methods: A prepost quasi-experimental design was used to perform the study. Sixty nine female students with deafness who were enrolled in all of the four different special secondary schools in Tehran, Iran, between 2010 and 2011 participated in this research. Two of four secondary schools were randomly allocated to the intervention group (33 students), and the other two to the control group (36 students). The participants were between 11 and 21 years (Mean = 15.43; SD = 1.89), and more than three fourth of each groups (i.e. 28 students in each groups) were affected by profound hearing impairment. The intervention group participated in twelve bi-weekly sessions. Pretest and posttest data were collected using the 'Hearing Impaired Children Self-Image Test'. The questionnaire was filled by an interviewer. This questionnaire asks students about their feeling toward their own competence in domains of cognitive, physical, socio-emotional and communication competence and school adjustment. The data was analyzed by using SPSS software, version 16.
   Results: The intervention led to significant improvement in total perceived competence scores of adolescents with deafness (P < 0.001) as well as in three domains of socio-emotional competence (P = 0.003), communication competence (P < 0.001), and school adjustment (P = 0.018).
   Conclusions: It is likely that learning social skills in adolescents with deafness would improve their sense of competence, and emotional well being.

AB Exposure time, program content and cultural context may affect the impact of television (TV) on the social-emotional competence (SEC) of children. This study examined the effects of TV viewing on the SEC of Thai infants. The study was based on a Thai birth cohort study from which duration and content of TV viewing and data from the Modified Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment instrument at 1 and 3 years of age were available. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine whether scores below the 10th national percentile were associated with TV viewing duration. The relationship between viewing duration and SEC risk was quadratic rather than linear. Viewing duration of 30-120 min/day was associated with a decreased risk of low overall SEC compared to non-viewers after adjustments for confounding factors. However, the beneficial effect diminished when the duration exceeded 120 min/day. Viewing educational programs was associated with a risk reduction of having low overall SEC compared to non-educational programs. These results suggest that a short period of TV viewing may be beneficial for the SEC of Thai infants, especially if the programs are educational. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sizeable numbers of youth in community and clinical settings meet diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Early assessment and treatment may positively alter the life-course trajectory of young people with BPD and reduce future suffering and impairment. This article reviews the potential etiological bases of BPD, including genetic, neurobiological, social-cognitive, and the biosocial theory. Prospective, retrospective, and correlational research including infant and child temperament, internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, as well as suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors provide additional information to better understand potential risk factors for the development of BPD as well as points for intervention (e.g., emotion regulation). To date, dialectical behavior therapy and mentalization-based treatment appear promising as effective treatments for adolescents who carry at least three borderline personality features in addition to self-harm. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB Understanding the emotional risk factors for cigarette smoking in adolescence can greatly inform prevention efforts. The current study examined prospective relationships between 3 affective dimensions-negative mood variability, overall negative mood, and depression-affect-related smoking motives, and future smoking patterns among adolescents. The current study expands on prior research by using real-time methods to assess mood and by focusing on a key developmental transition in smoking behavior: the progression from experimentation or low level, infrequent use to higher use. Ninth-and 10th-grade students (N = 461; 55% girls) provided data on cigarette use at a baseline and follow-up 15-month wave, and also provided ecological momentary assessments of negative moods via palmtop computers for 1 week at each wave. Negative mood was examined via the means of negative mood reports at each wave, and mood variability was examined via the intraindividual standard deviations of negative mood reports at each wave. Depressive symptoms and smoking motives were also assessed. Findings supported a complex self-medication model of smoking escalation in adolescence whereby mood-smoking relationships differed by affect dimension and gender. For girls, greater negative mood variability at baseline significantly predicted rapid escalation in smoking over time, whereas depressive symptoms and overall negative mood were unrelated to girls' smoking patterns. In contrast, overall negative mood significantly predicted boys' smoking escalation among those with affect-related motives for smoking. Results thus suggest that inconsistent mood-smoking relations in past work may be driven by the complex interrelationships among affect vulnerabilities, gender, and smoking patterns.

AB Autism and its related disorders are commonly described as lying along a continuum that ranges in severity and are collectively referred to as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Although all individuals with ASD meet the social impairment diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-IV-TR, they do not present with the same social difficulties. The variability in the expression and severity of social competence is particularly evident among the group of individuals with high-functioning ASD who appear to have difficulty applying their average to above average intelligence in a social context. There is a striking paucity of empirical research investigating individual differences in social functioning among individuals with high-functioning ASD. It is possible that more detailed investigations of social competence have been impeded by the lack of standardized measures available to assess the nature and severity of social impairment. The aim of the current study was to develop and evaluate a parent rating scale capable of assessing individual differences in social competence (i.e. strengths and challenges) among adolescents with ASD: the Multidimensional Social Competence Scale (MSCS). Results from confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized multidimensional factor structure of the MSCS. Seven relatively distinct domains of social competence were identified including social motivation, social inferencing, demonstrating empathic concern, social knowledge, verbal conversation skills, nonverbal sending skills, and emotion regulation. Psychometric evidence provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the scale. Possible applications of this promising new parent rating scale in both research and clinical settings are discussed. Autism Res 2013, 6: 631-641.

AB Distress tolerance (DT) is an established construct contributing to the onset and maintenance of psychopathology in adulthood; however, few studies have examined the role of DT in older adolescent psychopathology. Emerging data suggest that gender and race may influence this relation. Therefore, the current study examined the relation between gender, race, and DT on parent-reported internalizing and externalizing DSM-oriented symptoms among a community sample of 128, 14-18 year old adolescents. Results indicated a moderating effect of gender on affective problems, such that females with low DT, but not males, displayed significantly greater affective problems. Findings also indicated a significant moderating effect of race, such that Caucasians with low DT, but not African Americans, displayed significantly higher somatic, oppositional defiant, and conduct problems. These findings suggest that DT is an important clinical variable in older adolescence, particularly among Caucasians and females.

AB Maternal hostility/rejection and warmth were considered as potential mediators of the relation between mothers' and adolescents' emotion regulation. Participants were first-year high school students living in Ankara, Turkey and their mothers (N = 365). Scales assessing emotion regulation difficulties and maternal hostility/rejection and warmth were administered to both the adolescents and their mothers. Maternal hostility/rejection, but not warmth, mediated the relation between maternal and adolescent emotion regulation. For girls there was, additionally, a direct effect of maternal emotion regulation. The different roles played by parental rejection and parental warmth in the development of adolescents' emotion regulation accord with arguments that socialization occurs in different domains and that rejection and warmth are not aspects of the same domain.

AB Perceiving that one is rejected is an important correlate of emotional maladjustment. Yet, self-perceptions can substantially differ from classmate-reports of who is rejected. In this study, discrepancies between self- and classmate-reports of rejection were identified in 359 Australian adolescents (age 10-12 years). As expected, adolescents who overestimated rejection reported more rejection sensitivity and felt more victimized by their peers, but were not seen by peers as more victimized. Adolescents who underestimated rejection identified themselves as high in overt aggression, and their peers identified them as high in overt and relational aggression and low in prosocial behavior. Yet, underestimators' feelings of friendship satisfaction did not seem to suffer and they reported low rejection sensitivity. Results suggest that interventions to promote adolescent health should explicitly recognize the different needs of those who do and do not seem to perceive their high rejection, as well as adolescents who overestimate their rejection.

AB Loneliness is typically defined in terms of feeling states. In this review, we take a somewhat different approach, describing loneliness in terms of perceived social isolation. Vulnerabilities to perceived social isolation differ across the lifespan. Unique properties of adolescence are identified that carry special risk for perceived social isolation. These include (but are not limited to) developmental changes in companions, developmental changes in autonomy and individuation, identity exploration, cognitive maturation, developmental changes in social perspective taking, and physical maturation. Scholars are encouraged to consider loneliness through the lens of perceived social isolation so as to better understand how the experience of physical isolation varies across adolescence.

AB The amygdala is a key region in emotion processing. In particular, fMRI studies have demonstrated that the amygdala is active during the viewing of emotional faces. Previous research has consistently found greater amygdala responses to fearful than to neutral faces in adults, convergent with a focus in the animal literature on the amygdala's role in fear processing. Studies have shown that the amygdala also responds differentially to other facial emotion types in adults. Yet the literature regarding when this differential amygdala responsivity develops is limited and mixed. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine amygdala responses to emotional and neutral faces in a relatively large sample of healthy school-age children (N = 52). Although the amygdala was active in response to emotional and neutral faces, the results did not support the hypothesis that the amygdala responds differentially to emotional faces in 7- to 12-year-old children. Nonetheless, amygdala activity was correlated with the severity of subclinical depression symptoms and with emotional regulation skills. Additionally, sex differences were observed in frontal, temporal, and visual regions, as well as effects of pubertal development in visual regions. These findings suggest important differences in amygdala reactivity in childhood.

AB Background: Preterm children are at risk for behavioral and emotional problems.
   Aims: To evaluate behavior and emotional well-being of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) teenagers born in Iceland in 1991-1995.
   Methods: Participants, 30 of 35 ELBW survivors (25 girls, 5 boys, mean age 16.8 years), were interviewed, underwent medical examination and answered the Youth Self-Report for ages 11-18 (YSR) of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). The ELBW parents answered the ASEBA Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18 and the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). A comparison group of 30 teenagers (23 girls, 7 boys, mean age 16.5 years) answered the YSR questionnaire and their parents answered the CBCL and ASSQ questionnaires.
   Results: ELBW teenagers and parents report more behavior problems than the full term comparison teenagers and parents. They score significantly higher on the YSR and CBCL syndrome scales except for YSR and CBCL rule-breaking behavior and CBCL thought problems. The ELBW teenagers self-report on total competence, activities, social participation and academic performance was not significantly lower than the comparison teenagers. Parents of ELBW teenagers rated total competence, social participation and school performance of their children significantly lower than parents of comparison teenagers. The YSR Positive Qualities Scale was not significantly different between the two teenage groups. Two ELBW teenagers scored above cut-off points on the ASSQ questionnaire and none of the comparison teenagers. Bullying was reported by 20% of ELBW parents compared to none of the comparison group.
   Conclusion: ELBW teenagers experience emotional, behavior and social challenges. The teenagers value their positive qualities, activities and academic performance similar to peers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to their heightened risk of developing late-occurring adverse outcomes, pediatric cancer survivors are advised to receive follow-up care in specialized Survivor Clinics. However, little is known about the impact of attending such clinics on psychosocial adjustment, knowledge, and morbidity. This study assesses the differences between those who attended a Survivorship Clinic and those who did not on knowledge, perception of risk, and psychosocial adjustment.
   We assessed 102 survivors who attended our Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Clinic and 71 survivors never seen in a specialized clinic (non-LTFU). Participants were diagnosed at least 5 years prior to the assessment, were at least 20 years old, and had no evidence of active disease. Groups were matched on gender, age at cancer diagnosis, diagnosis, and race.
   On average, participants were currently 30 years of age and had been diagnosed with cancer around age 12. Most common reasons that non-LTFU survivors did not attend the clinic were "not aware" (71 %) or "not interested" (16 %). Survivors in each group were able to accurately report their cancer diagnosis, but few knew specific treatment information. There were no significant differences regarding survivors' perceptions of risk of future health problems with both groups similarly underestimating their risks. A significant minority in each group reported psychological or emotional problems (16-18 %), post-traumatic stress disorder (4.2-6.9 %), and/or psychological distress (7.8-19.7 %).
   Survivors are in need of continued education about their specific cancer treatments, recommended follow-up practices, the importance of survivorship care, and their specific risks for late effects.
   Among those childhood cancer survivors who do attend a Survivor clinic, a majority are in need of continued education about their specific cancer treatments, recommended follow-up practices, and risk of late effects. As many survivors of pediatric cancer appear to be unaware of the existence of Survivor clinics, improved methods of transitioning survivors after completion of treatment are needed.

AB We tested whether emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and coping (distraction, avoidance, support seeking and active coping) mediate or moderate the association between change in life stress (change in number of adverse life events) and change in adolescent problem behaviour. We used prospective and retrospective longitudinal data from a community sample. We measured change in problem behaviour as emotional and behavioural problems at Time 2 controlling for emotional and behavioural problems at Time 1, a year earlier. We measured change in life stress as life stress between Times 1 and 2, controlling for total previous life stress (before Time 1). Neither coping nor emotion regulation mediated the association between change in life stress and change in problem behaviour. Avoidance and expressive suppression were related to an increase in problem behaviour. Only cognitive reappraisal moderated the effect of increase in life stress on worsening of problem behaviour, suggesting that, as expected, cognitive reappraisal was a protective factor. In adolescents who reported they habitually reappraise, the association between change in life stress and change in emotional and behavioural problems was non-significant.

AB The motives of suicide attempts among a community sample of 99 U.S. high school students were explored. Participants completed an in-depth computer-assisted self interview about their most recent attempts as well as additional psychosocial measures. Results indicated that nearly 75% of the adolescents engaged in suicide attempts for reasons other than killing themselves and that depressive symptoms and premeditation prior to the attempt were significantly associated with increased risk for engaging in the attempts with death as a clear motive. Linking motive for an attempt (death, interpersonal communication, emotion regulation) and treatment approach may improve prevention of subsequent attempts and completed suicides.

AB Purpose: Recent research suggests a role of cognitive self-regulation skills on obesity and lifestyle behaviors. However, very little is known about the role of emotion regulation. This study examined the association of emotion regulation with lifestyle behaviors and examined a mediational model testing the effects of emotion regulation through self-efficacy and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 602 adolescents (mean age 12.7 years) from 4 public schools in the Bronx, NY. The sample was 58% female, predominantly Hispanic (74%) and US born (81%). Emotion regulation was assessed by 3 indicators and defined as a latent variable. Dependent variables included fruit/vegetable intake, snack/junk food intake, frequency of physical activity, and time spent in sedentary behaviors. Structural equation modeling examined the association of emotion regulation with lifestyle behaviors, with self-efficacy and depressive symptoms defined as potential mediators.
   Results: The analyses showed that there was a positive association of emotion regulation with higher intake of fruits/vegetable and greater physical activity, which was mediated by self-efficacy. Emotion regulation was related to snack/junk food intake and sedentary behavior, and the structural equation model indicated pathways through an inverse relation to depressive symptoms, but these pathways were only observed in adolescent girls and not boys.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that the ability to regulate emotions among adolescents has a role in weight-related behaviors. Future studies may need to explore the relation of other dimensions of emotion to positive health behaviors and study aspects of emotion regulation that may be more relevant for boys.

AB Due to the higher diagnostic prevalence of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in females, there exists a dearth of literature on the manifestations of BPD in men and minimal information on male developmental trajectories to the disorder. To identify precursors of BPD in males, surveys were administered to parents about their BPD male offspring and non-BPD male siblings. Questions covered aspects of probands' lives from infancy to late adolescence. BPD offspring were identified through self-reported clinical diagnoses and standardized diagnostic criteria embedded within the survey. A total of 263 male offspring (97 meeting strict criteria for BPD and 166 non-BPD siblings) were studied. The authors found that parents describe the early emergence of a constellation of symptoms in their BPD sons that include separation anxiety starting in infancy, body image concerns in childhood, and impulsivity, emptiness, and odd thinking in adolescence. This trajectory differs from the developmental course found in females diagnosed with BPD.

AB The main aims of the present study were to compare the frequency and correlates of psychopathological symptoms in two generations of the same family in Japan and in England.
   The sample included 689 adolescents and one of their parents/guardians. All participants completed a set of questionnaires to measure psychopathological symptoms, self-construals, and perceived social support.
   In both parent and adolescent data, the Japanese sample reported significantly lower psychopathological symptoms than the English sample. The relationship between parental and adolescent psychopathology was significant in England, but not in Japan. In both countries, perceived social support and independent self-construal were generally associated with less psychopathological symptoms, and interdependent self-construal was associated with more symptoms. Additionally, in England, a significant interaction effect was found between social support and the self-construals. Participants with low independent and high interdependent self-construal had elevated levels of psychopathological symptoms when perceived social support was low.
   The present study illustrates the importance of culture in the transmission of psychopathological symptoms across different generations in the same family.

AB Previous studies on victimization have either used self-reports of peer-reports, but correspondence between these measures is low, implying that types of victims may exist that differ in convergence between self- and peer-reported victimization. Importantly, the very few studies that do exist on such types were cross-sectional, and did not address the stability nor predictive validity in terms of adjustment of these types. Using a person-centered approach, the present study identified types of victims that were either convergent or divergent in self- and peer-reported victimization, and examined how these types differed in concurrent and prospective adjustment. Participants were 1,346 adolescents (50 % girls, mean age 14.2) who were followed for 1 year. Using Latent Profile Analysis, we identified two convergent types (self-peer identified victims and non-victims) and two divergent types (self-identified and peer-identified) of victims. The types were highly stable over time. Self-peer identified victims were not only concurrently but also prospectively the least well adjusted. Self-identified victims showed lower levels of emotional adjustment but did not show problems on social adjustment. On the other hand, peer-identified victims were at risk for social but not emotional maladjustment. The findings corroborate previous studies that suggest that self-reported victimization is related to emotional problems, while peer-reported victimization is more indicative of social problems. The findings also suggest that using self-reports or peer-reports only may lead to incomplete conclusions about victims' adjustment on different domains.

AB This study examined the contribution to parent-adolescent conflict resolution of parental adult attachment styles and attitudes toward adolescent separation. Questionnaires were completed by 295 couples with early to late adolescent children. Structural equation models were used to test self and partner influences on conflict resolution for three attachment orientations: confidence (model A), anxiety (model B) and avoidance (model C). Model A showed self influences between parents' confidence orientation and negotiation and also via positive attitudes towards separation. Also, the fathers' use of negotiation was facilitated by the mothers' confidence orientation and vice versa, indicating partner influences as well. Model B showed self influences between parents' anxiety orientation and the use of dominance and withdrawal and also via negative attitudes towards separation. Model C showed self influences between parents' avoidance orientation and dominance and withdrawal, and a partner influence between fathers' avoidance and mothers' use of dominance. The results indicated that the parents' adult attachment system and the parenting system were related in the area of conflict resolution, and that self influences were stronger than partner influences.

AB Little research has examined the association of parents' friendships with adolescent's well-being, perhaps because the association was considered too distal. However, developmental theories suggest that contexts in which parents, but not their children, are situated may be related to child development (Bronfenbrenner, , ). The current work examined associations between the quality of mothers' own friendships and their adolescent children's friendship quality and emotional adjustment. Fifth-, eighth-, and eleventh-graders (N=172) whose mothers' friendships were characterized by conflict and antagonism reported having friendships that were high in negative friendship qualities as well as elevated internalizing symptoms. These associations held after controlling for mother-child relationship quality, suggesting that mothers' friendships may have a unique association with adolescents' adjustment.

AB Nighttime settling difficulties (i.e., bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay) occur in about 25% of young children and are associated with attentional, behavioral, and emotional problems. We examined whether the timing of internal (endogenous) circadian melatonin phase (i.e., dim light melatonin onset; DLMO) and its relationship with parent-selected bedtimes were related to nighttime settling behaviors. Fourteen regularly napping preschoolers (8 females; 30-36months) participated in a 6-day protocol (parent-report of nighttime settling, actigraphic assessment of sleep onset latency, evening salivary DLMO). Average DLMO clock time was 07:40p.m.+/- 00:48minutes, occurring 29minutes +/- 32minutes prior to bedtime (lights-out). Children with later DLMOs had longer sleep-onset latencies (r=.62) and poorer success in falling asleep (r=-.59). Children whose bedtimes were closer to their DLMO had longer sleep-onset latencies (r=.72) and increased bedtime resistance (r=-.54). We conclude that dissonance between parent-selected bedtimes and children's circadian physiology may contribute to the development of nighttime settling difficulties in early childhood.

AB Background: In altricial species, maternal stimuli have powerful effects on amygdala development and attachment-related behaviors. In humans, maternal deprivation has been associated with both "indiscriminate friendliness" toward non-caregiving adults and altered amygdala development. We hypothesized that maternal deprivation would be associated with reduced amygdala discrimination between mothers and strangers and increased parent report of indiscriminate friendliness behaviors.
   Methods: Sixty-seven youths (33 previously institutionalized; 34 comparison; age-at-scan 4-17 years) participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment designed to examine amygdala response to mother versus stranger faces. In-scanner behavior was measured. Indiscriminate friendliness was assessed with parental report.
   Results: Comparison youth showed an amygdala response that clearly discriminated mother versus stranger stimuli. Previously institutionalized youths, by contrast, exhibited reduced amygdala discrimination between mothers and strangers. Reduced amygdala differentiation correlated with greater reports of indiscriminate friendliness. These effects correlated with age-at-adoption, with later adoptions being associated with reduced amygdala discrimination and more indiscriminate friendliness.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that early maternal deprivation is associated with reduced amygdala discrimination between mothers and strangers, and reduced amygdala discrimination was associated with greater reports of indiscriminate friendliness. Moreover, these effects increased with age-at-adoption. These data suggest that the amygdala, in part, is associated with indiscriminate friendliness and that there might be a dose-response relationship between institutional rearing and indiscriminate friendliness.

AB Objective: To qualitatively explore the experiences, challenges and needs of parents of children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in order to inform future intervention research through incorporation of participant knowledge and experience.
   Methods: Parents of children with TBI (n = 10) and experienced health professionals in paediatric rehabilitation (n = 5) took part in focus groups or individual interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and an inductive thematic analysis performed.
   Findings: Participants reported that, beyond the impact of the injury on the child, TBI affects the entire family. Parents need to adjust to and manage their child's difficulties and can also experience significant emotional distress, relationship discord and burden of care, further adding to the challenges of the parenting role. Parents can feel isolated and the importance of empowerment, support and information was emphasized. Coping styles of disengagement and avoidance were often reported, despite acknowledgement that these were not beneficial.
   Conclusions: Parenting interventions may provide essential support for parents in adjusting to and managing their child's difficulties and the efficacy of existing programmes needs evaluation. Addressing parent emotional adjustment and coping strategies is vital following paediatric TBI, given the impact on parent well-being and the potential negative effects on child outcomes through reduced parenting effectiveness. Group programmes may enable connection and support.

AB Recent research has determined that affective pictures modulate event-related delta and beta oscillations in adults. However, it is unclear whether these brain oscillations reflect developmental changes in the processing of affective information during adolescence. EEG data were collected from 51 adolescents and 18 undergraduates as they viewed a total of 90 pictures. In the range of fast wave activities, event-related synchronization (ERS) in the beta band varied with emotional valence, indicating that beta ERS is indicative of early bottom-up processing of visual emotional stimuli. Adolescents at the age of 12 years exhibited more positive beta ERS amplitudes over posterior brain regions for positive versus neutral pictures compared to adolescents at the ages 14years, 16 years and in young adults; however, no age-related differences were found for negative versus neutral pictures. In the range of slow wave activities, delta ERSs and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes exhibited affective modulation and decreased over anterior brain regions from between the age of 12 years and early adulthood. These slow wave activities (delta and LPPs) reflected top-down attention to the motivational relevance of the emotional stimuli. Taken together, these observations suggest that adolescents exhibit dissociable ERS patterns in the delta and beta bands during affective processing. Furthermore, adolescents undergo age-dependent changes in oscillatory brain reorganization. Our results should be useful to researchers interested in affective processing during adolescence.

AB IMPORTANCE The study provides novel data to inform the mechanisms by which poverty negatively impacts childhood brain development.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the income-to-needs ratio experienced in early childhood impacts brain development at school age and to explore the mediators of this effect.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This studywas conducted at an academic research unit at theWashington University School of Medicine in St Louis. Data from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development in preschool children who participated in neuroimaging at school age were used to investigate the effects of poverty on brain development. Children were assessed annually for 3 to 6 years prior to the time of amagnetic resonance imaging scan, during which they were evaluated on psychosocial, behavioral, and other developmental dimensions. Preschoolers included in the study were 3 to 6 years of age and were recruited from primary care and day care sites in the St Louis metropolitan area; they were annually assessed behaviorally for 5 to 10 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with clinical symptoms of depression participated in neuroimaging at school age/early adolescence.
   EXPOSURE Household poverty as measured by the income-to-needs ratio.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain volumes of children's white matter and cortical gray matter, as well as hippocampus and amygdala volumes, obtained usingmagnetic resonance imaging. Mediators of interest were caregiver support/hostility measured observationally during the preschool period and stressful life events measured prospectively.
   RESULTS Poverty was associated with smaller white and cortical gray matter and hippocampal and amygdala volumes. The effects of poverty on hippocampal volume were mediated by caregiving support/hostility on the left and right, as well as stressful life events on the left.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The finding that exposure to poverty in early childhood materially impacts brain development at school age further underscores the importance of attention to the well-established deleterious effects of poverty on child development. Findings that these effects on the hippocampus are mediated by caregiving and stressful life events suggest that attempts to enhance early caregiving should be a focused public health target for prevention and early intervention. Findings substantiate the behavioral literature on the negative effects of poverty on child development and provide new data confirming that effects extend to brain development. Mechanisms for these effects on the hippocampus are suggested to inform intervention.

AB Purpose To explore the quality of life (QOL) and patient expectations among adolescents with neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) and their parents using qualitative and quantitative approaches.
   Methods A total of 18 adolescents (10-17 y) with residual NBPP impairment and their parents underwent separate 1-hour tape-recorded semistructured interviews. We also collected quantitative physical examination measures and patient-rated outcome scores, specifically the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument and the Child Health Questionnaire, to quantify the severity of each adolescent's functional deficit and increase our understanding of QOL and patient expectations.
   Results Through qualitative analysis, we identified several patient- and system-dependent factors contributing to QOL, such as social impact and peer acceptance, emotional adjustment, aesthetic concerns and body image, functional limitations, physical and occupational therapy, finances, pain, and family dynamics. Despite residual impairment, most adolescents and their parents reported a good overall QOL according to quantitative outcome measures. Our study results showed that functional and aesthetic factors were responsible for most observed differences in QOL among NBPP adolescents. We also found that the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument might be more sensitive than the Child Health Questionnaire in assessing patient expectations and QOL among this patient population.
   Conclusions Understanding patient expectations and QOL in NBPP adolescents is essential for medical decision making and advancing care. Physical examination measurements alone may not be sufficient for measuring outcome, and knowledge regarding environmental factors and family dynamics is important for clinicians to consider when counseling families of children with NBPP and improving overall outcome.

AB Adult observers are typically the only informants on emotional and behavioral problems in young children. Although additional information can be provided by child self-report, few validated, structured instruments are available to obtain self-report from young children. The Berkeley Puppet Interview (BPI) has been developed to obtain structured self-reports on multiple domains of mental health and social well-being. This study was the 1st to evaluate the psychometric properties of the BPI in a large sample. We studied 8 a priori scales of the interview in a Dutch community sample of 6,375 children ages 5-7 years. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we demonstrated adequate fit (Tucker-Lewis index = .90; comparative fit index = .90; root-mean-square error of approximation = .03) of a multidimensional model with 50 items loading on 8 latent factors (Depression, Separation Anxiety, Overanxious, Oppositional Defiant, Overt Hostility, Conduct Problems, Bullied by Peers, and Peer Acceptance/Rejection). This model was invariant across gender. Children reported anxiety-related problems more frequently than depressive problems, behavioral problems, or difficulties in peer relations. Reliability analyses showed that 3 broadband scales designated as Internalizing, Externalizing, and Peer Relations were homogeneous constructs (alpha s = .68-.79). Higher scores on most BPI scales were associated with lower maternal education, lower family income, and non-Western ethnicity. Boys reported more behavioral and peer relation problems, whereas girls reported more emotional problems. The findings indicate that young children from socioeconomically and demographically diverse backgrounds are capable of providing valid, multidimensional information on their emotional, behavioral, and peer relation problems using the BPI. Young children's self-report is a promising addition to existing assessment tools.

AB Childhood and adolescent mental health have a lasting impact on adult life chances, with strong implications for subsequent health, including cognitive aging. Using the British 1946 birth cohort, the authors tested associations between adolescent conduct problems, emotional problems and aspects of self-organization, and verbal memory at 43 years and rate of decline in verbal memory from 43 to 60-64 years. After controlling for childhood intelligence, adolescent self-organization was positively associated with verbal memory at 43 years, mainly through educational attainment, although not with rate of memory decline. Associations between adolescent conduct and emotional problems and future memory were of negligible magnitude. It has been suggested that interventions to improve self-organization may save a wide range of societal costs; this study also suggests that this might also benefit cognitive function in later life.

AB Introduction: Research has shown that eating disorder (ED) patients who abuse substances demonstrate worse ED symptomatology and poorer outcomes than those with EDs alone, including increased general medical complications and psychopathology, longer recovery times, poorer functional outcomes and higher relapse rates. This article provides a broad overview of the prevalence, aetiology, assessment and management of co-morbid EDs and substance use disorders (SUDs).
   Review: The co-occurrence of EDs and SUDs is high. The functional relationship between EDs and SUDs vary within and across ED subtypes, depends on the class of substance, and needs to be carefully assessed for each patient. Substances such as caffeine, tobacco, insulin, thyroid medications, stimulants or over the counter medications (laxatives, diuretics) may be used to aid weight loss and/or provide energy, and alcohol or psychoactive substances could be used for emotional regulation or as part of a pattern of impulsive behaviour. A key message conveyed in the current literature is the importance of screening and assessment for co-morbid SUDs and EDs in patients presenting with either disorder. There is a paucity of treatment studies on the management of co-occurring EDs and SUDs. Overall, the literature indicates that the ED and SUD should be addressed simultaneously using a multi-disciplinary approach. The need for medical stabilization, hospitalization or inpatient treatment needs to be assessed based on general medical and psychiatric considerations. Common features across therapeutic interventions include psycho-education about the aetiological commonalities, risks and sequelae of concurrent ED behaviours and substance abuse, dietary education and planning, cognitive challenging of eating disordered attitudes and beliefs, building of skills and coping mechanisms, addressing obstacles to improvement and the prevention of relapse. Emphasis should be placed on building a collaborative therapeutic relationship and avoiding power struggles. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been frequently used in the treatment of co-morbid EDs and SUDs, however there are no randomized controlled trials. More recently evidence has been found for the efficacy of dialectical behavioural therapy in reducing both ED and substance use behaviours.
   Conclusion: Future research would benefit from a meta-analysis of the current research in order to better understand the relationships between these two commonly co-occurring disorders.

AB Objective: In light of the current controversy about whether severe temper outbursts are diagnostic of mania in young children, we conducted a study to characterize such children, focusing on mania and other mood disorders, emotion regulation, and parental psychiatric history.
   Methods: Study participants included 51 5-9-year-old children with frequent, impairing outbursts (probands) and 24 non-referred controls without outbursts. Parents completed a lifetime clinical interview about their child, and rated their child's current mood and behavior. Teachers completed a behavior rating scale. To assess emotion regulation, children were administered the Balloons Game, which assesses emotion expressivity in response to frustration, under demands of high and low regulation. Parental lifetime diagnoses were ascertained in blind clinical interviews.
   Results: No child had bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), or major depression (MDD). The most prevalent disorder was oppositional defiant disorder (88.2%), followed by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (74.5%), anxiety disorders (49.0%), and non-MDD depressive disorders (33.3%). Eleven probands (21.6%) met criteria for severe mood dysregulation. During the Balloons Game, when there were no demands for self-regulation, children with severe outbursts showed reduced positive expressivity, and also showed significant deficits in controlling negative facial expressions when asked to do so. Anxiety disorders were the only diagnoses significantly elevated in probands' mothers.
   Conclusions: Overall, young children with severe temper outbursts do not present with bipolar disorder. Rather, disruptive behavior disorders with anxiety and depressive mood are common. In children with severe outbursts, deficits in regulating emotional facial expressions may reflect deficits controlling negative affect. This work represents a first step towards elucidating mechanisms underlying severe outbursts in young children.

AB The present study aimed to test if measures of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity additively predicted dimensional scores of borderline personality disorder assessed using the Borderline Personality Disorder Scale of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4+ in two independent samples of Italian nonclinical adolescents. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that three dimensions of emotion dysregulation (difficulties controlling impulsive behaviours when distressed, limited access to effective emotional regulation strategies and lack of emotional clarity) were significantly associated with BPD features in both samples. Further, impulsivity scores accounted for a significant amount of additional variance in BPD features above and beyond emotion dysregulation. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Personality Disorders (PDs) can reasonably hope to gain benefit from psychotherapy. Nevertheless many patients do not fully respond. Research therefore has to be done into which variables need to be targeted in psychotherapy, in order to tailor treatment to the needs of the majority of PD patients. These have to date been understudied, in particular where patients have PD other than borderline and where they obtain no or limited benefits from available treatments. Many elements of the therapy process, such as therapy alliance, can be investigated. We outline here some personality pathology core issues and then describe how the authors involved in this special issue investigated the roles of symptoms, emotional experience and regulation, interpersonal patterns and mentalizing in PD psychotherapy.

AB OBJECTIVE: To document the persistence and predictors of mental health problems in children aged 12 to 18 months investigated for alleged maltreatment.
   METHODS: Data came from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW II), a longitudinal study of youth 0 to 17.5 years referred to US child welfare agencies. These analyses involved children 12 to 18 months. Baseline sociodemographic, social services, developmental data, and health data were collected on children and caregivers. Potential social-emotional problems at baseline were assessed with the Brief Infant Toddler Social and Emotional (BITSEA) scales. Outcomes were scores over the clinical cutoff on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5-5 assessed at 18 months after study entry.
   RESULTS: The multivariable analyses showed that an elevated BITSEA score at baseline (odds ratio 9.18, 95% confidence interval 1.49, 56.64; P = .018) and living with a depressed caregiver (odds ratio 13.54, 95% confidence interval 2.50, 73.46; P = .003) were associated with CBCL scores in the clinical range at the 18-month follow-up. For children who scored both positive on the BITSEA and lived with a depressed care-giver, 62.5% scored positive on the CBCL compared to 10.7% of the children with one risk factor and 3.8% of the children with neither risk factor. Only 23.9% of children and/or their caregivers received any service.
   CONCLUSIONS: Data show considerable persistence of mental health problems in very young children that 2 factors could identify. Lack of services to these children is a tremendous missed opportunity for identification and treatment that could potentially prevent more serious mental health problems.

AB Objectives: This article aims to explore the value of attachment theory as a framework for understanding the ways in which the staff-patient relationship is associated with different methods of regulating emotion in individuals with a diagnosis of psychosis. Method: Patient participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychosis not otherwise specified and mental health workers were recruited from 24-hour rehabilitation teams. Patient participants completed questionnaires assessing emotion regulation, attachment, therapeutic alliance and symptomatology. The therapeutic alliance was also assessed from mental workers' perspective. Results: Insecure attachment was significantly associated with greater difficulties in regulating emotions. A strong therapeutic alliance was associated with fewer difficulties in regulating emotions. Conclusions: Attachment is a useful theoretical construct for understanding psychosis, with evidence for a link between a positive staff-patient relationship and enhanced emotion regulation. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
   Key Practitioner Message
   The study supports a link between attachment organisation and psychosis, characterised by difficulties in emotion regulation. A positive patient-key worker relationship may facilitate the development of emotion regulation in this client group. A key implication of these findings is the training of MDT staff in the implementation of attachment-informed interventions.

ID SOCIAL WITHDRAWAL; TRAJECTORIES; CHILDHOOD
AB Social withdrawal has been associated with adjustment difficulties across development. Although much is known about shyness, little is known about preference-for-solitude; even less is known about its relations with adjustment across different periods of adolescence. We examined whether preference-for-solitude might be differentially associated with adjustment difficulties in early and late adolescence. Self- and parent-reports of withdrawal motivations and adjustment were collected from 234 eighth graders (113 boys; M age=13.43) and 204 twelfth graders (91 boys; M age=17.25). Results from structural equation modeling demonstrated that above and beyond the effects of shyness, preference-for-solitude was more strongly associated with adjustment difficulties in 8th grade than in 12th grade. Preference-for-solitude was associated with greater anxiety/depression, emotion dysregulation, and lower self-esteem in 8th grade; these relations were not found in 12th grade. Although preference-for-solitude was associated with lower social competence in both 8th and 12th grades, this relation was significantly stronger in 8th grade than in 12th grade. Findings suggest preference-for-solitude has closer ties to maladjustment in early adolescence than in late adolescence. Interventions targeting preferred-solitary youth in early adolescence may be particularly fruitful.

AB The development of learning difficulties is associated with problems in external (executive) and extensive behaviour in a co-occurrence with psycho-emotional problems beginning from pre-school, school age, and adolescence up to adulthood. Through the current survey, we aim to emphasise the early role of learning difficulties during the school age and adolescence of prisoners and their effects on the onset of offending behaviours in adulthood, such as criminal behaviour. Altogether, we studied 117 Greek adult prisoners from 18 to 70 years old who were accused of different types or degrees of offences. Through statistical analyses, the following factors were observed with high statistical significance as early indicators of criminal behaviour in the adult lives of the prisoners: (i) learning difficulties, (ii) family problems, (iii) behaviour disorders, (iv) developmental disorders, and (v) psycho-emotional disorders. As a result, the learning difficulties were assumed to be the most decisive factor in the developmental progression of prisoners because they manifested early in the prisoners' lives, weakened the prisoners to be competitive and robust, provoked a bad self-image and low self-esteem, and, in the frame of a weak or negative family and educational environment, they accompanied antisocial behaviour and psycho-emotional disorders even from adolescence, which continued into adulthood.

AB Adolescents with emotional distress may find help-seeking an extremely daunting endeavor. However, different adolescent population sectors relate differently to help-seeking for severe emotional difficulties. Gender and ethnic group are among the central factors influencing attitudes towards seeking emotional help. One of the possible mechanisms explaining these cross-group differences is self-esteem. The psychological price of seeking help could be admission of incompetence and feelings of failure, emotions that can be threatening, particularly to adolescents' self-esteem. In the present study, the psychological price of seeking help was manipulated by comparing the ease with which adolescents would self-refer for a severe emotional problem as opposed to referring another for the same problem, and the influence of gender, ethnic group differences and level of self esteem in both situations. The first hypothesis predicting greater ease of referral in the other-referral condition compared to self-referral was confirmed. The second hypothesis predicting general preference of informal help agents than the formal help agents was confirmed. The third hypothesis predicting gender differences such that girls would show higher ease of referral than boys from the different help agents was confirmed. The fourth hypothesis predicting that Jewish-Israeli adolescents would show greater ease of referral than Arab-Israeli adolescents was confirmed. An additional exploratory question examined the interaction between self-esteem and self versus other-referral on ease of referral for help. A significant interaction emerged only for help from the family. Adolescents with low self-esteem showed no differences in self versus other-referral, but adolescents with high self-esteem were more willing to refer others than themselves to seek help. These findings emphasize the importance of a sensitive needs assessment approach in designing mental health service delivery for youth. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) and depression co-occur at far greater levels than chance, despite largely separate diagnostic criteria. One potential shared mechanism of this comorbidity is emotion dysregulation, which characterizes both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Previous research demonstrates that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)a peripheral biomarker of emotion regulationis attenuated among children with CD, and among children with depression. However, few studies have examined biomarkers of emotion regulation as a function of heterotypic comorbidity. We evaluated longitudinal patterns of RSA and RSA reactivity to emotion evocation across three annual assessments among 207 children diagnosed at ages 8-12 years with CD (n=30), depression (n=28), comorbid CD and depression (n=80), or no psychiatric condition (n=69). Using continuous symptom counts as predictors, DepressionxCD interactions were observed for both Time 1 resting RSA and Time 1 RSA reactivity. CD, depression, and their interaction were all associated with low resting RSA at Time 1. In addition, concurrently elevated CD and depression scores predicted the greatest RSA reactivity to emotion evocation. Psychopathology scores were unrelated to developmental changes in RSA and RSA reactivity over time. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 55: 698-706, 2013.

AB Adolescents use media that exposes them to sexual material. This study focused on adolescents in the Czech Republic, a country with relatively high rates of exposure to sexual material (ESM). A sample of adolescents aged 11 to 15 years (N = 495) taken from the project EU Kids Online II was examined for predictors of the following: frequency of ESM, place of ESM, and, for online ESM, the types of sites. The only predictors of sporadic ESM were age and excessive Internet use, while age, gender, sensation seeking, and excessive Internet use were predictors of frequent ESM. Age and excessive Internet use were predictors only of ESM online, while age, gender, emotional problems, sensation seeking, and excessive Internet use were predictors of ESM in online and offline environments. High ESM is linked to adolescent vulnerability and also to adolescent psychosexual development. The implications of these findings are discussed in this article.

AB Using multi-informant data drawn from a prospective study involving 184 youth, mother-perpetrated and father-perpetrated partner aggression during early adolescence (the age of 13) was examined as a predictor of five types of disengagement coping strategies in emerging adulthood (the age of 21): behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement, denial, substance use, and restraint. The ability to develop close friendships, or friendship competence, was examined as a moderator of these links. Results suggest that inter-parent aggression in early adolescence can predict reliance on disengagement coping 8 years later, but that friendship competence can buffer against the reliance on disengagement coping. Moreover, close friendship competence was not directly related to partner aggression by mothers or fathers, suggesting that friendship competence develops along an independent developmental track and thus may truly serve as a buffer for young adults with a history of exposure to inter-parent aggression.

AB The authors investigated the patterns of reactive and proactive aggression exhibited by young male (N = 604) and female (N = 544) adolescents in Singapore. Self-report measures of reactive and proactive aggression, behavioral and emotional adjustment, parenting styles, and delinquency were administered to students aged 13-14. Using cluster analysis, three distinct patterns of aggression emerged: a low aggressive group, a combined aggressive group with high reactive and proactive aggression, and a reactively aggressive group with low proactive and high reactive aggression. The two aggressive groups showed similar disturbances in adjustment and delinquency, but the combined group showed the greatest disruptions. Findings indicate cross-cultural stability of patterns of aggression as well as the usefulness of the reactive/proactive distinction in early identification of individuals with adjustment problems.

AB The present study examined the cortical processes that mediate cognitive regulation in response to emotion-eliciting stimuli, before and after anxious children participated in a cognitive behavioral therapy program. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded from anxious children (n = 24, 8 males) and comparison children (n = 16, 7 males) at pre-and post-treatment sessions. The change in anxiety T-scores from pre- to post-treatment was used to signify clinical improvement among anxious children (Improvers: n = 11 vs. Non-improvers: n = 13). Event-related potential components were recorded while children performed a Go/No-go task using emotional facial expressions. For the P1 component, believed to reflect attention and/or arousal processes, Non-improvers had greater activation levels relative to Improver and comparison groups at both sessions. Greater P1 amplitudes at pre-treatment predicted non-improvement following treatment. For the frontal N2 component, thought to reflect cognitive control processing, Improvers recruited greater activation from pre- to post-treatment, a change in activation that was predictive of treatment outcome. Non-improvers showed increased cortical activation within the time window of the P1, whether at pre- or post-treatment. These data suggest that heightened perceptual vigilance may have led to poorer outcomes. Improvers showed increased prefrontal activation within the time window of the N2 from pre- to post-treatment. These data suggest that increased cognitive control may have led to improved treatment outcomes. In sum, P1 activation may serve as a predictor of treatment outcome, while N2 activation may serve as an indicator of treatment response.

AB As Internet usage has become more prevalent among youth, so too has problematic Internet use. Despite the critical role of emotion regulation in the development of adolescents' behaviors and the role of parenting interactions on their children's behaviors, little research has examined these links with reference to problematic and addictive Internet use for adolescents. The main goal of this study was to examine these links, based on a sample of 525 high school students (368 males; M = 15.33 years, SD = 0.47) from a predominantly middle and lower-middle socioeconomic community in Seoul, Korea. Results from structural equation modeling revealed that students' difficulties in emotion regulation was a mediating variable between students' perceptions of their parents' parenting behaviors and the students' Internet use. The findings substantiate the importance of conceptualizing addiction from a social/cognitive theoretical framework and the notion that adolescence is the onset period for many addictive behaviors and so more proactive attention needs to be given to reducing these early negative behaviors. Based on these results, interventions designed to enhance adolescents' emotion regulatory abilities have the likelihood to mitigate problematic and even addictive Internet use among youth.

AB This study evaluated whether exposure to maternal pre- or postnatal depression or anxiety symptoms predicted psychopathology in adolescent offspring. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of pre- and postnatal depression and anxiety symptoms in 577 women of low socioeconomic status selected from a prenatal clinic. Logistic regression models indicated that maternal pre- and postnatal depression trajectory exposure was not associated with offspring major depression, anxiety, or conduct disorder, but exposure to the high depression trajectory was associated with lower anxiety symptoms in males. Exposure to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety was associated with the risk of conduct disorder among offspring. Male offspring exposed to medium and high pre- and postnatal anxiety had higher odds of conduct disorder than did males with low exposure levels. Females exposed to medium or high pre- and postnatal anxiety were less likely to meet conduct disorder criteria than were females with lower exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of pre- and postnatal anxiety trajectories on the risk of conduct disorder in offspring. These results suggest new directions for investigating the etiology of conduct disorder with a novel target for intervention.

AB Chronic, severe irritability is common in childhood and is very impairing. Furthermore, childhood irritability predicts suicidality, social impairment, and depressive and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Focusing on both normative and pathologic development, we review the construct of irritability from its origins in aggression and disruptive behavior research to its contemporary relevance for affective psychopathology. We then describe two broad neurocognitive systems that show promise in differentiating irritable from nonirritable youths: aberrant processing of emotional stimuli and impaired context-sensitive regulation. We suggest behavioral, neurocognitive, and physiologic measures that may aid in studying severe irritability and assessing its therapeutics. Finally, we argue for therapeutic trials targeting severe irritability that address emotional aspects of irritability in addition to the associated disruptive behavior.

AB Reunion behavior following stressful separations from caregivers is often considered the single most sensitive clue to infant attachment patterns. Extending these ideas to middle childhood/early adolescence, we examined participants' neural responses to reunion with peers who had previously excluded them. We recorded event-related potentials among nineteen 11- to 15-year-old youth previously classified on attachment interviews (11 secure and 8 insecure-dismissing) while they played a virtual ball-toss game (Cyberball) with peers that involved fair play, exclusion and reunion phases. Compared to secure participants, dismissing participants displayed a greater increment in the N2 during reunion relative to fair play, a neural marker commonly linked to expectancy violation. These data suggest a greater tendency toward continued expectations of rejection among dismissing children, even after cessation of social exclusion. In turn, the link between self-reported ostracism distress and neural signs of negative expectancy at reunion was moderated by attachment, such that self-reports were discordant with the neural index of expectancy violation for dismissing, but not for secure children.

AB IMPORTANCE Depression can have devastating effects unless prevented or treated early and effectively. Schools offer an excellent opportunity to intervene with adolescents presenting emotional problems. There are very few universal school-based depression interventions conducted in low-and middle-income countries.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of a school-based, universal psychological intervention to reduce depressive symptoms among adolescents from low-income families.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-arm, parallel, cluster, randomized clinical trialwas conducted in secondary schools in deprived socioeconomic areas of Santiago, Chile. Almost all students registered in the selected schools consented to take part in the study. A total of 2512 secondary school students from 22 schools and 66 classes participated.
   INTERVENTIONS Students in the intervention arm attended 11 one-hour weekly and 2 booster classroom sessions of an intervention based on cognitive-behavioral models. The intervention was delivered by trained nonspecialists. Schools in the control arm received the standard school curriculum.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Scores on the self-administered Beck Depression Inventory-II at 3 months (primary) and 12 months (secondary) after completing the intervention.
   RESULTS There were 1291 participants in the control arm and 1221 in the intervention arm. Primary outcome data were available for 82.1% of the participants. There was no evidence of any clinically important difference in mean depression scores between the groups (adjusted difference in mean, -0.19; 95% CI, -1.22 to 0.84) or for any of the other outcomes 3 months after completion of the intervention. No significant differences were found in any of the outcomes at 12 months.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Awell-designed and implemented school-based intervention did not reduce depressive symptoms among socioeconomically deprived adolescents in Santiago, Chile. There is growing evidence that universal school interventions may not be sufficiently effective to reduce or prevent depressive symptoms.

AB The diagnosis of parental cancer may destabilize the whole family, parents and children as well. The Hamburg children of somatically ill parents (COSIP) intervention supports parental skills and adaptation of children to the situation. There is currently no evidence for criteria to determine which family members should be involved in the COSIP intervention, predominantly the parents (parent setting), the children (child setting) or both (family setting).
   Data from a multicentre study were analyzed with respect to the predominant intervention settings, the correlation between setting and aims of intervention as well as variables that predict the involvement of children in the intervention.
   A total of 203 documented cases were analyzed. Different variables that had been documented by the therapists were included in a regression analysis model in order to identify predictive variables.
   In 142 cases the intervention was carried out in a specific intervention setting. In 57 % of the cases children were involved (32 % family setting and 25 % child setting). A systematic relationship between the reported intervention aims and the intervention setting was not detected. The most powerful predictor was the existence of emotional problems of children as reported by the child itself.
   Decision-making on intervention settings should therefore take the assessment of emotional symptoms of children by the means of age-appropriate self-reporting tools into consideration. Further investigations are needed to reveal variables concerning needs, motivation and capabilities of the family members as well as institutional conditions.

AB Background: Psychotic symptoms are common in adolescents in the general population but it is unknown whether they are associated with poor social functioning.
   Aims: To investigate whether adolescent psychotic symptoms are associated with poor social functioning measured by peer relationships.
   Method: Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort was used. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between psychotic symptoms at 12.9 years detected using a semi-structured interview and poor social functioning at 13.2 years using parent-reported peer problems from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results: There was strong evidence (p < 0.001) of an unadjusted association between psychotic symptoms and poor social functioning (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.24-1.61). The association was attenuated after adjusting for earlier social functioning, socio-demographic variables, bullying status and IQ (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50). The majority of the crude association was explained by additional adjustment for emotional problems including depression at age 12, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity and conduct problems at age 11 (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89-1.29).
   Conclusion: Adolescents with psychotic symptoms may be no more likely to have poor social functioning than other adolescents, once other emotional problems have been taken into account. The discussion addressed two explanations. First, emotional problems may be on the causal pathway from psychotic symptoms to poor social functioning. Alternatively, emotional symptoms may act as a confounder, suggesting that medical intervention may be inappropriate. It is the impact of psychotic symptoms on the individual that should dictate whether any intervention is required. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Promoting child wellbeing necessarily goes beyond the clinic as risks to child health and development are embedded in the social and physical environmental conditions in which children live. Pediatricians play a vital role in promoting the health of children in the communities they serve and can maximize their impact by advocating for and supporting efficacious, evidence-based strategies in their communities.
   Methods: To provide a succinct guide for community pediatric efforts to advance the wellbeing of all children and particularly disadvantaged children in a community, we conducted a theory-driven and structured narrative review to synthesize published systematic and meta-analytic reviews of policy-relevant, local-level strategies addressing potent and malleable influences on child health and development. An exhaustive list of policy-relevant, local-level strategies for improving child health was used to conduct a comprehensive search of recent (1990-2012), English language peer-reviewed published meta-analyses and systematic reviews in the 10 core databases of scientific literature. Our review of the literature encompassed six key conceptual domains of intervention foci, including distal influences of child health (i.e., income and resources, social cohesion, and physical environment) and proximal influences (i.e., family, school and peer). We examined intervention effects on four key domains of child health and development: cognitive development, social and emotional competence, psychological and behavioral wellbeing, and physical health.
   Results: Published reviews were identified for 98 distinct policy-relevant community interventions, evaluated across 288 outcomes. We classified 46 strategies as meeting scientific criteria for efficacy by having consistent, positive outcomes from high-quality trials (e.g., tenant-based rental assistance, neighborhood watch programs, urban design and land use policies, access to quality childcare services, class size reductions, after-school programs that promote personal/social skills). Another 21 strategies were classified as having consistent evidence of positive outcomes from high-quality observational studies only, while 28 strategies had insufficient evidence available to assess their effectiveness based on published reviews. We did not limit the review to studies conducted in the United States, but the vast majority of them were U.S.-based, and the results therefore are most applicable to the U.S. context.
   Conclusions: Based on our synthesis of published literature on community development strategies, we provide an illustration combining a comprehensive set of evidence-based strategies to promote child health and development across a wide-range of child health outcomes.

AB Background: Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is characterized by angry and noncompliant behaviour. It is the most common disruptive behaviour disorder (DBD), with prevalence estimates of 6-9% for preschoolers and is closely linked to several long-term difficulties, including disorders of conduct, mood, anxiety, impulse-control, and substance abuse. ODD in children is related to parental depression, family dysfunction, and impairments in parental work performance. Children displaying early DBDs exhibit more symptoms of greater severity, more frequent offences, and commit more serious crimes later in life. The goal of the Strongest Families (TM) Finland Canada (SFFC) Smart Website intervention research program is to develop and evaluate an affordable, accessible, effective secondary prevention parent training program for disruptive behaviour in preschoolers to prevent the negative sequelae of ODD. Strongest Families is an 11-session program with two booster sessions that focuses on teaching skills to: strengthen parent-child relationships; reinforce positive behaviour; reduce conflict; manage daily transitions; plan for potentially problematic situations; promote emotional regulation and pro-social behaviour and decrease antisocial behaviour.
   Methods/design: This protocol paper describes an ongoing population-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) of high-risk 4 year-olds attending well-child clinics in Turku, Finland and environs to examine the effectiveness of the Strongest Families Smart Website intervention compared to an Education Control condition. Randomization consists of a 1:1 ratio for intervention versus the education group, stratified by the child's sex. The participants randomized to the intervention group receive access to the Strongest Families Smart Website and weekly telephone coaching sessions. The participants randomized to the Education Control condition receive access to a static website with parenting tips. Children are followed using parental and daycare teacher measures at 6 and 12 months after randomization.
   Discussion: The Strongest Families Smart Website intervention is hypothesized to improve parenting skills, reduce child disruptive behaviour, reduce parental distress and improve family functioning. These results will likely inform subsequent investigations, public policy, and early treatment of childhood disruptive behaviour problems.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the associations between 2 types of emotion regulation (reactivity and inhibition) and 2 types of non-hunger-based eating (emotional eating and external eating). Although emotion regulation and eating regulation problems have both been linked to obesity in previous studies, there is little research examining the link between the two, particularly among children. Methods: A total of 782 rural second graders (49% girls, 20% American Indian) were followed longitudinally through third grade. During both data collection points, children participated in face-to-face interviews at school using the Children's Emotion Management Scales and the revised Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Results: Correlational analyses revealed that children's emotion regulation was significantly related to both external and emotional eating within and across grades, with reactivity appearing to be more consistently related to eating regulation than was inhibition. Regression analyses showed that second to third grade increases in external and emotional eating were predicted by increases in reactivity to anger and reactivity to worry. Conclusions: Given the established link in previous research between poor behavioral regulation and obesity in children, findings from this study linking child emotional reactivity and emotional and external eating (both forms of behavior dysregulation) are important in informing prevention and treatment programs. Based on these findings, targeting child emotion regulation in addition to behavior regulation skills as part of prevention and intervention programs may improve program effectiveness.

AB Insula function has been associated with emotional regulation, adjusting to changing outcomes under risk, reward and loss anticipation, discounting of future rewards, and self-rated impulsivity. The role of the insula in these processes may be fundamentally related to prospective thinking, a trait that increases with age. There is evidence that insular cortical thickness shows age related decreases that parallel age related increases in future orientation and planning. We tested the hypothesis that nonplanning decreases with age and that insula thickness is related to both age and nonplanning impulsivity. Fifty-nine male and female participants, ranging in age from 10 to 22 years old, underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures and were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). We observed that anterior insula thickness and nonplanning impulsivity show an inverse relationship with age and that there is a significant positive linear relationship between anterior insula thickness and nonplanning.

AB Purpose of reviewOver the last two decades advances in congenital heart surgery, pediatric cardiology, and pediatric intensive care have dramatically increased the survival of infants with critical congenital heart disease (CHD). Survivors often experience neurodevelopmental deficits and behavioral and emotional problems. These complications often have a profound impact on quality of life in this high-risk population. This review will focus on the most significant and innovative studies that have been published over the last 18 months that focus on predicting, evaluating, and managing neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD.
   Recent findingsRecent reports demonstrate new potential predictors of worse neurodevelopmental outcome, including abnormal fetal cerebrovascular resistance, brain biomarkers, and abnormalities in electroencephalogram (EEG) during the perioperative period, and new stratification schemata. In addition, a new evidence-based scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) describing how to evaluate and manage neurodevelopmental outcomes in children and adolescents with CHD and novel interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes will be reviewed.
   SummaryThe literature reviewed reveals new intervention opportunities to improve neurodevelopmental outcome in the fetus (cerebrovascular resistance), during the perioperative period (brain biomarkers and EEG), and through the utilization of new stratification schemata. The new AHA/AAP guidelines on the evaluation and management of neurodevelopmental outcomes create the opportunity to identify and treat a significant population of survivors with neurodevelopmental deficits with novel interventions.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between cyber-victimization and adolescent well-being, alone and in combination with relational and physical victimization. Method: Questionnaires assessing the study constructs were administered in group settings during the school day. Data were collected from 388 adolescents. Multiple regression was used to examine the unique associations between different victimization experiences and indicators of emotional well-being and academic performance. Several potential modifiers of the relationship between cyber-victimization and adolescent functioning were examined as well. Results: Cyber-victimization was positively associated with emotional problems and negatively related to GPA even after experiences of physical and relational victimization were taken into consideration. The results also indicated that cyber-victimization significantly interacted with other forms of victimization, such that both relational and physical victimization modified the relationship between cyber-victimization and GPA. Conclusion: Overall, these data demonstrate that multiple forms of victimization are negatively associated with adolescent well-being, and that cyber-victimization can influence adolescents above and beyond traditional victimization. In addition, this study has policy implications for schools and parents in regard to adolescents' victimization experiences. In particular, it will be necessary for schools to provide both academic and mental health resources for students experiencing victimization.

AB Despite research documenting a strong association between emotion dysregulation and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), the moderators of this association have received little attention. Thus, it remains unclear why some individuals with heightened emotion dysregulation engage in NSSI and others do not. Body regard (i.e., how one perceives, experiences, and cares for the body) may be one such moderator, explaining the risk for NSSI among some individuals with emotion dysregulation. The current study used structural equation modeling within a sample of 398 undergraduates (26% reporting NSSI, mean frequency=25.16, SD=40.5) to test the interactive effect of emotion dysregulation and body regard on NSSI frequency when controlling for negative affect and borderline personality disorder symptoms. The interaction model provided a strong fit to the data and showed that emotion regulation was associated with NSSI only when low levels of body regard were present. Results suggest that body regard may be important to understanding who engages in NSSI within the context of emotion dysregulation. Possible mechanisms underlying the interaction between body regard and emotion dysregulation are discussed along with treatment and prevention implications.

AB Adolescents in therapeutic schools are at greater risk for HIV and other STIs than their peers due to earlier higher rates of sexual risk and difficulty managing strong emotions. HIV prevention programs that incorporate techniques for affect management (AM) during sexual situations may be beneficial. This paper determined the immediate impact of such an intervention, AM, compared to a standard, skills-based HIV prevention intervention and a general health promotion intervention (HP) for 377 youth, ages 13-19, in therapeutic schools in two cities. 1 month after the intervention, analyses that adjusted for the baseline scores found adolescents in AM were more likely to report condom use at last sex than those in HP (0.89 vs. 0.67, p = 0.02) and that their HIV knowledge was significantly greater. These data suggest that AM techniques might improve the impact of standard skills-based prevention programs for adolescents in therapeutic schools.

AB OBJECTIVETo determine whether personality traits (conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional regulation, extraversion, and openness to experience) are associated with glycemic control and blood glucose monitoring behavior, and change or stability of these outcomes over time, in young people with type 1 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSA 3-year longitudinal study was conducted using data from 142 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 8-19 years of age. Personality was assessed at baseline using the Five-Factor Personality Inventory for Children. Data relating to glycemic control (HbA(1c)) and frequency of blood glucose monitoring (based on meter memory) were collected annually. Relationships between personality traits and HbA(1c) and monitoring frequency were examined using regression models and mixed-design ANOVA.RESULTSThree of the Five-Factor domains were independently associated with glycemic control. Individuals high in conscientiousness and agreeableness had a lower and more stable HbA(1c) across the 3-year study period. In contrast, the HbA(1c) of individuals scoring low on these traits was either consistently worse or deteriorated over time. Low or high emotional regulation scores were also associated with worse glycemic control. By the third year, these domains, together with initial HbA(1c), accounted for 39% of HbA(1c) variance. Conscientiousness was the only personality factor associated with blood glucose monitoring behavior.CONCLUSIONSResults of this study underline the importance of personality in contributing to diabetes outcomes. Attention to a young person's personality, and appropriate tailoring of diabetes management to ensure an individualized approach, may help to optimize diabetes outcomes.

DE Trauma; Residential treatment; Milieu; Trauma systems therapy
AB Although abundant evidence exists indicating the prevalence of trauma exposure among youth in residential care, few models exist for creating trauma-informed milieu treatment. This article outlines the problem and describes the implementation of Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) in three residential centers. TST is unique in emphasizing youth emotions and behaviors as well as the role a distressed or threatening social environment may play in keeping a traumatized youth in a dysregulated state. This dual emphasis makes TST specifically appropriate to implementation in congregate care, focusing assessment and intervention strategies on both clinical treatment and the functioning of the therapeutic milieu itself. Data are reported on incidents of the use of physical restraint; numbers of disrupted foster care placements following discharge from residential treatment; and scores on psychometric measures of children's functioning and emotion regulation capacity. Knowledge gained through TST implementation in these three residential centers has important implications for developing a model of trauma-informed congregate care.

AB The ability to regulate emotions represents an important developmental step in childhood. Emotion regulation is significantly influenced by various factors, such as neurological development, child's temperament, and parenting behavior.
   Current research shows that deficits in emotion regulation (i.e., the frequent use of dysfunctional regulation strategies and a lack of use of functional strategies) are associated with psychosocial impairment. In addition, a basic association could be detected between emotion regulation deficits and externalizing and internalizing disorders in childhood.
   By focusing on emotion regulation in well-directed treatment approaches, promising effects can be observed. A crucial task for future research is to further investigate the specific function of emotion regulation for psychopathology and to integrate this ability into treatment approaches for children.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the psychophysiological concomitants of self-reported behavioral inhibition system (BIS) sensitivity in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) supposed to be at risk for anxiety disorders. Twenty participants with high scores in self-reported BIS sensitivity (at-risk group) were matched in age and sex to 20 participants scoring in the normal range in BIS sensitivity (control group). Negative affect, negative emotion regulation style, and anxiety symptomatology were assessed by means of self-reported measures. Cardiac and electrodermal response signals were recorded during baseline, paced breathing, exposure to an attentional task with response cost and fear-relevant slides conditions. The at-risk group exhibited higher scores on measures of negative affect, negative emotion regulation style, and anxiety symptomatology than their control counterparts. After controlling for negative styles of emotion regulation, groups did not differ in skin conductance reactivity during the attentional task with response cost, but participants at risk exhibited more nonspecific skin conductance responses than the control group during baseline recording. Regarding the cardiac concomitants, participants at risk presented lower vagal tone at resting conditions as compared to participants in the control group. Additionally, at-risk participants exhibited lower flexibility across experimental conditions in heart rate and cardiac sample entropy measures than participants in the control group. These findings add knowledge on psychophysiological concomitants of BIS sensitivity and are discussed in light of associations between temperament and development of anxiety disorders in youth. They show how psychophysiological patterns observed in resting conditions could be useful endophenotypes to reliably detect individuals at risk before the disorder onset.

The presence of suicidal thoughts and behavior was assessed through the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Child and Parent Versions. Children and parents completed measures of anxiety severity, functional impairment, and behavioral and emotional problems. Approximately 11 % of youth displayed suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Children with autism were more likely to have suicidal thoughts and behaviors whereas children with Asperger's disorder were less likely. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors were associated with the presence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Overall, results suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are common in youth with ASD, and may be related to depression and trauma.

AB Objective: Irritability is common in children and adolescents and is the cardinal symptom of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new DSM-5 disorder, yet its neural correlates remain largely unexplored. The authors conducted a functional MRI study to examine neural responses to frustration in children with severe mood dysregulation.
   Method: The authors compared emotional responses, behavior, and neural activity between 19 severely irritable children (operationalized using criteria for severe mood dysregulation) and 23 healthy comparison children during a cued-attention task completed under nonfrustrating and frustrating conditions.
   Results: Children in both the severe mood dysregulation and the healthy comparison groups reported increased frustration and exhibited decreased ability to shift spatial attention during the frustration condition relative to the nonfrustration condition. However, these effects of frustration were more marked in the severe. mood dysregulation group than in the comparison group.. During the frustration condition, participants in the severe mood dysregulation group exhibited deactivation of the left amygdala, the left and right striatum, the parietal cortex, and the posterior cingulate on negative feedback trials, relative to the comparison group (i.e., between-group effect) and to the severe mood dysregulation group's responses on positive feedback trials (i.e., within-group effect). In contrast, neural response to positive feedback during the frustration condition did not differ between groups.
   Conclusions: In response to negative feedback received in the context of frustration, children with severe, chronic irritability showed abnormally reduced activation in regions implicated in emotion, attention, and reward processing. Frustration appears to reduce attention flexibility, particularly in severely irritable children, which may contribute to emotion regulation deficits in this population. Further research is needed to relate these findings to irritability specifically, rather than to other clinical features of severe mood dysregulation.

AB This study investigated the roles of parents' and children's emotion dysregulation in children's display of internalizing and externalizing symptoms by incorporating person- and variable-centered approaches. Sixty-four children (ages 8-11) participated in this study with their mothers. Study variables were collected via multiple methods, including behavioral observation and questionnaire assessment from both parents' and children's perspectives. Using model-based cluster analysis, children's profiles with regulating emotions were created by incorporating multiple measurements. Two profiles were identified and applied in a moderation model testing whether the combination of parents' and children's regulatory style influence child outcomes. Results showed that children's emotion dysregulation profiles moderated the relationship between parental emotion dysregulation and child internalizing symptoms, with children who adopted more internalizing regulatory styles display more internalizing symptoms in the context of high parental emotion dysregulation. Implications for the measurement of emotion regulation in the family context, and future directions for intervention, are discussed.

AB Previous research on autonomic characteristics of social anxiety in children and adolescents has produced highly inconsistent results which may partially be due to task differences and a limited breadth of autonomic measurement. Here we investigated a sample of high (HSA) and low socially anxious (LSA) children, aged 10-12 years before, during and after a standardized evaluated speech task while acquiring a broad set of autonomic and experiential measures. During baseline, we found evidence for tonically higher sympathetic autonomic activity in HSA children, indicated by higher low frequency heart rate variability (LF) and a trend for higher LF to high frequency heart rate variability ratios (LF/HF). In response to the speech task, HSA children showed blunted cardiac responding evidenced by slower increase and delayed recovery of heart rate and a similar significant trend on LF/HF values. Self-reported anxiety, by contrast, showed enhanced reactivity from baseline to anticipation in the HSA compared to the LSA group. The results suggest a restricted cardiac flexibility in HSA children and illustrate that broad autonomic assessment during a well-structured, naturalistic task may improve our understanding of the autonomic physiology of socially anxious children. The results have implications for current theories of social anxiety.

AB ObjectivesTo determine (a) the prevalence of Rome III abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in a western community sample of children, (b) their associations with sociodemographic factors, and (c) whether children fulfilling Rome III abdominal pain diagnoses show higher rates of psychological distress and somatization.MethodsData were collected from parents of 6-10-year-old children who were recruited from 22 public grammar schools in Germany. A total of 1537 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders were diagnosed on the basis of questionnaire responses by Rome III criteria. Further, somatic complaints as well as emotional and behavioral problems were assessed.ResultsIn total, 7.7% of children aged 6-10 years fulfilled the criteria for at least one Rome III abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder according to their parents. The most prevalent diagnoses were irritable bowel syndrome (4.9%) and functional abdominal pain (2.0%). Assigned diagnoses were not associated with sociodemographic factors. We could confirm that abdominal pain-related functional disorders, especially irritable bowel syndrome, were strongly associated with somatization and emotional problems in community.ConclusionRome III abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders are a common health problem in children and are, even in community, strongly associated with other somatic complaints and psychological distress.

AB Despite fruitful research on some aspects of adolescent coping, the development of specific coping mechanisms still remains a neglected topic. The present empirical study with 535 early adolescents (M = 12.60 years) and their parents examines possible developmental components of accommodative coping competences. Using latent path modelling, we investigated how specific components of four sets of variables (cognitive abilities, experiences in life, goal disengagement, and parental influences) contributed to accommodative coping capacities in the adolescents. Direct effects (e.g., specific cognitive abilities, parental influences) and indirect effects (e.g., positive experiences in life) on accommodative coping were identified for the components investigated. Future research should focus on the relevance of these components for the development of accommodative coping capacities. (C) 2013 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Most youth detained in juvenile justice facilities have extensive histories of exposure to psychological trauma. Traumatic stress plays a key role in their mental health and behavioral problems and needs, and in their safety and rehabilitation and the security and effectiveness of detention facilities. We provide an overview of the barriers to successful provision of mental health services for youths in juvenile justice facilities, including those involving youth, parents, and juvenile justice residential facility staff and administrators. Next, we discuss the relevance and potential utility of approaching mental health needs using posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and more broadly posttraumatic dysregulation, as an organizing framework. Examples of how a posttraumatic dysregulation perspective can enhance juvenile justice residential facility milieus and services are presented, with an overview of traumatic stress intervention models that have shown promise, or potentially could be deployed, in developing and sustaining trauma-informed juvenile justice facilities.

AB Objective: Diet quality is related to the risk for depression and anxiety in adults and adolescents; however, the possible impact of maternal and early postnatal nutritional exposures on children's subsequent mental health is unexplored. Method: The large prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study recruited pregnant women between 1999 and 2008. Data were collected from mothers during pregnancy and when children were 6 months and 1.5, 3, and 5 years of age. Latent growth curve models were used to model linear development in children's internalizing and externalizing problems from 1.5 to 5 years of age as a function of diet quality during pregnancy and at 1.5 and 3 years. Diet quality was evaluated by dietary pattern extraction and characterized as "healthy" or "unhealthy." The sample comprised 23,020 eligible women and their children. Adjustments were made for variables including sex of the child, maternal depression, maternal and paternal age, maternal educational attainment, household income, maternal smoking before and during pregnancy, mothers' parental locus of control, and marital status. Results: Higher intakes of unhealthy foods during pregnancy predicted externalizing problems among children, independently of other potential confounding factors and childhood diet. Children with a high level of unhealthy diet postnatally had higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Moreover, children with a low level of postnatal healthy diet also had higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Conclusion: Among this large cohort of mothers and children, early nutritional exposures were independently related to the risk for behavioral and emotional problems in children.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are reported to have high rates of co-occurring psychopathology. Little is known about risk factors that might contribute to this psychopathology. This study modeled the effect of family poverty on psychopathology trajectories in young children with ASD, and examined whether home organization and maternal warmth and involvement could buffer the effect of poverty on children's psychopathology. Method: The sample comprised 209 children with ASD who participated in the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, a population birth cohort study. Individual trajectories of psychopathology at ages 3, 5, and 7 years were analyzed using growth curve models. Psychopathology was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Children with ASD exhibited increasingly high rates of psychopathology over time. Family poverty was associated with broad and specific (emotional and conduct problems) psychopathology, but not with changes in psychopathology over time. Warmth, involvement, and home organization did not buffer the association of family poverty with psychopathology. However, low warmth explained the relationship between poverty and broad psychopathology, and predicted annual changes in broad psychopathology. Warmth was associated with fewer conduct problems and less hyperactivity, and with an annual decrease in peer and conduct problems. Household chaos was a risk factor for conduct problems, as was maternal involvement for peer problems. Conclusions: Family poverty, low maternal warmth, and household chaos are risk factors for externalizing problems in children with ASP. Maternal warmth may be a key target for intervention, particularly in poorer families of children with ASD.

AB In recent years, research has examined the role of heightened emotional reactivity and poor regulation on maladjustment during childhood and adolescence. Although much of this research has shown a direct link between high emotional reactivity and maladjustment, there is less research on the ways in which reactivity interacts with contextual factors. Using data from the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), the current study asks how emotional reactivity in childhood, household chaos, and household income impact changes in emotional and behavioral problems between childhood and adolescence. Participants in the SECCYD were followed from birth until adolescence. Of these, 958 youth (52 % male; 80 % Caucasian, 13 % African American, 2 % Asian, and 5 % Other) who completed measures at age 15 were included in the current study. Results indicate that emotional reactivity and low household income during childhood directly predict higher levels of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescence. In contrast, the impact of household chaos on adolescent mental health depends on the child's emotional reactivity. Specifically, the adverse impact of household chaos on emotional problems was observed among adolescents who were highly emotionally reactive as children, but not among their less reactive counterparts. Taken together, the relationship between an individual's childhood context and temperament are important aspects in the prediction of outcomes in adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND: Over the past decades, increased knowledge about childhood abuse and trauma have prompted changes in child welfare policy, and practice that may have affected the out-of-home (OOH) care population. However, little is known about recent national trends in child maltreatment, OOH placement, or characteristics of children in OOH care. The objective of this study was to examine trends in child maltreatment and characteristics of children in OOH care.
   METHODS: We analyzed 2 federal administrative databases to identify and characterize US children who were maltreated (National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System) or in OOH care (Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System). We assessed trends between 2000 and 2010.
   RESULTS: The number of suspected maltreatment cases increased 17% from 2000 to 2010, yet the number of substantiated cases decreased 7% and the number of children in OOH care decreased 25%. Despite the decrease in OOH placements, we found a 19% increase in the number of children who entered OOH care because of maltreatment (vs other causes), a 36% increase in the number of children with multiple (vs single) types of maltreatment, and a 60% increase in the number of children in OOH care identified as emotionally disturbed.
   CONCLUSIONS: From 2000 to 2010, fewer suspected cases of maltreatment were substantiated, despite increased investigations, and fewer maltreated children were placed in OOH care. These changes may have led to a smaller but more complex OOH care population with substantial previous trauma and emotional problems.

AB Background. Neural substrates of emotion dysregulation in adolescent suicide attempters remain unexamined.
   Method. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity to neutral, mild or intense (i.e. 0%, 50% or 100% intensity) emotion face morphs in two separate emotion-processing runs (angry and happy) in three adolescent groups: (1) history of suicide attempt and depression (ATT, n=14); (2) history of depression alone (NAT, n=15); and (3) healthy controls (HC,n=15). Post-hoc analyses were conducted on interactions from 3 group x 3 condition (intensities) whole-brain analyses (p < 0.05, corrected) for each emotion run.
   Results. To 50% intensity angry faces, ATT showed significantly greater activity than NAT in anterior cingulate gyral-dorsolateral prefrontal cortical attentional control circuitry, primary sensory and temporal cortices; and significantly greater activity than HC in the primary sensory cortex, while NAT had significantly lower activity than HC in the anterior cingulate gyrus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. To neutral faces during the angry emotion-processing run, ATT had significantly lower activity than NAT in the fusiform gyrus. ATT also showed significantly lower activity than HC to 100% intensity happy faces in the primary sensory cortex, and to neutral faces in the happy run in the anterior cingulate and left medial frontal gyri (all p < 0.006, corrected). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed significantly reduced anterior cingulate gyral-insula functional connectivity to 50% intensity angry faces in ATT v. NAT or HC.
   Conclusions. Elevated activity in attention control circuitry, and reduced anterior cingulate gyral-insula functional connectivity, to 50% intensity angry faces in ATT than other groups suggest that ATT may show inefficient recruitment of attentional control neural circuitry when regulating attention to mild intensity angry faces, which may represent a potential biological marker for suicide risk.

AB Bullying is a serious problem for schools, parents, and public-policymakers alike. Bullying creates risks of health and social problems in childhood, but it is unclear if such risks extend into adulthood. A large cohort of children was assessed for bullying involvement in childhood and then followed up in young adulthood in an assessment of health, risky or illegal behavior, wealth, and social relationships. Victims of childhood bullying, including those that bullied others (bully-victims), were at increased risk of poor health, wealth, and social-relationship outcomes in adulthood even after we controlled for family hardship and childhood psychiatric disorders. In contrast, pure bullies were not at increased risk of poor outcomes in adulthood once other family and childhood risk factors were taken into account. Being bullied is not a harmless rite of passage but throws a long shadow over affected people's lives. Interventions in childhood are likely to reduce long-term health and social costs.

AB Underachievement in school during early adolescence predicts future economic and personal difficulties. Particular neurocognitive skills on the domain of executive functions start to mature during adolescence. This fact and the physical and psychological changes typical for the transition from childhood to adulthood make adolescents vulnerable to emotional problems. The current study investigated the relationship between mild emotional problems which are highly prevalent among adolescents and underachievement in school, and the role of neurocognitive functioning in this relation. This study was conducted in a substantial sample of typical developing young adolescents who just made the transition to secondary education. Pupils were on average 12.5 years old (standard deviation 0.5), and 45% of the included sample were girls. Emotional wellbeing was associated with underachievement [Odds ratio (OR) 5.15, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 3.06-8.681 after adjusting for background variables. Self-reported neurocognitive functioning partly explained the relation between emotional wellbeing and underachievement (OR 2.22, 95% Cl 1.23-3.99), yet, emotional wellbeing remained statistically associated with underachievement after correcting for additional confounders (OR 1.99, 95% Cl 1.08-3.66). The observed findings suggest that emotional wellbeing plays an essential role in underachievement during the first year of secondary education.

AB Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood, with onset marked by puberty and the offset by relative independence from parents. Across species, it is a time of incredible change that carries increased risks and rewards. The ability of the individual to respond adequately to the mental, physical and emotional stresses of life during this time is a function of both their early environment and their present state. In this article, we focus on the effects that acute threat and chronic stress have on the brain and behavior in humans and rodents. First, we highlight developmental changes in frontolimbic function as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence. Second, we examine genetic factors that may enhance susceptibility to stress in one individual over another using translation from genetic mouse models to human neuroimaging. Third, we examine how the timing and nature of stress varies in its impact on brain and behavior. These findings are discussed in the context of implications for adolescent mental health and illness.

AB Under typical conditions, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connections with the amygdala are immature during childhood and become adult-like during adolescence. Rodent models show that maternal deprivation accelerates this development, prompting examination of human amygdala-mPFC phenotypes following maternal deprivation. Previously institutionalized youths, who experienced early maternal deprivation, exhibited atypical amygdala-mPFC connectivity. Specifically, unlike the immature connectivity (positive amygdala-mPFC coupling) of comparison children, children with a history of early adversity evidenced mature connectivity (negative amygdala-mPFC coupling) and thus, resembled the adolescent phenotype. This connectivity pattern was mediated by the hormone cortisol, suggesting that stress-induced modifications of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis shape amygdala-mPFC circuitry. Despite being age-atypical, negative amygdala-mPFC coupling conferred some degree of reduced anxiety, although anxiety was still significantly higher in the previously institutionalized group. These findings suggest that accelerated amygdala-mPFC development is an ontogenetic adaptation in response to early adversity.

TI Discrepancies in parental and self-appraisals of prosocial
   characteristics predict emotional problems in adolescents
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY

AB Objectives. Parental appraisals of an adolescent may have an effect upon the adolescent's well-being and likelihood of emotional problems. However, the impact of these parental appraisals is likely to be partly determined by the young person's self-appraisal. It was predicted that a discrepancy in self-and parent appraisals of positive, prosocial qualities would be associated with an increased risk of emotional problems.
   Design. The study employed a cross-sectional design within a large sample of adolescent and caregiver dyads (N = 3,976, aged 11-17 years), drawn from the 'Mental health of children and young people in Great Britain, 2004' survey.
   Method. Two separate measures of prosociality were used to ensure that effects were not specific to one measure. The analysis explored the discrepancy in parent and self-ratings on these measures via interactions within a logistic regression framework. Potential confounds, including gender, parental mental health, conduct and hyperkinetic problems were controlled for in the analysis.
   Results. The logistic regression analyses demonstrated significant interactions between self-and parent ratings of prosocial qualities in predicting the odds of emotional disorder (i.e., depression and anxiety). This effect occurred across both measures of prosocial qualities whilst controlling for confounds. The pattern of the interactions suggested that low parental appraisals had a more detrimental effect on well-being when self-appraisals were highly positive.
   Conclusions. The results suggest that moderately high self-appraised positive traits may carry a cost of leaving young people more vulnerable to discrepant, negative parental appraisals. This has important implications for the meaning attributed to self-appraised positive traits in clinical contexts.

AB Background: A small body of previous research has demonstrated that pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases risk for internalizing problems, but findings have varied regarding their predictors and correlates. Methods: We examined the level and correlates of internalizing symptoms in 130 teens who had sustained a complicated mild to severe TBI within the past 1 to 6 months. Internalizing problems were measured via both maternal-and paternal-report Child Behavior Checklist. We also measured family functioning, parent psychiatric symptoms, and postinjury teen neurocognitive function. Results: Mean parental ratings of internalizing problems were within the normal range. Depending on informant, 22% to 26% of the sample demonstrated clinically elevated internalizing problems. In multiple and binary logistic regression models, only parent psychiatric symptoms consistently provided unique prediction of teen internalizing symptoms. For maternal but not paternal report, female gender was associated with greater internalizing problems. Conclusion: Parent and teen emotional problems are associated following adolescent TBI. Possible reasons for this relationship, including the effects of TBI on the family unit, are discussed.

AB Background: Patients with idiopathic scoliosis, although otherwise healthy, often have significant concerns about their self-image and appearance. In a group of juveniles and adolescents, this can impact adjustment in school, functioning in peer groups, and general sense of well-being. There are limited data to help physicians reliably and precisely identify those who are at higher risk of poor emotional adjustment even after spine deformity correction. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictors of emotional maladjustment in juvenile and adolescent patients after surgical correction of idiopathic scoliosis.
   Methods: A total of 233 juveniles, mean age 11.26 +/- 1.02 (range, 8 to 12) years and 909 adolescents, mean age 14.91 +/- 1.61 (range, 13 to 21) years, who underwent surgical correction for idiopathic scoliosis and who were participating in a prospective longitudinal multicenter database, were enrolled in the study. Participants completed the Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire before surgery and 2 years postoperatively. Radiographs were used to measure Cobb angle and surface measurements were used to determine decompensation and trunk shift.
   Results: Adolescents reported poorer mental health pre-operatively (P < 0.05) and 2 years postoperatively (P < 0.001) than juveniles; however, both groups reported improved mental health (P < 0.001) and self-image (P < 0.01) postoperatively. Mental health 2 years postoperatively was predicted by pre-operative self-image (P < 0.05), mental health (P < 0.001), and main thoracic Cobb angle (P < 0.05) in the juvenile group. Within the adolescent group, mental health 2 years postoperatively was predicted by preoperative mental health (P < 0.001); self-image 2 years postoperatively was predicted by preoperative mental health (P < 0.01) and self-image (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Self-image and mental health are significantly improved after spine deformity correction in juveniles and adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. However, consistent with normative development, adolescents are at higher risk for emotional maladjustment than juveniles. Surgical decision making in scoliosis correction should take the emotional status of the patient into consideration.

AB During adolescence, concerns about peer rejection and acceptance become increasingly common. Adolescents regularly experience peer rejection firsthand and witness these behaviors among their peers. In the current study, neuroimaging techniques were employed to conduct a preliminary investigation of the affective and cognitive processes involved in witnessing peer acceptance and rejection - specifically when these witnessed events occur in the immediate aftermath of a firsthand experience with rejection. During an fMRI scan, 23 adolescents underwent a simulated experience of firsthand peer rejection. Then, immediately following this experience they watched as another adolescent was ostensibly first accepted and then rejected. Findings indicated that in the immediate aftermath of being rejected by peers, adolescents displayed neural activity consistent with distress when they saw another peer being accepted, and neural activity consistent with emotion regulation and mentalizing (e.g. perspective-taking) processes when they saw another peer being rejected. Furthermore, individuals displaying a heightened sensitivity to firsthand rejection were more likely to show neural activity consistent with distress when observing a peer being accepted. Findings are discussed in terms of how witnessing others being accepted or rejected relates to adolescents' interpretations of both firsthand and observed experiences with peers. In addition, the potential impact that witnessed events might have on the broader perpetuation of bullying at this age is also considered.

AB Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome exhibit high rates of social-behavioral problems, particularly in the internalizing domain, indicating an area in need of intervention. The current investigation was designed to obtain information regarding parent and teacher ratings of the social-emotional behavior of children with 22q11DS. Using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the sample included 67 children with 22q11DS and 59 control subjects. Results indicated significant differences in social-behavioral functioning of children with 22q11DS, as compared to a control group, based on rater type. Specifically, parents reported more difficulties with internalizing problems, withdrawal, and social problems in children with 22q11DS. In contrast, teachers perceived few differences between children with 22q11DS and unaffected children. Correlational analyses indicated weak concordance between parent and teacher reports, with no significant correlations on any of three summary scales. The findings support the use of multiple methods of assessment and multiple informants when collecting information regarding the social-behavioral functioning of children with 22q11DS, and that interpretations based on only one informant/setting need to be made cautiously.

AB This study explores the relationship between a ruminative response style and symptom reports in children and adolescents of grades 5, 7 and 9 from German secondary schools. Questionnaires were used to assess rumination and symptom reports. A group of children and adolescents (N=140) were asked to think first about the items before responding to them (increased attention condition), while a second group (N=260) served as control group (standard condition). The assumption was that rumination and also additional attention to the symptoms by instruction would increase the reported frequency of experiencing somatic and psychological symptoms. The results showed significant relations between symptom reports and rumination, which increased with grade. There were sex differences for somatic symptom reports with increased symptom frequencies in girls, which were mediated by rumination. Moreover, instructing participants to think first about the items led to an increase in reported symptoms. It is concluded that an increased attention to symptoms of distress increases symptom reports, which may be induced momentarily by instruction and also more generally by a ruminative response style. Conclusions regarding prevention and concerning instructions in symptom report questionnaires are outlined.

AB Background: Self-regulatory mechanisms appear etiologically operant in the context of both substance use disorders (SUD) and bipolar disorder (BD), however, little is known about the role of deficits in emotional self-regulation (DESR) as it relates to SUD in context to mood dysregulation. To this end, we examined to what extent DESR was associated with SUD in a high-risk sample of adolescents with and without BD.
   Methods: 203 families were assessed with a structured psychiatric interview. Using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a subject was considered to have DESR when he or she had an average elevation of 1 standard deviation (SD) above the norm on 3 clinical scale T scores (attention, aggression, and anxiety/depression; scores: 60 x 3 >= 180).
   Results: Among probands and siblings with CBCL data (N=303), subjects with DESR were more likely to have any SUD, alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, and cigarette smoking compared to subjects with scores <180 (all p values <0.001), even when correcting for BD. We found no significant differences in the risk of any SUD and cigarette smoking between those with 1SD and 2SD above the mean (all p values >0.05). Subjects with cigarette smoking and SUD had more DESR compared to those without these disorders.
   Conclusions: Adolescents with DESR are more likely to smoke cigarettes and have SUD. More work is needed to explore DESR in longitudinal samples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Deficits in the ability to organize, integrate, and modulate emotions, thoughts, and behaviors when dealing with stress have been found to be related to the onset and escalation of substance use among adolescents and young adults. However, limited research has focused on understanding how coping and emotion regulation tendencies might be associated with different patterns of prescription and illicit drug use, particularly among high-risk young adults who may already face additional challenges relative to lower-risk populations.
   Methods: Young adults aged 16-25 years who had misused prescription drugs within the past 90 days were interviewed in Los Angeles and New York. The current study utilized latent profile analysis to empirically derive coping and emotion regulation typologies/profiles that are then used to predict different patterns of substance use (N = 560).
   Results: Four latent classes/groups were identified: (1) suppressors, (2) others-reliant copers, (3) self-reliant copers and (4) active copers. Distinct patterns of prescription and illicit drug misuse were found among different coping/emotion regulation profiles, including differences in age of initiation of opiates, tranquilizers, and illicit drugs, recent injection drug use, substance use-related problems, and past 90-day use of tranquilizers, heroin, and cocaine. Specifically, suppressors and others-reliant capers evidenced more problematic patterns of substance use compared to active copers.
   Conclusion: This is among the first studies to show how coping and emotion regulation profiles predict distinct patterns of substance use. Results provide the groundwork for additional investigations that could have significant prevention and clinical implications for substance-using high-risk young adults.

AB Marked gender differences have been identified in cigarette smoking. In this study, we aimed to identify the gender-specific emotional and behavioral disorders among adolescent smokers and their consequent utilization of mental health services. We performed a nationwide survey study of an Israeli representative sample of 906 adolescents and their mothers. Mental disorders were assessed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA) Inventory. Levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties were evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Mental health services use and smoking habits were also assessed. Among non-smoker adolescents there were significant gender differences in almost all SDQ scales: emotional problems, pro-social, hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems, whereas in the smoker group there was a difference only in the SDQ emotional problems scale (both self-and maternal-rated, P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Only marginal difference was noted between males and females in help-seeking for emotional or behavioral problems. Over 50% of both male and female smokers in the study had untreated mental disorders (nonsignificant gender difference). The well-established gender differences in psychiatric symptomatology narrowed markedly in adolescent smokers; the typical gender difference in disruptive behaviors was lost in the adolescent smoking population. The implications of these findings are particularly relevant to developing more effective gender-specific programs to prevent youth smoking, to facilitate quitting and prepare primary care practitioners to identify mental disorders and behavioral problems in adolescents with a smoking history.

AB The study tests whether participation in interventions offered by a subset of sites from the National Safe Start Promising Approaches for Children Exposed to Violence initiative improved outcomes for children relative to controls.
   The study pools data from the nine Safe Start sites that randomized families to intervention and control groups, using a within-site block randomization strategy based on child age at baseline. Caregiver-reported outcomes, assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, included caregiver personal problems, caregiver resource problems, parenting stress, child and caregiver victimization, child trauma symptoms, child behavior problems, and social-emotional competence.
   Results revealed no measurable intervention impact in intent-to-treat analyses at either 6- or 12-month post-baseline. In 6-month as-treated analyses, a medium to high intervention dose was associated with improvement on two measures of child social-emotional competence: cooperation and assertion. Overall, there is no reliable evidence of significant site-to-site effect variability, even in the two cases of significant intervention effect.
   Since families in both the intervention and control groups received some degree of case management and both groups improved over time, it may be advantageous to explore the potential impacts of crisis and case management separately from mental health interventions. It may be that, on average, children in families whose basic needs are being attended to improve substantially on their own.

AB This paper presents research results concerning developmental data (ET 6-6 and SSV) in the context of community based prevention of disruptive behavior. The analysis included data from 61 children between 3 and 6 years of age. The research aimed to analyze associations between SDQ behavior ratings and the scores of developmental tests. In addition evaluation data of the PEP quality management are illustrated. Moreover, recommendations concerning the need of follow-up treatment were evaluated. Significant reduction of disruptive behavior and the total problem behavior score as well as enhancement of prosocial behavior are reported. The purpose of the screening was to identify associations between the appearance of behavioral dysfunction and developmental disorders. Therefore, a regression analysis was performed including the parental SDQ ratings and the results of developmental tests which showed significant associations between developmental disorders and behavioral dysfunction. For the ET 6-6 developmental dimensions body awareness, gross motor and expressive language, substantial correlations with the SDQ prosocial scale and the SDQ problem scales could be found.

AB Initially thought of as a unitary ability, empathy has been more recently considered to consist of 2 components (i.e., an affective and a cognitive component). The Basic Empathy Scale (BES) is a tool that has been used to assess empathy in young people and adolescents on the basis of this dual-component conception (Jolliffe & Farrington, 2006). Recent studies of empathy have led to it being defined as underpinned by 3 components, namely, emotional contagion, emotional disconnection, and cognitive empathy. The aims of this study were (a) to validate the BES in Adults and (b) to compare the different conceptions of empathy. Three hundred seventy French adults took part in the study, and 160 of them filled out complementary scales measuring empathy, alexithymia, and emotional consciousness. The confirmatory factor analyses showed that the 3-factor model was the model that was best able to account for the data. Complementary tools confirmed the relationships previously observed between empathy as assessed with the BES and other scales assessing emotional processes. The results of this study make it clear that empathy can be seen as process-dependent. This conception of empathy, which is based on 3 factors, is consistent with the current, more integrated view of empathy. The implications of this conception and the opportunity to use the 2 or 3 factors of the BES in adults are presented in the Discussion.

LA English
DT Article
DE psychometric properties; nonsuicidal self-injury; functions; addictive

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is an issue primarily of concern in adolescents and young adults. Thus far, no single NSSI self-report measure offers a fully comprehensive assessment of NSSI, particularly including measurement of both its functions and potential addictive features. The Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (ORE) permits simultaneous assessment of both these characteristics; the current study examined the psychometric properties of this measure in a sample of 149 young adults in a university student sample (82.6% girls, M-age = 19.43 years). Exploratory factor analyses revealed 4 functions factors (internal emotion regulation, social influence, external emotion regulation, and sensation seeking) and a single addictive features factor. Convergent evidence for the functions factor scores was demonstrated through significant correlations with an existing measure of NSSI functions and indicators of psychological well-being, risky behaviors, and context and frequency of NSSI behaviors. Convergent evidence was also shown for the addictive features scores, through associations with NSSI frequency, feeling relieved following NSSI, and inability to resist NSSI urges. Additional comment is made regarding the potential for addictive features of NSSI to be both negatively and positively reinforcing. Results show preliminary psychometric support for the OSI as a valid and reliable assessment tool to be used in both research and clinical contexts. The OSI can provide important information for case formulation and treatment planning, given the comprehensive and all-inclusive nature of its assessment capacities.

AB Study design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Objectives: To describe coping strategy use in adolescents with spinal cord injury (SCI), to explore the underlying factor structure of a measure of coping among adolescents with SCI and to assess relationships between coping and psychosocial outcomes. Setting: Multiple pediatric SCI centers in the United States.
   Methods: One hundred and eighty-two participants aged 13-17 years who experienced an SCI completed measures including the Kidcope, Children's Depression Inventory, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.
   Results: Participants reported that cognitive restructuring and resignation are the most used coping strategies, whereas social support, emotional regulation (calming) and cognitive restructuring are the most effective coping strategies. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that a three-factor solution provided the most parsimonious model for the relationships between the different coping strategies. However, only one of the three factors had acceptable internal consistency. This factor comprised escape-oriented coping strategies or an avoidant approach to coping with the sequelae of SCI. After controlling for demographic/injury-related factors, higher scores on the escape-oriented factor were associated with the lower quality of life and higher levels of depression and anxiety symptomatology.
   Conclusion: Escape-oriented coping is associated with maladaptive psychosocial outcomes in adolescents with SCI. These adolescents report that active coping strategies are most effective in reducing SCI-related distress. Coping strategy use may mediate psychosocial outcomes in adolescents with SCI and represent an intervention target in adolescents who overly rely on escape-oriented coping.

TI How Functional Connectivity between Emotion Regulation Structures Can Be

AB Outcome of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) includes impaired emotion regulation. Emotion regulation has been associated with amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate (rACC). However, functional connectivity between the two structures after injury has not been reported. A preliminary examination of functional connectivity of rACC and right amygdala was conducted in adolescents 2 to 3 years after moderate to severe TBI and in typically developing (TD) control adolescents, with the hypothesis that the TBI adolescents would demonstrate altered functional connectivity in the two regions. Functional connectivity was determined by correlating fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of the rACC and right amygdala with that of other brain regions. In the TBI adolescents, the rACC was found to be significantly less functionally connected to medial prefrontal cortices and to right temporal regions near the amygdala (height threshold T = 2.5, cluster level p < .05, FDR corrected), while the right amygdala showed a trend in reduced functional connectivity with the rACC (height threshold T = 2.5, cluster level p = .06, FDR corrected). Data suggest disrupted functional connectivity in emotion regulation regions. Limitations include small sample sizes. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to characterize the persistent neural damage resulting from moderate to severe TBI during development.

AB As levels of immigration and ethnic diversity continue to rise in most Western societies, the social demography of schools is changing rapidly. Although schools represent a prominent developmental context, relatively little is known about the extent to which the racial/ethnic composition of schools influences mental health outcomes in students. The objective of the present study is to examine the association between immigrant and racial/ethnic congruence in school-the numerical representation of a student's immigrant generational status and race/ethnicity in the student body-and levels of emotional and behavioral problems. This study also examines the extent to which the association between congruence and emotional-behavioral problems differs across racial/ethnic immigrant sub-groups and is accounted for by individual perceptions of school belonging. Data come from the in-school survey of the Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) conducted in the United States. The sample is nationally representative, and includes 128 schools and 77,150 adolescents in grades 7-12 (50 % female, M (age) = 14.9 years, SD = 1.78). After controlling for school and family socio-demographic characteristics, immigrant and racial/ethnic congruence in school exhibited a negative association with emotional and behavioral problems for most sub-groups examined. School belonging was associated negatively with emotional and behavioral problems, and partially accounted for the effects linked to congruence in schools. The immigrant and racial/ethnic composition of schools and perceptions of belonging have strong links with emotional and behavioral problems and may represent important targets for intervention.

AB Background: As often only parents are addressed, studying parent-child agreement and its explanatory factors is crucial in gaining accurate information on young children's emotional problems. Method: Parental and children's reports of children's emotional problems (anger, anxiety, sadness) and children's reports of life events were gathered between February and June, 2010 from 464 Belgian nonclinical children 5-10 years old. Results: Children reported more emotional problems than their parents. Parental underestimation was higher in the case of girls, older children, nontraditional family structures and authoritative parenting style. Furthermore, life events and emotional problems were significantly correlated only when using children's reported emotions. Conclusions: In our nonclinical children, interviewing both parents and children on children's emotional problems is necessary and parent-child disagreement can partially be explained by child or family characteristics.

AB Background Over the past few decades there has been a dramatic increase in maternal employment and, as a result, an increase in the use of non-maternal childcare in the early years. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine, in a large representative English sample, the influence of different forms of childcare on children's behavioural and emotional development around the age of school entry.
   Methods A sample of 991 families, originally recruited when the children were 3 months old, was assessed around school entry age at 51 months. The main outcome variable was the children's emotional and behavioural functioning, measured by questionnaire completed by both mothers and teachers. A range of repeated assessments were carried out at different time points, including direct observation of the quality of maternal caregiving and observations of the quality of non-parental care, and amount of time spent in different forms of care.
   Results The strongest and most consistent influences on behaviour and emotional problems were derived from the home, including lower socio-demographic status, poorer maternal caregiving, parental stress/maternal mental health problems, as well as child gender (being a boy). Non-parental childcare had small effects on child outcome. One finding that did emerge was that children who spent more time in group care, mainly nursery care, were more likely to have behavioural problems, particularly hyperactivity.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that interventions to enhance children's emotional and behavioural development might best focus on supporting families and augmenting the quality of care in the home.

AB Black youth often lag behind their non-Hispanic white peers in educational outcomes, including teacher-evaluated school performance. Using data from four waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, the analyses presented here identify the extent to which children receive different evaluations from their teachers depending on the racial/ethnic match of teachers and students. This study is distinct from previous work because we examine the assessment of an individual child by multiple teachers. The results indicate that Black children receive worse assessments of their externalizing behaviors (e.g. arguing in class and disrupting instruction) when they have a non-Hispanic white teacher than when they have a Black teacher. Further, these results exist net of school context and the teacher's own ratings of the behavior of the class, overall. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Collective efficacy refers to a perceived sense of connectedness and willingness to intervene among youth, and is a potential aspect of positive youth development (Larson in Am Psychol 55:170-183, 2000; Lerner et al. in Child Dev 71:11-20, 2000; Sampson et al. in Science 277:918-924, 1997). Theoretically, those who feel connected to a group that is empowered to positively influence the behavior of their peers may demonstrate fewer problem behaviors. Few studies, however, have measured the impact of youth perceptions of collective efficacy. As a relatively new child-related research topic, there is much to be learned. One contribution to the foundation of this research agenda begins by evaluating the reliability and validity of a measure of collective efficacy with elementary children attending community-based afterschool programs. This paper describes the internal consistency reliability and various indicators of construct and concurrent validity of the Collective Efficacy Among Children Scale. The measure was found to have high internal consistency reliability. Construct validity was tested using exploratory factor analyses of collective efficacy including the dimensions of willingness to intervene and cohesion found in previous research (Sampson et al. in Science 277:918-924, 1997). Concurrent validity assessed relations between the scale and other measures in theoretically congruent ways. Using Hierarchical Linear Models to account for children's nestedness in after-school programs, connectedness was found to be more related to emotional adjustment, particularly children's prosocial attitudes (caring about others and sharing). Children's perception of the willingness of the group to intervene was found to be related to less problem behavior, (i.e. smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, vandalism, and stealing). The implications suggest that future research should further explore children's collective efficacy, and ways to foster its development in youth-serving afterschool settings.

AB Maladaptive emotion regulation is a risk factor for depression when an individual is experiencing stressful interpersonal events. Although emotion regulation has several different dimensions, little is known about which of these mediate the relationship between interpersonal stress and depressive symptoms. The current study examined self-ratings of emotion regulation, interpersonal stress, and depression in a sample of non-clinical undergraduate students (N = 152). Our results indicated that two facets of emotion regulation (i.e., lack of emotional clarity and limited access to emotion regulation strategies) fully mediate the relationship between interpersonal stress and depression. Hence, to minimize depressive symptoms when experiencing interpersonal stress, our findings suggest that it is important for individuals to be clear about their feelings and to attempt to transition from negative feelings to alternative feelings.

AB Adolescent "storm and stress" has been a focal yet controversial developmental framework for over a century. In the present article, we challenge the current perspective that storm and stress is neither ubiquitous nor inevitable but probable. Instead, we argue, storm and stress is a vestigial developmental framework, and we propose a more comprehensive approach to understanding adolescent-typical changes based on six premises: (1) The biological changes of adolescence are inevitable and ubiquitous; (2) adolescent biological changes drive various mechanisms of adolescent behavior; (3) adolescent biological changes are shaped by environmental influences; (4) individual differences in adolescent emotional-behavior changes are domain specific and vary in intensity; (5) there are individual differences in the age of onset and duration of periods of adolescent change; and (6) individual differences in the duration and intensity of transitions in emotional arousal are functionally modulated by burgeoning emotion regulation skills. We conclude with the more comprehensive 4T (typicality, transactions, temperament, and timing) approach and suggestions to guide adolescent research in the 21st century.

AB Evidence that nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) serves a maladaptive emotion regulation function in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has drawn attention to processes that may increase risk for NSSI by exacerbating negative emotion, such as rumination. However, more adaptive forms of emotion processing, including differentiating broad emotional experiences into nuanced emotion categories, might serve as a protective factor against NSSI. Using an experience-sampling diary, the present study tested whether differentiation of negative emotion was associated with lower frequency of NSSI acts and urges in 38 individuals with BPD who reported histories of NSSI. Participants completed a dispositional measure of rumination and a 21-day experience-sampling diary, which yielded an index of negative emotion differentiation and frequency of NSSI acts and urges. A significant rumination by negative emotion differentiation interaction revealed that rumination predicted higher rates of NSSI acts and urges in participants with difficulty differentiating their negative emotions. The results extend research on emotion differentiation into the clinical literature and provide empirical support for clinical theories that suggest emotion identification and labeling underlie strategies for adaptive self-regulation and decreased NSSI risk in BPD.

AB Objective This study aimed to describe and compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of children and adolescents with an eating disorder (ED) and comorbid depression or anxiety.
   Method Data were drawn from intake assessments of children and adolescents at a specialist ED clinic. Demographic characteristics (e.g. age and gender) and clinical characteristics (e.g. body mass, binge eating and purging) were compared between 217 ED participants without comorbidity, 32 with comorbid anxiety, 86 with comorbid depression and 36 with comorbid anxiety and depression.
   Results The groups with comorbid depression had more complex and severe presentations compared with those with an ED and no comorbid disorder and those with comorbid anxiety alone, especially in regard to binge eating, purging, dietary restraint and weight/shape concerns.
   Discussion Depression and anxiety were differentially related to clinical characteristics of EDs. The findings have implications for understanding the relations between these disorders and their potential to impact outcome of ED treatments.

AB Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Little is known, however, about the specific psychological skills that may improve with MBCT. The present study investigated the relationship between history of MBCT and emotion regulation ability. Specifically, we examined cognitive reappraisal ability (CRA) in a sample of individuals with a history of MBCT compared with two control groups: a group without a history of any type of therapy and a group with a history of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Groups were matched on key variables including age, sex, education, working memory, emotional reactivity, and life stress. CRA was measured using a standardized laboratory challenge. Results indicated that participants with a history of MBCT demonstrated higher CRA than both the no-therapy control group and the CBT control group. These results suggest that, by guiding people to accept thoughts and feelings without judgment and to focus on the present moment, MBCT may lay the foundation for increased CRA.

AB The results of study of adolescents with normative and deviant behavior are presented. The interrelations between personal and behavioral characteristics and the resilience and social adaptation are shown. It is established that such personal characteristics include emotional regulation and motivation, the level of subjective control, especially self-esteem, coping mechanisms, communication features. It is shown that low level of resilience is determined by the failure of maladaptive adolescents' psychological resources, as well as by low level of functional coping behavior and protective nature of their activity.

AB Background. Emotion dysregulation represents a core symptom of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Deficits in emotion perception are thought to underlie this clinical feature, although studies examining emotion recognition abilities in BPD have yielded inconsistent findings.
   Method. The results of 10 studies contrasting facial emotion recognition in patients with BPD (n = 266) and non-psychiatric controls (n = 255) were quantitatively synthesized using meta-analytic techniques.
   Results. Patients with BPD were less accurate than controls in recognizing facial displays of anger and disgust, although their most pronounced deficit was in correctly identifying neutral (no emotion) facial expressions. These results could not be accounted for by speed/accuracy in the test-taking approach of BPD patients.
   Conclusions. Patients with BPD have difficulties recognizing specific negative emotions in faces and may misattribute emotions to faces depicting neutral expressions. The contribution of state-related emotion perception biases to these findings requires further clarification.

AB Little is known about which processes explain the well-established link between maternal and child symptomatology. Interpersonal coping processes may be worth exploring, as depressed mothers have characteristic coping styles that may influence interactions with their children. We examined two interpersonal coping processes as potential factors explaining how depressive symptomatology in mothers impacts child psychopathology: parent-child co-rumination (dwelling on negative affect, over-analyzing problems) and impaired problem-solving. We analyzed 198 aggressive children (most of whom also had elevated internalizing symptoms) who engaged in structured discussions with their mothers. Coders rated the extent to which dyads problem-solved and co-ruminated during discussions, and mothers filled out questionnaires assessing maternal and child symptoms. Path analysis tested whether higher levels of co-rumination and poor problem-solving statistically mediated the relation between depressive symptoms in mothers and child internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Maternal depressive symptomatology was correlated with greater child symptoms, higher rates of co-rumination and poorer problem-solving. Statistical mediation was non-significant. Results support the established link between maternal depression and child psychopathology, and suggest that dysphoric mothers and their children engage in maladaptive coping interactions.

AB We sought to determine if attentional distraction in adolescents can modulate event-related desynchronization or synchronization (ERD or ERS) of the theta band during emotion regulation. Event-related theta oscillations were collected from 48 adolescents and young adults as they performed a distraction (counting) task while viewing affective pictures. Consistent with data from adult participants, positive and negative pictures elicited a larger theta ERS than did neutral pictures within a 100-400 ms window, indicating that early theta ERS is indicative of motivated attention to biologically salient stimuli. Counting as a distraction strategy attenuated early affective modulation of theta ERS. Moreover, theta ERS increased with age in the anterior regions of the brain regardless of valence; however, no age differences were found in the posterior regions. These results suggest that distraction depends on a top-down attentional mechanism that disrupts theta ERS for affective pictures at an early stage. Furthermore, adolescents undergo a developmental increase in oscillatory brain reorganization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite ongoing concerns that traumatized children with severe symptoms of emotional dysregulation may be inappropriately receiving a diagnosis of pediatric bipolar-I (BP-I) disorder, this issue has not been adequately examined in the literature. Because both pediatric BP-I disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are familial disorders, if children with both BP-I and PTSD were to be truly affected with BP-I disorder, their relatives would be at high risk for BP-I disorder. To this end, we compared patterns of familial aggregation of BP-I disorder in BP-I children with and without PTSD with age and sex matched controls. Participants were 236 youths with BP-I disorder and 136 controls of both sexes along with their siblings. Participants completed a large battery of measures designed to assess psychiatric disorders, psychosocial, educational, and cognitive parameters. Familial risk analysis revealed that relatives of BP-I probands with and without PTSD had similar elevated rates of BP-I disorder that significantly differed from those of relatives of controls. Pediatric BP-I disorder is similarly highly familial in probands with and without PTSD indicating that their co-occurrence is not due to diagnostic error. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Dating violence among college aged couples has become a growing concern with increasing prevalence. The current study investigated the interplay among witnessing violence during childhood (both parental conflict and parent to child aggression), attachment insecurity, egalitarian attitude within the relationship, and dating aggression. Participants of this study included 87 couples. Results from the structural equation model indicated that the proposed model provided a good fit to the with chi 2 to df ratio of 1.84. In particular, both female and male participants who reported higher levels of attachment insecurity were more likely to be victim of dating aggression in their relationships. Furthermore, female participants who reported having witnessed parental conflict were more likely to be victimized by their partners. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of intimate relationship violence with dyadic data showing, for both genders, attachment insecurity is a crucial factor in both victimization and perpetration of aggression.

AB Development of the prefrontal cortex is believed to play an important role in the maturation of higher cognitive functions such as decision making, cognition and control of part of the neural element of the stress response. The prefrontal cortex undergoes considerable maturation during childhood, including a reduction of synaptic and neural density, a growth of dendrites, and an increase in white matter volume, thereby forming distributed neural networks appropriate for complex cognitive processing, but maturation is not complete until approximately 25 years of age. Serotonin and its receptors (HTRs) play critical roles in brain development and in the regulation of cognition, mood, and anxiety. HTRs are highly expressed in the human prefrontal cortex and exert control over prefrontal excitability. Studies of postmortem prefrontal brain tissue found distinct developmental patterns of expression of these receptors occurring in early postnatal development and also into adulthood. The general pattern of improved cognitive control and emotion regulation with maturation of the prefrontal cortex, suggests a linear increase in development from childhood to adulthood. Animal studies have shown that dopamine is crucial for communication between the accumbens, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex continue to develop into early adulthood.
   Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) is an eye disease affecting people of working age, commonly resulting in repeated unpredictable visually disabling serous retinal detachments and occasionally leading to irreversible reduction in central vision. The disease has been closely linked to the stress response. Despite a concerted effort to understand aetiopathogenesis, disease mechanisms are still largely unclear.
   This paper, supported by evidence in the literature, proposes a systemic approach to CSC and explains how interactions of the eye with the cerebral cortex could lead to disease. We propose that the lack of development of the neural element of the stress response and in particular the prefrontal cortex is the reason for the absence of CSC in childhood and adolescence. Additionally, we attempt to explain why excess stress hormones do not always result in CSC and why acute attacks occur only once in over half of cases. Finally, we summarise the implications that an integrated systemic hypothesis has for future CSC research and the requirement of a holistic management practice for the identification and treatment of patients with CSC.

AB Numerous studies have investigated the deleterious effects of maternal depression on child outcomes. Knowledge of characteristics of these mothers is incomplete, as most studies utilize small samples or limit investigation to the postpartum period. Utilizing data from a nationally representative sample of 7,211 fathers and mothers living in households with children aged 5-17 years who participated in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2004-2006, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) was used to assess parental depressive symptoms, the Short Form-12 (SF-12) was used to examine paternal and maternal physical health, and the Columbia Impairment Scale was used to measure child behavioral or emotional problems. In multivariate analyses, maternal unemployment (AOR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.31-2.35); living with smokers (AOR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.12-2.94); poor maternal physical health (AOR 2.31; 95 % CI 1.81-2.94); living with children with behavioral or emotional problems (AOR 2.95, 95 % CI 2.30-3.96); and paternal depressive symptoms (AOR 5.11, 95 % CI 1.97-13.25) each were independently associated with increased rates of maternal depressive symptoms. This paper is the first we are aware of to use a nationally representative sample to investigate characteristics associated with maternal depressive symptoms and found that maternal unemployment, living with smokers, poor maternal physical health, having children with behavioral or emotional problems, and paternal depressive symptoms are each independently associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In these data, paternal depressive symptoms are associated with the greatest risk of mothers exhibiting depressive symptoms, a finding that we believe has never before been shown.

AB Background: Recent longitudinal studies demonstrate that addiction risk may be influenced by a cognitive, affective and behavioral phenotype that emerges during childhood. Relatively little research has focused on the affective or emotional risk components of this high-risk phenotype, including the relevant neurobiology.
   Methods: Non-substance abusing youth (N=19; mean age = 12.2) with externalizing psychopathology and paternal history of a substance use disorder and demographically matched healthy comparisons (N=18; mean age = 11.9) were tested on a facial emotion matching task during functional MRI. This task involved matching faces by emotions (angry, anxious) or matching shape orientation.
   Results: High-risk youth exhibited increased medial prefrontal, precuneus and occipital cortex activation compared to the healthy comparison group during the face matching condition, relative to the control shape condition. The occipital activation correlated positively with parent-rated emotion regulation impairments in the high-risk group.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest a preexisting abnormality in cortical activation in response to facial emotion matching in youth at high risk for the development of problem drug or alcohol use. These cortical deficits may underlie impaired affective processing and regulation, which in turn may contribute to escalating drug use in adolescence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB IMPORTANCE Maternal depression is a major risk factor for the development of children's mental health problems. No population-based study to date has examined whether early child care spanning the full preschool period from infancy onward is protective for children of depressed mothers.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether early child care moderates associations between maternal depressive symptoms (MDSs) and child internalizing problems (emotional problems [EPs], separation anxiety symptoms, and social withdrawal symptoms [SWSs]) during the preschool period.
   DESIGN AND SETTING Population-based prospective cohort study within the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development.
   PARTICIPANTS Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development participants (n = 1759) assessed repeatedly between ages 5 and 60 months.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES High-level trajectories of EPs, SWSs, and separation anxiety symptoms between ages 17 and 60 months.
   RESULTS Child care age at entry moderated associations between MDSs and child internalizing problems. Among children of mothers with elevated MDSs, reduced odds ratios for EPs and SWSs were found for those entering child care early (0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.66 for EPs and 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.92 for SWSs) or late (0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.77 for EPs and 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.65 for SWSs) compared with those remaining in maternal care. Child care type moderated the association between MDSs and child EPs; children of mothers with elevated MDSs who received group-based child care had lower odds ratios for EPs than those who remained in maternal care (0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.48) or those who were cared for by a relative or babysitter (0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.94).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Regulated early child care services reduced the risks for internalizing problems for children of mothers with elevated MDSs. Regulated child care services may be used as a public health intervention to buffer the negative effect of maternal depression on children's internalizing problems.

AB Adolescent suicide is a significant public health concern; however, relatively little empirical research has investigated the etiology or effective treatment of adolescent suicidal behaviors. Linehan's biosocial theory posits that problems with regulating emotions underlie suicidal and self-harm behavior, and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) was developed to improve emotion regulation skills (Crowell, Beauchaine, & Linehan, 2009; Linehan, 1993). Currently, DBT is an empirically supported treatment for adults, and results of nonrandomized trials with adolescents have been promising. This article discusses the application of DBT with adolescents from a developmental perspective, drawing links between Linehan's biosocial theory and the development of emotion regulation. More specifically, the authors (a) review the biosocial theory, (b) review research on the development of emotion regulation in childhood and adolescence and highlight areas of overlap with the biosocial theory, (c) describe specific DBT interventions that are developmentally appropriate for adolescents, and (d) provide a clinical case example illustrating the application of these techniques.

TI An Adolescent With Nonsuicidal Self-Injury: A Case and Discussion of

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

DT Article
ID BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; HARM; BEHAVIOR
AB The management of nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior is a common focus of clinical care, particularly in the treatment of adolescents and young adults. Increased recognition of this problem has led to proposed criteria for future study in DSM-5, which may be beneficial in advancing the field. Clinical care may be fruitfully informed by an understanding of the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of this behavior. The authors discuss the current status of neurobiological research related to nonsuicidal self-injury with a focus on the key dimension of emotion regulation. A case is presented to illustrate the critical points. Preliminary empirical evidence suggests disturbances in neurobiological systems relevant to emotion regulation. Disturbances involve engagement of limbic brain regions and frontal regulatory brain regions that may evolve over time. Additionally, disturbances are observed in serotonin and physiological response systems relevant to emotion regulation. Treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be most beneficial in combination with dialectical behavioral therapy to address safety, build self-soothing strategies to enhance emotion regulation, and reduce interpersonal sensitivity. Delineation of the neurobiological markers that reflect successful treatment response will help in the identification of new avenues for research and the development of personalized treatments for adolescents with nonsuicidal self-injury.

AB Child maltreatment, peer victimization, and a polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) were examined as predictors of depressive symptomatology. Children (M age = 11.26, SD = 1.65), including 156 maltreated and 145 nonmaltreated children from comparable low socioeconomic backgrounds, provided DNA samples and self-reports of relational peer victimization, overt peer victimization, and depressive symptoms. Path analysis showed that relational and overt victimization mediated the association between child maltreatment and depressive symptoms. Bootstrapping procedures were used to test moderated mediation and demonstrated that genotype moderated the indirect effects of relational and overt victimization on child depressive symptoms, such that victimized children with the long/long variation were at an increased risk for depressive symptoms compared to victimized children carrying a short allele. Results highlight the utility of examining process models that incorporate biological and psychological factors contributing to the development of depressive symptomatology and provide direction toward understanding and promoting resilience among high-risk youth from a multiple levels of analysis approach.

AB The additive and interactive relations of parenting styles (authoritative and authoritarian parenting) and child temperament (anger/frustration, sadness, and effortful control) to children's internalizing problems were examined in a 3.8-year longitudinal study of 425 Chinese children (aged 6-9 years) from Beijing. At Wave 1, parents self-reported on their parenting styles, and parents and teachers rated child temperament. At Wave 2, parents, teachers, and children rated children's internalizing problems. Structural equation modeling indicated that the main effect of authoritative parenting and the interactions of Authoritarian Parenting x Effortful Control and Authoritative Parenting x Anger/Frustration (parents' reports only) prospectively and uniquely predicted internalizing problems. The above results did not vary by child sex and remained significant after controlling for co-occurring externalizing problems. These findings suggest that (a) children with low effortful control may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effect of authoritarian parenting and (b) the benefit of authoritative parenting may be especially important for children with high anger/frustration.

AB Background: Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) affects many individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), often leading to stressful encounters during daily routines. Methods: This study describes the associations between early SOR symptoms and the longitudinal course of restrictions in family life activities and parenting stress across three time-points in families raising a child with ASD (n = 174). Covariates were child diagnostic severity, emotional problems, and maternal affective symptoms. At time 1 mean chronological age was 28.5 months. Children were administered the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Parents completed the Infant Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP), Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Inventory (CES-D) at time 1; and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) and Family Life Impairment Scale (FLIS) at the three annual time-points. Results: Latent Growth Curve Models indicated that higher SOR scores on the ITSP at time 1 were associated with higher initial levels of family life impairment and parenting stress and with a smaller magnitude of change over time. These associations were independent of severity of ADOS socialcommunication symptoms, MSEL composite score, ITSEA externalizing and anxiety symptoms, and maternal affective symptoms as measured by the BAI and CES-D. On average FLIS and PSI did not change over time, however, there was significant individual variability. Concurrently, SOR at time 1 explained 39-45% of the variance in family stress and impairment variables. Conclusions: An evaluation of SOR should be integrated into the assessment of toddlers with ASD considering their role in family life impairment and stress.

AB Depressive symptoms are considered to have evolutionary social functions to reduce social risks with peers and family members. However, social processes and their relationship to depressive symptoms have been understudied in adolescent boys. Low engagement in social contexts may predict depressive symptoms in adolescent boys, as it may signify efforts to reduce social risks. To address these issues, this study focused on 160 boys at risk for affective problems based on low socioeconomic status. We evaluated how behavioral and physiological engagement in peer and family contexts, respectively, in late childhood predicted depressive symptoms at age 12 and age 15. Social withdrawal was measured across late childhood (ages 9-12) in a camp setting using a latent variable of teacher ratings of withdrawn behavior, peer nominations of withdrawn behavior, and camp counselor ratings of withdrawn behavior. Physiological reactivity was measured during a provocative parent-child conversation using respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at age 12. Social withdrawal in late childhood predicted depressive symptoms at age 12. The combination of high levels of social withdrawal with peers from ages 9-12 and low RSA reactivity with a parent at age 12 predicted higher depressive symptoms at age 15. Withdrawal in multiple social contexts may place boys at risk for depressive symptoms during the vulnerable period of adolescence.

AB We investigated self-image, psychological functioning, and quality of life in children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Thirty-nine children with JIA were compared with 80 healthy peers. We first administered the Human Figure Drawing Test (HFDT) to all subjects; children also completed standardized questionnaires evaluating health-related quality of life (PEDSQL (TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales) and the main aspects of psychological functioning: anxiety (SAFA-A) and depression (CDI). Parents were asked to complete the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the PEDSQL (TM) 4.0. For each patient with JIA, clinical notes were gathered and a global disease assessment (visual analog scale--VAS) was performed. Compared to healthy peers, patients with JIA reported reduced maturity quotients at HFDT, more depressive traits, greater anxiety, and lower health-related quality of life. Among the subjects with JIA, HFDT revealed that adolescents had a greater impairment in all areas investigated. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the physical well-being rated by VAS and the perception of poorer quality of life in patients, mostly in the psychosocial domains. Children and adolescents with JIA exhibit emotional difficulties and a delay of psychological development leading to low self-esteem, a distorted self-image, more anxiety and depression traits, and a worse quality of life, when compared to healthy subjects.

AB Among juvenile status offenses, truancy represents the largest share of juvenile court caseloads. As a marker of risk, truancy is important because of its associations with school disengagement, drop-out, and developmental trajectories that include various forms of delinquency and anti-social behavior. Better understanding of the developmental circumstances and needs of truant children may point the way to more effective intervention strategies. Much accumulated research has shown strong associations between the emergence of juvenile delinquency and qualities of caregiving in parent-child relationships. Child-parent attachment in particular has been identified as an important developmental foundation of the child-parent relationship. We used a multi-informant approach to examine associations between children's self-reported perceptions of attachment security (using the Security Scales), their emotion regulation (reported by parents on the Emotion Regulation Checklist), and school-related behavior problems (as reported by teachers with the Child Behavior Checklist), among 74 elementary school-aged truant children (mean age 9 years). Children and families were recruited through a truancy intervention program in a state in the deep South in the U.S. Data were analyzed via hierarchical multiple regression. Parents' reports of their children's emotion regulation predicted behavior problems as reported by teachers. Children's own reports of their emotional bonds with parents were somewhat less predictive of emotion regulation and behavior problems. Implications for truancy intervention programs for high-risk elementary school children include more focused attention to the importance of children's developing capacities for emotion regulation and the child-parent bond.

AB While a range of factors have been found to increase the likelihood of alcohol-related harms among young people, little is known about their relative importance. This article aimed to identify the risks for alcohol-related harms at an age when alcohol use and problems tend to peak in Australia (19-20 years). A wide range of concurrent and antecedent factors from multiple domains were examined using path analysis, including individual characteristics, family environment, and externalising and internalising problems. The sample comprised of 941 individuals from the Australian Temperament Project, a large longitudinal community-based study. The path model controlled for current risky drinking and revealed a number of variables that were significant longitudinal predictors of alcohol-related harms within each of the domains, including adolescent antisocial behaviour and drinking behaviour, low agreeableness, impulsivity, and paternal drinking levels. The potential for developmental prevention approaches to reduce alcohol-related harms by targeting externalising behaviour problems, interpersonal influences, and individual characteristics is discussed.

AB There are no studies of the distinct trajectories of children's psychological distress over the first year after a destructive natural disaster and the determinants of these trajectories.
   We examined these issues using an existing dataset of children exposed to Hurricane Andrew, one of the most devastating natural disasters in US history.
   At 3-months postdisaster, 568 children (55 % girls; grades 3-5) residing in areas most directly affected by the hurricane completed measures of hurricane exposure and stressors, social support, coping, and general anxiety. Children also reported major life events occurring since the hurricane (at 7-months) and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms at 3-, 7-, and 10-months postdisaster.
   Latent growth mixture modeling identified three trajectories of PTS reactions: resilient (37 %), recovering (43 %), and chronic distress (20 %). Predictors of the trajectories were examined. Odds ratios indicated that, compared to the resilient trajectory, girls were more likely to be in the recovering and chronically distressed trajectories, as were children reporting higher anxiety and greater use of coping strategies that reflected poor emotion regulation. Compared to the recovering trajectory, children in the chronically distressed trajectory had greater odds of reporting high anxiety, less social support, more intervening life events, and greater use of poor emotion regulation strategies.
   Hurricane exposure may be less effective in identifying children who develop chronic postdisaster distress than other child (anxiety, coping) and contextual variables (social support, life events). Effective screening after disasters is critical for identifying youth most in need of limited clinical resources.

AB We assessed linkages of mothers' emotion coaching and children's emotion regulation and emotion lability/negativity with children's adjustment in 72 mother-child dyads seeking treatment for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Dyads completed the questionnaires and discussed emotion-related family events. Maternal emotion coaching was associated with children's emotion regulation, which in turn was related to higher mother-reported adaptive skills, higher child-reported internalizing symptoms, and lower child-reported adjustment. When children were high in emotion lability/negativity, mothers' emotion coaching was associated with lower mother and child reports of externalizing behavior. Results suggest the role of emotion regulation and emotion lability in child awareness of socio-emotional problems and support the potential of maternal emotion coaching as a protective factor for children with ODD, especially for those high in emotion lability.

AB Developmental psychopathology researchers and practitioners commonly conduct behavioral assessments using multiple informants' reports (e. g., parents, teachers, practitioners, children, and laboratory observers). These assessments often yield inconsistent conclusions about important questions in developmental psychopathology research, depending on the informant (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses and risk factors of disorder). Researchers have theorized why informant discrepancies exist and advanced methodological models of informant discrepancies. However, over 50 years of empirical data has uncovered little knowledge about these discrepancies beyond that they exist, complicate interpretations of research findings and assessment outcomes in practice, and correlate with some characteristics of the informants providing reports (e.g., demographics and mood levels). Further, recent studies often yield take-home messages about the importance of taking a multi-informant approach to clinical and developmental assessments. Researchers draw these conclusions from their work, despite multi-informant approaches to assessment long being a part of best practices in clinical and developmental assessments. Consequently, developmental psychopathology researchers and practitioners are in dire need of a focused set of research priorities with the key goal of rapidly advancing knowledge about informant discrepancies. In this paper, I discuss these research priorities, review work indicating the feasibility of conducting research addressing these priorities, and specify what researchers and practitioners would gain from studies advancing knowledge about informant discrepancies in developmental psychopathology research.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether five subcomponents of children's externalizing behavior showed distinctive patterns of long-term growth and predictive correlates. We examined growth in teachers' ratings of overt aggression, covert aggression, oppositional defiance, impulsivity/inattention, and emotion dysregulation across three developmental periods spanning kindergarten through Grade 8 (ages 5-13 years). We also determined whether three salient background characteristics, family socioeconomic status, child ethnicity, and child gender, differentially predicted growth in discrete categories of child externalizing symptoms across development. Participants were 543 kindergarten-age children (52% male, 81% European American, 17% African American) whose problem behaviors were rated by teachers each successive year of development through Grade 8. Latent growth curve analyses were performed for each component scale, contrasting with overall externalizing, in a piecewise fashion encompassing three developmental periods: kindergarten-Grade 2, Grades 3-5, and Grades 6-8. We found that most subconstructs of externalizing behavior increased significantly across the early school age period relative to middle childhood and early adolescence. However, overt aggression did not show early positive growth, and emotion dysregulation significantly increased across middle childhood. Advantages of using subscales were most clear in relation to illustrating different growth functions between the discrete developmental periods. Moreover, growth in some discrete subcomponents was differentially associated with variations in family socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Our findings strongly affirmed the necessity of adopting a developmental approach to the analysis of growth in children's externalizing behavior and provided unique data concerning similarities and differences in growth between subconstructs of child and adolescent externalizing behavior.

AB Family-school interventions are a well-established method for preventing and remediating behavior problems in at-risk youth, yet the mechanisms of change underlying their effectiveness are often overlooked or poorly understood. The Family Check-Up (FCU), a school-based, family-centered intervention, has been consistently associated with reductions in youth antisocial behavior, deviant peer group affiliation, and substance use. The purpose of this study was to explore proximal changes in student-level behavior that accounts for links between implementation of the FCU and changes in youth problem behavior. Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial study of the efficacy of the FCU among 593 ethnically diverse middle school students followed longitudinally from 6th through 8th grades. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that random assignment to the FCU intervention condition was related to increased mean levels of students' self-regulation from 6th to 7th grades, which in turn reduced the risk for growth in antisocial behavior, involvement with deviant peers, and alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use through the 8th grade. Overall, these findings highlight the robust implications of self-regulation as a proximal target for family-centered interventions. (c) 2013 Society for the Study of School Psychology.

AB Starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood, women are twice as likely as men to experience depression. According to the response styles theory (RST), gender differences in depression result, in part, from women's tendency to ruminate more than men. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate gender differences in rumination in adults (k = 59; N = 14,321); additionally, an analysis of subtypes of rumination - brooding and reflection - was conducted (k = 23). Fixed effects analyses indicated that women scored higher than men in rumination (d = .24, p < .01, SEd = .02), brooding (d = .19, p < .01, SEd = .03) and reflection (d = .17, p < .01, SEd = .03); there was no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias across studies for these effect sizes. Although statistically significant, the effect sizes for gender differences in rumination were small in magnitude. Results are discussed with respect to the RST and gender differences in depression.

AB This longitudinal study tested whether associations between early attachment history and temperament and later anxiety symptoms are direct, or are indirect and explained by children's competencies in regulating emotions and relating to peers. Attachment patterns (secure, avoidant, preoccupied, disorganized) were assessed at 15 and 36 months, and temperament (negative emotionality-NE, Shyness) was assessed at 54 months. Peer competence (PC) and the ability to manage intense emotions were assessed at early school age, and anxiety symptoms in preadolescence. Both attachment history and temperament predicted anxiety. PC mediated the relations of security and disorganization with anxiety, and the ability to manage intense emotions mediated the relation between security and anxiety. PC also mediated the relations of NE and shyness with anxiety, and the ability to manage intense emotions mediated the relation of NE with anxiety. The findings highlight specific mechanisms that may contribute to the development of anxiety.

AB This study examined emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship of attachment and depression in adolescents. Participants (N girls = 127; M age = 14.50; N boys = 121; M age = 14.31) completed self-report questionnaires of attachment to parents and peers, emotion regulation and depression. Models with dysfunctional emotion regulation as a mediation variable were tested via hierarchical multiple regression analyses and bootstrapping procedure. Results revealed significant relations between attachment to parents and peers, dysfunctional emotion regulation and depression. For girls, internal-dysfunctional emotion regulation was a mediator in the relation of attachment to parents and depression and partly mediated the association of attachment to peers. For boys, internal- and external-dysfunctional emotion regulation acted as partly mediators in association of attachment to parents and depression. Results indicate important mechanisms that contribute to the refinement of conceptual models and provide indications for gender specific prevention and intervention for depressive disorders.

AB While a relationship has been identified between physical aggression and executive functioning within the adult population, this relationship has not yet been consistently examined in the adolescent population. This study examined the association between physical aggression towards others, self-reported depressive symptoms, and executive functioning within an adolescent inpatient sample diagnosed with a mood disorder. This study consisted of a retrospective chart review of 105 adolescent inpatients (ages 13-19) that received a diagnosis of a mood disorder (excluding Bipolar Disorder). Participants were grouped based on history of aggression towards others, resulting in a mood disorder with physically aggressive symptoms group (n = 49) and a mood disorder without physically aggressive symptoms group (n = 56). Ten scores on various measures of executive functioning were grouped into five executive functioning subdomains: Problem Solving/Planning, Cognitive Flexibility/Set Shifting, Response Inhibition/Interference Control, Fluency, and Working Memory/Simple Attention. Results from analyses of covariance indicated that there were no significant differences (p < .01) between aggression groups on any executive functioning subdomains. Correlation analyses (p < .01) indicated a negative correlation between disruptive behavior disorders and response inhibition/interference control, while anxiety disorders were negatively correlated with problem solving/planning. These findings provide important information regarding the presence of executive dysfunction in adolescent psychiatric conditions, and the specific executive subdomains that are implicated.

AB Current neurocognitive models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggest that neural circuits involving both attentional and affective processing make independent contributions to the phenomenology of the disorder. However, a clear dissociation of attentional and affective circuits and their behavioral correlates has yet to be shown in medication-naive children with ADHD. Using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) in a cohort of medication naive children with (N=22) and without (N=20) ADHD, we demonstrate that children with ADHD have reduced connectivity in two neural circuits: one underlying executive attention (EA) and the other emotional regulation (ER). We also demonstrate a double dissociation between these two neural circuits and their behavioral correlates such that reduced connectivity in the EA circuit correlates with executive attention deficits but not with emotional lability, while on the other hand, reduced connectivity in the ER circuit correlates with emotional lability but not with executive attention deficits. These findings suggest potential avenues for future research such as examining treatment effects on these two neural circuits as well as the potential prognostic and developmental significance of disturbances in one circuit vs the other.

AB Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with arousal dysregulation, and alterations of amygdala activity in response to emotional arousal have previously been reported. However, voluntary regulation of emotional affect, enabling appropriate neural response to different streams of stimuli, must also engage prefrontal regions, yet the impact of PCE on these prefrontal mechanisms has not been investigated. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) in the modulation of amygdala reactivity and the mediation of effective emotional regulation. Based on these findings, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the present study compared functional activations of the vPFC as well as its structural connectivity with the amygdala between groups of PCE and control adolescents. In a working memory task with emotional distracters, the PCE adolescents exhibited less capability of increasing their vPFC activation in response to increased memory load, which corresponded with their less suppressed amygdala activation. Reduced structural connectivity between the vPFC and the amygdala was also observed from DTI measurement in the PCE group. In addition, correlations between amygdala activation and (i) vPFC activation, as well as (ii) amygdala-vPFC structural connectivity, were observed in the control but not in the PCE group. These data complement previous findings of the impact of PCE on the activity of the amygdala and extend our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effect of PCE on arousal dysregulation reported in human and animal studies.

AB This study examined whether different aspects of self regulation (i.e., emotion and behavior regulation) account for gender differences in German and mathematics achievement. Specifically, we investigated whether higher school achievement by girls in comparison to boys can be explained by self-regulation. German and mathematics achievement were assessed in a sample of 53 German fifth graders (19 boys, 34 girls) using formal academic performance tests (i.e., reading, writing, mathematics) and teachers ratings (i.e., grades in German and mathematics). Moreover, teachers rated children's behavior regulation using the Self-Control Scale (SCS-K-D). Children's self-reported strategies of emotion regulation were assessed with the Questionnaire for the Measurement of Stress and Coping in Children and Adolescents (SSKJ 3-8). Age and intelligence (CFT 20-R) were included as control variables. Analyses of mean differences showed that girls outperformed boys in German achievement and behavior regulation. Regression analyses, using a bootstrapping method, revealed that relations between gender and German achievement were mediated by behavior regulation. Furthermore, we found a suppression effect of behavior regulation on the relation between gender and mathematics achievement: boys' mathematics achievement was underestimated when the analyses did not control for behavior regulation. We discuss these results from a developmental perspective and within the theoretical framework of self regulation and achievement.

AB Background: Research examining mental health in violence-affected youth in representative samples is rare. Using data from the nationally representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) this study reports on gender-specific prevalence rates and associations of a broad range of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems: emotional problems, conduct problems, ADHD, disordered eating, somatic pain and substance use in youth variously affected by violence. While internalizing is generally more common in girls and externalizing in boys, observations of prior non-normative studies suggest reverse associations once an individual is affected by violence. The occurrence of such "gender cross-over effects" is therefore examined in a representative sample.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 6,813 adolescents aged 11 to 17 from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS): Applying multivariate logistic regression analyses, associations between each type of violence history and mental health indicator were determined for perpetrators, victims, and perpetrating victims of youth violence. Moderating effects of gender were examined by using product term interaction.
   Results: Victim status was associated primarily with internalizing problems, while perpetrators were more prone to externalizing problems. Perpetrating victims stood out with respect to the number and strength of risk associations with all investigated mental health indicators. However, the risk profiles of all violence-affected youth included both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. Gender cross-over effects were found for girls and boys: despite lower overall prevalence, girls affected by violence were at far higher risk for conduct problems and illicit drug use; by contrast, somatic pain, although generally lower in males, was positively associated with perpetrator status and perpetrating victim status in boys. All violence-affected youth exhibited significantly higher rates of cumulative mental health problems.
   Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of violence for the mental health of youth. They reveal a particular vulnerability as a function of gender. Implications for policy making, clinical practice and research are discussed.

AB Recently, efforts have been made to better understand constructs that are associated with difficulties in emotion regulation in hopes of identifying underlying mechanisms that may be valuable targets for intervention. Against this background, the present study had two aims. Firstly, we wanted to explore the relation between emotion regulation, experiential avoidance and alexithymia by determining whether adolescents with elevated scores on a measure of alexithymia would report deficits in emotion regulation and experiential avoidance. Secondly, we sought to evaluate the role of experiential avoidance as a mediator in the relation between alexithymia and emotion regulation. The sample (N = 64) consisted of adolescents recruited from an inpatient facility of which approximately 30% were classified as having alexithymia. The results of this study indicate that adolescents with alexithymia report deficits in emotion regulation and elevated experiential avoidance. Experiential avoidance mediated the relation between alexithymia and emotion regulation, indicating that while the inability to effectively use language to identify and describe emotional states is strongly correlated with difficulties in regulating one's emotions, this relation is mediated by the unwillingness to tolerate aversive private experiences. Limitations and strengths of the present study are also noted.

AB This study identified classes of adolescents who differed in their patterns of reported aggression and victimization, examined the stability of these patterns, and explored factors associated with changes in patterns across time. Participants were 477 students from an urban and an adjoining county school system. The overall sample was 48% male and had an average age of 11.3 years. The urban sample was predominantly African American (80%); the county sample was primarily Caucasian (40%) and African American (38%). Self-report aggression and victimization measures completed at the beginning of sixth grade and the end of seventh grade were analyzed using latent class analyses and latent transition analyses. Support was found for four classes: nonvictimized aggressors, aggressive-victims, predominantly victimized, and well-adjusted youth. Emotion dysregulation, anxiety, and site were associated with membership in the aggressive-victim class in the expected direction, providing support for the validity of the classes. The well-adjusted class was the most stable in class membership over time; the predominantly victimized class was the least stable. In addition, nonvictimized aggressors and predominantly victimized youth were more likely than those in the well-adjusted class to transition into the aggressive-victim class. These findings suggest notable stability in aggressor/victim classes over time and emphasize the importance of developing prevention programs that target the unique needs of distinct aggressor/victim classes in adolescence.

AB According to developmental theories of self-injury, both child characteristics and environmental contexts shape and maintain problematic behaviors. Although progress has been made toward identifying biological vulnerabilities to self-injury, mechanisms underlying psychosocial risk have received less attention. In the present study, we compared self-injuring adolescents (n=17) with typical controls (n=20) during a mother-child conflict discussion. Dyadic interactions were coded using both global and microanalytic systems, allowing for a highly detailed characterization of mother-child interactions. We also assessed resting state psychophysiological regulation, as indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Global coding revealed that maternal invalidation was associated with adolescent anger. Furthermore, maternal invalidation and coerciveness were both related to adolescent opposition/defiance. Results from the microanalytic system indicated that self-injuring dyads were more likely to escalate conflict, suggesting a potential mechanism through which emotion dysregulation is shaped and maintained over time. Finally, mother and teen aversiveness interacted to predict adolescent resting RSA. Low-aversive teens with highly aversive mothers had the highest RSA, whereas teens in high-high dyads showed the lowest RSA. These findings are consistent with theories that emotion invalidation and conflict escalation are possible contextual risk factors for self-injury.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a growing public health concern, especially among adolescents. In the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, NSSI is classified as a criterion of borderline personality disorder (BPD). However, a distinct NSSI disorder will now be included in DSM-5 as a condition requiring further study. It is important to note that, at this time, there is little direct evidence supporting the DSM-5 proposal over the DSM-IV classification. To address this need, the current study examined the extent to which NSSI occurs independently of BPD and has clinical significance beyond a diagnosis of BPD in adolescent psychiatric patients. NSSI disorder was assessed based on the proposed DSM-5 criteria in 198 adolescents ages 12 to 18 (74% female; 64% Caucasian, 14% Hispanic, 10% African American, and 12% mixed/other ethnicity) from a psychiatric hospital. Major Axis I disorders, Axis II BPD, and suicide ideation and attempts were assessed with structured clinical interviews; emotion dysregulation and loneliness were measured with validated self-report questionnaires. First, results indicated that NSSI disorder occurred independently of BPD. Specifically, although there was overlap between the occurrence of BPD and NSSI disorder, this overlap was no greater than that between BPD and other Axis I disorders (e.g., anxiety and mood disorders). Second, NSSI disorder demonstrated unique associations with clinical impairmentindexed by suicide ideation and attempts, emotion dysregulation, and lonelinessover and above a BPD diagnosis. Taken together, findings support the classification of NSSI as a distinct and clinically significant diagnostic entity.

AB Introduction. - Aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms co-occur frequently during adolescence. The failure model argues that the onset of aggressive behavior is more likely to precede the onset of depressive symptoms, whereas the acting-out model states that depressed mood predicts subsequent aggressive behavior. However, few longitudinal studies have examined with fully recursive models the temporal ordering of aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms during early adolescence.
   Objective. - Therefore, this study examined the bidirectional associations between aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms during early adolescence, using a multi-informant cross-lagged panel model. Gender differences were also investigated.
   Method. - We used data from three waves of questionnaire data that were annually collected among 497 early adolescents (56.9% boys) and their parents, thereby covering an age range from 12 to 15. Adolescents reported on their depressive symptoms and the parents reported on the adolescents' aggressive behavior.
   Results. Cross-lagged path analyses showed that early adolescents' aggressive behavior predicted subsequent depressive symptoms, but early adolescents' depressive symptoms did not predict aggressive behavior. Findings were similar for boys and girls.
   Conclusion. - Thus, our results provide support for the failure model and suggest that reducing aggressive behavior at the start of adolescence might reduce the risk for subsequent depressive symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To investigate prevalence and patterns of psychiatric disorders in young subjects with Internet addiction (IA).
   Methods: Subjects were taken from a sample of patients, aged 10-18 years old, referred to Istanbul Medical Faculty, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department due to a variety of behavioral and emotional problems alongside problematic Internet use. Inclusion criteria included IQ 70 and score 80 on Young's Internet Addiction Scale (YIAS). Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Turkish version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version.
   Results: Subjects were 45 boys (75%) and 15 girls (25%) with an age range of 10-18 years old (mean age, 13.38 +/- 1.79 years). A total of 60% (n=36) had been using Internet for 5 years. Mean hours/week spent on the Internet was 53.7 (range, 30-105h) and the average YIAS score was 85. All subjects (100%) had at least one and 88.3% (n=53) had at least two comorbid psychiatric disorders. The frequency of diagnostic groups were as follows: behavioral disorder, n=52 (86.7%); anxiety disorder, n=43 (71.7%); mood disorder, n=23 (38.3%); elimination disorder, n=16 (26.7%); tic disorder, n=10 (16.7%); and substance use disorder, n=4 (6.7%). The most common psychiatric disorders were attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (n=53; 83.3%), social phobia (n=21; 35.0%) and major depressive disorder (n=18; 30.0%).
   Conclusion: High rates of psychiatric comorbidity, particularly behavioral, anxiety and mood disorders were found in young subjects with IA. Because the presence of psychiatric disorders may affect the management /prognosis of IA, assessment should include that for other psychiatric disorders.

AB Although immigrant adolescents are at least at equal risk of developing internalizing problems as their non-immigrant peers, immigrant adolescents are less likely to use mental health care. The present study is the first to examine ethnic differences in problem identification to find explanations for this disparity in mental health service use. Specifically, the extent to which emotional problem identification mediates the relationship between immigrant status and mental health service use for internalizing problems in three immigrant populations in the Netherlands (i.e., Surinamese, Turkish, and Moroccan) was investigated. A two-phase design was used to include adolescents at risk for internalizing problems. Data were used from the second phase, in which 349 parents and adolescents participated (95 native Dutch, 85 Surinamese, 87 Turkish, and 82 Moroccan). Results indicated that mental health service use for internalizing problems is far lower among immigrant adolescents than among native Dutch adolescents, although differences between immigrant groups were also substantive. A lack of emotional problem identification was identified as an essential mediator in the relationship between immigrant status and mental health service use. Since the results suggest the low levels of problem identification in our immigrant samples may serve an explanatory role in the relationship between immigrant status and mental health service use, future research should aim at understanding these ethnic differences in problem identification.

AB Purpose: This paper reports the first prospective study of risk factors for continuation of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) during adolescence.
   Methods: We examined whether NSSI became more severe among those continuing to self-injure 1 year later, as well as characteristics and predictors of continuation, relative to cessation, drawn from a sample of 1,973 community-based adolescents from five states in Australia. Multiple sociodemographic and psychosocial factors were assessed in a series of sequential logistic regressions.
   Results: Of those reporting NSSI at follow-up (12% total sample), 4.1% (95% CI: 3.3%-5.0%; n = 80) continued from baseline and an additional 4.1% had stopped this behavior by follow-up (95% CI: 3.3%-5.1%, n = 81; 3.8% new cases). Frequency, potential lethality and number of methods of NSSI increased among adolescents continuing to self-injure. These individuals also had overall higher frequency and more serious wounds compared with those who had stopped self-injuring, possibly providing parameters to differentiate these groups. Continuation of NSSI was associated with higher frequency (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = .99-1.13, p = .08), lower cognitive reappraisal (OR = .86; 95% CI = .78-.95, p = .004) and higher emotional suppression (OR = 1.10; 95% CI = .98-1.22, p = .09) relative to cessation at T1.
   Conclusions: These findings may assist to better identify young people more likely to continue self-injuring and also highlight potentially modifiable factors to inform early intervention initiatives. (C) 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Because impulsivity during adolescence predicts health-risk behaviors and associated harm, interventions that attenuate impulsivity may offer protection. We evaluated effects of the Youth Empowerment Seminar (YES!), a biopsychosocial workshop for adolescents that teaches skills of stress management, emotion regulation, conflict resolution, and attentional focus, on impulsive behavior.
   Methods: High school students (14-18 years of age) in the United States participated in YES! during their physical education classes. Students in a control group attended their usual curriculum and were tested in parallel. We used items from the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (framed to reflect recent behavior) to assess students' behavior before and after they underwent the program.
   Results: Compared with the control group, YES! participants reported less impulsive behavior after the program.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that YES! can promote mental health in adolescents, potentially protecting them from harmful coping behaviors. (C) 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Research on adolescent attachment is limited, but is growing. Studies to date have focused primarily on high-functioning, college student samples with minimal attention given to at-risk, early adolescents. The current study assessed the relationship between sexual activity, substance use, physical and sexual abuse, and attachment avoidance and anxiety in a sample of substance using, runaway youth. Seventy-three adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 years were recruited from a local runaway shelter. The main finding was that attachment avoidance was related to a later age at first use of marijuana. Results provide some support for the utility of the attachment framework in understanding problem behaviors among runaway adolescents. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Objective: Disrupted amygdala activity in depressed adolescents and adults while viewing facial expressions of emotion has been reported. However, few data are available to inform the developmental nature of this phenomenon, an issue that studies of the earliest known forms of depression might elucidate. The current study addressed this question by examining functional brain activity and its relationships to emotion regulation in depressed 4- to 6-year-old children and their healthy peers. Method: A total of 54 medication-naive 4- to 6-year-olds (23 depressed and 31 healthy) participated in a case-control study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Imaging data were used to compare functional brain activity in children with and without depression during emotion face processing. Results: A rightlateralized pattern of elevated amygdala, thalamus, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus activity during face processing was found in depressed 4- to 6-year-olds. In addition, relationships between increased amygdala activity during face processing and disruptions in parent-reported emotion regulation and negative affect were found. No between-group differences specific to emotion face type were identified. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the earliest evidence of alterations in functional brain activity in depression using fMRI. Results suggest that, similar to findings in older depressed groups, depression at this age is associated with disrupted amygdala functioning during face processing. The findings also raise the intriguing possibility that disrupted amygdala function is a depression-related biomarker that spans development. Additional studies will be needed to clarify whether the current findings are a precursor to or a consequence of very early childhood depression.

AB Background Clinic and community-based epidemiological studies have shown an association between child psychopathology and language impairment. The demands on language for social and academic adjustment shift dramatically during adolescence and the ability to understand the nonliteral meaning in language represented by higher order language becomes essential. Objectives: This article reports on the association between difficulties in higher order language skills, reading, cognition, and social-emotional adjustment in adolescents. Method: 144 clinic-referred and 186 comparison youth aged 12-18years were administered a battery of standardized tests of intelligence, working memory, structural and higher order language, and reading achievement. Parent ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist were used as a measure of severity of social-emotional problems. Results: Clinic-referred youth scored significantly lower than comparison youth on measures of structural and higher order language, working memory, and reading. Of the clinic-referred youth, 45% had some type of higher order language impairment, whereas this was the case for 15% of youth in the comparison group. Lower levels of nonverbal ability and working memory as well as lower level of mothers' education were associated with greater risk of having higher order language impairment. Conclusions: Findings have implications for practitioners' seeking to understand and treat adolescents since therapeutic techniques rely on skills where higher order language is at play including the ability to discuss opinions flexibly and to weigh interpretations. Therapists must be aware that there are areas that have potential for miscommunication with some adolescents and where inaccurate inferences may be made about their behavior. Furthermore, educators must consider resources for youth who may increasingly struggle in high school because of such difficulties.

AB Background: Uncertainty remains about the rate of specific psychiatric disorders and associated predictive factors for very preterm (VPT) children. The aims of this study were to document rates of psychiatric disorders in VPT children aged 7years compared with term born children, and to examine potential predictive factors for psychiatric diagnoses in VPT children. Methods: Participants were 177 VPT and 65 term born children. Perinatal medical data were collected, which included brain abnormalities detected using magnetic resonance imaging. The Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were administered at 2 and 5years respectively. At 7years of age, the Developmental and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA) was used to indicate psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Compared with term born children, VPT children had three times the odds of meeting criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis at age 7years (odds ratio 3.03; 95% confidence interval 1.23, 7.47, p=.02). The most common diagnoses were anxiety disorders (11% VPT, 8% term), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (10% VPT, 3% term) and autism spectrum disorder (4.5% VPT, 0% term). For VPT children, those with severe global brain abnormalities (p=.02), those who displayed social-emotional problems at age 5 (p=.000) and those with higher social risk at age 7 (p=.001) were more likely to meet criteria for a psychiatric illness at age 7. Conclusions: Compared with term born children, VPT children have higher rates of psychiatric diagnoses at early school age, predicted by neonatal brain abnormalities, prior social-emotional problems and social factors.

AB Interpersonal violence is present at all levels of influence in the social ecology and can have comprehensive and devastating effects on child and adolescent development through multiple simultaneous channels of exposure. Children's experiences with violence have been linked with a range of behavioral and mental health difficulties including posttraumatic stress disorder and aggressive behavior. In this article, we offer a conceptual framework delineating the ways in which children and adolescents might encounter violence, and a theoretical integration describing how violence might impact mental and behavioral health outcomes through short- and long-term processes. We propose that coping reactions are fundamental to the enduring effects of violence exposure on their psychosocial development and functioning. Finally, we discuss the manner in which coping efforts can support resilience among children exposed to violence and suggest new directions for research and preventive intervention aimed at optimizing outcomes for children at risk of exposure.

AB This study assessed mothers' employment experiences and links with children's long-term cognitive achievement and socio-emotional adjustment using a representative sample of low-income mothers and children (N = 538) from the Three-City Study. Maternal employment involvement, quality, and stability were assessed over a 2-year period when children were aged 24 to 48months. Cluster analysis of the employment characteristics yielded 4 distinct employment patterns differing by the quality and stability of employment. OLS regression analyses linking these employment patterns with children's functioning at age 9 revealed that high-quality stable employment was associated with enhanced cognitive skills and behavioral functioning among children. Further analysis suggested the significance of mothers' consistent insurance benefits to the long-term well-being of their children.

AB Evidence from neuroimaging studies indicate that individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) exhibit altered functioning of fronto-limbic systems implicated in voluntary emotion regulation. Few studies, however, have examined the extent to which unaffected youth at familial risk for BD exhibit such alterations. Using an fMRI emotional working memory paradigm, we investigated the functioning of fronto-limbic systems in fifteen healthy bipolar offspring (8-17 years old) with at least one parent diagnosed with BD (HBO), and 16 age-matched healthy control (HC) participants. Neural activity and functional connectivity analyses focused on a priori neural regions supporting emotion processing (amygdala and ventral striatum) and voluntary emotion regulation (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)). Relative to HC, HBO exhibited greater right VLPFC (BA47) activation in response to positive emotional distracters and reduced VLPFC modulation of the amygdala to both the positive and negative emotional distracters; there were no group differences in connectivity for the neutral distracters. These findings suggest that alterations in the functioning of fronto-limbic systems implicated in voluntary emotion regulation are present in unaffected bipolar offspring. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine the extent to which such alterations represent neurodevelopmental markers of risk for future onset of BD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emotional dysregulation in childhood has been associated with various forms of later psychopathology, although no studies have investigated the personality related adolescent outcomes associated with early emotional dysregulation. The present study uses a typological approach to examine how the child behavior checklist-dysregulation profile (CBCL-DP) predicts DSM-5 pathological personality traits (as measured with the personality inventory for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5 or PID-5 by Krueger et al. (Psychol Med 2012)) across a time span of 4 years in a sample of 243 children aged 8-14 years (57.2 % girls). The results showed that children assigned to the CBCL-DP class are at risk for elevated scores on a wide range of DSM-5 personality pathology features, including higher scores on hostility, risk taking, deceitfulness, callousness, grandiosity, irresponsibility, impulsivity and manipulativeness. These results are discussed in the context of identifying early manifestations of persistent regulation problems, because of their enduring impact on a child's personality development.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of toddlers' self-regulation skills and temperament in predicting weight outcomes in preadolescence.
   METHODS: Participants for this study included 195 children (114 girls) obtained from three different cohorts participating in a larger ongoing longitudinal study. At 2 years of age, participants participated in several laboratory tasks designed to assess their self-regulation abilities, including emotion regulation, sustained attention and delay of gratification, whereas parents filled out a temperament questionnaire to assess toddlers' pleasure expression. Height and weight measures were collected when children were 4, 5, 7 and 10 years of age. Children also filled out a body image and eating questionnaire at the 10-year visit.
   RESULTS: Self-regulation skills in toddlers were associated with body mass index (BMI) development and pediatric obesity as well as body image/eating concerns. The temperament dimension of pleasure was also associated with BMI development and pediatric obesity but not body image/eating concerns.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-regulation difficulties across domains as well as temperament-based pleasure in toddlers represented significant individual risk factors for the development of pediatric obesity 8 years later. Early self-regulation difficulties also contributed to body image and eating concerns that typically accompanied overweight children. The mechanisms by which early self-regulation skills and temperament-based pleasure may contribute to the development of pediatric obesity and associated weight concerns are discussed.

AB Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with amplified emotional responses and poor emotional control, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. This article provides a conceptual and methodologic framework for understanding compromised emotion regulation (ER) in ASD. Method: After defining ER and related constructs, methods to study ER were reviewed with special consideration on how to apply these approaches to ASD. Against the backdrop of cognitive characteristics in ASD and existing ER theories, available research was examined to identify likely contributors to emotional dysregulation in ASD. Results: Little is currently known about ER in youth with ASD. Some mechanisms that contribute to poor ER in ASD may be shared with other clinical populations (e.g., physiologic arousal, degree of negative and positive affect, alterations in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex), whereas other mechanisms may be more unique to ASD (e.g., differences in information processing/perception, cognitive factors [e.g., rigidity], less goal-directed behavior and more disorganized emotion in ASD). Conclusions: Although assignment of concomitant psychiatric diagnoses is warranted in some cases, poor ER may be inherent in ASD and may provide a more parsimonious conceptualization for the many associated socioemotional and behavioral problems in this population. Further study of ER in youth with ASD may identify meaningful subgroups of patients and lead to more effective individualized treatments.

Participants included 216 regular education public high school students with pretest and posttest data participating in the program or instruction-as-usual comparison condition. Program participants reported statistically lower levels of perceived stress and psychosomatic complaints and higher levels of efficacy in affective regulation. Program participants also evidenced statistically larger gains in emotion regulation skills including emotional awareness, access to regulation strategies, and emotional clarity. These findings provide promising evidence of the effectiveness of Learning to BREATHE on the development of key social-emotional learning skills.

AB Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) exhibit common cognitive deficits that may impede the capacity for self-regulating affect. We examined the use of particular cognitive strategies for regulating negative affect in SZ and BD, and their associations with levels of mood symptomatology. Participants were 126 SZ, 97 BD, and 81 healthy controls (HC) who completed the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS). Patients with SZ and BD reported more frequent rumination, catastrophising and self-blame, and less use of putting into perspective, relative to HC. Additionally, SZ patients were more likely to engage in other-blame, compared to HC. The most consistent predictors of symptomatology for SZ were self-blame and catastrophising, while for BD were rumination and reduced positive reappraisal. These findings demonstrate maladaptive use of cognitive strategies to self-regulate negative affect in SZ and BD, resembling those reported previously for unipolar depression. The ineffective use of adaptive cognitive reframing strategies in both patient groups may reflect the impact of their shared cognitive deficits, and requires further investigation. Remediation of cognitive capacities contributing to ineffective self-regulation may facilitate reduced mood symptomatology in SZ and BD. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Medical advancements in neonatology have significantly increased the number of high-risk preterm survivors. However, recent long-term follow-up studies have suggested that preterm infants are at risk for behavioral, educational, and emotional problems. Although clear relationships have been demonstrated between preterm infants and developmental problems during childhood and adolescence, less is known about the early indications of these problems. Recently, numerous studies on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) have demonstrated temporal correlations of activity between spatially remote cortical regions not only in healthy adults but also in neuropathological disorders and early childhood development. In order to compare RSFC of the cerebral cortex between preterm infants at term-equivalent ages and full-term neonates without any anatomical abnormality risk during natural sleep, we used an optical topography system, which is a recently developed extension of near-infrared spectroscopy. We clarified the presence of RSFC in both preterm infants and full-term neonates and showed differences between these groups. The principal differences were that on comparison of RSFC between the bilateral temporal regions, and bilateral parietal regions, RSFC was enhanced in preterm infants compared with full-term neonates; whereas on comparison of RSFC between the left temporal and left parietal regions, RSFC was enhanced in full-term neonates compared with preterm infants. We also demonstrated a difference between the groups in developmental changes of RSFC related to postmenstrual age. Most importantly, these findings suggested that preterm infants and full-term neonates follow different developmental trajectories during the perinatal period because of differences in perinatal experiences and physiological and structural development.

AB Background: Many children can be exposed to multiple adversities in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) placing them at potential risk of psychological problems. However, there is a paucity of research using large representative cohorts examining the psychological adjustment of children in school settings in these countries. Children's psychological adjustment has been shown to affect educational progress which is critical for their future. This study, based in a rural, socio-economically disadvantaged area of South Africa, aimed to examine the prevalence of children's psychological problems as well as possible risk and protective factors.
   Methods: Rates of psychological problems in 10-12 year olds were examined using teacher-and child-report questionnaires. Data on children from 10 rural primary schools, selected by stratified random sampling, were linked to individual and household data from the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance system collected from households over 15 years.
   Results: A total of 1,025 children were assessed. Teachers identified high levels of behavioural and emotional problems (41%). Children reported lower, but substantial rates of anxiety/depression (14%), and significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (24%); almost a quarter felt unsafe in school. Risk factors included being a second-generation former refugee and being from a large household. Protective factors highlight the importance of maternal factors, such as being more educated and in a stable partnership.
   Conclusion: The high levels of psychological problems identified by teachers are a serious public health concern, as they are likely to impact negatively on children's education, particularly given the large class sizes and limited resources in rural LMIC settings. Despite the high levels of risk, a proportion of children were managing well and research to understand resilience could inform interventions.

AB Objectives. We examined the contribution of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination to disparities in problem behaviors among preadolescent Black, Latino, and White youths.
   Methods. We used cross-sectional data from Healthy Passages, a 3-community study of 5119 fifth graders and their parents from August 2004 through September 2006 in Birmingham, Alabama; Los Angeles County, California; and Houston, Texas. We used multivariate regressions to examine the relationships of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and race/ethnicity to problem behaviors. We used values from these regressions to calculate the percentage of disparities in problem behaviors associated with the discrimination effect.
   Results. In multivariate models, perceived discrimination was associated with greater problem behaviors among Black and Latino youths. Compared with Whites, Blacks were significantly more likely to report problem behaviors, whereas Latinos were significantly less likely (a "reverse disparity"). When we set Blacks' and Latinos' discrimination experiences to zero, the adjusted disparity between Blacks and Whites was reduced by an estimated one third to two thirds; the reverse adjusted disparity favoring Latinos widened by about one fifth to one half.
   Conclusions. Eliminating discrimination could considerably reduce mental health issues, including problem behaviors, among Black and Latino youths.

AB Background & objectives: Occurrence of chronic physical pain is increasingly identified among youth, and medically unsupervised analgesic use is a possible risk factor for opioid dependence and other mental diseases in later life. Therefore, the present study was carried out in young student population in Sikkim, India, to explore predictors (including current chronic pain and current analgesic use) of low QoL in youth to identify a subset of population vulnerable to substance use and mental diseases in later life.
   Methods: The study was conducted in a health university setting in Sikkim, North East India. In this cross-sectional study, 156 participants were enrolled with almost equal number of males and females. Generic instruments for demographics and current analgesic use and SF - 36, for assessment of quality of life (QoL), were used. QoL was measured in general, physical and emotional domains. Presence of chronic physical pain during past four weeks was captured using SF - 36.
   Results: Almost two-third participants reported presence of current physical pain (69%, n=108); and (14%, n=22) reported current analgesic use for pain. In logistic regression model controlled for age, ethnicity, gender and residence, higher body mass index (BMI) (beta=-0.16, P=0.02) and current analgesic use (beta=1.6, P=0.006) predicted low QoL in emotional domain (less accomplishment due to emotional problem). Current analgesic use also predicted low QoL in another measure of emotional domain (depressed beta=2.0, P=0.001).
   Interpretation & conclusions: This study identified a subset of participants in their youth with low QoL in emotional domain predicted by current analgesic use and possible overweight problem. Low QoL in more than one emotional domain also identifies possibility of later psychiatric impairment. However, chronic pain did not emerge as a significant predictor of low QoL in emotional domain.

AB Problem Statement: Children, like adults, face numerous problems and conflicts in their everyday lives, including issues with peers, siblings, older children, parents, teachers, and other adults. The methods children use to solve such problems are more important than actually facing the problems. The lack of effective social problem-solving skills among primary school children leads to larger problems such as learning difficulties during adolescence and adulthood, increased dropout potential, academic underachievement, bullying, and exposure to bullying. Sub-features of social problem solving, such as behavior problems, social-emotional adjustment, aggression, violence and anger in the primary school are evaluated by way of observations made by teachers and/or parents. The Social Problem-Solving Questionnaire (SPSQ) measures the methods used by the children in their interpersonal relations in their own words. As there are not any scales in Turkey that measure the social problem-solving skills of students in their own words at the first-and second-grade levels of primary school, it is important to adapt the SPSQ into the Turkish language for use in research and applications.
   Purpose of Study: The purpose of this study was to translate the Wally Child Social Problem - Solving Detective Game Test developed by Webster-Stratton (1990) [(into Turkish and investigate its validity and reliability among Turkish primary school students)]. Methods: Forward and back translation methods were used to translate the Wally Child Social Problem-Solving Detective Game Test from English to Turkish. The Turkish form of the Wally Child Social Problem-Solving Detective Game Test and the Sears Aggression Scale were administered to 376 Turkish primary school students (median age M=8.10) in first and second grades. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the factor structure of the questionnaire. The relationship between social problem solving scores and aggression was assessed by calculating the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient. Additionally, internal consistency was evaluated by calculating Cronbach's alpha, while item-total correlation, split-half, and test-retest reliability coefficients were calculated by Pearson correlation.
   Findings and Results: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified two factors that account for 47.541 % of the variance. Factor 1, social problem solving for peers (eigenvalue=4.96), accounted for 35.473 % of the variance and included 9 items and item loadings that ranged from .59 to .73. Factor 2, social problem solving for adults (eigenvalue=2.07), accounted for 12.068 % of the variance and included 5 items and item loadings that ranged from .63 to .72. The CFA indicated that the two-factor model fit the data well: chi(2) = 171.07, df= 76, chi(2)/df=2.25, RMSEA=.05, SRMR=.004, GFI=.92, AGFI=.90, CFI=.96. Sears Aggression Scale was used to check the criterion validity of the Wally Child Social Problem-Solving Detective Game Test,. There was negative moderate level correlation between social problem-solving subscales and Sears Aggression subscales.
   The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients were .86 (social problem solving for peers),.73 (social problem solving for adults), and .85 (total social problem solving). The Spearman-Brown coefficients were .83 (social problem solving for peers), .71 (social problem solving for adults), and .75 (total social problem solving). The test-retest reliability coefficients for the total scale social problem solving, for social problem solving for peers, and for social problem solving for adults were .85, .86, and .83, respectively. The findings also indicated sufficient evidence in favor of the concurrent validity and reliability of the Turkish Wally Child Social Problem-Solving Detective Game Test.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: The results of this study revealed that the 14-item Wally Child Social Problem-Solving Detective Game Test can be used to evaluate conduct problems and social problem-solving skills among Turkish primary school students between the ages of 7 and 8.

AB For this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we assessed the impact of early social experiences on the social regulation of neural threat responding in a sample of 22 individuals that have been followed for over a decade. At 13 years old, a multidimensional measure of neighborhood quality was derived from parental reports. Three measures of neighborhood quality were used to estimate social capital-the level of trust, reciprocity, cooperation, and shared resources within a community. At 16 years old, an observational measure of maternal emotional support behavior was derived from a mother/child social interaction task. At 24 years old, participants were asked to visit our neuroimaging facility with an opposite-sex platonic friend. During their MRI visit, participants were subjected to the threat of electric shock while holding their friend's hand, the hand of an anonymous opposite-sex experimenter, or no hand at all. Higher adolescent maternal support corresponded with less threat-related activation during friend handholding, but not during the stranger or alone conditions, in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and left insula. Higher neighborhood social capital corresponded with less threat-related activation during friend hand-holding in the superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor cortex, insula, putamen and thalamus; but low childhood capital corresponded with less threat-related activation during stranger handholding in the same regions. Exploratory analyses suggest that this latter result is due to the increased threat responsiveness during stranger handholding among low social capital individuals, even during safety cues. Overall, early maternal support behavior and high neighborhood quality may potentiate soothing by relational partners, and low neighborhood quality may decrease the overall regulatory impact of access to social resources in adulthood.

AB Extensive research has investigated links between individual differences in youths' autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning and psychological outcomes related to emotion regulation, yet little of this research has examined developmental change. The study tested whether individual differences in youths' tonic and stress-induced ANS functioning, assessed at age 14, and changes in ANS functioning from age 14 to 16 predicted corresponding changes in youths' behavioral warmth, as displayed during videotaped mother-child conflict interactions conducted at age 14 and 16. Increased behavioral warmth was predicted by increased baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), increased SCL stress reactivity, decreased RSA stress reactivity (i.e., greater vagal suppression), and decreased baseline SCL. There was also an interaction between RSA stress reactivity at age 14 and changes in maternal warmth from age 14 to 16, such that increased maternal warmth was only associated with increased adolescent warmth for adolescents with lower RSA stress reactivity at age 14.

AB The current study tested whether callous-unemotional (CU) traits explained unique variance in measures of aggression and bullying, and in measures assessing cognitive and affective correlates to aggression, when controlling for conduct problem severity. In a sample of 284 ethnically diverse students (ages 9 to 14 years), a self-report measure of CU traits did not explain unique variance in self-report measures of reactive aggression but did interact with conduct problems in predicting proactive aggression, with conduct problems being more strongly related to proactive aggression in students high on CU traits. Conduct problems were also more strongly related to peer-reports of bullying in girls high on CU traits. Further, CU traits were negatively related to behaviors that defend victims of bullying, independent of conduct problem severity. Finally, conduct problems were more strongly related to anger dysregulation in students low on CU traits, and conduct problems were more strongly related to positive expectations for aggressive behavior in girls high on CU traits. These findings provide support for the proposal to include CU traits as a specifier for the diagnosis of conduct disorder.

AB Young people perceive loneliness as a distressing emotional experience associated with sadness and boredom. Also, feelings of loneliness may be associated with psychosocial and emotional problems during adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate whether perceived social competence mediated the cross-sectional relationship between sport participation and loneliness in young people when controlling for age, sex, shyness, and non-organized physical activity. This cross-sectional study consisted of 2,055 pupils (995 boys and 1,060 girls) from 38 schools in Norway, with a mean age of 15.3 years. In addition to normal theory regression procedures, bootstrapping techniques were used to test the hypothesized indirect effect. Findings revealed that sport participation was inversely associated with loneliness mediated by perceived social competence. This indirect effect was evident when controlling for age, sex, non-organized physical activity and shyness. Findings suggest that sport participation during adolescence is indirectly associated with lower level of loneliness through higher level of perceived social competence. One may argue that sport participation during adolescence can contain important social components that help meet young peoples' social needs and expectations, which in turn may prevent feelings of loneliness.

AB Self-regulationthe ability to manage motivations, emotions, physiological sensations, and behavior to meet internal and external demands of the environmentis critical to health and development. Adolescence represents a dynamic period of change in both the demand and capacity for self-regulation. As teens mature and become more autonomous, they are confronted with decisions in determining where they spend their time, what they eat, when they go to bed, and how they prioritize and pursue various social, academic, and recreational goals. We highlight opportunities to improve self-regulatory capacities and related health outcomes during this important developmental window. In particular, we focus on emotion regulation, sleep regulation, and weight regulation as three separate but synergistic self-regulatory systems that may provide unique opportunities for intervention to optimize health outcomes. To this end, we begin by describing developmental changes that occur in emotion, sleep and weight regulatory systems during the transitional period of adolescence, as well as how these changes can lead to profound and enduring health consequences. Next, we describe emerging evidence that indicates complex and synergistic interactions among these regulatory systems during adolescence. Last, we end with possible prevention and intervention efforts that capitalize on the interactions among these three regulatory domains.

AB Adolescence is an important developmental stage during which both peers and the media have a strong influence. Both peer rejection and the use of morally adverse media are associated with negative developmental outcomes. This study examines processes by which peer rejection might drive adolescents to select antisocial media content by tying together developmental research on peer rejection and research on media effects. Assumed underlying mechanisms are rejection-based anger and frustration and the adolescent's moral judgment. A between-participants experimental design manipulated peer rejection versus acceptance in adolescents (M-age = 13.88 years; N = 74) and young adults (M-age = 21.37 years; N = 75), applying the Cyberball paradigm. Measures included the State Anger Inventory (STAXI) to assess feelings of rejection and the newly devised Media, Morals, and Youth Questionnaire (MMaYQue) to assess media preferences and moral judgment of media content. Using bootstrapping analyses, a double mediation was established: Higher levels of state anger in peer-rejected adolescents induced more tolerable moral judgments of antisocial media content, subsequently instigating a preference for antisocial media content. In contrast, the young adult sample showed no relations between peer rejection and antisocial media preference. Results are discussed within a downward spiral framework of combined peer and media influences.

AB Early identification of behavioral and emotional risk has been identified as one strategy to help decrease rates of childhood behavioral and emotional problems. This study compares two methods for early identification (teacher nomination and universal screening) to determine how each strategy may differentially identify at-risk students. A sample of 849 elementary and middle school students was assessed on a number of behavioral and academic outcomes to determine differences among identification methods. Results indicate that universal screening identified a higher number of students than teacher nomination, and those identified by universal screening had lower reading grades. Both approaches identified more males than females. Although students identified as at risk by both methods had significantly more office discipline referrals, and lower study habits and cooperation grades than students not identified as at risk, there were no significant differences in these variables between the early identification methods. Implications and future research needs are discussed.

AB Aims: To assess behavioural problems in adolescents with congenital and acquired heart disease in comparison with healthy controls. The perception of behavioural problems by the patients' parents was also assessed and compared. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 130 adolescents with congenital and acquired heart disease and 246 healthy controls. The second part of the Youth Self-Report was applied to the patients and controls, and the Child Behavior Checklist to the patients' parents. Results: Male patients showed significantly fewer behavioural problems compared with male controls. No significant difference was found in the female gender. Healthy male adolescents scored significantly higher in the Internalising, Externalising, and in the Total Problems scales. Patients scored significantly higher only on the Social Problems subscale. Female patients in middle and late adolescence and male patients in early adolescence displayed more problems. No significant difference was found between the diagnostic groups. Operated patients did not differ from the non-operated ones. Patients scored significantly lower than did their parents. Conclusions: Male adolescents with cardiac disease reported fewer behavioural problems when compared with healthy controls, but no difference was observed in the female gender. Patients also reported fewer behavioural problems than did their parents. Adolescents with cardiac disease scored higher than did controls only on the Social Problems subscale. Analysing the patients' behavioural profile, female patients in middle and late adolescence and male patients in early adolescence were the most problematic ones. No difference was observed between the diagnostic groups, nor between operated and non-operated patients.

AB Previous studies of early life trauma suggest that in addition to its emotional impact, exposure to early life stress (ELS) is associated with alterations in brain structure. However, little attention has been devoted to the relationship between emotional processing and brain integrity as a function of age of ELS onset. In the present study we examined whether ELS onset in older ages of youth rather than younger ages is associated with smaller limbic and basal ganglia volumes as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We hypothesized that later age of manifestation during youth is associated with smaller volumetric morphology in limbic and basal ganglia volumes in adulthood. A total of 173 individuals were divided into three groups based on the age of self-reported ELS. The three groups included individuals only experiencing early childhood ELS (1 month-7 years, n = 38), those only experiencing later childhood ELS (8 years -17 years, n = 59), and those who have not experienced ELS (n = 76). Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, amygdala, insula and caudate volumes were measured using a T1-weighted MRI. Analyses confirmed that later childhood ELS was associated with volumetric reductions in the ACC and insula volumes, while ELS experienced between the ages of 1 month and 7 years was not associated with lower brain volumes in these regions. The results may reflect the influence of more fully developed emotional processing of ELS on the developing brain and reinforce a body of research implicating both the ACC and insula in neuropsychiatric disorders and emotional regulation.

AB This study examined how maximizing and minimizing responses to positive events were associated with sustained positive feelings about the events and adjustment in a community sample of 56 young adolescents (31 boys and 25 girls, 10-14 years of age). On daily reports, adolescents reported their positive emotional reactions to their best event each day. A week later, they reported their responses to their most intense positive event across the 4 days. Parents and adolescents reported on adolescents' adjustment. The results indicated that maximizing responses were related to more intense feelings about the events 1 week later. Minimizing responses were associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors over and above coping with negative events. The findings indicated that adolescents can maximize or capitalize on positive events but that minimizing is linked to poorer adjustment. Our study parallels existing research with adults and offers new information about young adolescents' responses to positive events.

AB The aim of this study was to examine whether the relationship between maternal psychological well-being and behavior problems in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is bidirectional. Data were available at 9 months, 3 years, and 5 years old for 132 children with ASD, identified from a population-representative sample of UK children. Three-wave cross-lagged models examined reciprocal effects between child behavior and maternal well-being (psychological distress, physical health functioning, and life satisfaction). Results indicated that the relationships between maternal well-being and child problem behaviors were not bidirectional. Specifically, findings suggested that while early behavior problems are not a risk factor for later maternal well-being, maternal psychological distress, physical health limitations, and lower life satisfaction are risk factors for later child behavior problems.

AB To develop and refine interventions to prevent youth suicide, knowledge is needed about specific processes that reduce risk at a population level. Using a cross-sectional design, the present study tested hypotheses regarding associations between self-reported suicide attempts, emotion regulation difficulties, and positive youth-adult relationships among 7,978 high-school students (48.6 % male, 49.9 % female) in 30 high schools from predominantly rural, low-income communities. 683 students (8.6 %) reported a past-year suicide attempt. Emotion regulation difficulties and a lack of trusted adults at home and school were associated with increased risk for making a past-year suicide attempt, above and beyond the effects of depressive symptoms and demographic factors. The association between emotion regulation difficulties and suicide attempts was modestly lower among students who perceived themselves as having higher levels of trusted adults in the family, consistent with a protective effect. Having a trusted adult in the community (outside of school and family) was associated with fewer suicide attempts in models that controlled only for demographic covariates, but not when taking symptoms of depression into account. These findings point to adolescent emotion regulation and relationships with trusted adults as complementary targets for suicide prevention that merit further intervention studies. Reaching these targets in a broad population of adolescents will require new delivery systems and "option rich" (OR) intervention designs.

AB Background: In addition to the core symptoms, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor emotion regulation. There is some evidence that children and young adults with ADHD have lower omega-3 levels and that supplementation with omega-3 can improve both ADHD and affective symptoms. We therefore investigated differences between ADHD and non-ADHD children in omega-3/6 fatty acid plasma levels and the relationship between those indices and emotion-elicited event-related potentials (ERPs).
   Methods: Children/adolescents with (n = 31) and without ADHD (n = 32) were compared in their plasma omega-3/6 indices and corresponding ERPs during an emotion processing task.
   Results: Children with ADHD had lower mean omega-3/6 and ERP abnormalities in emotion processing, independent of emotional valence relative to control children. ERP abnormalities were significantly associated with lower omega-3 levels in the ADHD group.
   Conclusions: The findings reveal for the first time that lower omega-3 fatty acids are associated with impaired emotion processing in ADHD children. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective This study examines associations between attachment orientations and mental health among breast cancer survivors and their adolescent daughters, while focusing on intergenerational transmission of emotional problems. Methods A total of 58 breast cancer survivors and their adolescent daughters were recruited 8 months following mothers' completion of treatment and were compared with a matched control group of 48 healthy mothers and their adolescent daughters. Measures included the Experiences in Close Relationships scale and the Mental Health Inventory. Results Hierarchical regressions revealed the following: First, breast cancer survivors reported higher levels of mental distress and lower levels of well-being than control women, and the effect of breast cancer on well-being was significant only among highly anxiously attached women. Second, daughters of breast cancer survivors reported higher levels of mental distress than daughters of control women only if they scored high on avoidant attachment. Third, daughters of breast cancer survivors reported higher levels of mental distress than daughters of control women only if their mothers scored high on anxious attachment. Conclusions Breast cancer had detrimental effects on survivors' well-being and daughters' distress mainly when survivors scored high on attachment anxiety. Breast cancer had also detrimental effects of daughters' distress mainly when daughters scored high on avoidant attachment. These findings highlight the importance of attachment security as an inner resource for buffering detrimental mental health effects of breast cancer among survivors and their daughters.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Due to increased multiculturalism in the US and abroad, there is a need for increased understanding of the different ways in which parenting stress is related to child problems across cultures. In the present study, we investigated (a) differences in reported parenting stress and childhood problem behaviors across a Korean (n = 71) and US (n = 71) sample, as well as (b) differences in the ways in which parenting stress and childhood problems were related across Korean and US children based on mothers' reports. Results revealed that Korean mothers reported significantly higher parenting stress yet significantly lower childhood problem behaviors compared to US mothers. In addition, mother-based reports of child problems were significantly associated with parenting stress in the US sample, but not in the Korean sample. Clinical implications and culturally-relevant issues relevant to these findings are addressed, including a potential under-reporting bias of child problems among Asian parents.

AB In the current study we aimed to examine the association between attachment styles towards father and mother, perfectionistic self-promotion (PSP), socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), and binge eating symptoms in a sample of 328 late adolescents (mean age 17.1 years). It was examined whether anxiously and avoidantly attached adolescents would differentially cope with their insecure feelings. It was hypothesized that anxiously attached adolescents would, through hyperactivating strategies, be hypersensitive to the expectations of others. Avoidantly attached adolescents were hypothesized to present a perfect image of the self, because of their deactivating emotion regulation. Furthermore, the mediating role of perfectionism in the relation between attachment representations and binge eating symptoms was examined. Results showed that anxious attachment was significantly positively associated with PSP, SPP, and binge eating. Avoidant attachment towards mother was only positively associated with SPP, whereas avoidant attachment towards father was positively associated with PSP and binge eating. PSP fully mediated the relation between avoidant attachment towards father and binge eating. Interestingly, the current findings showed the importance of examining attachment representations towards both parents. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Intellectual disability (ID) is often associated with behavioral problems or disorders. Mutations in the GRIN2B gene (MRD6, MIM613970) have been identified as a common cause of ID (prevalence of 0.5 - 1% in individuals with ID) associated with EEG and behavioral problems.
   Methods: We assessed five GRIN2B mutation carriers aged between 3 and 14 years clinically and via standardized questionnaires to delineate a detailed behavioral phenotype. Parents and teachers rated problem behavior of their affected children by completing the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC) and the Conners' Rating Scales Revised (CRS-R:L).
   Results: All individuals had mild to severe ID and needed guidance in daily routine. They showed characteristic behavior problems with prominent hyperactivity, impulsivity, distractibility and a short attention span. Stereotypies, sleeping problems and a friendly but boundless social behavior were commonly reported.
   Conclusion: Our observations provide an initial delineation of the behavioral phenotype of GRIN2B mutation carriers.

AB Fronto-limbic brain activity during sleep is believed to support the consolidation of emotional memories in healthy adults. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is accompanied by emotional deficits coincidently caused by dysfunctional interplay of fronto-limbic circuits. This study aimed to examine the role of sleep in the consolidation of emotional memory in ADHD in the context of healthy development. 16 children with ADHD, 16 healthy children, and 20 healthy adults participated in this study. Participants completed an emotional picture recognition paradigm in sleep and wake control conditions. Each condition had an immediate (baseline) and delayed (target) retrieval session. The emotional memory bias was baseline-corrected, and groups were compared in terms of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (sleep vs. wake). We observed an increased sleep-dependent emotional memory bias in healthy children compared to children with ADHD and healthy adults. Frontal oscillatory EEG activity (slow oscillations, theta) during sleep correlated negatively with emotional memory performance in children with ADHD. When combining data of healthy children and adults, correlation coefficients were positive and differed from those in children with ADHD. Since children displayed a higher frontal EEG activity than adults these data indicate a decline in sleep-related consolidation of emotional memory in healthy development. In addition, it is suggested that deficits in sleep-related selection between emotional and non-emotional memories in ADHD exacerbate emotional problems during daytime as they are often reported in ADHD.

AB Background: Being bullied has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders, but there is very limited evidence on the association of bullying with temperament.
   Methods: The data was collected in a large web-survey on psychological and psychiatric measures (BRAIN-STEP). Bullying was assessed with a question on time exposed to bullying (none, <1 year, 1-3 years and >3 years) during childhood and adolescence. Emotional traits and affective temperaments were evaluated with the Affective and Emotional Composite Temperament Scale (AFECTS). The final sample consisted of 50,882 subjects (mean age 30.8 +/- 10.4 years, 73.4% females) with valid answers.
   Results: About half of the sample reported exposure to bullying and 10% reported being victimized by peers for longer than 3 years. Longer exposure to bullying was associated with lower Volition, Coping and Control scores, and more Emotional Sensitivity, Anger and Fear, with statistical significance between all groups. To a lower degree, exposure to bullying was associated with lower Caution and higher Desire scores. Bullying victimization was also associated with a much lower proportion of euthymic and hyperthymic types in both genders, which was compensated by an increase mainly in the proportion of depressive, cyclothymic and volatile types.
   Limitations: Retrospective assessment of bullying with a single question on time exposed to bullying and use of self-report instruments only.
   Conclusions: Being bullied was associated with a broad and profound impact on emotional and cognitive domains in all dimensions of emotional traits, and with internalized and unstable affective temperaments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Knowledge of where substance use and other such behavioral problems frequently occur has aided policing, public health, and urban planning strategies to reduce such behaviors. Identifying locales characterized by high childhood neurobehavioral disinhibition (ND), a strong predictor of substance use and consequent disorder (SUD), may likewise improve prevention efforts. Objectives: The distribution of ND in 10-12-year olds was mapped to metropolitan Pittsburgh, PA, and tested for clustering within locales. Methods: The 738 participating families represented the population in terms of economic status, race, and population distribution. ND was measured using indicators of executive cognitive function, emotion regulation, and behavior control. Innovative geospatial analyzes statistically tested clustering of ND within locales while accounting for geographic barriers (large rivers, major highways), parental SUD severity, and neighborhood quality. Results: Clustering of youth with high and low ND occurred in specific locales. Accounting for geographic barriers better delineated where high ND is concentrated, areas which also tended to be characterized by greater parental SUD severity and poorer neighborhood quality. Conclusions and Significance: Offering programs that have been demonstrated to improve inhibitory control in locales where youth have high ND on average may reduce youth risk for SUD and other problem behaviors. As demonstrated by the present results, geospatial analysis of youth risk factors, frequently used in community coalition strategies, may be improved with greater statistical and measurement rigor.

AB Frequent use of expressive suppression to regulate one's emotions can impair long-term health and well-being for both children and adults. Therefore, there are important pragmatic benefits to identifying contexts in which individuals learn to avoid expressive suppression. We hypothesized that individuals involved in acting classes-a context in which expression of emotion is highly valued-may use expressive suppression as an emotion regulation technique less than do other individuals. Study 1 showed that adolescents majoring in acting at a high school for the arts used suppression less than did adolescents majoring in other kinds of art classes (visual arts, music). Study 2 showed that after 10 months of acting (but not visual arts) classes, expressive suppression decreased in elementary school-age children. These findings suggest that experience in acting may be associated with a decrease in the use of expressive suppression, a relatively maladaptive emotion regulation strategy.

AB Issues of equality and fairness and invasion of the personal domain, 2 previously identified topic areas of adolescent sibling conflict (N. Campione-Barr & J. G. Smetana, 2010), were examined in 145dyads (Mfirst-born=14.97, SD=1.69years; Msecond-born=12.20, SD=1.90years) for their differential effects on youths' emotional adjustment over 1year. The impact of internalizing symptoms on later sibling conflicts also was tested. Invasion of the personal domain conflicts were associated with higher levels of anxiety and lower self-esteem 1year later, whereas Equality and Fairness issues were associated with greater depressed mood. Conversely, greater internalizing symptomatology and lower self-esteem predicted more of both types of conflict. Moderating influences of gender and ordinal position were also examined.

AB Objective: We tested a dual-process model based on behavioral and emotional regulation constructs, which posits that good self-control and poor regulation make independent contributions and have different types of pathways to outcomes. The utility of the model for predicting substance use was tested in two diverse populations of younger adolescents. Method: A survey was administered in classrooms to middle-school students in Westchester County, New York (N = 601) and Honolulu, Hawaii (N = 881). The New York sample was 8% African American, 5% Asian American, 47% Caucasian, 31% Hispanic, and 9% other ethnicity. The Hawaii sample was 21% Asian American, 8% Caucasian, 26% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 34% Filipino, and 10% other ethnicity. Structural equation modeling analyses tested pathways from the four regulation variables through six hypothesized mediators to a criterion construct of substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana). Results: Results were replicated across samples and were consistent with prediction. Unique contributions were found for good self-control and poor regulation, including both behavioral and emotional aspects. Good self-control had an inverse effect on substance use primarily through relations to higher levels of protective factors (e. g., academic competence). Poor regulation independently had a risk-promoting effect on substance use through relations to higher levels of risk factors (e. g., negative life events). Conclusions: Two field studies showed the dual-process model is robust across different populations. Substance prevention programs should consider approaches for enhancing good self-control as well as procedures for reducing poor regulation and minimizing its impact. Extensions to health behaviors including dietary intake and physical activity are discussed.

AB Objective To examine whether deviation from one's ethnic group norm on body mass index (BMI) was related to psychosocial maladjustment among early adolescent girls, and whether specific ethnic groups were more vulnerable to maladjustment. Methods Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted on self- and peer-report measures from an ethnically diverse sample of sixth-grade girls (N = 2,636). Results African Americans and Latinas had a higher mean BMI than Asians and Whites. As deviation from their ethnic group BMI norm increased, girls reported greater social anxiety, depression, peer victimization, and lower self-worth, and had lower peer-reported social status. Associations were specific to girls deviating toward obesity status. Ethnic differences revealed that Asian girls deviating toward obesity status were particularly vulnerable to internalizing symptoms. Conclusions Emotional maladjustment may be more severe among overweight/obese girls whose ethnic group BMI norm is furthest away from overweight/obesity status. Implications for obesity work with ethnically diverse adolescents were discussed.

AB The incidence of single-parent families has increased significantly in Taiwan in recent years. Children born in single-parent families are predisposed to suffering from emotional problems. We aimed to determine if the children of single-parent families are more depressive than children from both-parent families, and to examine the individual and joint effects of various factors on the depression risk. A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the depression status of elementary school children in MiaoLi County, Taiwan. A total of 881 eligible subjects, including 144 children from single-parent families were recruited from 29 schools. Data for depression-related demographic characteristics, family and school variables were collected. The results show that 27.6% of children from single-father families with depressive symptoms, 15.1% children from single-mother families and 15.3% children from both-parent families with repressive symptoms. This study provides significant evidences that single-father family was one significant predictor for childhood depression and the enhanced effects of socioeconomic status and peer relationship on depression of children from single father families were found up to 4-fold (OR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.8-8.5) and 5-fold (OR= 5.5, 95% CI = 2.3-13.2) risk respectively. The results provide hints to parents and teachers for improving the mental health of children in single-parent families by reducing the occurrence of depression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background Australian young people have a high prevalence of mental health problems but low rates of service use. This article examines whether the Australian National Youth Mental Health Foundation, headspace, has helped redress this through providing youth-specific services. Method The article compares headspace service use demographics with population data from the Australian Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing from 2007. Results Headspace has improved access relative to the population, particularly among males and socially and economically excluded young people. Conclusions Despite overall successes, certain ethnic and age groups appear under-represented and in need of more careful targeting by youth mental health services.

AB This longitudinal study examined personal-accentuation and contextual-amplification models of pubertal timing. In these models, individual and contextual risk factors during childhood and adolescence can magnify the effects of early or late puberty on depression symptoms that occur years later. The moderating role of prepubertal individual factors (emotional problems in late childhood) and interpersonal factors (deviant peer affiliation, early dating, perceived peer popularity, and perceived parental rejection during adolescence) were tested. A representative sample of 1,431 Canadian adolescents between 10-11 and 16-17 years of age was followed biannually. In line with the personal-accentuation model, early puberty has been shown to be a predictor for depression in both girls and boys who presented emotional problems in childhood. This effect was also noted for late maturing boys. Consistent with the contextual-amplification model, early puberty predicted later depression in youth who perceived greater parental rejection. Interpersonal experiences such as early dating in girls and deviant peer affiliation in boys predicted depression in early maturers as well. For girls, early dating was also found to be amplified by childhood emotional problems. In line with biopsychosocial models, results indicate that the effect of pubertal timing on depressive symptoms must be conceptualized through complex interactions between characteristics of adolescents' interpersonal relationships and prepubertal vulnerabilities.

AB The present study examined the predictive value of emotional competence and the five-factor model of personality on the quality of life of children with asthma.
   Participants were 90 children (M age = 11.73, SD = 2.60) having controlled and partly controlled asthma, undergoing everyday treatment. Children filled in questionnaires assessing emotional competence and quality of life. Parents completed questionnaires assessing the personality of their child.
   Results showed that two emotional competences, bodily awareness and verbal sharing of emotions, were related to the quality of life of children with asthma. Moreover, one personality trait, benevolence, was associated with children's quality of life. Regression analyses showed that the predictive value of these three dimensions remained significant over and above asthma control and socio-demographic variables frequently associated with the quality of life of children with asthma (age, gender, and educational level of parents).
   These findings emphasize the importance of alerting the clinician who works with children with asthma to observe and assess the child's expression of emotions, attention to bodily sensations, and benevolence.

AB This study aimed at validating the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire (EAQ, Rieffe etal., 2008) for Italian children and adolescents. Emotion awareness is a prerequisite of emotion regulation including the abilities to monitor and differentiate emotions, locate their antecedents, and value the importance of one's own and others' emotions. The EAQ consists of six scales: Differentiating Emotions, Verbal Sharing of Emotions, Not Hiding Emotions, Bodily Awareness of Emotions, Attending to Others' Emotions, and Analyses of (Own) Emotions. The questionnaire was filled in twice with a one-year time interval. At T1, 420 Italian children and adolescents took part (M=12.65; SD=1.41). Additionally, the Somatic Complaints List was administered to examine the concurrent validity of the EAQ. Results confirmed the six-factor structure, showed good psychometric properties of the separate scales and a good concurrent validity, which make the EAQ a reliable instrument to administer emotion awareness in Italian youth.

AB This study tested if children and adolescents with high levels of borderline personality features (BPF) exhibit the same shame-prone self-concept previously found to characterize adults with borderline personality disorder (Rusch et al., 2007). Self-concept was indexed using the Implicit Association Test, in a community sample of children/adolescents aged 10 to 14 years (48% female; M age=12.04 years). Common domains of child and adolescent psychopathology and core components of BPF were assessed using self-reports on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children. The identity problems component of BPF was found to significantly predict implicit levels of shame-prone self-concept, but only among girls. This effect was independent of the key dimensions of child and adolescent psychopathology that overlap with BPFincluding features hyperactivity/inattention, disruptive behavior problems, and anxiety/depressionnone of which were associated with shame-prone self-concept at the bivariate level or otherwise. The current findings provide preliminary evidence that self-schemas related to shame are uniquely associated with a core component of BPF in middle childhood and early adolescence and suggest that this correlate may apply uniquely to female individuals. These findings point to the identity problems component of BPF as a priority for future clinical and developmental research into mechanisms associated with BPF across childhood and adolescence.

AB Motivation is assumed to influence behaviors via perceived agency over goal pursuits, but empirical research integrating motivation and action-control processes in social development is close to nonexistent. We applied this perspective to the study of early adolescent friendships by examining motivation for and perceived control (ability and effort) over establishing and maintaining friendships in association with adolescents' emotional adjustment, friend-reported friendship closeness, and peer-reported social adjustment. Participants were 648 early adolescents (12-14 years). As expected, intrinsic friendship motivation was associated with perceived ability and effort in the self as well as positive adjustment, whereas extrinsic motivation was associated with relying on others in friendship tasks and poor adjustment. Motivation was also directly related to adjustment and the observed associations differed by gender. The integrated motivation-action control model was supported in terms of adolescent emotional adjustment and friendship quality.

AB Purpose: Although quantitative benefits of mindfulness training have been demonstrated in youth, little is known about the processes involved. The aim of this study was to gain a detailed understanding of how young people engage with the ideas and practices known as mindfulness using qualitative enquiry.
   Methods: Following completion of a six-week mindfulness training program with a nonclinical group of 11 young people (age 16-24), a focus group (N = 7) and open-ended interviews (n = 5) were held and audio-recorded. Qualitative data, collected at eight time points over three months from the commencement of training, were coded with the aid of computer software. Grounded theory methodology informed the data collection process and generation of themes and an explanatory model that captured participants' experiences.
   Results: Participants described their daily lives as beset by frequent experiences of distress sometimes worsened by their unhelpful or destructive reactions. With mindfulness practice, they initially reported greater calm, balance, and control. Subsequently they commented on a clearer understanding of themselves and others. Mindfulness was then described as a "mindset" associated with greater confidence and competence and a lessened risk of future distress.
   Conclusions: Participants demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of and engagement with mindfulness principles and practice. Their reported experience aligned well with qualitative research findings in adults and theoretical literature on mindfulness. An encouraging finding was that, with ongoing mindfulness practice and within a relatively short time, participants were able to move beyond improved emotion regulation and gain greater confidence in their ability to manage life challenges.

AB Research has established links between parental emotion socialization behaviours and youth emotional and psychological outcomes; however, no study has simultaneously compared these relations for White, Black, and Asian individuals. In this study, emerging adults identifying as White (n= 61), Black (n= 51), or Asian (n= 56) retrospectively reported on parents' emotion socialization behaviours during childhood, existing emotion regulation (ER) skills, and current psychopathology symptoms. Asian participants reported fewer positive displays of emotions in their families during childhood than White and Black participants. Despite this difference, low expression of positive emotions in families during childhood did not relate to negative outcomes for Asian participants but was linked for White and Black participants. Overall, Asian participants reported more difficulties with ER than Black or White participants, and relations between ER difficulties and psychopathology varied by racial group. The findings emphasize the need to consider race when conducting research on emotion functioning with families and highlight emotion dysregulation as a potential treatment target for White, Black, and Asian individuals.

AB While associations between exposure to marital conflict and child development have been documented extensively in middle childhood and adolescence, few studies have examined the developmental consequences of conflict exposure in infancy. Moreover, those that have examined marital conflict in infancy tended to focus on consequences of conflict exposure on infants' attachment security, and various aspects of infants' physiological and emotion regulation. Virtually nothing is known about the longitudinal links between exposure to interparental conflict in infancy and later cognitive development. Using longitudinal data on a subsample of infants (N = 6,019) and their parents who participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), this study examined links between the frequency of interparental conflict at 9 months and child cognitive development 15 months later. Combining data from parent interviews, birth certificates, in-home assessments of child cognitive development, and videotaped parent-child interactions, results showed significant negative associations between the frequency of child-related interparental conflict at 9 months of age and child cognitive ability at 24 months. The negative association reflects a direct effect that was not mediated by parental support or child attachment security measured at 24 months. Associations were calculated while considering children's prior cognitive functioning (at 9 months), and a wide range of child, parent and household characteristics.

AB Background: Faecal incontinence (FI) and constipation occur following corrective surgery for anorectal malformations (ARMs) and in children or adults with chronic constipation without a structural birth anomaly (chronic idiopathic constipation, CIC). Such symptoms may have profound effects on quality of life (QoL). This study systematically determined the burden of FI and constipation in these patients in adolescence and early adulthood, and their effect on QoL and psychosocial functioning in comparison with controls.
   Methods: Patients with ARMs or CIC were compared with age-and sex-matched controls who had undergone appendicectomy more than 1 year previously and had no ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms. Constipation and FI were evaluated using validated Knowles-Eccersley-Scott Symptom (KESS) and Vaizey scores respectively. Standardized QoL and psychometric tests were performed in all groups.
   Results: The study included 49 patients with ARMs (30 male, aged 11-28 years), 45 with CIC (32 male, aged 11-30 years) and 39 controls (21 male, aged 11-30 years). The frequency of severe constipation among patients with ARMs was approximately half that seen in the CIC group (19 of 49 versus 31 of 45); however, frequencies of incontinence were similar (22 of 49 versus 21 of 45) (P < 0.001 versus controls for both symptoms). Physical and mental well-being were significantly reduced in both ARM and CIC groups compared with controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.015 respectively), with generally worse scores among patients with CIC. Both were predicted by gastrointestinal symptom burden (P < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in state or trait psychiatric morbidity between groups.
   Conclusion: FI and constipation are major determinants of poor QoL in adolescents and young adults with ARMs and in those with CIC.

AB Although past research has provided important information about the relationship between language use and mental health in the period of adolescence, the role of intervening variables in this association has been seriously neglected. The aim of the present study was to illuminate the association between language use (operationalized by the gap between experience and languageGAP) and mental health (e.g., adjustment and depression, with the mediator role of emotion regulation). Three-hundred-and-seventy-four adolescents (220 female, 154 male; 16.08 mean age) participated in the study. The results provided support for the mediator role of emotion regulation in the relationship between GAP and mental health. Moreover, it was shown that the relationship between emotion regulation and depression was mediated by adjustment.

   AGGRESSION; CONDUCT PROBLEMS; DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY;
   PATHOLOGICAL NARCISSISM; DECISION-MAKING; PERSONALITY; CHILDREN
AB Different patterns of emotional reactivity characterize proactive and reactive functions of aggressive behavior, and theory also suggests a link of both types with narcissism. How people with narcissistic traits respond emotionally to competitive scenarios could influence their aggressiveness. Participants were 85 adolescent boys from a detention center. Several indices of emotional functioning were assessed, including attentional bias to negative emotional stimuli and psychophysiological responding. In addition, we included self-report and laboratory measures of aggression and measures of psychopathy-linked narcissism, callous-unemotional traits, and impulsivity. Psychopathy-linked narcissism was uniquely related to unprovoked aggression (i.e., proactive aggression) and to heightened attention to pictures depicting others' distress. Compared with those scoring low on narcissism, those high on narcissism, who were the least physiologically reactive group, evinced greater proactive aggression, whereas those showing a pattern of coactivation (i.e., sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic reactivity) evinced greater reactive aggression. Results are consistent with descriptions of narcissistic individuals as being hypervigilant to negative cues and exhibiting poor emotion regulation. These characteristics may lead to aggressive and violent behavior aimed at maintaining dominance over others.

ID SUPPLEMENT NCS-A; CHILDREN; CARE; DISORDERS; PROGRAMS; DESIGN; SCALE
AB Objective: Although schools are identified as critical for detecting youth mental disorders, little is known about whether the number of mental health providers and types of resources that they offer influence student mental health service use. Such information could inform the development and allocation of appropriate school-based resources to increase service use. This article examines associations of school resources with past-year mental health service use among students with 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders. Method: Data come from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a national survey of adolescent mental health that included 4,445 adolescent parent pairs in 227 schools in which principals and mental health coordinators completed surveys about school resources and policies for addressing student emotional problems. Adolescents and parents completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and reported mental health service use across multiple sectors. Multilevel multivariate regression was used to examine associations of school mental health resources and individual-level service use. Results: Nearly half (45.3%) of adolescents with a 12-month DSM-IV disorder received past-year mental health services. Substantial variation existed in school resources. Increased school engagement in early identification was significantly associated with mental health service use for adolescents with mild/moderate mental and behavior disorders. The ratio of students to mental health providers was not associated with overall service use, but was associated with sector of service use. Conclusions: School mental health resources, particularly those related to early identification, may facilitate mental health service use and may influence sector of service use for youths with DSM disorders.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Objective: Maternal antenatal anxiety is associated with an increased risk of behavioral disturbances in offspring. Recent work has suggested that the effect of maternal antenatal anxiety on infant temperament at 6 months is moderated by the serotonin transporter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR, with carriers of the short allele more susceptible to the adverse behavioral outcomes of maternal antenatal anxiety. These findings, however, are yet to be replicated and extended beyond infancy. The aim of the current study was to assess this same potential moderator (5-HTTLPR) in a large population-based cohort study, and to determine whether or not the effects persist into childhood and early adolescence. Method: Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC) cohort (N = 3,946) were used to assess whether the 5-HTTLPR genotype moderated the association between self-reported maternal antenatal anxiety (Crown Crisp Index) in pregnancy, and child temperament at 6 months (Infant Temperament Questionnaire), and also later behavioral and emotional problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire from age 4 to 13 years. Results: We found no evidence to suggest that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism moderated the effects of maternal antenatal anxiety on infant temperament at 6 months or infant behavioral and emotional problems from childhood through to adolescence. Conclusion: Our results, based on a large prospective community sample that assessed children from infancy to early adolescence, provide a thorough test of, but no evidence for, a genetic moderation of the effects of maternal antenatal anxiety by 5-HTTLPR.

AB Recent functional connectivity studies have demonstrated that in resting humans, activity in a dorsally-situated neocortical network is inversely associated with activity in the amygdalae. Similarly, in human neuroimaging studies, aspects of emotion regulation have been associated with increased activity in dorsolateral, dorsomedial, orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions, as well as concomitant decreases in amygdalar activity. These findings indicate the presence of two countervailing systems in the human brain that are reciprocally related: a dorsally-situated cognitive control network, and a ventrally-situated limbic network We investigated the extent to which this functional reciprocity between limbic and dorsal neocortical regions is recapitulated from a purely structural standpoint. Specifically, we hypothesized that amygdalar volume would be related to cerebral cortical thickness in cortical regions implicated in aspects of emotion regulation. In 297 typically developing youths (162 females, 135 males; 572 MRIs), the relationship between cortical thickness and amygdalar volume was characterized. Amygdalar volume was found to be inversely associated with thickness in bilateral dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal, inferior parietal, as well as bilateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Our findings are in line with previous work demonstrating that a predominantly dorsally-centered neocortical network is reciprocally related to core limbic structures such as the amygdalae. Future research may benefit from investigating the extent to which such cortical-limbic morphometric relations are qualified by the presence of mood and anxiety psychopathology.

ID CONDUCT DISORDER; CHILDREN; VALIDATION; CONFLICT
AB Background: Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterised as a recurrent pattern of defiant behaviour towards authority figures, irritability and difficulties in regulating emotions. ODD in adolescents presents similar symptomatology to borderline personality disorder (BPD). A treatment programme that has been shown to be effective for treating problems related to emotion dysregulation such as BPD is dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT). The aim of this article is to outline a case series in which we applied DBT to two adolescents diagnosed with ODD, in addition to psychiatric comorbidity and parasuicidal behaviours. Method: We applied a training programme of 24 sessions in DBT skills, along with individual therapy. Results: The results showed a decrease in impulsive behaviours, maladaptive behaviours to regulate affect, self-mutilation behaviour, number of hospitalisations, anger and depressive symptoms. The data also showed an increase in positive emotions. Conclusion: These results suggest that DBT can be an alternative for the treatment of ODD in adolescents with psychiatric comorbidity and parasuicidal behaviours.

AB The current study explored the differential roles of dimensions of body image (i.e., affective, cognitive, and behavioral) among a sample of 101 young adults (72.3% female, M=19.45; S.D.=1.28) who reported having engaged in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and a matched comparison group of young adults who did not. A mediational model of NSSI was tested, based on the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation would mediate the relationship between dimensions of body image and engagement in NSSI. Preliminary examination of the variables revealed that negative attitudes, suicide-related rumination, and behavioral practices associated with physical appearance significantly differentiated young adults who reported having engaged in NSSI and those who did not, regardless of gender. Path analytic modeling provided partial support for the proposed mediational model, with significant direct and indirect effects between dimensions of body image and NSSI through emotion dysregulation. Discussion focuses on the importance of understanding the differential roles of dimensions of body image and emotion dysregulation as intrapersonal risk factors related to NSSI engagement.

AB Objective: This study aimed to compare situational and trait anxiety levels in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) with that in healthy controls and to investigate their correlation to the perceived health status.
   Patients and methods: From November 2007 to December 2009 in total 879 patients (405 female, 15-71 years) with various CHD and 40 healthy controls completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess state and trait anxiety, the depression scaling instrument CES-D, and the health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36.
   Results: In patients with CHD no increased anxiety as a trait could be found (Mann-Whitney Utest, p=.186). Only situational anxiety in the setting of an outpatient department in a tertiary center was increased compared to healthy controls (Mann-Whitney U test, p=.004). Anxiety was closely related to depression and to all of the nine SF-36 dimensions (r=-.149 to r=-.745, p<.001).
   Conclusions: In general, patients with CHD show a rather normal anxiety pattern compared to healthy controls. These symptoms of anxiety were strongly correlated with the perceived health status. Only situational anxiety levels at the hospital are increased and still remain an important challenge for doctors and psychologists. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: While homelessness among youth is a serious problem, there is little information about evidence-based interventions for homeless youth. In cooperation with professionals and youths, Wolf (2012) developed Houvast (Dutch for 'grip'): a strengths based method grounded in scientific and practice evidence. The main aim of Houvast is to improve the quality of life of homeless youths by focusing on their strengths, thus stimulating their capacity for autonomy and self-reliance.
   Method/Design: The effectiveness and fidelity of Houvast will be tested in ten Dutch services for homeless youth which are randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 5), or a control group which provides care as usual (n = 5). Measurements of both objective and subjective quality of life and secondary outcomes (mental and physical health, substance use, coping, resilience, psychological needs, care needs, working relationship with the professional and attainment of personal goals) will be conducted among homeless youths (n = 251). Youths in both groups will be interviewed by means of a structured interview at baseline, at time of ending care or after having received care for six months (T1) and at nine months after baseline (T2). Model fidelity will be tested around T1.
   Discussion: This study is unique as it includes a large number of homeless youths who are followed for a period of nine months, and because it focuses on a strengths based approach. If the Houvast method proves to be effective in improving quality of life it will be the first evidence-based intervention for homeless youth.

AB The aim of this study was to validate a Spanish version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-S), originally developed by Garnefski, Kraaij, and Spinhoven. To date, it is the only available instrument that permits a conceptually pure quantification of cognitive strategies of emotional regulation. A sample of 615 students (25% men; 75% women) completed the CERQ-S. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that, as in the original version, a nine-factor model also explained the data collected with the Spanish version. However, an alternative model that integrates the nine dimensions in two second-order factors shows appropriate global fit indices and has interesting implications. Likewise, the results of the present study are comparable with those obtained in previous work with measures of depression, anxiety, and anger, and increase support for the validity of this instrument for assessing normalized affective states.

AB Purpose: Symptoms of depression are common in children and adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but information about underlying developmental factors is limited. Depression is often linked to aspects of emotional functioning such as coping strategies, but in children with ASD difficulties with social interactions are also a likely contributor to depressive symptoms.
   Methodology: We examined several aspects of emotional coping (approach, avoidant, maladaptive) and social functioning (victimization, negative friendship interactions) and their relation to depression symptoms in children with ASD (N=63) and typically developing (TD) peers (N=57). Children completed a battery of self-report questionnaires.
   Results: Less approach and avoidant, but more maladaptive coping strategies, and poor social functioning were uniquely associated with more symptoms of depression in children with ASD. Only less approach and more maladaptive coping were uniquely associated with depression severity in TO boys.
   Conclusions: Unlike TD boys, boys with ASD who report using avoidant strategies to deal with stressful situations report fewer symptoms of depression, suggesting that this may be an adaptive emotion regulation strategy. However, understanding the role of over-arousal in this process, inferences about long-term effects of this strategy, its causality and direction of effects will require additional research.

AB Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a comprehensive psychosocial treatment originally designed for individuals meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the principles and techniques of DBT for BPD, summarize current research, and discuss the implications for psychologists who wish to implement DBT. The four modes in DBT (individual therapy, skills training, as-needed consultation between sessions, and therapist consultation meetings) are reviewed. The three overarching theories that guide and help organize DBT treatment (biosocial theory, behavioral theory, and dialectical philosophy) are also summarized. DBT has been the subject of much research and has been adapted for different settings, disorders, and populations, including substance abuse and BPD, eating disorders, treatment-resistant depression, ADHD, and forensic settings. This research is critically reviewed. Finally, we examine the implications and applications for practicing psychologists who seek training in DBT and work in independent practice.

AB Preterm birth (PT) and low birthweight (LBW) are risk factors for cognitive, academic, and behavioral difficulties. Executive functioning, which is an umbrella term encompassing higher-order problem-solving and goal-oriented abilities, may help to understand these impairments. This review article examines executive functioning in PT and LBW children, with a specific focus on adolescence and the functional consequences of executive dysfunction in this age group. We have focused on adolescence as it is a critical period for brain, cognitive and social-emotional development, and a period of increased autonomy, independence and reliance on executive functioning. While more longitudinal research is required, there is evidence demonstrating that the PT/LBW population is at increased risk for impairments across all executive domains. Emerging evidence also suggests that executive dysfunction may partly explain poorer academic and social-emotional competence in PT/LBW adolescents. In conclusion, PT/LBW adolescents exhibit poorer executive functioning, and close surveillance is recommended for high-risk individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines adolescents' coping styles, with relation to their gender and age and level, of six types of problems. The participants were 1843 adolescents (51.7% female and 48.3% male) from the Sultanate of Oman with a mean age of 15.75. Two scales examining general adaptive and maladaptive coping styles and levels of school, economic, personal, health, family, and emotional problems were administered. The findings showed that adolescents' high levels of perceived problems were associated with higher levels of maladaptive coping styles than those with low levels of problems. Furthermore, female adolescents seem to use maladaptive coping styles (across all levels of the six types of problems) more than males. The use of adaptive and maladaptive coping styles increase with age. (C) 2012 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anxiety disorders are prevalent in children with epilepsy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, adaptability, and feasibility of a manual-based, computer-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety disorders in children with epilepsy. Fifteen anxious youth (aged 8-13 years) with epilepsy completed 12 weeks of manualized computer-assisted CDT. The children and parents completed a semi-structured interview at baseline, and questionnaires assessing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and behavior problems were completed prior to treatment, at treatment midpoint, after treatment completion, and at three months posttreatment. There were significant reductions in the symptoms of anxiety and depression reported by the children at completion of the intervention and at the three-month follow-up. Similarly, the parents reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and a reduction in behavior problems. No adverse events were reported. This CBT intervention for children with epilepsy and anxiety disorders appears to be safe, effective, and feasible and should be incorporated into future intervention studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Difficulties in emotion regulation are one of the core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Individuals with BPD also report higher levels of experiential avoidance (EA) compared to controls. These constructs have never been studied concomitantly in adolescents. First, given the conceptual similarity of difficulties in emotion regulation and EA, the authors sought to determine whether EA provides incremental validity, above emotion dysregulation, in its association with borderline features. Second, EA was explored as a mediator in the relation between difficulties in emotion regulation and borderline features. The sample included 208 adolescents recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit (M-age = 15.96, SD = 1.39; females = 60.1%). Borderline personality features were assessed using the self-report Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children (Crick, Murray-Close, & Woods, 2005). EA was assessed using the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (Greco, Lambert, & Baer, 2008), and difficulties in emotion regulation were assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004). Greater borderline personality features were associated with significantly higher levels of EA and difficulties in emotion regulation. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that EA made a small, but significant, incremental and independent contribution to borderline features when added to a model already including difficulties in emotion regulation. In addition, EA partially mediated the relation between difficulties in emotion regulation and borderline features. EA and emotion regulation are both important targets of treatments aimed at decreasing borderline personality features in adolescents.

AB The Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ, Wells and Davies in Behav Res Therapy, 32, pp 871-878, 1994) measures individual differences in thought suppression strategies. This study describes the development and psychometric properties of an adolescent version of the questionnaire. Pilot studies were conducted to make some of the items more accessible to young people while still retaining the meaning of the original items. The adolescent version of the questionnaire and measures of emotional disorder were then administered to 589 school pupils aged 13-17 years. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded mixed results with only partial support for a five factor solution. Subsequently exploratory factor analysis did suggest a five factor structure that was the same as the original TCQ with the only difference being two fewer items. The five factors were distraction, social control, worry, punishment and reappraisal. The TCQ-A showed good internal consistency and evidence of stability over time. Scores on the worry and punishment subscales were positively correlated with measures of emotional symptoms. These data provided initial support for the psychometric properties of the TCQ-A and extend findings suggesting worry and punishment strategies are associated with psychological vulnerability.

AB The majority of studies examining associations between clinical-diagnostic and empirical-quantitative approaches have concentrated only on the target diagnosis without taking into account any possible co-variation of psychopathological traits, which is intrinsic to child psychopathology. The ability of child behaviour checklist (CBCL) DSM-oriented scales (DOSs) to predict target and other DSM diagnoses, taking into consideration the covariation of psychopathological traits, was analysed by logistic regression analysis. Corresponding odds ratio (OR) was used as indicator of the strength of the relationship between the clinical score in DOSs and the presence of DSM-IV diagnoses. Logistic regression allowed us to consider multiple scales simultaneously, thus addressing the problem of co-occurrence of psychopathological traits, and to include gender and age as covariates. The sample consisted of 360 children and adolescents aged 6-16 years, consecutively referred for behavioural and emotional problems. As a whole, the CBCL DOSs seem to be more specific but with a weaker association with DSM-IV diagnoses than syndrome scales, and with some distinctive features: clinical scores in the anxiety DOS suggest a diagnosis of both anxiety and mood disorder; clinical scores in the somatic problems DOS are very strong and specific predictors for diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder; clinical scores in the oppositional defiant problems DOS are not only predictors of the oppositional defiant disorder but are also strong predictors of generalized anxiety disorder; clinical scores in the conduct problems DOS are a specific and strong predictor for oppositional defiant disorder. Results confirm the clinical usefulness of CBCL and suggest using both syndrome and DOS scales for a complete and accurate assessment of children and adolescents.

ID EMOTION REGULATION; BISEXUAL YOUTHS; MENTAL-HEALTH; COLLEGE-STUDENTS;

AB Purpose: Previous studies have found that sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual) adolescents are at higher risk of substance use than heterosexuals, but few have examined how changes in sexual orientation over time may relate to substance use. We examined the associations between change in sexual orientation identity and marijuana use, tobacco use, and binge drinking in U. S. youth.
   Methods: Prospective data from 10,515 U.S. youth ages 12-27 years in a longitudinal cohort study were analyzed using sexual orientation identity mobility measure M (frequency of change from 0 [no change] to 1 [change at every wave]) in up to five waves of data. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate substance use risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals; interactions by sex and age group were assessed.
   Results: All substance use behaviors varied significantly by sexual orientation. Sexual minorities were at higher risk for all outcomes, excluding binge drinking in males, and mobility score was positively associated with substance use in most cases (p < .05). The association between mobility and substance use remained significant after adjusting for current sexual orientation and varied by sex and age for selected substance use behaviors. This association had a higher positive magnitude in females than males and in adolescents than young adults.
   Conclusions: In both clinical and research settings it is important to assess history of sexual orientation changes. Changes in reported sexual orientation over time may be as important as current sexual orientation for understanding adolescent substance use risk.

AB Children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are at an increased risk of developing emotional problems. This study evaluated the associations between levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in these children.
   Sixty-seven children with JIA, together with one parent, participated. Anxiety symptoms were identified using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders Questionnaire (SCARED), while depressive symptoms were identified using the Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (MFQ). The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) was used for HRQOL assessments. Using hierarchical multiple-regression analysis, demographics, clinical factors, and pain were control variables, while anxiety (the SCARED score) and depressive symptoms (the MFQ score) were HRQOL (the PedsQL score) predictors.
   The regression model emerged with specified variables explaining 63 % of the variance in the PedsQL score (F = 11.92, p < 0.01) among children. Among parents, the same set of variables accounted for 49 % the variance (F = 6.99, p < 0.01). The MFQ score, but not the SCARED, added most to the variance.
   Depressive symptoms, but not anxiety, accounted for substantial variability in levels of HRQOL when considered with demographics, clinical factors, and pain. Thus, screening for depression needs to be considered as a part of multimodal assessment and treatment approaches in JIA.

AB To evaluate caregiver-reported psychosocial adjustment and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of Taiwanese children with newly diagnosed cancer and their caregivers during the first 6 months of treatment.
   Caregivers of 89 newly diagnosed children completed the child behavior checklist, the pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL((TM)) 4.0), the Parenting Stress Index, and the SF-36 questionnaire at diagnosis, and again 3 and 6 months into treatment. They were compared with a group of age- and sex-matched controls from general community.
   Significantly worse HrQoL in both children and their caregivers and greater parenting stress were noted in the cancer group than the controls during the first 6 months. Children with cancer were found to have significantly more internalizing behavioral problems and somatic complaints, especially those younger than 12 years old. After starting chemotherapy, significant decrease in parenting stress and improvements of both caregivers and children's HrQoL were noted within the first 6 months, although not to the level comparable with normal controls.
   Although children and their caregivers can adjust themselves gradually during the first 6 months after diagnosis of cancer, intervention and efforts aimed at reducing their distress and promoting adjustments are still required during this period.

AB We sought to explore the differential associations of callous-unemotional (CU) traits, narcissistic traits, and Machiavellian traits with overt aggression, relational aggression, delinquency, behavioral dysregulation, and emotional dysregulation in a community sample of boys and girls (ages 11-17). Results indicated that the three personality traits were significantly correlated with each other, yet distinct. CU traits, narcissistic traits, and Machiavellian traits demonstrated different unique associations with behavior problems. Specifically, narcissistic traits showed the strongest unique associations with overt aggression, relational aggression, behavioral dysregulation, and emotional dysregulation. CU traits showed the second strongest unique associations with overt aggression, delinquency and behavioral dysregulation, but were not associated with relational aggression or emotional dysregulation. Lastly, Machiavellian traits showed a strong unique association with emotional dysregulation, but were not uniquely associated with externalizing behavior problems. These findings have implications for intervention with aggressive and antisocial youth.

AB This study investigated relationships between attachment insecurity, maladaptive cognitive schemas, and various types of psychopathological symptoms in a sample of clinically referred adolescents (N = 82). A mediation model was tested in which maladaptive schemas operated as mediators in the relations between indices of attachment quality and conduct, peer, and emotional problems. Results revealed partial support for the hypothesized mediation effect: the schema domain of disconnection/rejection acted as a mediator in the links between insecure attachment and peer problems and emotional problems. Further analysis of these effects revealed that different types of maladaptive schemas were involved in both types of psychopathology. Altogether, findings suggest that treatment of adolescent psychological problems may need to target the improvement of attachment relationships with peers and parents and the correction of underlying cognitive schemas.

AB Importance: Both bullies and victims of bullying are at risk for psychiatric problems in childhood, but it is unclear if this elevated risk extends into early adulthood.
   Objective: To test whether bullying and/or being bullied in childhood predicts psychiatric problems and suicidality in young adulthood after accounting for childhood psychiatric problems and family hardships.
   Design: Prospective, population-based study.
   Setting: Community sample from 11 counties in Western North Carolina.
   Participants: A total of 1420 participants who had being bullied and bullying assessed 4 to 6 times between the ages of 9 and 16 years. Participants were categorized as bullies only, victims only, bullies and victims (hereafter referred to as bullies/victims), or neither.
   Main Outcome Measure: Psychiatric outcomes, which included depression, anxiety, antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorders, and suicidality (including recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or a suicide attempt), were assessed in young adulthood (19, 21, and 24-26 years) by use of structured diagnostic interviews.
   Results: Victims and bullies/victims had elevated rates of young adult psychiatric disorders, but also elevated rates of childhood psychiatric disorders and family hardships. After controlling for childhood psychiatric problems or family hardships, we found that victims continued to have a higher prevalence of agoraphobia (odds ratio [OR], 4.6 [95% CI, 1.7-12.5]; P<.01), generalized anxiety (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.1-6.3]; P<.001), and panic disorder (OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.5-6.5]; P<.01) and that bullies/victims were at increased risk of young adult depression (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.2-19.4]; P<.05), panic disorder (OR, 14.5 [95% CI, 5.7-36.6]; P<.001), agoraphobia (females only; OR, 26.7 [95% CI, 4.3-52.5]; P<.001), and suicidality (males only; OR, 18.5 [95% CI, 6.2-55.1]; P<.001). Bullies were at risk for antisocial personality disorder only (OR, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.1-15.8]; P<.04).
   Conclusions and Relevance: The effects of being bullied are direct, pleiotropic, and long-lasting, with the worst effects for those who are both victims and bullies.

AB Purpose: To investigate the extent to which nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) contributes to later suicide thoughts and behaviors (STB) independent of shared risk factors.
   Methods: One thousand four hundred and sixty-six students at five U.S. colleges participated in a longitudinal study of the relationship between NSSI and suicide. NSSI, suicide history, and common risk/protective factors were assessed annually for three years. Analyses tested the hypotheses that the practice of NSSI prior to STB and suicide behavior (excluding ideation) reduced inhibition to later STB independent of shared risk factors. Analyses also examined factors that predicted subsequent STB among individuals with NSSI history.
   Results: History of NSSI did significantly predict concurrent or later STB (AOR 2.8, 95%, CI 1.9-4.1) independent of covariates common to both. Among those with prior or concurrent NSSI, risk of STB is predicted by > 20 lifetime NSSI incidents (AOR 3.8, 95% CI, 1.4-10.3) and history of mental health treatment (AOR 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-4.6). Risk of moving from NSSI to STB is decreased by presence of meaning in life (AOR.6, 95% CI, .5-.7) and reporting parents as confidants (AOR,.3, 95% CI,.1-.9).
   Conclusions: NSSI prior to suicide behavior serves as a "gateway" behavior for suicide and may reduce inhibition through habituation to self-injury. Treatments focusing on enhancing perceived meaning in life and building positive relationships with others, particularly parents, may be particularly effective in reducing suicide risk among youth with a history of NSSI.

AB The main aim of this study was to examine the extent to which affective and cognitive empathy were associated with reactive and proactive aggression, and whether these associations differed between children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. The study included 133 children (67 ASD, 66 TD, Mage = 139 months), who filled out self-report questionnaires. The main findings showed that the association between reactive aggression and affective empathy was negative in TD children, but positive in children with ASD. The outcomes support the idea that a combination of poor emotion regulation and impaired understanding of others' emotions is associated with aggressive behavior in children with ASD.

AB Chronic victimization negatively affects mental health, making it crucial to understand the key predictive social health (e.g., loneliness, isolation) factors. Evidence suggests that the effects of victimization are worse over the transition from primary to secondary school. Longitudinal data from 1810 students transitioning were used to identify victimization trajectory groups, classified as low increasing, low stable, medium stable, and not bullied. Adolescents with poorer social health were more likely to be in the increasing and stable victimized group than in the not bullied group. Students in the low increasing victimized group had poorer mental health outcomes than those in the stable and not bullied groups. The results of this study have important implications for the type and timing of school-based interventions aimed at reducing victimization and the harms caused by long-term exposure.

AB Background: Obesity among young children in Hong Kong has become a public health problem. This study explored associations between Chinese parent reported children's quality of life (QoL), socio-demographics and young children's weight status from 27 preschool settings.
   Methods: A mixed-method approach, including quantitative and qualitative tools, was employed for this cross-sectional study. Quantitative data were collected from 336 Chinese parents of children aged 2-7 years. Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL, v 4.0) and a questionnaire about parents' socio-demographics were used. In-depth interviews with mothers, teachers and children from a larger sample were the basis of 10 case studies. Quantitative data were analysed using chi-square analysis, one-way ANOVA and logistic regression. Qualitative data were analysed according to a multi-level framework that established linkages with quantitative data.
   Results: The children's Body Mass Index (BMI) ranged from 11.3 to 28.0 kg/m(2) and was classified into four weight groups. ANOVAs showed that the normal-weight children had significantly higher PedsQL scores in Physical Functioning than obese children (mean difference = 14.19, p < .0083) and significantly higher scores in School Functioning than overweight children (mean difference = 10.15, p < .0083). Results of logistic regression showed that relative to normal-weight children, obese children had a 2-5 times higher odds of showing problems in Physical, Social Functioning and School Performance. Overweight children had 2 times higher odds of problems in Social Functioning, and underweight children had a 2 times higher odds of problems in Physical Functioning. Children's age (chi(2) = 21.71, df = 3, p < 0.01), and housing (chi(2) = 33.00, df = 9, p < 0.01) were associated with their weight. The case studies further act as a supplement to the quantitative data that children showed emotional problems across different abnormal weight statues; and the association between children's weight status and well-being might be affected by multiple childcare arrangements and familial immigration status.
   Conclusions: This study is one of only a few studies that have examined parents', teachers' and young children's own perceptions of the children's quality of life across different weight statuses. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for intervention.

AB Data were collected from 40 youth and 37 caregivers, which represented 57 distinct youth and 20 youth-caregiver dyads to measure the level of agreement between youth self-report and their caregivers on a variety of topics. Topics included: the youth's past placements, service use and needs, experiences in the child welfare system, and the youth's emotional problems and social behaviors. Results indicated high agreement between youth and caregiver proxy related to placement history, service use, the restrictiveness of the current environment, and community safety; results indicated low levels of agreement for youth emotional difficulties and prosocial behaviors. Qualitative data were used to further identify some of the differences noted. Overall, the findings support prior research that shows higher agreement within youth-caregiver dyads for objective measures as opposed to subjective and private ones. Implications for future research are discussed, and methodological challenges related to this study are identified.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the development and interplay of emotional stability and affective self-regulatory efficacy beliefs through adolescence to young adulthood. A latent growth curve approach was used to investigate level and stability of emotional stability and self-efficacy in managing negative emotions and in expressing positive emotions. We found that initial levels of emotional stability and self-efficacy beliefs are highly correlated. In accordance with the posited hypothesis, the growth rate of perceived self-efficacy in managing negative emotions predicted the growth rate of emotional stability, whereas the opposite path was not significant. The growth rates of perceived self-efficacy in expressing positive emotions and emotional stability were not related to each other. Taken together, these findings point to self-efficacy beliefs as instrumental to the change of traits. Practical implications of results are discussed, highlighting the role of social cognitive theory in supplying the proper strategies to design effective interventions to enable people to make the best use of their potentials.

AB We used population sample data from 25 societies to answer the following questions: (a) How consistently across societies do adolescents report more problems than their parents report about them? (b) Do levels of parentadolescent agreement vary among societies for different kinds of problems? (c) How well do parents and adolescents in different societies agree on problem item ratings? (d) How much do parentadolescent dyads within each society vary in agreement on item ratings? (e) How well do parentadolescent dyads within each society agree on the adolescent's deviance status? We used five methods to test cross-informant agreement for ratings obtained from 27,861 adolescents ages 11 to 18 and their parents. Youth Self-Report (YSR) mean scores were significantly higher than Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) mean scores for all problem scales in almost all societies, but the magnitude of the YSRCBCL discrepancy varied across societies. Cross-informant correlations for problem scale scores varied more across societies than across types of problems. Across societies, parents and adolescents tended to rate the same items as low, medium, or high, but within-dyad parentadolescent item agreement varied widely in every society. In all societies, both parental noncorroboration of self-reported deviance and adolescent noncorroboration of parent-reported deviance were common. Results indicated many multicultural consistencies but also some important differences in parentadolescent cross-informant agreement. Our findings provide valuable normative baselines against which to compare multicultural findings for clinical samples.

AB Background Early relationships are crucial to human brain maturation, well-being, affect regulation and self-other schema. Shame traumatic memories are related to psychopathology, and recent research has shown that the quality and type of attachment relationships may be crucial in shame traumatic memories in relation to psychopathology. The current study explores a mediator model of emotion regulation processes (rumination, thought suppression and dissociation) on the association between shame traumatic memory, with attachment figures and with others, and depressive symptoms. Method Ninety subjects from the general community population completed the Shame Experiences Interview (SEI), assessing shame experiences from childhood and adolescence, and a battery of self-report scales measuring shame traumatic memory, rumination, thought suppression, dissociation and depression. Results Mediator analyses show that emotion regulation processes, such as brooding, thought suppression and dissociation, mediate the association between shame traumatic memory with others and depression. In contrast, shame traumatic memory with attachment figures has a direct effect on depression, not mediated by emotion regulation processes, with only brooding partially mediating this relation. Conclusion The current findings shed light on the importance of attachment figures on the structuring of shame traumatic memories and on their impact on psychopathological symptoms, adding to recent neuroscience research and Gilbert's approach on shame and compassion. In addition, our results emphasize the relevance of addressing shame memories, mainly those that involve attachment figures, particularly when working with patients suffering from depressive symptoms and/or that find compassion difficult or scary. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The quality of attachment relationships is important in how shame memories are structured and in their relation to psychopathology. The relationship between shame traumatic memory with attachment figures and depressive symptoms is not mediated by emotion regulation processes (rumination, thought suppression and dissociation). In contrast, these processes emerge as mediators on the association between shame traumatic memory with others and depression. For people suffering from depressive symptoms, having been shamed by an attachment figure may be a major block to develop self-compassion and receive compassion from others and may constitute an important obstacle to recovery. When working with patients suffering from depressive symptoms and/or that find compassion difficult or scary, it is important to target shame memories, especially those that involve attachment figures. In therapy with individuals with depressive symptoms and who reveal shame traumatic memories involving others, it may not only be pertinent to target these memories but also to evaluate and intervene on emotion regulation processes, particularly rumination, thought suppression and dissociation.

AB The present study examined the longitudinal relations between psychopathology and social competence in a sample of 115 Chinese children during the transition to preschool initiated in their third year of life. Social competence was assessed by maternal reports at three months after preschool entry (T1) and at the end of the first (T2) and second (T3) preschool years. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed by maternal reports at T1 and T2. The results showed that T1 externalizing predicted rank-order decreases in social competence from T2 to T3. T1 Internalizing predicted rank-order decreases in social competence from T1 to T2 but growth of competence from T1 to T3 and rank-order increases in competence from T2 to T3. Rank-order decreases in internalizing from T1 to T2 also predicted rank-order increases in social competence from T2 to T3. These longitudinal relations held across gender and proved robust to the inclusion of broad individual and family process variables as covariates. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background. The diagnosis of personality disorders in adolescents has been a topic of debate in recent years. Method. This manuscript reviews the case of an adolescent girl admitted for a medium length combined inpatient and partial hospitalization program. This program has developed protocols to assess for Axis I and II pathology as well as various psychological processes. Comprehensive outcome measures were administered to the patient at discharge and follow-up. Results/Conclusions. Diagnosis of a personality disorder in adolescence appears to be associated with psychological processes usually identified in adults. Against the background of an emerging debate about the need to reform a culture of ultra-short inpatient care, this case study provides some support for more thorough assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of adolescents who appear to have comorbid Axis I and II disorders.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to determine changes in behaviour among patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by different informants during treatment in the clinical setting.
   Methods Seventy-nine patients with ADHD were recruited. They completed 12-months of treatment with oral short-acting methylphenidate, two-to-three times per day, at a dose of 0.3-1.0 mg/kg. Among the 79 patients (mean age, 9.1 +/- 1.9 years), 39 were classified as the ADHD-C/H type (hyperactive-impulsive type and combined type) and 40 as the ADHD-I type (inattentive type). At baseline, and after 12 months; their behaviour was assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form (TRF), ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S).
   Results Patients classified as the ADHD-C/H type had higher scores on three CBCL subscales, on the ADHD-RS and CGI-S compared to the ADHD-I type patients. After 12-months of treatment, for all patients, there were significant improvements in the four subscales of the TRF as well as the ADHD-RS and CGI-S scores, but not on the CBCL. In addition, the patients with the ADHD-C/H type had greater improvements on the four subscales of the TRF after treatment. However, there were no differences noted on the CBCL, ADHD-RS and CGI-S.
   Conclusion The results of this study showed that during treatment, in the clinical setting, there are different assessments of behaviour symptoms, associated with ADHD, reported by different informants. Assessments of behaviour profiles from multiple informants are crucial for establishing a fuller picture of patients with ADHD. Psychiatry Investig 2013;10:1-7

AB The Assessment Checklist for Adolescents - ACA is a 105-item carer-report mental health rating scale, measuring behaviours, emotional states, traits, and manners of relating to others, as manifested by adolescents (ages 12 to 17) residing in various types of alternate care, as well as those adopted from care. The ACA was designed for population and clinical research with these young people, and for use as a clinical assessment measure. The ACA's content was largely derived from the Assessment Checklist for Children (ACC). Fifteen ACC items were modified to better reflect adolescent difficulties, and 25 additional items were derived using a combination of inductive and deductive strategies. Item and factor analyses were carried out on scores from a 136-item research instrument, obtained for 230 young people residing in long-term care (as part of the NSW Children in Care study). These data were supplemented by ACC scores obtained for 142 adolescents residing in treatment foster care in Ontario, Canada. A robust 7-factor model was identified among a core of 73 clinical item scores, accounting for 51% of score variance. Four of the factors replicate ACC clinical scales (non-reciprocal interpersonal behaviour; sexual behaviour problems; food maintenance behaviour; and suicide discourse), and three are unique to the ACA (social instability/behavioural dysregulation; emotional dysregulation/distorted social cognition; and dissociation/trauma symptoms). The ACA also contains two empirically-derived low self-esteem scales (low confidence; negative self-image) that are shared with the ACC. Initial data indicate that the ACA has good content, construct and criterion-related validity, as well as high internal reliability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally developed for chronically suicidal adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and emotion dysregulation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate DBT is associated with improvements in problem behaviors, including suicide ideation and behavior, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), attrition, and hospitalization. Positive outcomes with adults have prompted researchers to adapt DBT for adolescents. Given this interest in DBT for adolescents, it is important to review the theoretical rationale and the evidence base for this treatment and its adaptations. A solid theoretical foundation allows for adequate evaluation of content, structural, and developmental adaptations and provides a framework for understanding which symptoms or behaviors are expected to improve with treatment and why. We first summarize the adult DBT literature, including theory, treatment structure and content, and outcome research. Then, we review theoretical underpinnings, adaptations, and outcomes of DBT for adolescents. DBT has been adapted for adolescents with various psychiatric disorders (i.e., BPD, mood disorders, externalizing disorders, eating disorders, trichotillomania) and problem behaviors (i.e., suicide ideation and behavior, NSSI) across several settings (i.e., outpatient, day program, inpatient, residential, correctional facility). The rationale for using DBT with these adolescents rests in the common underlying dysfunction in emotion regulation among the aforementioned disorders and problem behaviors. Thus, the theoretical underpinnings of DBT suggest that this treatment is likely to be beneficial for adolescents with a broad array of emotion regulation difficulties, particularly underregulation of emotion resulting in behavioral excess. Results from open and quasi-experimental adolescent studies are promising; however, RCTs are sorely needed.

AB Children with tics often experience accompanying problems that may have more impact on their well being and quality of life than the tics themselves. The present study investigates characteristics and the course of associated problems. In a population-based follow-up study, we investigated the developmental trajectory of children with and without tics when they were 7-9 years old. Parents and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the children were 7-9 years (wave 1) and 4 years later (wave 2). Using strict criteria, we identified 38 children with tics in the cohort of 4,025 children (0.94 % of the total cohort) with a preponderance of boys (78.9 %). 22 children (57.9 %) in the group with tics had only motor tics, and 16 (42.1 %) had both motor and vocal tics. Children with tics had significantly higher parent- and teacher-rated SDQ total difficulty scores and subscale scores in both waves. Children with tics experienced an increase in emotional problems and in peer problems between the first and the second wave. This study in a general population indicates that the presence of tics is associated with a range of internalizing and externalizing difficulties, as well as problems in peer relationships. Moreover, our study indicates that emotional and peer problems tend to increase over time in the group of children with tics.

AB Research with violent offenders and delinquent adolescents suggests that endogenous testosterone concentrations have the strongest positive correlations with violence among men who have low concentrations of cortisol. The present study tested the hypothesis that testosterone and cortisol would similarly interact to determine neural activation in regions supporting self-regulation in response to anger provocation. Nineteen healthy Asian male participants were insulted and asked to control their anger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). When cortisol levels were low, testosterone positively correlated with activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and thalamus, but not when cortisol levels were high. During induced anger control, functional connectivity was increased between the amygdala and a top-down prefrontal cortical control network. Moreover, the amygdala-PFC connectivity was strongest among those high in testosterone and low in cortisol. This research highlights a possible neural mechanism by which testosterone and cortisol may influence anger control.

AB Aims. Adolescence is a critical transition phase between childhood and adulthood, when the burden of mental disorder may still be prevented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the continuity and discontinuity of behavioural problems in adolescence while taking into account the multiple co-variation of psychopathological traits and the complex role of recent stressful life events (SLEs).
   Methods. This is a 5-year follow-up investigation of emotional and behavioural problems assessed by the newly developed Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) DSM-Oriented Scales (DOSs) in 420 general population subjects aged 15-19 years.
   Results. The DOSs showed good stability, even when multiple co-variation was taken into account. Longitudinal data showed that homotypic evolution of psychopathology was to be expected in the first place. Equifinality and multifinality were also found. Oppositional Defiant Problems emerged to be polyvalent predictors of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Furthermore, Oppositional Defiant Problems predicted more SLEs, which in turn predicted more Depression, Anxiety and Oppositional Defiant Problems. Mediational analyses confirmed the role of SLEs in partially accounting for the continuity of Oppositional Defiant Problems and for the heterotypic progression towards Affective Problems.
   Conclusions. These data underscore early adolescence behavioural problems as an important focus for primary and secondary intervention.

AB Adult attachment classification is traditionally based on qualitative coding of participants' discourse about their attachment history. Word count-based analyses have proven useful for assessing emotional states from narrative. To expand the understanding of how language is used in emotion regulation processes related to attachment, the authors assess 102 college-aged adults' language on the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Autonomous adults use more emotion words and, in particular, negative emotion words. Preoccupied adults use more anger words. Disorganized adults use more experientially connected language and more death/dying words, but also use more second-person pronouns when discussing loss. Language use during the AAI explains variability in self-reported emotional distress above and beyond attachment classifications. Results are discussed in terms of their relevance to emotion and attachment.

AB This research applies the emotion regulation (ER) model of attachment to the regulation of specific emotions, namely sadness and anger, in early adolescents. The study investigates how attachment and accompanying ER strategies relate to both internalizing and externalizing problems. Two separate cross-sectional studies (N = 197 and N = 310) supported different associations between attachment and ER (i.e., dysregulation and suppression). For attachment avoidance, associations with ER strategies seem to depend on the specific type of emotion involved, whereas attachment anxiety related to dysregulation irrespective of the type of emotions. Furthermore, Study 2 found that attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with internalizing and externalizing problems via different ER strategies. Discussion focuses on the dynamics involved in associations between attachment, ER, and psychological problems.

AB Objective: Several studies have used the Forms of Self-Criticism/Reassurance Scale (FSCRS; Gilbert, Clarke, Hempel, Miles, & Irons, 2004) when exploring the role of emotion regulation in psychopathology. However, psychometric evaluation of the FSCRS is limited. The present study sought to confirm the factor structure of the FSCRS based on theoretical and empirical grounds in a large sample of the general population. Method: The FSCRS was completed by a large sample of men and women (N= 1,570) as part of an online survey. The data were randomly split in order to perform both independent exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). One-, two- and three-factor solutions were examined. Results: A three-factor model of reassured-self (RS) and the two types of self-criticism, inadequate-self (IS), and hated-self (HS), proved to be the best-fitting measurement model in this sample (2= 800.3, df= 148, p < .001; CFI [comparative fit index]= .966, TLI [Tucker Lewis index]= .961, RMSEA [root mean square error of the approximation]= .074). Although very similar to the original questionnaire, there were some differences in terms of the items that were retained. Validity was confirmed with the shortened FSCRS showing the same associations with mood and sex as the original version of the FSCRS. Conclusion: A three-factor model (RS, IS and HS) provided the best-fitting structure and confirmed the separation of different types of self-criticism. Future research should explore the degree to which these separable aspects of self-criticism are theoretically and clinically meaningful and to identify the role of self-reassurance in ameliorating their effects. Practitioner Points Positive clinical implications center dot The current paper has established that the FSCRS consists of self-reassurance and two separable factors of self-criticism (inadequate-self and hated-self). center dot The current paper refined a measure to test the role of different kinds of self-criticism in the aetiology of psychopathology as well as evaluate outcomes following intervention. Cautions and limitations center dot The current study did not recruit a clinical sample and responses from a clinical group may have revealed a different factor solution. center dot A high percentage of the sample was classed as white' and female so the results of this study may not be representative of the general population.

AB This review puts forth a transdiagnostic lens through which to examine the oft-found comorbidity between anxiety and oppositional defiant disorder in children and adolescents. Children who experience these co-occurring disorders may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes. Our review begins with a broad examination of the comorbidity between anxiety and oppositionality and then highlights three underlying processes that characterize both anxiety and oppositionality: emotion regulation difficulties, information processing biases, and specific parenting practices. These underlying processes are then discussed within the context of developing a treatment to target these transdiagnostic processes for families with a child who experiences comorbid anxiety and oppositionality. Our review concludes with future directions for this emerging area of research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Many young women have turned to illness blogs to describe their lived experience with cancer. Blogs represent an untapped source of knowledge for researchers and clinicians. Objective: The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory study was to describe the life disruptions caused by cancer among young women, as well as to understand the facilitators and barriers in accessing healthcare services during and after active treatment. Methods: Sixteen Internet illness blogs were analyzed among women, aged between 20 and 39 years, diagnosed with cancer. These blogs were analyzed based on phenomenological qualitative methods and thematic analysis. Results: There were 4 dimensions of persistent problems that were articulated in the narratives of the young women without any relief. They included pain and fatigue, insurance and financial barriers, concerns related to fertility, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress and anxiety. Conclusion: The young women's narratives capture fear, uncertainty, anger, and the debilitating nature of these persistent issues. Many of the women expressed their lingering physical, psychosocial, and emotional problems. Implications for Practice: Online illness narratives are a naturalistic form of inquiry that allows nurses to understand the experience of the patient through their own words and accounts. This study provides a foundation for nursing-based interventions that transcend traditional clinic experiences.

AB The aim of the study was to experimentally examine the reactivity of mood and impulsivity to negative mood induction in adolescents with loss of control (LOC) eating and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The study included eighty-eight adolescents with LOC eating, ADHD symptoms, and control. Participants self-reported on mood and participated in a stop signal task before and after negative mood induction with Cyberball. Groups did not differ in impulsivity at baseline (p > .05). The LOC group presented with greater increase of negative mood than the ADHD group, and with greater increase of impulsivity than both other groups from pre- to post-Cyberball (p < .05). Stronger reactivity of negative mood and impulsivity in LOC eating corroborates findings in adults that the concepts' association might be specific to binge eating disorder. Additionally, findings add to previous results showing emotion regulation deficits in LOC eating. Future research should examine the concepts' impact on actual eating behavior including binge eating.

AB Objective: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) typically begins during adolescence and can persist into adulthood. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder remain unclear. Recent evidence from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) studies in adults suggests disruptions in amygdala-based circuitry; the present study examines this issue in adolescents with GAD. Method: Resting state fMRI scans were obtained from 15 adolescents with GAD and 20 adolescents without anxiety who were group matched on age, sex, scanner, and intelligence. Functional connectivity of the centromedial, basolateral, and superficial amygdala subdivisions was compared between groups. We also assessed the relationship between amygdala network dysfunction and anxiety severity. Results: Adolescents with GAD exhibited disruptions in amygdala-based intrinsic functional connectivity networks that included regions in medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and cerebellum. Positive correlations between anxiety severity scores and amygdala functional connectivity with insula and superior temporal gyrus were also observed within the GAD group. There was some evidence of greater overlap (less differentiation of connectivity patterns) of the right basolateral and centromedial amygdala networks in the adolescents with, relative to those without, GAD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that adolescents with GAD manifest alterations in amygdala circuits involved in emotion processing, similar to findings in adults. In addition, disruptions were observed in amygdala-based networks involved in fear processing and the coding of interoceptive states. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry; 2013; 52(3):290-299.

AB Longitudinal studies of biological domains in bipolar disorder (BD) are crucial in determining if such baseline changes are progressive. We reviewed reported studies of longitudinal brain structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological changes in BD through November 2012. Longitudinal brain structural MRI studies suggest cortical and subcortical abnormalities within networks subserving emotional regulation. There is evidence of neuroprogressive loss of gray matter volume in prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex and the subgenual region, with less consistent findings in temporal and subcortical regions. Abnormal amygdala neurodevelopment is noted in adolescent onset BD and possible changes in hippocampus require further evaluation. The fewer reported longitudinal functional MRI studies suggest neurobiological changes in activation patterns involving fronto-limbic circuitry which relate to different illness phase and mood states. Early onset pediatric/adolescent BD may signify a more malignant course of illness in which extensive and executive neurocognitive deficits are found early and may persist, with some potential for improvement during remission and perhaps with treatment. Future studies should include larger samples, combine investigational modalities, incorporate genetic profiles, consider standardization of assessments and collaborative ventures across institutions, selection of more homogeneous subgroups and track neurobiological changes longer to clarify trajectories of changes.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) frequently present with a comorbid anxiety disorder that can cause significant functional impairment, particularly at school. An intensive modular cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) program was delivered to address anxiety, self-regulation, and social engagement in school and in the community. A particular emphasis was placed on increasing generalizability of coping skills and positive social behavior by involving school personnel in the treatment process. Children (7-11 years old) were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment condition (IT) that included 32 sessions of CBT (n = 7) or a 16-week treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition (n = 5). The CBT sessions emphasized behavioral experimentation and emotion regulation training as well as social coaching on increasing positive peer interactions. School observations and consultations were included in the treatment model. Independent evaluators blind to treatment condition conducted structured diagnostic interviews at baseline and post-IT/post-TAU. Post-treatment analyses showed that 71.4 % of the IT group had remitted from their primary anxiety disorder diagnosis as compared with none of the TAU group. In addition, an ANCOVA analysis conducted with baseline anxiety scores included as a covariate revealed a statistically significant difference by treatment group in anxiety severity favoring the IT group at post-treatment. The 32-session CBT program is an intensive approach for children with ASD and moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders that appears to yield a clinically significant impact on anxiety symptoms. The generalizability of coping skills may be enhanced by the inclusion of school-based treatment components due to the consistency of supports this permits across the child's daily settings.

AB The present study is the first to assess whether the neural correlates of cognitive control processes differ in adults with and without a behaviorally inhibited temperament during early childhood. Adults with and without childhood behavioral inhibition completed an emotional conflict task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. While no group differences in behavior were observed, adults with childhood behavioral inhibition, relative to adults without childhood behavioral inhibition, exhibited greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity during conflict detection and greater putamen activity during conflict adaptation. Lifetime psychopathology predicted behavioral, but not brain-related, differences in conflict adaptation. These data suggest that the brain regions underlying cognitive control processes are differentially influenced by childhood behavioral inhibition, and may be differently related to psychopathology.

AB Children and adolescents with a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high-risk for developing sleep problems (SPs) triggering daytime behavioral co-morbidities such as inattention, hyperactivity, and cognitive and emotional impairments. However, symptoms of sleep deprivation are solely associated with typical daytime diagnosis, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and treated with psychotropic medications. To understand how and why SPs are missed, we conducted qualitative interviews (QIs) with six parents and seven health care professionals (HCPs), and performed comprehensive clinical sleep assessments (CCSAs) in 27 patients together with their caregivers referred to our clinic for unresolved SPs. We used narrative schema and therapeutic emplotment in conjunction with analyzes of medical records to appropriately diagnose SPs and develop treatment strategies. The research was conducted at British Columbia Children's Hospital in Vancouver (Canada) between 2008 and 2011. In the QIs, parents and HCPs exhibited awareness of the significance of SPs and the effects of an SP on the daytime behaviors of the child and the associated burdens on the parents. HCPs' systemic inattention to the sequelae of SPs and the affected family's wellbeing appears due to an insufficient understanding of the various factors that contribute to nighttime SPs and their daytime sequelae. In the CCSAs, we found that the diagnostic recognition of chronic SPs in children and adolescents was impaired by the exclusive focus on daytime presentations. Daytime behavioral and emotional problems were targets of pharmacological treatment rather than the underlying SP. Consequently, SPs were also targeted with medications, without investigating the underlying problem. Our study highlights deficits in the diagnostic recognition of chronic SPs among children with chronic neurodevelopmental disorders/disabilities and proposes a clinical practice strategy, based on therapeutic emplotment that incorporates patients and parents' contributions in recognizing SPs and related sequelae in designing appropriate treatment and care.

AB We tested the hypothesis that less effective responses during a cognitive challenge would relate to higher levels of self-reported rumination in children. The sample was 100 children (55 boys, 45 girls), aged 7 to 14 years. A portion (n=65) was at high risk for depression due to having a parent with a childhood-onset mood disorder, and 35 were a low-risk comparison group. Using an impossible puzzle task, we assessed children's responses following failure across several domains: emotions (expressed anger, sadness, and negative self-statements), performance (being off-task, the time to solve subsequent puzzles, and the number solved), and physiology (heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia). Results indicated that making negative self-blaming statements during the solvable puzzles and taking more time to solve the puzzles were associated with higher levels of self-reported rumination. Our findings advance the understanding of potential correlates of children's tendency to ruminate and may have implications for children's performance on cognitive tasks.

AB The Quebec Newborn Twin Study (QNTS) is an ongoing prospective longitudinal follow-up of a birth cohort of twins born between 1995 and 1998 in the greater Montreal area, Quebec, Canada. The goal of QNTS is to document individual differences in the cognitive, behavioral, and social-emotional aspects of developmental health across childhood, their early bio-social determinants, as well as their putative role in later social-emotional adjustment, school and health outcomes. A total of 662 families of twins were initially assessed when the twins were aged 6 months. These twins and their family were then followed regularly. QNTS has 14 waves of data collected or planned, including 5 in preschool. Over the past 15 years, a broad range of physiological, cognitive, behavioral, school, and health phenotypes were documented longitudinally through multi-informant and multi-method measurements. QNTS also entails extended and detailed multi-level assessments of proximal (e.g., parenting behaviors, peer relationships) and distal (e.g., family income) features of the child's environment. This detailed longitudinal information makes QNTS uniquely suited for the study of the role of the early years and gene-environment transactions in development.

AB Gene-environment correlations (rGE) have been demonstrated in behavioral genetic studies, but rGE have proven elusive in molecular genetic research. Significant gene-environment correlations may be difficult to detect because potential moderators could reduce correlations between measured genetic variants and the environment. Molecular genetic studies investigating moderated rGE are lacking. This study examined associations between child catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype and aspects of positive parenting (responsiveness and warmth), and whether these associations were moderated by parental personality traits (neuroticism and extraversion) among a general community sample of third, sixth, and ninth graders (N = 263) and their parents. Results showed that parent personality traits moderated the rGE association between youths' genotype and coded observations of positive parenting. Parents with low levels of neuroticism and high levels of extraversion exhibited greater sensitive responsiveness and warmth, respectively, to youth with the valine/valine genotype. Moreover, youth with this genotype exhibited lower levels of observed anger. There was no association between the catechol-O-methyltransferase genotype and parenting behaviors for parents high on neuroticism and low on extraversion. Findings highlight the importance of considering moderating variables that may influence child genetic effects on the rearing environment. Implications for developmental models of maladaptive and adaptive child outcomes, and interventions for psychopathology, are discussed within a developmental psychopathology framework.

AB Using a genetically informed design, this study examined the additive and interactive effects of genetic risk, personal peer victimization experiences, and peer victimization experienced by others on children's aggression and depression symptoms. Of major interest was whether these effects varied depending on whether or not the victimized others were children's close friends. The sample comprised 197 monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs reared together (95 female pairs) assessed in Grade 4. Each twin's victimization experiences and victimization experienced by his or her friends and other classmates were measured using individuals' reports about their own levels of peer victimization. Aggression was assessed using peer nominations, and depression was measured using self-reports. Indicative of a possible social-learning mechanism or the emotional contagion of anger, multilevel regressions showed that personal victimization experiences were related to especially high levels of aggression when close friends where also highly victimized, albeit only in boys. Moreover, in line with social comparison theory, the effect of frequent personal victimization experiences on depressive feelings was much weaker when close friends were also highly victimized than when close friends were not or were only rarely victimized. Finally, a high level of peer victimization experienced by other classmates was related to a lower level of aggression in girls and boys, possibly because of a heightened sense of threat in classrooms where many suffer attacks from bullies. All of these results were independent of children's genetic risk for aggression or depression. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Two studies investigated the overpowering hypothesis as a possible explanation for the currently inconclusive empirical picture on age differences in affective responding to unpleasant events. The overpowering hypothesis predicts that age differences in affective responding are particularly evident in highly resource-demanding situations that overtax older adults' capacities. In Study 1, we used a mobile phone-based experience-sampling technology in 378 participants 14-86 years of age. Participants reported their momentary negative affect and occurrences of unpleasant events on average 54 times over 3 weeks. In Study 2, a subsample of 92 participants wore an ambulatory psycho-physiological monitoring system for 24 hr while pursuing their daily routines and additionally completed an average of 7 mobile phone-based experience-sampling reports. Affective responding was analyzed by comparing, within persons, affective states in situations without and with preceding unpleasant events. Results support the overpowering hypothesis: When dealing with complex unpleasant events that affected multiple life domains, both psychological (Study 1) and cardiovascular (Study 2) responding to unpleasant events were more pronounced the older the participants were. When dealing with circumscribed unpleasant events, however, no age differences in psychological responding were observed (Study 1), and cardiovascular responding was even less pronounced the older the participants were (Study 2). These findings are consistent with the notion of preserved affect regulation throughout adulthood, as long as the resource demands exerted by an event do not overtax the individual's capacities. We conclude that the overpowering hypothesis can bridge previously opposing positions regarding age differences in affective responding.

AB Objective: To evaluate the prevalence, pattern, and sociodemographic correlates of self-reported mental health problems among a pilot sample of adolescents from 5 developing countries and to speculate the methodology and design of a larger scale study. Methods: The sociodemographic questionnaire was developed based on extant literature on the sociodemographic correlates of mental health problems among adolescents. Additional information about the socioeconomic status of parents/caregivers of the participants was obtained using the Family Affluence Scale (FAS). Mental health problems were evaluated using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ). Logistic regression analysis was done to determine independent sociodemographic correlates of mental health problems. Results: A total of 1894 adolescents sampled from 5 countries completed the study. The prevalence of self-reported mental health problems was 10.5% (range, 5.8-15) with conduct and emotional problems being the most prevalent. When the raw total-SDQ scores were adjusted for age, gender, and FAS scores, there was a statistically significant difference in the mean scores among the adolescents from different countries (F = 17.23, p < .001). After controlling for all potential sociodemographic confounders, living with single parents or other nonparent care givers, having a chronic disabling physical condition, lower maternal education, and coming from a family in the lower FAS-score category were all independently associated with higher odds of mental health problems. Conclusions: Study has added to the currently limited data on prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents in developing countries. It further established that socioeconomic and family factors still play a major role in the mental health of children irrespective of region of the world. Significant but surmountable methodological issues for a larger scale study were raised. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 34:129-137, 2013)

AB Impairments in adaptive functioning are frequently associated with intellectual disability (ID); however, adaptive dysfunction can be seen in many individuals with a variety of neurological conditions without ID. The extent to which other variables may be associated with adaptive dysfunction is unclear. In a mixed clinical sample of children (n = 348) consecutively referred for neuropsychological evaluation, the majority were rated as showing weak adaptive skills (ABAS-II, >1 SD below the mean; 71%), with a substantial proportion evidencing frank impairment (>2 SD below the mean, 45%). We examined patterns of scores on measures of intelligence (WISC-IV) and behavioral/affective dysregulation (BRIEF and BASC-2). Using hierarchical cluster analysis, a four cluster model yielded the most appropriate fit and adaptive functioning was subsequently examined across clusters. As expected, adaptive functioning was most intact in the cluster characterized by average IQ and minimal behavioral dysregulation. Other clusters were marked by adaptive dysfunction and distinguished by sub-average intellectual functioning and varying behavioral/emotional dysregulation. In contrast to traditional views associating low IQ with adaptive dysfunction, adaptive impairment was comparable between the cluster characterized by low intelligence and the cluster with average intelligence but significant behavioral dysregulation. These data suggest that adaptive functioning should be considered across various cognitive/behavioral conditions. (JINS, 2013, 19, 189-197)

AB Etiological models of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) suggest interpersonal features may be important to understand this behavior, but social functions and correlates have not been extensively studied. This study addresses existing limitations by examining interpersonal correlates and functions of NSSI within a stratified random sample of 1,243 predominantly Caucasian college students (mean age = 21.52, SD = 4.15 years). Participants completed an anonymous online survey assessing NSSI features, perceived social support, and disclosure experiences. Approximately 15% of the students endorsed NSSI. Interpersonal reasons were endorsed proportionally more often for initiating rather than repeating the behavior. Individuals with repetitive NSSI reported significantly lower perceived social support from family members and fewer individuals to seek advice from than single-act and control participants. Fifty-nine percent had disclosed their NSSI, but rarely to mental health professionals. Conversations with others about NSSI were rated as being mostly unhelpful. These results emphasize the importance of interpersonal features and functions of NSSI, suggesting treatments should focus on strengthening interpersonal bonds alongside emotion regulation. Improving responses to disclosures of NSSI is needed to promote communication about this behavior and perceived helpfulness of such conversations.

AB The study assessed whether teacher and parent ratings of child behavior problems were similar for children with autism spectrum disorders. Two informants rated child behaviors in the same home environment, and the degree to which parenting stress impacted the similarity of the ratings was assessed. Overall behavior problem ratings did not differ between groups, but there was poor correspondence between the ratings for individual children, stress did not impact markedly on the discrepancies. Parent-teacher discrepancies in behavior ratings cannot be attributed entirely to differences in the assessment-environment, and there was little evidence of widespread impacts of parenting stress on these discrepant ratings. It was suggested that attention is needed in terms of the teacher characteristics when explaining such results.

AB Cross-sectional studies have shown a positive association between expressive suppression and depressive symptoms. These results have been interpreted as reflecting the impact of emotion regulation efforts on depression. However, it is also possible that depression may alter emotion regulation tendencies. The goal of the present study was to prospectively examine the bidirectional association between habitual use of suppression and depressive symptoms in young adolescents. Participants were 1,753 adolescents (mean age = 13.8 years) who reported their use of suppression and depressive symptoms at two time points with a 1-year interval. Suppression and depressive symptoms were correlated within each time point. Depressive symptoms preceded increased use of suppression 1 year later, but suppression did not precede future depressive symptoms. Overall, the findings suggest depressive symptoms may be a potential precursor of habitual use of suppression during adolescence.

AB Previous research demonstrates that both child maltreatment and intellectual performance contribute uniquely to the accurate identification of facial affect by children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to extend this research by examining whether child maltreatment affects the accuracy of facial recognition differently at varying levels of intellectual functioning. A sample of maltreated (n = 50) and nonmaltreated (n = 56) adolescent females, 14 to 19 years of age, was recruited to participate in this study. Participants completed demographic and study-related questionnaires and interviews to control for potential psychological and psychiatric confounds such as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, negative affect, and difficulties in emotion regulation. Participants also completed an experimental paradigm that recorded responses to facial affect displays starting in a neutral expression and changing into a full expression of one of six emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, or surprise. Hierarchical multiple regression assessed the incremental advantage of evaluating the interaction between child maltreatment and intellectual functioning. Results indicated that the interaction term accounted for a significant amount of additional variance in the accurate identification of facial affect after controlling for relevant covariates and main effects. Specifically, maltreated females with lower levels of intellectual functioning were least accurate in identifying facial affect displays, whereas those with higher levels of intellectual functioning performed as well as nonmaltreated females. These results suggest that maltreatment and intellectual functioning interact to predict the recognition of facial affect, with potential long-term consequences for the interpersonal functioning of maltreated females.

AB Universal screening is a promising approach for identifying students at risk for behavioral and emotional problems. Due to the frequent adolescent onset of behavioral and emotional problems, middle school is an important time for early identification. This study explored the ability of the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS) to predict behavioral outcomes (i.e., behavioral grades, suspensions, and office disciplinary referrals) in a sample of 694 middle-school students. Both the teacher and student rated BESS forms were able to significantly predict behavioral outcomes. Findings suggest that the BESS can be an effective tool for identifying students at risk of experiencing behavior problems.

AB The rate of emotional and behavioural disturbance in children with intellectual disability (ID) is up to four times higher than that of their typically developing peers. It is important to identify these difficulties in children with ID as early as possible to prevent the chronic co-morbidity of ID and psychopathology. Children with ID have traditionally been assessed via proxy reporting, but appropriate and psychometrically rigorous instruments are needed so that children can report on their own emotions and behaviours. In this study, the factor structure of the self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was examined in a population of 128 children with ID (mean age = 12 years). Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed a three factor model (comprising Positive Relationships, Negative Behaviour and Emotional Competence) to be a better measure than the original five factor SDQ model in this population.

AB This study presents a novel task examining young children's affective responses to evaluative feedbackspecifically, social acceptance and rejectionfrom peers. We aimed to determine (1) whether young children report their affective responses to hypothetical peer evaluation predictably and consistently, and (2) whether young children's responses to peer evaluation vary as a function of temperamental shyness and gender. Four- to seven-year-old children (N = 48) sorted pictures of unknown, similar-aged children into those with whom they wished or did not wish to play. Computerized peer evaluation later noted whether the pictured children were interested in a future playdate with participants. Participants then rated their affective responses to each acceptance or rejection event. Children were happy when accepted by children with whom they wanted to play, and disappointed when these children rejected them. Highly shy boys showed a wider range of responses to acceptance and rejection based on initial social interest, and may be particularly sensitive to both positive and negative evaluation. Overall, the playdate task captures individual differences in affective responses to evaluative peer feedback and is potentially amenable to future applications in research with young children, including pairings with psychophysiological measures.

AB Aim To analyse the prevalence of atypical eating problems and their associations with anxious or oppositional behaviours in young children. Methods One thousand and ninety children examined in the school enrolment test in a defined geographical region were included (544 boys). The parents completed a 25-item questionnaire regarding their child's eating behaviour and anxious or oppositional behaviours. Results Half of the parents reported that their child avoids certain foods (53%). Twenty-three percent showed selective eating, 26% showed an aversion against new foods. Children with underweight avoided more types of food and ate smaller amounts than children with normal or overweight. Three groups could be differentiated. Sixty-one percent of the children were normal eaters with avoidance of certain foods, normal weight status and low anxious or oppositional behaviour. Thirty-four percent showed selective and/or restrictive eating, and 5% worried about their weight. Children with selective eating and with weight concerns were more often affected by anxious and oppositional behaviours. Conclusion Atypical eating problems are common in young children. Without accompanying weight loss, behavioural or emotional problems, selective eating should be seen as a normal feature in young eating behaviour. Parents of young children with selective, restrictive eating or with weight worrying and psychological problems should be offered advice/treatment.

AB Threat appraisals-individuals' perceptions of how stressful situations may threaten their well-being-are an important but understudied mechanism that could explain links between peer victimization and adjustment. The goal of the present study was to examine relationships between physical and relational victimization by peers, threats to the self, and aggression, anxiety, and depression to better understand the cognitive evaluations that make youth vulnerable to negative adjustment. The sample comprised two cohorts of African American adolescents (N = 326; 54 % female; M = 12.1; SD = 1.6) and their maternal caregivers, who participated in three waves of a longitudinal study. Path models revealed significant direct effects from Time 1 relational victimization, but not physical victimization, to Time 2 threat appraisals (i.e., negative self-evaluations and negative evaluations by others), controlling for Time 1 threat appraisals. Significant direct effects were found from Time 2 threats of negative evaluations by others to Time 3 youth-reported aggression, controlling for Time 1 and Time 2 aggression. Significant direct effects also were found from Time 2 threats of negative self-evaluations to T3 youth-reported depression, controlling for Time 1 and Time 2 depression. Overall, findings highlight the need to consider the role of threats to the self in pathways from peer victimization to adjustment and the implications these appraisals have for youth prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Social functioning was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form for children with anxiety disorders who participated in a randomized clinical trial (N = 161, aged 7-14). Significant relationships were found between severity of children's principal anxiety disorder and most measures of social functioning, such that poorer social functioning was associated with more severe anxiety. Among youth who received cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 111), significant associations were found between parent-reported social competence and both absence of principal anxiety disorder and lower anxiety severity at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up, controlling for the severity of the child's principal anxiety disorder at pretreatment. Findings support a relationship between anxiety severity and social difficulties, and suggest the importance of social competence for a favorable treatment response.

AB Aim To investigate psychopathology in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), particularly the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptomatology, using a population-based sampling approach. Method Standard questionnaire screen reports were analysed for ASD (Social Responsiveness Scale, SRS), ADHD (Conners Parent Rating Scale- Revised, CPRS-R), and other psychiatric morbidity (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) from parents and teachers of children aged from 4 to 16 years (112 females, 95 males) on the UK North West Regional Genetic Service register for NF1. Results Parental response rate was 52.7% (109/207 children; 59 females, 50 males, mean age 9y 11mo, SD 3y 3mo). The SRS showed that in 29.4% (32/109) of children, autism was in the severe, clinical range (T-score>75) and in 26.6% (29/109) in the mild to moderate range (T-score 6075). CPRS-R scores showed that in 53.8% (57/106) of children autism was in the clinical ADHD range (ADHD index T-score>65). Based on their scores on the SDQ total difficulties scale, 41.5% (44/106) of children were in the abnormal range and 14.2% (15/106) were in the borderline range. Twenty-five per cent (26/104) of children met criteria for both clinical autism and ADHD. Interpretation This representative population-based sample of children with NF1 indicates a high prevalence of ASD symptoms associated with NF1 as well as substantial co-occurrence with ADHD symptoms. The findings clarify the psychopathology of NF1 and show the disorder as a potentially important single-gene cause for autism symptoms.

AB Traumatic childhood experiences have been found to predict later internalizing problems. This prospective longitudinal study investigated whether repeated and intentional harm doing by peers (peer victimization) in childhood predicts internalizing symptoms in early adolescence. 3,692 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), as well as their mothers and teachers, reported on bullying in childhood (7-10 years) and internalizing problems in early adolescence (11-14 years). Controlling for prior psychopathology, family adversity, gender and IQ, being a victim of bullying was associated with higher overall scores, as well as increased odds of scoring in the severe range (> 90(th) percentile) for emotional and depression symptoms. Victims were also more likely to show persistent depression symptoms over a 2-year period. These associations were found independent of whether mothers, teachers or the children reported on bullying. It is concluded that peer victimization in childhood is a precursor of both short-lived and persistent internalizing symptoms, underlining the importance of environmental factors such as peer relationships in the etiology of internalizing problems.

AB Background: Psychiatric problems are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the reasons are poorly understood. We use a longitudinal population-representative cohort to examine for the first time the persistence of psychiatric problems and to identify risk factors for their occurrence and stability. Methods: Eighty-one 16-year olds (75 male, six female), initially seen at 12 years, were re-assessed using the parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Child, family and contextual characteristics from age 12 were tested as risk factors for psychopathology. Results: Prevalence rates varied depending on whether general population or ASD-specific SDQ cut-offs were used. While the former suggested a decrease in psychiatric problems over time, the ASD-specific cut-offs showed no significant differences. With the exception of ADHD, the ASD-specific cut-offs identified a smaller proportion of individuals as affected than did the general population cut-offs. There was longitudinal domain specificity, with parent correlations ranging from 0.50 to 0.58 and teacher SDQ reports at age 12 correlating 0.330.53 with parent reports at 16 years. In examining the role of risk factors, lower IQ and adaptive functioning predicted higher hyperactivity and total difficulties scores. Greater emotional problems at 16 were predicted by poorer maternal mental health, family-based deprivation and lower social class. Improvement from 12 to 16 years in conduct problems was predicted by greater neighbourhood deprivation and special school attendance. Conclusions: This is the first longitudinal study of other psychiatric symptoms in ASD. Additional psychiatric problems in ASD are persistent and domain-specific from childhood to adolescence. The finding that age-related reduction in SDQ symptoms does not apply when ASD-specific cut-offs are used requires further evaluation using diagnostic measures. Only a few of the expected risk factor-psychopathology predictions expected from general population studies were found, raising the possibility that the causes of psychopathology in ASD differ from those in the general population.

AB Few studies have examined potential intermediary processes linking insecure attachment with eating disorders. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative contributions of social comparison and emotion dysregulation on disordered eating symptoms within an attachment framework. Participants were 247 women living in Australia, aged between 18 and 35 years. All the study variables were moderately, positively correlated. Disordered eating was most highly correlated with emotion dysregulation, whilst correlation magnitudes with both attachment styles were comparable. Multiple mediation analysis was performed using bootstrapping procedures. Consistent with hypotheses, the mediating roles of social comparison and emotion dysregulation were supported, suggesting they may be processes through which insecure attachment influences disordered eating. Results highlight the need for intervention to focus not only on eating symptomatology, but also on the ways in which eating disorders are maintained through maladaptive self-regulatory and comparison processes.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of an assessment instrument on teachers' perceptions regarding the development of socio-emotional skills. Results revealed a consistent four-factor structure (School/teachers' needs for socio-emotional skills promotion; Needs regarding teaching-learning process; Difficulties in dealing with students' socio-emotional deficits, Socio-emotional needs related to teacher's initial training) with internal consistency values above .79. Confirmatory analyses revealed a good fit of the model to the data. Teachers reported having more needs at the school/teachers conditions for the promotion of social and emotional needs, and less needs at the level of their Teachers' initial training. The instrument also showed to be sensitive in capturing teachers' perception of schooling social and emotional needs in terms of teachers' gender, pedagogic group and school level.

AB Recent advances achieved in the field of clinical neuro(bio-)psychology have been varied and impressive. Together with the related social and psychosocial aspects, they contribute to and enrich the development of new options in diagnosis and psychotherapy. Important research results are discussed here based on the examples of depression, Alzheimer's disease and self-injury, which profit greatly from neuropsychological research, especially through early detection of symptoms and prevention.

AB The article provides an overview of approaches to measuring emotion regulation strategies in children, youth, and adults. Self and external assessment procedures in children and adolescence and questionnaires for adults, for which a validated German-language translation exists, are considered separately and discussed in terms of quality and standards of psychometric quality criteria. Following methods of ecological momentary assessment are reviewed, which enables one to capture emotion regulatory processes in the natural environment and to take into account contextual factors. The paper concludes with the recommendation to use multimethod procedures for the assessment of emotion regulation strategies.

AB Background: Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) in childhood is a commonly occurring condition and shows a high stability. Psychosocial dysfunctioning of children, such as increased stress experience, is a burden for children and parents and complicates clinical management. Additional comorbid disorders may develop. To minimize the onset of such disorders, treatment at an early stage and taking psychosocial aspects into consideration is strongly recommended. Through this approach, the cognitive-behavioral, child-centered group program 'Stop the pain with Happy-Pingu' was developed, applied, and subsequently evaluated. What is the psychosocial situation of the affected children? Can the cognitive-behavioral group program be applied to improve psychosocial limitations? Method: The cognitive-behavioral group program comprises 6 weekly sessions for children and 1 single meeting for parents. In a randomized controlled study, the program was evaluated with 29 children aged between 6 and 12 years. The evaluation was based on a comparison between the intervention group (IG) and the waiting list control group (WLC), measured at 3 measurement points: T1 (pre), T2 (post), and T3 (3-month follow-up). Results: Emotional problems in particular can emerge in children with CAP. The program was well received, with a high level of participation through to completion. The results demonstrate that children participating in the IG experience significant stress reduction and improved psychosocial functioning compared to children participating in the WLC. The effect sizes range from medium to high. Conclusions: Drawing upon the above findings, multimodal cognitive-behavioral techniques appear to be suitable to successfully treat children with CAP. However, further controlled studies are required to identify the specific elements of the training that are most effective in reducing pain.

AB This work focuses on a multidimensional exploration of the stress experienced by kinship foster carers. This study is the first one conducted on Spanish sample, with 116 kinship foster families and foster children, between the ages of 4 and 11 years.
   In general, data indicate that the carer's parental stress scores are within the normative range. The existing heterogeneity among these families is also reported, highlighting a carers group with high stress levels. Parental stress correlated with children variables (initial adversity index, adaptation, evolution and behavioral adjustment); caregiver and family variables (main carer's health, no correlation was found with social support network or with economic needs) and child-carer relationship variables (acceptance-rejection, relationship with the main caregiver and with other family members). Finally, the predictive model performed shows that the more behavioral and emotional problems foster children exhibit, the more stress the carers experience. This is also true the worse the relationships with other relatives are and the poorer the health of the main carer is.

AB Conduct disorder is a prevalent problem in adolescence and is associated with serious consequences. Deficits in emotion regulation may constitute a proximal risk factor for aggressive behavior patterns. Therefore, the present study examined the relation between emotion regulation and aggressive behavior in preschool children. 278 adolescents (12-17 years) filled out self-report questionnaires of internal, external, functional, and dysfunctional emotion regulation and aggressive behavior. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the influence of patterns of emotion regulation on different types of aggression. The results revealed significant gender differences in the practice of regulation strategies but not in the extent of aggressive behavior. Internal-and external-dysfunctional emotion regulation were significant predictors of oppositional-aggressive behavior and aggressive behavior in general. Reclusively, external-dysfunctional regulation was a factor in dissocial-aggressive behavior. Results indicate that types of aggression show differentiated relations with deficits in emotion regulation. In the future, systematic interventions for advancing emotion regulation may supplement common therapy programs for conduct disorder.

AB Objective: Few studies have examined hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress reactivity and its relationship to histories of child maltreatment and physical aggression. We examined the relation of a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and perpetration of dating violence to patterns of cortisol change before (resting) and after (reactivity) exposure to a laboratory stressor. Methods: In a sample of 40 disadvantaged sexually active female adolescent patients (ages 14-17 years), we collected self-reports of lifetime child maltreatment (5 types) and past-year female perpetration of physical assault (PA) acts toward a romantic partner. We assessed changes in salivary cortisol trajectories during resting and reactivity phases following the viewing of a teen dating violence vignette. Results: Reports of CSA (CSA+ group) were associated with reports of perpetration of severe dating PA (PA+ group), but the relation of these reports to laboratory-assessed patterns of cortisol changes following the stressor was opposite. As compared with subjects without victimization or perpetration histories (referent group), the CSA+ group showed the most pronounced positive slope (reactivity), whereas the PA+ group showed the least positive slope following the laboratory stressor after the over-lap between these groups was statistically adjusted. While showing less reactivity to the laboratory stressor, the PA+ group had higher levels of resting cortisol, which stayed high during reactivity as compared to the referent group. Conclusion: The laboratory paradigm to elicit neuroendocrine stress-related cortisol reactivity appears to be a promising tool for identifying altered cortisol physiology among female adolescents with mixed histories of CSA and perpetration of dating PA.

AB Having and Losing Friends: Necessary Social-Emotional Competencies in Adolescents, Supportive friendships are an invaluable resource for adolescents because of their various developmental tasks, but establishing and maintaining them requires particular interpersonal skills. In order to identify social-emotional competencies associated with having and losing friends, N = 206 early adolescents (12-14 years of age) were examined longitudinally right after the transition to secondary school in the beginning of grade 7 and again at the end of this school year. Adolescents who had at least one reciprocal friend at both times were compared to those who lost all their friends over the school year. Repeated-measures MANOVAs indicate effects of time (and development) that underline an increase of self-disclosure, explanations and humor as well as a general decrease of openly aggressive behavior when angry at the friend. Interaction effects suggest that adolescents who lost their friend(s) intensified their use of physically and relationally aggressive behavior and of fantasies of revenge over time while continuously befriended adolescents decreased in their aggressive behavior when coping with anger in their friendships. Adolescents who had friends at both times were more willing to disclose private information whereas the self-disclosure of adolescents who lost their friends stagnated. These results are discussed in terms of deficient social-emotional competencies as the cause and the consequence of losing friends. Prax. Kinderpsychol. Kinderpsychiat. 62/2013, 179-196

AB With the current focus on increasing utilization of empirically supported treatments, knowledge of sample differences and similarities has increasing importance. The present study compared anxiety-disordered youth (age 7-13) from (a) five Norwegian service clinics (SC, N-111) to (b) a university research clinic (RC) in Philadelphia, USA (N=144) on pre-treatment characteristics measured by the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, and Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). SC youth demonstrated higher levels of anxiety based on child- (d = 0.42-1.04) and parent-report (d = 0.53) and conduct problems based on parent-report (d = 0.43) compared to RC youth. SC youth was more functionally impaired on the CGAS (d = 0.97), whereas RC youth evidenced a greater number of diagnoses (d = 0.63). The two samples were equivalent regarding parent-reported symptoms of affective, somatic, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and oppositional problems. Future directions and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Loss of control (LOC) eating affects a significant number of adolescents of all racial and ethnic backgrounds and is associated with numerous psychosocial problems, including depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and weight concerns. However, empirically validated, culturally sensitive treatments for adolescents with these disordered eating behaviors are not available. This pilot project involved designing a developmentally and culturally appropriate treatment for LOC eating for adolescent girls. We intend to conduct multiple focus groups with adolescent girls who engage in LOC eating, and their primary caregivers. Data from these groups will inform the subsequent creation of a manualized treatment protocol. We will then evaluate the efficacy of this intervention (LIBER8-Linking Individuals Being Emotionally Real) to reduce LOC eating. This intervention will integrate components of dialectical behavior therapy, such as mindfulness and distress tolerance skills training, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. We will also integrate text-messaging, a key adolescent communication strategy, as a means of self-monitoring. Participants meeting study criteria will be offered participation in this 12-week randomized controlled trial comparing LIBER8 to a weight management control condition (2BFit). We hypothesize that this intervention will serve to reduce LOC eating, as well as improve psychosocial functioning as evidenced by decreased depression, anxiety, eating disorder cognitions, emotional eating, impulsivity, and improved quality of life. The feasibility and acceptability of this intervention will be extensively evaluated with the explicit intent of informing a subsequent larger randomized controlled trial. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The migration process is a cause of physical and social stressors that may lead to mental health problems, particularly in children. In Italy, there are few studies about migrant children's mental health; thus, the aim of this study is to compare the prevalence and types of emotional and behavioral problems in migrant schoolchildren to those of native Italian-children. The research involved migrant (first- and second-generation) and native schoolchildren attending kindergarten, primary, and secondary school. A questionnaire was administered to parents to collect information about the sociodemographic characteristics of the children. All teachers filled in the Teacher's Report Form for migrant and native children. The findings show that teachers detect academic and adaptive problems more easily in migrant schoolchildren, but they are probably less aware of the children's psychological problems. The observations made in this study provide a starting point in understanding the psychological status and main problems noted among migrant children.

AB Objective: Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders in adolescents and show high comorbidity. The aim of the current study was to investigate emotion regulation as a conjoint as well as restricting factor.
   Methods: Matched samples of depressive and anxious adolescents and a control group (12 - 16 years; n = 60) were compared for their emotion regulation. Analyses of variance and t-tests were used to analyse group differences in emotion regulation. Individual differences in regulation strategies between the two types of disorders were analysed exploratorily.
   Results: Results indicate more dysfunctional emotion regulation in anxious and depressive adolescents compared to a control group. Neither dysfunctional emotion regulation in sum, nor single strategies differentiated between the two disorder groups.
   Conclusion: Identification and modification of dysfunctional emotion regulation in anxious and depressive adolescents can support future prevention and intervention.

AB Adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are characterized by difficulties in emotion regulation. Difficulties in interpersonal relationships are directly and indirectly associated with NSSI through emotion dysregulation. Two important elements of a successful emotion regulation and functional interpersonal relationships are emotion recognition and emotion expression. Studies with patients with borderline personality disorder who often show NSSI indicate abnormalities in emotion recognition and a reduced emotion expression. In treatment programmes for adolescents with NSSI, the fostering of emotion regulation abilities and interpersonal skills are important. Trainings in emotion recognition and emotion expression might complement existing treatment concepts.

AB Background This study assessed the validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS), a measure of personality risk factors for substance use and other behavioral problems in adolescence. Methods The concurrent and predictive validity of the SURPS was tested in a sample of 1,162 adolescents (mean age: 13.7 years) using linear and logistic regressions, while its sensitivity and specificity were examined using the receiver operating characteristics curve analyses. Results Concurrent and predictive validity tests showed that all 4 brief scaleshopelessness (H), anxiety sensitivity (AS), impulsivity (IMP), and sensation seeking (SS)were related, in theoretically expected ways, to measures of substance use and other behavioral and emotional problems. Results also showed that when using the 4 SURPS subscales to identify adolescents at risk, one can identify a high number of those who developed problems (high sensitivity scores ranging from 72 to 91%). And, as predicted, because each scale is related to specific substance and mental health problems, good specificity was obtained when using the individual personality subscales (e.g., most adolescents identified at high risk by the IMP scale developed conduct or drug use problems within the next 18 months [a high specificity score of 70 to 80%]). Conclusions The SURPS is a valuable tool for identifying adolescents at high risk for substance misuse and other emotional and behavioral problems. Implications of findings for the use of this measure in future research and prevention interventions are discussed.

AB Objective Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is associated with impaired emotion regulation and impulsivity. Low serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) function is associated with NSSI, impaired emotion regulation and impulsivity. We investigated the effects of experimentally lowered 5-hydroxytryptamine activity, via acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), on impulsive action, reflection impulsivity and mood in female adolescents engaging in NSSI. Methods Thirty-two female adolescents engaging in NSSI participated in a parallel group ATD study. Following ATD, impulsive action was assessed using the Continuous Performance Test, Identical Pairs Version. Reflection impulsivity was assessed using the Matching Familiar Figures Test. Mood-lowering was examined using the Profile of Mood States. Results Following ATD, the participants showed an impulsive response style (as reflected in their low beta) and increased attentional capacity (as reflected in their elevated d'). ATD did not affect reflection impulsivity or mood. Conclusions Acute tryptophan depletion caused an impulsive response style and increased attentional capacity. Importantly, the findings suggest that low serotonin function is a vulnerability among female adolescents for engaging in NSSI when in emotional distress. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Association of mothers' emotional adjustment and negative kin relations with distressed interpersonal relations was examined. Among 115 low-income African American mothers, relationship of depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and demanding kin relations with psychological control and stressful interpersonal relations was assessed. Depressive symptoms and demanding kin relations were positively associated with mothers' use of psychological control in parenting. Interaction of self-esteem with demanding kin relations revealed that self-esteem was negatively associated with psychological control for mothers with high-demanding kin relations but not for mothers with low-demanding kin relations. Mothers' depressive symptoms and demanding kin relations were positively associated with their stressful interpersonal relations. Findings were discussed in terms of the need for research on the beneficial and detrimental aspects of families' social network.

AB A cascade of neuroendocrine events regulates the initiation and progression of female puberty. However, the factors that determine the timing of these events across individuals are still uncertain. While the consequences of puberty on subsequent emotional development and adult behavior have received significant attention, what is less understood are the social and environmental factors that actually alter the initiation and progression of puberty. In order to more fully understand what factors influence pubertal timing in females, the present study quantified social and emotional behavior; stress physiology; and growth and activity measures in juvenile female rhesus monkeys to determine what best predicts eventual puberty. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that increased agonistic behavior resulting from subordinate status in their natal group, in combination with slowed growth, reduced prosocial behavior, and increased emotional reactivity would predict delayed puberty. The analyses were restricted to behavioral and physiological measures obtained prior to the onset of puberty, defined as menarche. Together, our findings indicate that higher rates of aggression but lower rates of submission received from group mates; slower weight gain; and greater emotional reactivity, evidenced by higher anxiety, distress and appeasing behaviors, and lower cortisol responsivity in response to a potentially threatening situation, predicts delayed puberty. Together the combination of these variables accounted for 58% of the variance in the age of menarche, 71% in age at first ovulation, and 45% in the duration of adolescent sterility. While early puberty may be more advantageous for the individual from a fertility standpoint, it presents significant health risks, including increased risk for a number of estrogen dependent cancers and as well as the emergence of mood disorders during adulthood. On the other hand, it is possible that increased emotional reactivity associated with delayed puberty could persist, increasing the risk for emotional dysregulation to socially challenging situations. The data argue for prospective studies that will determine how emotional reactivity shown to be important for pubertal timing is affected by early social experience and temperament, and how these stress-related variables contribute to body weight accumulation, affecting the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty.

AB Emotion regulation is a crucial skill in adulthood; its acquisition represents one of the key developmental tasks in early childhood. Difficulties with adaptive emotion regulation increase the risk of psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. This is, for instance, shown by a relation between emotion regulation and aggressive behavior in childhood age, indicating emotion dysregulation as an important risk factor of aggressive behavior and potential precursor of psychopathology. Based on (1) interrelations between emotion processes and social information processing (maladaptive emotion regulation and social information processing are associated with higher levels of aggression) and (2) recent neuroscientific findings showing that empathy deficits might not only result in difficulties labeling others' emotions but one's own emotions too, we suggest that empathy deficits might serve as potential trigger of emotion dysregulation. Different studies investigating the relation between empathy and emotion regulation are presented and discussed. Discussions are based on the assumed potential of empathy deficits triggering emotion dysregulation. Furthermore, developmental neuroscientific findings on empathy and emotion regulation are highlighted which provide further insights on how these processes might relate. Finally, possible directions for future research are presented.

AB This paper discusses the differences between adults with and without children and adolescents (N = 686) about the appraisal of anger, emotional regulation, strategies used and the time it takes to regulate that emotion. It also analyses the correlation between difficulties in emotion regulation and psychological wellbeing. For the analysis of the results, we used a complementary methodology. Data indicate that interpersonal relationships (especially between parents and children) influence the regulation of anger and time it takes to regulate that emotion. Parents associate appraisal of anger with their children, making them more aware of the need to regulate such situations. They show differences in the use of cognitive reappraisal strategies and need less time to regulate anger. Adults without children and adolescents show a greater disparity in the causes but also show the influence of significant others in the appraisal of these situations. Adolescents use more suppression strategies and take longer to regulate anger.

Results demonstrated that: (a) maternal- and paternal-perpetrated IPV have similar but not identical relations with child outcomes, (b) mothers' and children's reports of paternal-perpetrated IPV were positively related, (c) mother and child report of maternal- and paternal-perpetrated IPV related to child emotional and behavior problems, and (d) emotion dysregulation mediated the link between IPV exposure and child outcomes. Notably, findings differed by reporters. Results support emotion dysregulation as one mechanism through which IPV exposure may lead to child behavior problems, with implications for clinical intervention.

AB This study focuses on the mechanisms through which exposure to family violence leads to aggressive behavior in adolescents who were the victims of abuse and neglect. A sample of 166 adolescents from residential child welfare and protection centers for victims of abuse and neglect completed measures of victimization and witnessing violence at home, three schemas (justification of violence, mistrust, and grandiosity), aggressiveness (proactive and reactive), and depression. The results showed that witnessing family violence is more intensely associated with aggressiveness than victimization, and that part of this association is mediated by schemas of justification of violence and grandiosity. Victimization was associated with less aggressiveness and more depression, through the schema of mistrust. In girls exposure to family violence was more intensely associated with aggressiveness.

AB Objective: Multiple factors predict early alcohol initiation in teenagers. Among these are genetic risk factors, childhood behavioral problems, life events, lifestyle, and family environment. We constructed a developmental prediction model for alcohol initiation below the Dutch legal drinking age (16 years), elaborating on the pathways identified by earlier studies. Method: A set of 22 prospectively measured variables, previously associated with alcohol initiation, was examined by path analytic techniques in a sample of 1,804 Dutch adolescents (ages 13-15 years, 56% girls). The predictors included genetic risk for alcohol initiation and behavioral/emotional problems; prenatal and childhood stressors and childhood behavioral/emotional problems; and adolescent behavioral/emotional problems, lifestyle, family functioning, and peer-related factors. Results: The model explained 66% of variance in early alcohol initiation. Subjects at higher genetic risk of alcohol initiation who had friends who drank alcohol and who had started smoking at an early age were at increased risk of initiating alcohol use before age 16. Behavioral (externalizing) problems were moderately and indirectly associated with early alcohol initiation, and emotional (internalizing) problems were marginally and indirectly associated with alcohol initiation. Conclusions: The Netherlands has relatively lenient alcohol laws. In this permissive environment, early alcohol initiation is explained by alcohol-specific genetic risk, smoking initiation, and peer-related factors, whereas behavioral and emotional problems are only indirectly related to early alcohol initiation.

AB There has been a recent increase in research focusing on child complex traumatic stress following prolonged or repeated trauma. These traumatic stress reactions often affect many aspects of the child's functioning, including psychological, behavioral, and physical health. In addition, complex traumatic stress experienced by youth with serious medical conditions may influence health issues such as medical adherence, emotional adjustment to illness, and pain management. This article reviews and delineates the current state of the literature on the impact of complex traumatic stress in childhood on mental and physical health as well as on these pediatric health-related issues. To date, few empirical studies have directly addressed this association. Several features associated with complex traumatic stress, such as emotion regulation difficulties, disruptive behavior, and family conflict, have indirectly been demonstrated to interfere with pediatric adherence, medical coping, and pain management. This demonstrates the need for more focused research in this area.

AB Objectives Whether behavioural and emotional maladjustment is more prevalent in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than in healthy controls remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess paediatric IBD patients for problems with emotional and behavioural adjustment and to examine associations with clinical and demographic variables.
   Methods Data from paediatric patients with IBD enrolled in the Swiss IBD Cohort Study and the results of both the parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the self-reported Child Depression Inventory (CDI) were analysed. Of the 148 registered patients, 126 had at least one questionnaire completed and were included.
   Results The mean age of 71 patients with Crohn's disease ( 44 males, 27 females) was 13.4 years, and 12.8 years for the 55 patients with ulcerative or indeterminate colitis. The mean duration of disease was 1.2 and 2.7 years, respectively. The total score of the SDQ was abnormal in 11.4% of cases compared to 10% in the normal population. Abnormal sub-scores were found in 20.2% of subjects for the domain of emotional problems and in 17.1% for problems with peers. The total CDI T score indicated a significantly lower prevalence of clinical depression in IBD patients than in normal youth. No correlation between the total SDQ scores or the CDI T scores and gender, type or duration of IBD, inflammatory markers or disease scores was found.
   Conclusions The prevalence of problems with behavioural and emotional adjustment among Swiss paediatric IBD patients is low and comparable to that of the normal population.

AB The current study examined the relations of measures of cognitive reappraisal and secondary control coping with working memory abilities, positive and negative affect, and symptoms of anxiety and depression in young adults (N=124). Results indicate significant relations between working memory abilities and reports of secondary control coping and between reports of secondary control coping and cognitive reappraisal. Associations were also found between measures of secondary control coping and cognitive reappraisal and positive and negative affect and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, the findings suggest that reports of cognitive reappraisal may be more strongly predictive of positive affect whereas secondary control coping may be more strongly predictive of negative affect and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Overall, the results suggest that current measures of secondary control coping and cognitive reappraisal capture related but distinct constructs and suggest that the assessment of working memory may be more strongly related to secondary control coping in predicting individual differences in distress.

AB The literature on father absence is frequently criticized for its use of cross-sectional data and methods that fail to take account of possible omitted variable bias and reverse causality. We review studies that have responded to this critique by employing a variety of innovative research designs to identify the causal effect of father absence, including studies using lagged dependent variable models, growth curve models, individual fixed effects models, sibling fixed effects models, natural experiments, and propensity score matching models. Our assessment is that studies using more rigorous designs continue to find negative effects of father absence on offspring well-being, although the magnitude of these effects is smaller than what is found using traditional cross-sectional designs. The evidence is strongest and most consistent for outcomes such as high school graduation, children's social-emotional adjustment, and adult mental health.

AB Attachment security towards parents and peers in adolescence, and romantic attachment styles and emotion regulation strategies in young adulthood, were evaluated using an eight-year longitudinal design. Fifty-six young adults completed the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA) at age 14, and then, at age 22, the Experience in Close Relationships (ECR) and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), an emotion regulation questionnaire concerning coping strategies, including task-oriented versus emotion-oriented foci. Results indicated that greater insecurity to parents and peers in adolescence predicted a more anxious romantic attachment style and greater use of emotion-oriented strategies in adulthood. Concurrently, anxious adult attachment style was related to more emotion-oriented strategies, whereas an avoidant attachment style was related to less support-seeking. Analyses also identified emotion-oriented coping strategies as a partial mediator of the link between adolescent attachment insecurity to parents and adult anxious attachment, and a complete mediator of the association between adolescent attachment insecurity to peers and adult anxious attachment. These findings support the core assumption of continuity in attachment theory, where relationships to parents influence close romantic relationships in adulthood.

AB It is common that intellectually gifted children-that is, children with an IQ >= 130-are referred to paediatric or child neuropsychiatry clinics for socio-emotional problems and/or school underachievement or maladjustment. These clinically-referred children with intellectual giftedness are thought to typically display internalizing problems (i.e., self-focused problems reflecting overcontrol of emotion and behavior), and to be more behaviorally impaired when "highly" gifted (IQ >= 145) or displaying developmental asynchrony (i.e., a heterogeneous developmental pattern, reflected in a significant verbal-performance discrepancy on IQ tests). We tested all these assumptions in 143 clinically-referred gifted children aged 8 to 12, using Wechsler's intelligence profile and the Child Behavior Checklist. Compared to a normative sample, gifted children displayed increased behavioral problems in the whole symptomatic range. Internalizing problems did not predominate over externalizing ones (i.e., acted-out problems, reflecting undercontrol of emotion and behavior), revealing a symptomatic nature of behavioral syndromes more severe than expected. "Highly gifted" children did not display more behavioral problems than the "low gifted." Gifted children with a significant verbal-performance discrepancy displayed more externalizing problems and mixed behavioral syndromes than gifted children without such a discrepancy. These results suggest that developmental asynchrony matters when examining emotional and behavioral problems in gifted children.

AB The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) for school-age children includes three instruments for assessing emotional and/or behavioral problems: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), completed by parents, Youth Self-Report (YSR), completed by adolescents and Teacher's Report Form (TRF), completed by teachers. This review article gives detailed information on the development of these forms in the United States and Brazil, describing the main changes to the items, scales and score cutoff points in original versions between 1991 and 2001, as well as the process involved in the translation, back-translation and cultural adaptation of the original questionnaires to develop the current official Brazilian versions of the CBCL, YSR and TRF. The utility of these tools for research and clinical practice is highlighted, mentioning epidemiological studies and evaluation of interventions conducted in Brazil. Researchers' and clinicians' doubts regarding the correct use of the current official Brazilian versions are answered, giving examples of frequently asked questions relevant to the Brazilian context.

DE Non-suicidal self-injury; Emotion regulation; Facial emotion
   recognition; Facial mimicry; Borderline personality disorder
AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is an increasingly prevalent, clinically significant behavior in adolescents and can be associated with serious consequences for the afflicted person. Emotion regulation is considered its most frequent function. Because the symptoms of NSSI are common and cause impairment, it will be included in Section 3 disorders as a new disorder in the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). So far, research has been conducted mostly with patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) showing self-injurious behavior. Therefore, for this review the current state of research regarding emotion regulation, NSSI, and BPD in adolescents is presented. In particular, the authors focus on studies on facial emotion recognition and facial mimicry, as social interaction difficulties might be a result of not recognizing emotions in facial expressions and inadequate facial mimicry. Although clinical trials investigating the efficacy of psychological treatments for NSSI among adolescents are lacking, especially those targeting the capacity to cope with emotions, clinical implications of the improvement in implicit and explicit emotion regulation in the treatment of NSSI is discussed. Given the impact of emotion regulation skills on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, neurobiological and psychophysiological outcome variables should be included in clinical trials.

DE Youth welfare institutions; Goal attainment scaling; Child behavior
   checklist
AB Background: Evaluating youth welfare services is vital, both because of the considerable influence they have on the development of children and adolescents, as well as owing to the extensive financial costs involved, especially for child residential care. In this naturalistic study we have undertaken to evaluate changes in various behaviors of young people who are in youth welfare institutions, not only by using standardized questionnaires, but also specifically modified goal attainment scales (GAS). These scales were meant to represent the pedagogical objectives of youth welfare professionals as well as the individual goals of the young people in care.
   Methods: Goal attainment scales were used to ascertain behavioral changes in 433 children and adolescents (age 6 to 18 years) in 25 youth welfare institutions (day care and residential care) in Germany. Social and individual goals were rated by young people and caregivers together on at least two occasions. In addition, to examine potential problems of children and adolescents, quality of life as well as mental health and behavior problems were identified by the caregiver and also by the youth using a self-report inventory.
   Results: Many of the children and adolescents had experienced critical life events, problems in school, impaired quality of life, along with mental health and behavior problems (range: 41-87%). During their stay in day care or residential care institutions, children and adolescents showed some improvement in social goals (Cohen's d = 0.14-0.44), especially those young people with deficits at the beginning, and with regard to mental health and problem behavior (d = 0.10-0.31). For individual goals, progress was even more pronounced (d = 0.75). Improvements to social goals were more pronounced if mental health and behavior problems decreased. This link to changes in behavioral and emotional problems was only ascertained to a limited extent for individual goals.
   Conclusions: Young people residing in youth welfare institutions achieved individual and social goals and improved with regard to behavior problems. The applied goal attainment scales are well suited for measuring individual change in children and adolescents and constitute a relevant addition to established instruments. Furthermore, their advantages include cooperative goal setting, the assessment of goals by caregivers and young people, and congruence with the pedagogical objectives of professionals.

AB Quality of maternal care in infancy is an important contributing factor in the development of behavior and psychopathology. One way maternal care could affect behavioral trajectories is through environmentally induced epigenetic alterations within brain regions known to play prominent roles in cognition, emotion regulation, and stress responsivity. Whereas such research has largely focused on the hippocampus or hypothalamus, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has only just begun to receive attention. The current study was designed to determine whether exposure to maltreatment or nurturing care is associated with differential methylation of candidate gene loci (bdnf and reelin) within the medial PFC (mPFC) of developing and adult rats. Using a within-litter design, infant male and female rats were exposed to an adverse or nurturing caregiving environment outside their home cage for 30 min per day during the first postnatal week. Additional littermates remained with their biological caregiver within the home cage during the manipulations. We observed that infant rats subjected to caregiver maltreatment emitted more audible and ultrasonic vocalizations than littermates subjected to nurturing care either within or outside of the home cage. While we found no maltreatment-induced changes in bdnf DNA methylation present in infancy, sex-specific alterations were present in the mPFC of adolescents and adults that had been exposed to maltreatment. Furthermore, while maltreated females showed differences in reelin DNA methylation that were transient, males exposed to maltreatment and both males and females exposed to nurturing care outside the home cage showed differences in reelin methylation that emerged by adulthood. Our results demonstrate the ability of infant-caregiver interactions to epigenetically mark genes known to play a prominent role in cognition and psychiatric disorders within the mPFC. Furthermore, our data indicate the remarkable complexity of alterations that can occur, with both transient and later emerging DNA methylation differences that could shape developmental trajectories and underlie gender differences in outcomes.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is an internationally recognized and widely used screening instrument consisting of 25 items that address positive and negative behavioral attributes of children and adolescents. This paper investigates some of the psychometric properties of the German parent-rated SDQ examining preschool-age children. The sample consisted of 1,738 children -840 girls and 898 boys - between 3 and 5 years of age. Parents completed the SDQ and gave basic demographical information. All subscales were sufficiently homogeneous. Principal component analysis suggested both a five-factor solution (replicating the original five-factor structure) and a three-factor solution. Confirmatory factor analyses showed a better fit for the five-factor model than for the three-factor model. A comparison between the preschool sample and the German normative sample revealed differences in some subscales. Furthermore, there were gender differences in almost all subscales, with boys showing significantly higher problem scores than girls (except for emotional symptoms) and lower scores on the prosocial behavior scale. Parental education proved to be associated with SDQ scores. This study confirmed that the parent-rated SDQ is a reliable and useful instrument for preschoolers and is recommended for screening purposes.

AB Objective: Bullying has become a major national concern, particularly as it affects children with disabilities. The current study aimed to determine the association between psychiatric comorbid conditions, involvement in bullying (victim, bully, or bully-victim), and the immediate psychological correlates of bullying among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Methods: A national sample of 1221 parents completed a survey dedicated to the bullying and school experiences of their child with ASD, reporting on the immediate consequences of bullying involvement, including their child's psychological well-being and any psychiatric comorbidity. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine whether specific psychiatric comorbidities were associated with an increased risk of involvement as victim, bully, or bully-victim. Analyses of variance determined the relationship between bullying frequency and psychological functioning. All models adjusted for child and school covariates. Results: Children who were frequently victimized were more likely to present with internalizing symptoms, whereas children who frequently bullied others were more likely to exhibit emotion regulation problems. Children who were identified as frequent bully-victims presented with both internalizing symptoms and emotion regulation problems. Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression were more likely to have been victimized, whereas children with conduct disorder (CD) or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) were more likely to have bullied other children. Children identified as bully-victims were more likely to have ADHD, CD, or ODD. Conclusions: Children with ASDs who had displayed bullying behaviors in the past month exhibited psychological impairments, including psychiatric comorbidity. The frequency of bullying behaviors was significantly associated with the level of impairment. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 34:1-8, 2013)

AB Background/Aims: Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. The aims of the study were: to investigate the level of anxiety in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to identify factors associated with the presence of that emotional problem. Methods: CKD children on hemodialysis (HD, n=22), peritoneal dialysis (PD, n=20,) and on conservative treatment (CT, n=95) were enrolled in the study. We used State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for adolescents and STAI-C for children. Socio-demographic and physical factors were assessed. Results: There was a significantly higher level of anxiety-state among HD children (8-12 years) compared with other groups of participants of the same age and Polish population norms. The level of anxiety among adolescents (13-18 years), both anxiety-state and anxiety-trait, was significantly higher in the HD group compared with other groups, which did not differ among themselves. In the HD adolescents, there was a correlation between the anxiety-state and the duration of the disease as well as with the number of hospitalizations. PD adolescents in the mainstream education had higher levels of anxiety-state and anxiety-trait compared with home schooled patients. Conclusions: Even though children and adolescents with CKD are at risk of developing a variety of emotional disorders, the level of anxiety among the researched group, with the exception of HD patients, was not significantly different than the level of anxiety among healthy subjects. Adolescents on HD who present a high level of anxiety should undergo long-term psychological treatment. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Studies show that ADHD, conduct disorders, and anxiety disorders are clinical disorders mostly diagnosed in schoolstarters. The preschool medical examination in Bremen was therefore extended by behavioral screenings. Based on their screening results from the SEU,(health examination for school entry) 2011 in Bremen, 67 preschoolers were tested for behavioral disorders. Subsequently, children with behavioral or emotional symptoms (N = 56) were compared to symptomfree controls (N = 52) for their cognitive, motoric, linguistic, and social-emotional development. Psychosocial health was obtained through external assessment by the parents and kindergarten teachers. Results of the WPPSI-III, M-ABC-2, and ET 6-6 were included in the analysis. 32 children met the criteria for behavioral disorders. Children with behavioral or emotional symptoms showed significant lower scores on tests measuring cognitive, motoric, linguistic and emotional development compared to controls. Results suggest that there is necessity to screen all preschoolers for behavioral disorders before entering school. Because children with clinical or subclinical behavioral disorders showed major developmental deficits compared to children without behavioral symptoms, it is essential to conduct a multiple assessment on children with suspected behavioral disorders to ensure early developmental support and adequate interventional programs.

AB Attention Deficit-/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence, often accompanied by comorbid disorders. A high standard of diagnostic assessment combined with a demand for valid diagnostic instruments is necessary. The K-SADS-PL is an established semi-structured interview, focusing on the categorical assessment of psychiatric disorders. The aim of the following study was to examine specific characteristics of ADHD symptomatology including functional and behavioral assessment. Therefore correlations between the result in a diagnostic interview (K-SADS-PL) and different ADHD-specific instruments were performed. Groups were formed (exposed vs. unexposed), based on the diagnostic finding in the K-SADS-PL. Group-specific test score differences were calculated and compared by multivariate analyses of covariance. Children with ADHD showed a significantly higher impact of conduct and emotional problems than the unexposed group. Health related quality of life was more impaired in children and families suffering from ADHD which refers to the relevance of family-oriented psychotherapy.

AB Experiences of maltreatment during childhood and the emergence of sexuality during adolescence are both critical developmental issues that intersect in meaningful ways, yet the two are often isolated from each other in practice. Despite the prevalence of childhood maltreatment, sexuality education does not accommodate young people with trauma histories. This results in curricula and content that ignore the particular needs and experiences of a proportion of students in sexuality education classrooms. Trauma interventions commit a similar oversight by neglecting the prospects for positive, growth-promoting sexual experiences and relationships among young people who have been abused. The failure to account for young people's resilience in the sexual domain results in treatment approaches that emphasise sexual risks (e.g. revictimisation) and problem behaviours to the exclusion of guidance in cultivating positive sexualities. Consequently, many forms of sexuality education and maltreatment interventions may be of limited effectiveness and relevance in promoting the future sexual well-being of young people with histories of trauma. To redress this gap, we advocate for trauma-informed sexuality education, an approach that acknowledges past experiences of abuse, the promise of resilience, and young people's right to positive sexualities.

AB War experiences are associated with the risk of long-term mental health problems. The War-affected Youths (WAYS) Study comprises a cohort of 539 youths (61% male) aged between 18 to 25 (at baseline) randomly sampled from the population of war-affected youths in northern Uganda. The study aims to chart the trajectory of long-term mental health consequences of war and the roles of individual, family, and community contextual risk and protective factors in influencing the course of mental health using Social Ecology Model, thus, addressing both the individual and its social ecology. Knowledge of postwar contexts may inform policy and guide interventions on postwar psychosocial adjustment and reintegration in conflict-prone Great Lakes region of Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, DR Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic, and South Sudan). Two waves of data collection have been conducted and more data collection is planned. At baseline, information on demographic characteristics, pre-war experiences, psychosocial outcomes, coping, stigma/discrimination, family and community acceptance and relationship, family functioning, and post-war experiences were obtained. At follow-up, information on general health, gender-based violence, PTSD, social skills, trauma memory quality, rumination, self-esteem, and psychosocial outcomes were collected. Approval to access the data can be obtained on application to the Principal Investigator upon submission of a research proposal with ethical approval from the applicant's institution. This research is funded by Wellcome Trust and Gulu University.

AB AIM: To explore age-related changes in symptoms and quality of life (QoL) of women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
   METHODS: Two-hundred and fifty-four female adult outpatients with IBS attending the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between January, 2008 and October, 2008 were approached. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery, mental illness or those who had recently taken psychotropic drugs were excluded. A physician obtained,demographic and abdominal symptom data. All patients were asked to complete the Zung Self-Rated Anxiety and Depression Scale (SDS/SAS) and the IBS-specific QoL questionnaire. The patients were divided into six groups according to age, in 10-year increments: 18-27 years, 28-37 years, 38-47 years, 48-57 years, 58-67 years and 68-75 years (maximum 75 years). Age-related differences of abdominal pain or discomfort were analyzed using rank-sum tests. Differences in SDS/SAS and IBS-QoL scores between age groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Pearson's correlations evaluated potential associations between IBS symptoms, psychological factors and QoL in each age group.
   RESULTS: There were no differences in the distribution of IBS subtypes between age groups (chi(2) = 20.516, P = 0.153). Differences in the severity of abdominal pain/discomfort with age were statistically significant (chi(2) = 25.638, P < 0.001); patients aged 48-57 years, 58-67 years or 68-75 years had milder abdominal pain/discomfort than those in the younger age groups. The severity of anxiety or depressive symptoms did not differ between age groups (SDS, chi(2) = 390.845, P = 0.110; SAS, chi(2) = 360.071, P = 0.220). Differences of IBS-QoL scores were statistically significant between age groups (chi(2) = 1098.458, P = 0.011). The scores of patients in the 48-57-year group were lower than those in the 18-27-year and 28-37-year groups (48-57-year group vs 18-27-year group, 74.88 +/- 8.76 vs 79.76 +/- 8.63, P = 0.021; 48-57-year group vs 28-37-year group, 74.88 +/- 8.76 vs 79.04 +/- 8.32, P = 0.014). The scores in the 68-75-year group were lower than those in the 18-27-year, 28-37-year and 38-47-year groups (68-75-year group vs 18-27-year group, 71.98 +/- 9.83 vs 79.76 +/- 8.63, P = 0.003; 68-75-year group vs 28-37-year group, 71.98 +/- 9.83 vs 79.04 +/- 8.32, P = 0.002; 68-75-year group vs 38-47-year group,71.98 +/- 9.83 vs 76.44 +/- 8.15, P = 0.039). Anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with QoL in all age groups (SDS and QoL: 18-27-year group, r = -0.562, P = 0.005; 28-37-year group, r = -0.540, P < 0.001; 38-47-year group, r = -0.775, P < 0.001; 48-57-year group, r = -0.445, P = 0.001; 58-67-year group, r = -0.692, P < 0.001; 68-75-year group, r = -0.732, P < 0.001. SAS and QoL: 18-27-year group, r = -0.600, P = 0.002; 28-37-year group, r = -0.511, P < 0.001; 38-47-year group, r = -0.675, P < 0.001; 48-57-year group, r = -0.558, 58-67-year group, P = 0.001; r = -0.588, P < 0.001; 68-75-year group, r = -0.811, P < 0.001). A negative correlation between abdominal pain severity and QoL was found in patients aged more than 58 years (58-67-year group, r = -0.366, P = 0.017; 68-75-year group, r = -0.448, P = 0.048), but not in younger patients (18-27-year group, r = 0.080, P = 0.716; 28-37-year group, r = -0.063, P = 0.679; 38-47-year group, r = -0.029, P = 0.812; 48-57-year group, r = -0.022, P = 0.876).
   CONCLUSION: Factors affecting QoL should always be treated in IBS, especially emotional problems in young adults. Even mild abdominal pain should be controlled in elderly patients. (C) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

AB An important aspect of successful emotion regulation is the ability to adjust emotional responses to changing environmental cues. Difficulties with such adaptation may underlie both marked symptoms of behavioral inflexibility and frequent severe anxiety in the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Thirty children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD and 29 age-and intelligence quotient-matched controls completed a reversal learning paradigm following partial reinforcement Pavlovian fear conditioning, using a surprising air puff as the unconditioned stimulus. After initial reversal of cue contingencies, where a previously safe cue now predicted the air puff threat, the control group but not the ASD group responded more strongly to the new threat cue. The ASD group showed evidence for reversal learning only during later trials. Reversal learning in the ASD group was significantly negatively correlated with everyday symptoms of behavioral inflexibility but not with everyday anxiety. Understanding shared associations between inflexibility, anxiety, and autism, with regard both to clinical symptoms and neurobiological mechanisms, can provide important markers for better characterizing the substantial heterogeneity across the autism spectrum.

AB Although adolescents' emotional lives are thought to be more turbulent than those of adults, it is unknown whether this difference is attributable to developmental changes in emotional reactivity or emotion regulation. Study I addressed this question by presenting healthy individuals aged 10-23 with negative and neutral pictures and asking them to respond naturally or use cognitive reappraisal to down-regulate their responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Results indicated that age exerted both linear and quadratic effects on regulation success but was unrelated to emotional reactivity. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings using a different reappraisal task and further showed that situational (i.e., social vs. nonsocial stimuli) and dispositional (i.e., level of rejection sensitivity) social factors interacted with age to predict regulation success: young adolescents were less successful at regulating responses to social than to nonsocial stimuli, particularly if the adolescents were high in rejection sensitivity. Taken together, these results have important implications for the inclusion of emotion regulation in models of emotional and cognitive development.

AB Introduction While depression affects adolescents' psychological functioning and adjustment, studies of Hong Kong adolescents show that more than 20% of this population suffer from depressive symptoms. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed to examine how depressive mood was related to shyness, self-esteem and social support in a sample of 326 early Chinese adolescents. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. Participants completed the Children Depression Inventory (CDI), Children's Shyness Questionnaire (CSQ), Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale and five items measuring perceived social support. Results Based on the CDI cut-off point (=20) adopted in the West (Kovacs), 20.9% of the sample was classified as having depressive symptoms, a percentage that was double that reported in Western studies. Regression analyses results showed that shyness predicted depressive mood in the positive direction and self-esteem and perceived social support in the negative direction. Furthermore, a mediation model was established in which the effects of shyness on depressive mood were mediated by self-esteem and social support. Discussion Professionals should offer age-appropriate social skill training to shy adolescents who have low self-esteem and poor peer relationship.

AB The current study examined reciprocal parent child emotion-related behaviors and links to child emotional and psychological functioning. Fifty-four mothers, fathers, and children (7 to 12 years old) participated in four emotion discussions about a time when the child felt angry, happy, sad, and anxious. Supportive emotion parenting (SEP), unsupportive emotion parenting (UEP), and child adaptive/maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) behaviors were coded using Noldus behavioral research software (Noldus Information Technology, 2007). Parents were more likely to follow children's adaptive emotion regulation with supportive versus unsupportive emotional responses and children were more likely to show adaptive versus maladaptive emotion regulation in response to supportive emotion parenting. Interaction patterns involving unsupportive emotion parenting related to child psychological and emotional outcomes. The results provide empirical support for an evocative person-environment framework of emotion socialization and identify the ways in which particular patterns of interaction relate to psychological functioning in youth.

AB Objective: To build on Achenbach, Rescorla, and Ivanova (2012) by (a) reporting new international findings for parent, teacher, and self-ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report, and Teacher's Report Form; (b) testing the fit of syndrome models to new data from 17 societies, including previously underrepresented regions; (c) testing effects of society gender, and age in 44 societies by integrating new and previous data; (d) testing cross-society correlations between mean item ratings; (e) describing the construction of multisociety norms; (f) illustrating clinical applications. Method: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) of parent, teacher, and self-ratings, performed separately for each society; tests of societal, gender, and age effects on dimensional syndrome scales, DSM-oriented scales, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems scales; tests of agreement between low, medium, and high ratings of problem items across societies. Results: CFAs supported the tested syndrome models in all societies according to the primary fit index (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation [RMSEA]), but less consistently according to other indices; effect sizes were small-to-medium for societal differences in scale scores, but very small for gender, age, and interactions with society; items received similarly low, medium, or high ratings in different societies; problem scores from 44 societies fit three sets of multisociety norms. Conclusions: Statistically derived syndrome models fit parent, teacher, and self-ratings when tested individually in all 44 societies according to RMSEAs (but less consistently according to other indices). Small to medium differences in scale scores among societies supported the use of low-, medium-, and high-scoring norms in clinical assessment of individual children. J. Am. Acad. Child Aclolesc.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Emotion Regulation Training (ERT), a 17-session weekly group training for adolescents with borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms. Method: One hundred nine adolescents with borderline traits (73% meeting the full criteria for BPD) were randomized to treatment as usual only (TAU) or ERT TAU. Outcome measurements included severity of BPD symptoms, general psychopathology, and quality of life. Multilevel analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. Clinical significant change was determined by normative comparisons on a primary outcome measurement. Results: Independent of treatment condition, the two groups improved equally on the severity of BPD symptoms, general psychopathology and quality of life. Nineteen percent of the ERT group was remitted according to the cutoff score after treatment (at 6 months) versus 12% of the control group. Follow-up assessments in the ERT group at 12 months showed some further improvement (33% remittance). With regard to predictors of outcomes, adolescents with higher levels of depression or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or oppositional-defiant disorder at baseline and who reported a history of abuse had worse outcomes, regardless of treatment condition. The attrition rate for the ERT sessions was remarkably low (19%). Conclusions: Early interventions for BPD symptoms in adolescence are feasible and necessary. No additional effect of ERT over TAU could be demonstrated in the present study. There is a dear need for developing effective interventions for adolescents with persistent BPD symptomatology.

AB National surveys indicate high rates of suicidal ideation in youth, especially among females. Coping skill training programs hold promise as a potential intervention that can help young people better manage stress and not consider suicide as a solution to life's problems. To assess the promise of this strategy, the present research examined which coping strategies (if any) predicted reduction in youth suicidal ideation over a 1-year follow-up, and explored the potential pathways through which their influence was channeled. Two waves of panel data from a nationally representative sample of youth, assessed 1 year apart (N = 710; Mean age = 18 years) were analyzed separately by gender using multiple group path analytic procedures. Four coping strategies, namely problem solving, emotional regulation, support seeking and acceptance were found to predict reduction in suicidal ideation among both males and females. However, the influence of these strategies (at baseline) was channeled through distinct pathways. The effect of emotional regulation (and acceptance) was channeled through its use at follow-up and was mediated by reductions in perceived stress and depressive symptoms, leading to reduction in suicidal ideation. The influence of support seeking was also channeled through its more recent use at follow-up, but directly predicted reduction in suicidal ideation, with no effect on perceived stress or depressive symptoms. The effect of problem solving on suicidal ideation was mediated by reduction in depressive symptoms, but was not channeled through its use at follow-up, suggesting a longer time course for the protective influence of this strategy. Finally, acceptance had a direct risk-enhancing effect on suicidal ideation. Coping strategies commonly used by youth can be effective in reducing suicidal ideation and therefore universal training in the effective use of these strategies should be considered. An understanding of the distinct pathways through which their effect on suicidal ideation is transmitted can better inform the design of youth suicide prevention interventions.

AB The aim of this study was (1) to examine whether childhood BMI is a significant predictor of restrained eating in preadolescents, (2) to investigate gender differences in restrained and emotional eating, and (3) to determine whether emotional problems, and body esteem were related to eating problems of preadolescents. In this longitudinal study with two measurement points, data from 428 children (50% female) were used. At time 1 (t1) children were on average 5.9 years old. BMI was assessed using objective measures. At time 2 (t2) participants were 12 years old. The adolescents and their parents completed questionnaires assessing restrained and emotional eating, body esteem, emotional problems, and BMI. Multiple regression analysis showed that restrained eating was significantly predicted by t1 BMI, by change in BMI between t1 and t2, and t2 body esteem. Emotional eating was, as expected, not predicted by t1 BMI, but associated with t2 body esteem and t2 emotional problems. Gender was not a significant predictor. The stability of BMI between childhood and preadolescence and its ability to predict restrained eating suggests that it is important to start prevention of overweight, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating at an early age.

AB Taxonomies of child, youth, and family care are needed for the adequate comparison of the effectiveness and usefulness of care and treatment programs. Until now, no systematic overview has been made of the taxonomies available and their outcomes. The aim of this paper is to systematically summarize the evidence available about taxonomies for child, youth, and family care. We searched the literature published during the period 1990-2011 in the databases Medline, PsycInfo, SocIndex, and Eric, using various terms related to the content of care. We identified 894 publications, out of which 13 met the inclusion criteria. The taxonomies identified always included the following aspects: the recipients of care and treatment, the intervention content, the intensity and complexity of the care arrangements, and the environment in which the intervention took place. Most of the taxonomies showed a structure with domains and sub-axes which were intended to enhance feasibility in practical applications. However, the empirical data concerning their use in daily practice were scarce. We concluded that several rather similar taxonomies were available but that the feasibility of such systems in daily care required more attention. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives The present study had two primary aims: (a) to test the mediating role of anger regulation in the relation between family processes and externalizing problems; (b) to test the moderating role of culture (specifically, independent and interdependent self-construals) in the relation between anger regulation and symptomatology via a moderated mediation model. Design The sample comprised 166 Korean American adolescents (54.2% male), who were recruited from the Midwestern region of the United States. Adolescents ages ranged from 11-15 years old (M = 13.0 years; SD = 1.2). Cross-sectional data were collected via adolescent self-report questionnaires. Results Results indicated that the anger regulation variables (either individually or collectively) mediated the influence of family processes (i.e., family conflict, family cohesion, and father-adolescent communication) on externalizing problems. Moreover, 2 indirect effects on externalizing problems were conditional upon adolescents independent self-construal. Conclusions These findings suggest that clinical intervention efforts for addressing externalizing problems may benefit from targeting anger regulation strategies. However, such interventions should be tailored to consider cultural context, since mediation effects may be moderated by cultural factors such as self-construal.

AB Agnew (1992, 2002, 2009) developed the general strain theory, considering the aggressive, deviant, delinquent phenomena as belonging to several individual and environmental factors. This model draws on theories of Merton (1938), Cohen (1955), and Cloward & Ohlin (1960), while it is also linked to the literature on stress. Thus, the forms of crime that may arise would be the result of the individual perception from the environment considered as dangerous, painful and harmful. This environment affects and promotes deviant emotions such as anger or fear, from which crime would be an adaptive response. Similarly, internal and external factors, such as self-esteem, self-efficacy, intelligence, social support, moral beliefs, previous criminal activities and association with delinquent peers can be considered as relational conditions between strains and delinquency. The elements that characterize the strains are the denial of positive goals, the removal of positive stimuli and the presentation of negative stimuli. These factors would, in fact, describe and explain the deviant behavior among offenders and can be applied to a wide range of people. In a similar vein, the model of Blevins, Listwan, Cullen, & Jonson (2010) updates Agnew's general strain theory to apply it to prisoners, according to the principles of adaptation and emotional regulation to explain violent behavior in prison. This model draws on theories related to the importation, deprivation and social control models, which are inherent to the prison life.

AB More complex models than those currently available are needed to guide research about childhood obesity. This article presents an interpersonal and intrapersonal risk model of child obesity, a transdisciplinary model of psychosocial risk factors that is based on work in developmental, family, and nutritional sciences. Two interpersonal realms of child development identified as being potentially significant for understanding the development and maintenance of overweight include the child's family and peer contexts. Child intrapersonal variables proposed as mediators between these contexts and weight outcomes include poor self-regulation and self-awareness, negative affect, and emotional or external eating. The article encourages developmental scientists to add their expertise to the study of childhood obesity by using models such as the one outlined here for the generation and testing of hypotheses so that future intervention efforts may be improved.

AB The current study expands upon the extant literature by examining the influence of contextual risk factors (e.g., parental psychological distress, household income, educational attainment) on parental responses to children's emotional experiences. Participants included 97 ethnically and demographically diverse mother-child dyads with children ranging in age from 7 to 12. Mothers reported indicators of supportive and unsupportive emotion socialization practices, and measures of child emotion regulation and emotion dysregulation. Higher scores on the familial risk index were positively related to increased emotion dysregulation and negatively related to decreased emotion regulation through mediated effects of mothers' unsupportive reactions to children's negative emotional expressions. These findings suggest the importance of considering contextual influences on the emotion socialization process and offer potential avenues to foster adaptive emotional development in the context of high risk.

The purpose of the present study was to develop a Turkish version of the CERQ and to examine its psychometric properties in a sample of Turkish university students. The English version of the CERQ was translated and back-translated prior to its administration to 396 participants recruited from several universities in Turkey. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability, inter-scale reliability, construct and criterion-related validity of the Turkish version were analyzed. The results indicated that the data collected with the Turkish version do also support the original nine-factor model; with reliability and validity measures comparable to the original one.

AB Expressive suppression is regarded as a generally ineffective emotion regulation strategy and appears to be associated with the development of depressive symptoms among adolescents. However, the mechanisms linking suppression to depressive symptoms are not well understood. The main aim of this study was to examine two potential mediators of the prospective relationship from depressive symptoms to expressive suppression among adolescents: parental support and peer victimization. Structural equation modelling was used to construct a three-wave cross-lagged model (n = 2,051 adolescents, 48.5 % female, at baseline; 1,465 with data at all three time points) with all possible longitudinal linkages. Depressive symptoms preceded decreases in perceived parental support 1 year later. Decreases in parental support mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and increases in expressive suppression over a 2-year period. Multi-group analyses show that the mediation model tested was significant for girls, but not for boys. No evidence for other mediating models was found. Although initial suppression preceded increases in depressive symptoms 1 year later, we did not find any evidence for the reversed link from suppression to depressive symptoms. Clear evidence for a reciprocal relationship between depressive symptoms and parental support was found. However, only limited and inconsistent support was found for a reciprocal relationship between depressive symptoms and peer victimization. Finally, although some evidence for a unidirectional relationship from parental support to increases in suppression was found, no significant prospective relationship was found between peer victimization and suppression. The implications of our clear results for parental support, and mostly lacking results for peer victimization, are discussed.

AB The transition period from primary to secondary school is a critical time in adolescent development. The high prevalence of adolescent mental health problems makes understanding the causal pathways between peer victimisation and internalising symptoms an important priority during this time. This article utilises data collected from self-completion questionnaires four times over 3 years from 3,459 students' aged 11-14 to examine directional relationships among adolescents as they transition from primary to secondary school, and investigates gender differences in these associations. The findings suggest depression in males is both a precedent and antecedent for victimisation over the transition period, whereas for females depression is an antecedent only. Anxiety is a both a precedent and antecedent for victimisation for males and females. To maintain emotional wellbeing and prevent peer victimisation, interventions prior to and during this transition period are critical, especially among adolescents experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety.

AB Poor executive function (EF) has been associated with a host of short- and long-term problems across the lifespan, including elevated rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, drug abuse, and antisocial behavior. Mindfulness-based interventions that focus on increasing awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and actions have been shown to improve specific aspects of EF, including attention, cognitive control, and emotion regulation. Reflecting a developmental neuroscience perspective, this article reviews research relevant to one specific mindfulness-based intervention, integrative body-mind training (IBMT). Randomized controlled trials of IBMT indicate improvements in specific EF components, and uniquely highlight the role of neural circuitry specific to the anterior cingulate cortex and the autonomic nervous system as two brain-based mechanisms that underlie IBMT-related improvements. The relevance of improving specific dimensions of EF through short-term IBMT to prevent a cascade of risk behaviors for children and adolescents is described and future research directions are proposed.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the relations between emotional competence and online game use in adolescents. This study is a cross-sectional descriptive survey using a convenience sample. The participants were 2199 adolescents in South Korea. Online game use and emotional competence including positive emotion, emotional expression, and emotional intelligence were measured. The study results indicated that emotional competence was negatively correlated with excessive online game use. All variables of emotional competence were significantly lower in high-risk users compared with general users. In addition, female adolescents were rated significantly higher in emotional competence among general users, but there were no significant gender differences among high-risk users. The results of our study imply that high-risk game users have lower levels of emotional intelligence than general users do. The results of this study suggest that emotion is an important factor to which practitioners in psychomedical fields and nursing should pay attention. Therefore, nurses in schools and communities should regularly screen the emotions of adolescents who habitually play online games and develop a program to enhance emotional competence associated with online games.

AB This study investigated the predictive utility of a six-dimensional conceptualization of emotion dysregulation for suicidal ideation, as well as its ability to distinguish among individuals with differing histories of suicidality. Young adults (N = 96) with current suicidal ideation but no suicide attempt history (n = 17), a history of a single (n = 20) or multiple attempts (n = 17), or no current ideation/no past attempts (n = 42) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, and a diagnostic interview. Multiple suicide attempters differed from participants with no suicidal ideation/no past attempts on two emotion dysregulation dimensions-nonacceptance of emotional responses and perceived limited access to emotion regulation strategies. After adjusting for depression symptoms and the presence of a mood or anxiety diagnosis, limited access to emotion regulation strategies significantly predicted current suicidal ideation, a relation that was found to be statistically mediated by hopelessness.

AB The aim of the present study was to find relevant coping factors for the development of psychological intervention programs for adolescents with a chronic medical condition. A wide range of coping techniques were studied, including cognitive coping, behavioral coping and goal adjustment coping. A total of 176 adolescents participated. They were contacted through social networking websites or Internet forums and through schools for children with a physical disability. Several cognitive and behavioral coping strategies and goal adjustment were found to be related to symptoms of depression. The cognitive coping strategies had the strongest influence on depressive symptoms. Especially self-blame, rumination and catastrophizing seemed to be important factors. If these findings can be confirmed, they could contribute to the focus and content of intervention programs for adolescents with a chronic medical condition.

AB Over the past decade, training in mindfulness-the intentional cultivation of moment-by-moment non-judgmental focused attention and awareness-has spread from its initial western applications in medicine to other fields, including education. This paper reviews research and curricula pertaining to the integration of mindfulness training into K-12 education, both indirectly by training teachers and through direct teaching of students. Research on the neurobiology of mindfulness in adults suggests that sustained mindfulness practice can enhance attentional and emotional self-regulation and promote flexibility, pointing toward significant potential benefits for both teachers and students. Early research results on three illustrative mindfulness-based teacher training initiatives suggest that personal training in mindfulness skills can increase teachers' sense of well-being and teaching self-efficacy, as well as their ability to manage classroom behavior and establish and maintain supportive relationships with students. Since 2005, 14 studies of programs that directly train students in mindfulness have collectively demonstrated a range of cognitive, social, and psychological benefits to both elementary (six studies) and high school (eight studies) students. These include improvements in working memory, attention, academic skills, social skills, emotional regulation, and self-esteem, as well as self-reported improvements in mood and decreases in anxiety, stress, and fatigue. The educational goals, target population, and core features of ten established mindfulness-based curricula are described. Finally, the need for more rigorous scientific evidence of the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions in K-12 education is discussed, along with suggestions of specific process, outcome, and research-design questions remaining to be answered.

AB Peer problems are common among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and may be exacerbated among those who are also anxious. Yet, few data exist on the nature and psychosocial correlates of peer victimization in youth with ASD and anxiety. Accordingly, this study investigated associations among peer victimization, loneliness, autism-related social impairment, and psychopathology in a sample of 60 youth (ages 11-14 years) with ASD and co-occurring anxiety. Youth completed measures of peer victimization, loneliness, anxiety, and depression, while their parent completed measures of child behavioral and emotional problems, functional impairment in daily life, and autism-related social impairment. Modest rates of victimization were noted, with similar to 7 % and 15 % of youth reporting clinically significant relational and reputational victimization but 0 % of participants endorsing significant overt victimization. Peer victimization was directly but modestly associated with some psychosocial maladjustment indices, but not with autism-related social impairment. Although results have to be considered in the context of certain limitations, these data suggest that peer victimization may be associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness in children with ASD and comorbid anxiety.

AB This study examined the relationships among adolescents' emotion regulation strategies (suppression and cognitive reappraisal), self-concept, and internalizing problems using structural equation modeling. The sample consisted of 438 early adolescents (13 to 15 years old) in Taiwan, including 215 boys and 223 girls. For both boys and girls, suppression was negatively associated, and cognitive reappraisal was positively associated with self-concept. Self-concept negatively predicted adolescents' internalizing problems. The findings support the hypothesis that self-concept mediates the relationship between emotion regulation and internalizing problems. These findings support generalization of one part of Cicchetti's and Toth's model of the development of internalizing problems to an Asian culture.

AB Background: Tourette syndrome is a combined motor and vocal tic disorder that begins in childhood and takes a chronic course. It arises in about 1% of all children, with highly varying severity. Transient and usually mild tics are seen in as many as 15% of all children in elementary school. The diagnosis is often delayed by several years.
   Methods: We selectively reviewed the pertinent literature, including the guidelines of the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome for the diagnosis and treatment of tic disorders.
   Results: Tic disorders usually take a benign course, with spontaneous improvement in adolescence in about 90% of patients. Psychoeducation is the basis of treatment in each case and almost always brings marked emotional relief. Specific treatment is needed only for more severe tics and those that cause evident psychosocial impairment. 80-90% of patients with Tourette syndrome have comorbidities (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation, autoaggression), which often impair their quality of life more than the tics do and therefore become the main target of treatment. There is little evidence for the efficacy of treatment for tics. Small-scale controlled studies with a brief follow-up period have been carried out for some neuroleptic drugs. Behavior therapy should be tried before drug treatment. A further option for very severely affected adults is deep brain stimulation.
   Conclusion: Because of the low level of the available evidence, no definitive recommendations can be made for the treatment of tics.

AB Background: Emotional problems such as anxiety and low mood in children are common, impair everyday functioning and increase the risk of severe mental health disorders in adulthood. Relatively few children with emotional health problems are identified and referred for treatment indicating the need to investigate preventive approaches.
   Methods/Design: The study is designed to be a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of an efficacious school-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) prevention program (FRIENDS) on symptoms of anxiety and low mood in children 9 to 10 years of age. The unit of allocation is schools which are assigned to one of three conditions: school-led FRIENDS, health-led FRIENDS or treatment as usual. Assessments will be undertaken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. The primary outcome measure is change on the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcome measures assess changes in self-esteem, worries, bullying and life satisfaction. An economic evaluation will be undertaken.
   Discussion: As of September 2011, 41 schools have been recruited and randomized. Final 12-month assessments are scheduled to be completed by May 2013.

AB Introduction
   Emotional Dysregulation(ED) is the decreased capacity to experiment and differentiate an ample range of emotions, as well as to Monitor, evaluate and modify intense emotional states. ED is associated with the most frequent emotional problems such as depression, anxiety, and with maladaptive behaviors thought-to serve an emotion and impulsivity regulating function, including deliberate self-harm. the Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was developed for adults, has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.93), and good test-retest reliability (r=0.88).
   Objectives
   TO translate and determine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the DERS (DERS-E) in a nonclinical Mexican adolescent's sample.
   Method
   455 students of a public junior high school in Mexico-City participated; the mean age was 13.1 +/-.95 years old. The Scale was administrated in groups of 40 students, who Concurrently answered the Spanish version of the following measures: Self-injury Schedule; ii) Beck Depression Inventory; and iii) Plutchik's Impulsivity Scale,
   Results
   The first confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) showed that the data did not replicate the original six factor structure with 36 items (chi(2)=2.2339.4, df=6, p<0.05). An exploratory factorial analysis showed that the data adjusted with a 24 items and 4-factor model (corroborated with a second CFA: chi(2)=259729, df=230, p>0.05); the subscales Cronbach a were from .85 to .68. The validity through contrasted groups and the correlation with concurrent scales showed significant results (Pearson's r of .51 to 76, p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   The DERS-E with adolescents did not replicate the fat-tonal structure of the original scale but showed a similor and multidimensional structure of four factor S and showed good psychometric,properties with respect to internal consistency and concurrent validity.

AB Although the quality of parent-adolescent emotional bonds has consistently been proposed as a major influence on young adult's psycho-emotional functioning, the precise means by which these bonds either facilitate or impede adaptive coping are not well-understood. In an effort to advance this inquiry, the present study examined interrelationships among measures of parental attachment, emotion regulation processes, and preferred coping strategies within a sample of 942 college freshmen. Structural Equation Modelling was used to test whether the link between attachment to parents and the use of particular coping strategies is mediated by differences in emotion regulation mechanisms. As hypothesized, differences in attachment to parents predicted differences in the use of emotion regulation mechanisms and coping strategies. More specifically, having a close emotional bond, feeling supported in autonomy processes and having (moderately) low levels of separation anxiety toward parents predict more constructive emotion regulation mechanisms and coping strategies. Additionally emotion regulation was found to (partly or totally) mediate the association between attachment and coping.

   The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the connection between perception of family financial status with some psychosocial internalized and externalized problems of high school students. The results for two subsamples of study which included 558 2nd grade students are presented: 70 students who perceive that their family has less or much less money than other families and 69 students who perceive that their family has more or much more money than other families.
   The youth who perceive that their family has less financial opportunities have more emotional problems and problems with peers, are less satisfied with their family relationships and are more exposed to psychological abuse by their parents. These two groups of high school students do not differ regarding experienced and committed peer violence, prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity, behaviour problems and experienced physical abuse by their parents. The results are analysed in the context of the youths' psychological vulnerability regarding poor financial family status.

AB The brain imaging literature suggests that child disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) are associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
   However, there is a lot of heterogeneity in findings in terms of direction of modifications identified until this point. The present study used a meta-analytic design to aggregate the empirical findings from the literature on functional and structural abnormalities of the ACC in children with DBD. A total of eight structural and functional brain imaging (sMRI and fMRI) studies were included and results obtained from a sample of 266 children show a large effect size (D = -.98 (95% CI [-1.18, -0.77]) in terms of reduced activation of the ACC in children presenting with DBD. Effects of ACC abnormality were moderated by: 1) the type of imaging used in the study (i.e., functional vs. structural); 2) the presence or absence of co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); 3) the mean age of the samples of children presenting with DBD. Overall, findings confirm functional impairments of the ACC in children with DBD and highlight the importance of using such neurological information to design innovative treatments.

AB Recent years have seen increasing attention being paid to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. This article provides an overview of research in the field and its implications for an understanding of these children as a particularly vulnerable category. The existing research focuses primarily on investigating the children's emotional well-being from psychiatric and medical perspectives. Moreover, in these studies such emotional problems tend to be linked to previous and current traumatic experiences, in particular separation from their parents. By contrast, this article suggests that a critical need exists for research on unaccompanied children's life situations based upon exploration of their own perspectives.

AB According to a literature of theory and advocacy, immigration and resettlement jeopardize the mental health of children and youth, largely because of factors such as intergenerational tensions arising from conflicts about the retention of traditional values, and experiences of prejudice and discrimination. The current study examines the specificity of these putative mental health risks to the immigration experience. The level and predictors of emotional problems among preadolescent Ethiopians living in immigrant families in Toronto, Canada, were compared with a matched sample of Ethiopian youngsters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data came from structured interviews with the person most knowledgeable about the family (usually a parent), as well as from the children themselves. Youth reported higher levels of emotional problems (EP) than their parents. Predictors differed for parent and child ratings. In both the Toronto and Addis Ababa samples, parental mental health predicted parent-rated, but not self-rated EP. Contrary to immigration stress theory, parental perceptions of prejudice predicted EP in Addis Ababa, but not Toronto, and parent-child discordance regarding ethnic adherence were predictors of self-rated emotional problems in Ethiopia, but not in Canada. Perceived discrimination was a significant predictor of self-rated emotional problems in both settings. Implications for theory and further research are discussed.

AB The World Health Organization estimates that 50% of the 30 million HIV infections worldwide occurred in young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years. In the United States, national statistics estimate that almost 40% of new HIV cases occur in youth ages 13-29 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Therefore, a focus on preventing HIV/AIDS among adolescents and young adults is warranted. There has been success in developing efficacious interventions for adolescents that reduce HIV sexual risk behaviors; however, the HIV incidence rates among adolescents remain alarming. This article identifies four areas of intervention development that remain underdeveloped and may guide the next generation of HIV prevention interventions. Family-based interventions, addressing health disparities and understanding the social determinants of health for adolescents, expanding the theoretical models that are relied on in developing interventions, and utilization of new technologies each have promise for successfully assisting adolescents to reduce their risk behaviors and enhance protective factors.

AB This study tracked the clinical course of 124 children receiving trauma systems therapy (TST). In addition, exploratory analyses compared hospitalization rates before and after implementation of the model and comparative cost savings were estimated. Children ages 3-20 who experienced potentially traumatic events received TST intervention. Measures of clinical course, children's psychiatric and psychosocial functioning, and social-environmental stability were taken at intake, 4-6 months, and 12-15 months. Exploratory analyses of cost savings were evaluated by comparing pre- and post-implementation hospitalization rates and lengths of stay for children under the care of the county mental health department. Emotion regulation, social-environmental stability, and child functioning/strengths improved significantly with treatment. Improvement in child functioning/strengths and in social-environmental stability significantly contributed to overall improvement in emotion regulation. Children who became stable enough to transition to office-based services during early treatment tended to stay in treatment and continued to improve. The number of children needing crisis-stabilization services at 15 months was reduced more than half for those who completed treatment. Poorer baseline emotion regulation was associated with hospitalization, and poorer social-environmental stability predicted fewer days-to-hospitalization. Exploratory analyses show that post-implementation hospitalization rates dropped 36% and average length of stay decreased by 23%, suggesting that further exploration of potential cost savings is warranted. These findings underscore the clinical importance of intervention and long-term treatment to stabilize the social environment of children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress, and emphasize the potential cost effectiveness of an intensive, community-based treatment approach at the county level.

AB Context: Epidemiologic studies of adults show that DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is a highly prevalent and seriously impairing disorder. Although retrospective reports in these studies suggest that IED typically begins in childhood, no previous epidemiologic research has directly examined the prevalence or correlates of IED among youth.
   Objective: To present epidemiologic data on the prevalence and correlates of IED among US adolescents in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement.
   Design: United States survey of adolescent (age, 13-17 years) DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders.
   Setting: Dual-frame household-school samples.
   Participants: A total of 6483 adolescents (interviews) and parents (questionnaires).
   Main Outcome Measures: The DSM-IV disorders were assessed with the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI).
   Results: Nearly two-thirds of adolescents (63.3%) reported lifetime anger attacks that involved destroying property, threatening violence, or engaging in violence. Of these, 7.8% met DSM-IV/CIDI criteria for lifetime IED. Intermittent explosive disorder had an early age at onset (mean age, 12.0 years) and was highly persistent, as indicated by 80.1% of lifetime cases (6.2% of all respondents) meeting 12-month criteria for IED. Injuries related to IED requiring medical attention reportedly occurred 52.5 times per 100 lifetime cases. In addition, IED was significantly comorbid with a wide range of DSM-IV/CIDI mood, anxiety, and substance disorders, with 63.9% of lifetime cases meeting criteria for another such disorder. Although more than one-third (37.8%) of adolescents with 12-month IED received treatment for emotional problems in the year before the interview, only 6.5% of respondents with 12-month IED were treated specifically for anger.
   Conclusions: Intermittent explosive disorder is a highly prevalent, persistent, and seriously impairing adolescent mental disorder that is both understudied and undertreated. Research is needed to uncover risk and protective factors for the disorder, develop strategies for screening and early detection, and identify effective treatments.

AB Adolescents are anecdotally sensitive to peer rejection. Many people can vividly recall, even as adults, instances during their teenage years in which they were excluded by a particular clique or left 'out of the loop' about parties or social plans. Rejection is undoubtedly part of the social landscape in adolescence, but why do young people find it quite so distressing? One possibility is that ongoing brain development in regions involved in emotional processing, emotion regulation, and social cognition may contribute to this phenomenon. This development could have far-reaching implications, not just for how adolescents respond to rejection, but for mental health during this crucial and formative stage of development.

AB Purpose: To describe trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents and to identify early indicators of these trajectories using data from routine well-child assessments at ages 0-4 years.
   Methods: Data from three assessment waves of adolescents (n = 1,816) of the TRAILS were used (ages: 11-17 years). Information on early indicators (at ages 0-4 years) came from the records of the well-child services. Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems were based on the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist and the adolescent-reported Youth Self-Report, filled out at ages 11, 14, and 17 years. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive value of these early indicators on trajectories.
   Results: For boys and girls, we found four trajectories for each outcome: one with high problem levels, and three with middle-high, middle-low, and low levels. For emotional problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by parental educational level and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, sleep problems were predictive in boys and language problems in girls (odds ratios between 1.53 and 7.42). For behavioral problems, the type of trajectory was predicted by maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental educational level, and parental divorce or single parents, for both genders. Moreover, for boys, early behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity problems were predictive (odds ratios between 1.64 and 5.43).
   Conclusions: Trajectories of emotional and behavioral problems during adolescence are rather stable and can be predicted by a parsimonious set of data from early well-child assessments. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB The present study employs a mixed methods approach to understanding the psychological functions and contexts of music use. Seventy-six emerging adults selected a single piece of music that they considered personally significant and elaborated on the reasons for this significance in response to written prompts. A constant comparative analysis of these retrospective accounts revealed three major themes. Specifically, participants selected music that helped them cope with a transition, facilitated self-reflection, or elicited positive memories. Additionally two metathemes emerged: participants selected music with lyrics that resonated with their own experiences or that helped them feel less alone. Quantitative analyses revealed systematic differences between the three major themes. Results are discussed in light of the psychological functions music may serve.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychopathological influence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in Korean 19-year-old males. Materials and Methods: The authors compared the Korean military multiphasic personal inventory (KMPI) military profiles of 211 CHD cases (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, or combined CHD) with the KMPI profiles of 300 normal controls. The CHD group was also divided according to whether or not the subjects had undergone open cardiac surgery in order to evaluate the psychopathological effects of an operation among the subjects. Results: A decreased result on the faking-good response scale and an increased result on the faking-bad response were observed in the CHD group compared to the control (p<0.01). The neurosis scale results, including anxiety, depression and somatization symptoms, were markedly increased in the CHD group compared to the control (p<0.01). The severity level of personality disorder was also increased in the CHD group (p<0.001). Differences in KMPI scale scores were not related to open cardiac surgery history. Conclusion: In this study, young males with CHD tended to report more abnormal results on the multiphasic personal inventory test in comparison to normal subjects, suggesting that CHD may be related to psychopathology in young males in Korea. Therefore, clinicians are recommended to evaluate the psychopathological traits of patients with CHD.

AB Background Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder causing intellectual disability. Children with WS often exhibit various kinds of maladaptive behaviours that affect their social functioning. In order to determine whether these behaviours are syndrome-specific, it would be necessary to compare children with WS with children with other syndromes as well as to provide data on the socio-emotional profile in WS from a variety of cultures. The present study investigated the behavioural profile and its relation to maternal stress in Greek young children with WS in comparison with young children with Down syndrome and typically developing (TD) children. Methods Participants were 60 mothers, 20 in each syndrome group and 20 in the control group. The three groups were matched for mental age. The behavioural profile of the participants was investigated through the Child Behaviour Checklist (1.55 years) and maternal stress through the Parental Stress Index. Results In accordance with studies in other cultures, it was found that young children with WS received significantly higher rates in emotional problems and anxiety/depression, compared with both children with Down syndrome and TD children. Moreover, mothers of children with WS reported significantly higher scores in the Total Stress index compared with mothers of TD children. However, in contrast with previous studies, only 25% of children with WS fell into the clinical range in the total Child Behavior Checklist score. Conclusion The consistency of the socio-emotional characteristics of children with WS across cultures and developmental stages implies a strong influence of the genetic phenotype. However, Greek mothers avoided to characterize these behaviours as pathological. Implications of these findings for clinical practice are also discussed.

AB Academic performance during the first years of school lays the groundwork for subsequent trajectories of academic success throughout childhood and adolescence. The current study tests a model according to which a gene-parenting correlation in the first 3 years of life is associated with subsequent psychosocial adjustment and then academic performance in the first grade (as indicated by teachers' assessment of academic behavior and two subscales of the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement, Third Edition). Drawing on multiple waves of data from the Durham Child Health and Development Study, we find that risk alleles for dopamine receptor genes (dopamine receptor D4 for girls, dopamine receptor D2 for boys) are associated with less sensitive parenting. For girls, parenting mediates the link between dopamine receptor D4 and all academic outcomes. There is some indication that parenting also influences girls' withdrawn behavior in the classroom, which in turn influences teachers' assessments of academic performance. For boys, some evidence suggests that parenting is associated with emotion regulation, which is associated with teachers' assessments of academic behavior and both subscales of the Woodcock-Johnson. Replications of this exploratory study are necessary, but these findings provide a first step in understanding how evocative correlations in the home may predict indicators of psychosocial adjustment that in turn influence performance and achievement at school.

AB Background: Irritable mood has recently become a matter of intense scientific interest. Here, we present data from two samples, one from the United States and the other from the United Kingdom, demonstrating the clinical and research utility of the parent- and self-report forms of the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI), a concise dimensional measure of irritability. Methods: The US sample (n = 218) consisted of children and adolescents recruited at the National Institute of Mental Health meeting criteria for bipolar disorder (BD, n = 39), severe mood dysregulation (SMD, n = 67), children at family risk for BD (n = 35), or were healthy volunteers (n = 77). The UK sample (n = 88) was comprised of children from a generic mental health setting and healthy volunteers from primary and secondary schools. Results: Parent- and self-report scales of the ARI showed excellent internal consistencies and formed a single factor in the two samples. In the US sample, the ARI showed a gradation with irritability significantly increasing from healthy volunteers through to SMD. Irritability was significantly higher in SMD than in BD by parent-report, but this did not reach significance by self-report. In the UK sample, parent-rated irritability was differentially related to emotional problems. Conclusions: Irritability can be measured using a concise instrument both in a highly specialized US, as well as a general UK child mental health setting.

AB Introduction: Severe mood dysregulation and problems (SMP) in otherwise typically developing youth are recognized as an important mental health problem with a distinct set of clinical features, family history and neurocognitive characteristics. SMP in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have not previously been explored. Method: We studied a longitudinal, population-based cohort of adolescents with ASD in which we collected parent-reported symptoms of SMP that included rage, low and labile mood and depressive thoughts. Ninety-one adolescents with ASD provided data at age 16 years, of whom 79 had additional data from age 12. We studied whether SMP have similar correlates to those seen in typically developing youth. Results: Severe mood problems were associated with current (parent-rated) and earlier (parent- and teacher-rated) emotional problems. The number of prior psychiatric diagnoses increased the risk of subsequent SMP. Intellectual ability and adaptive functioning did not predict to SMP. Maternal mental health problems rated at 12 and 16 years were associated with SMP. Autism severity as rated by parents was associated with SMP, but the relationship did not hold for clinician ratings of autistic symptoms or diagnosis. SMP were associated with difficulty in identifying the facial expression of surprise, but not with performance recognizing other emotions. Relationships between SMP and tests of executive function (card sort and trail making) were not significant after controlling for IQ. Conclusions: This is the first study of the behavioural and cognitive correlates of severe mood problems in ASD. As in typically developing youth, SMP in adolescents with ASD are related to other affective symptoms and maternal mental health problems. Previously reported links to deficits in emotion recognition and cognitive flexibility were not found in the current sample. Further research is warranted using categorical and validated measures of SMP.

AB The present study was designed to test whether the beneficial effects of emotion regulation (ER) have less to do with the use of singular, adaptive strategies and more to do with using a range of strategies. Using a community sample of adolescents (N = 177, M = 13.6 years), groups based on five measures of ER (reappraisal, suppression, concealing, emotional engagement, and adjusting) were created through latent profile analysis. A six-group model was the best fit. As hypothesized, ER profiles with high scores on one or two indicators were associated with higher levels of internalizing problems, whereas profiles with average to high scores on several indicators and high scores on adjusting were associated with lower levels of internalizing problems (depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety). Results highlight the importance of having different ER strategies to use and that a limited ER repertoire in adolescence may be associated with internalizing problems.

AB In this study, deaf children's understanding of their own emotions was compared with that of hearing peers. Twenty-six deaf children (mean age 11 years) and 26 hearing children, matched for age and gender, were presented with various tasks that tap into their emotion awareness and regulation (coping) regarding the four basic emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear). The findings suggest that deaf children have no difficulties in identifying their own basic emotions and the elicitors, or multiple emotions of opposite valence (happy and sad). Yet, they did show an impaired capacity to differentiate between their own emotions within the negative spectrum, which suggests a more generic evaluation of the situation. Deaf children's emotion regulation strategies showed a strong preference for approaching the situation at hand, but almost no deaf child reported the use of an avoidant tactic in order to diminish the negative impact of the situation. Overall, deaf children's emotion regulation strategies seemed less effective than those of their hearing peers. The implications for deaf children's emotional development are discussed.

AB The acquisition of affect regulation skills is often impaired or delayed in youth with mental health problems but the relationship between affect dysregulation and risk behaviors has not been well studied. Baseline data from adolescents (N = 417; ages 13-19) recruited from therapeutic school settings examined the relationship between affect dysregulation, substance use, self-cutting, and sexual risk behavior. Analyses of covariance demonstrated that adolescents who did not use condoms at last sex, ever self-cut, attempted suicide, used alcohol and other drugs and reported less condom use self-efficacy when emotionally aroused were significantly more likely (p < .01) to report greater difficulty with affect regulation than peers who did not exhibit these behaviors. General patterns of difficulty with affect regulation may be linked to HIV risk behavior, including condom use at last sex. HIV prevention strategies for youth in mental health treatment should target affect regulation in relation to multiple risk behaviors.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in youth with chronic daily headache (CDH) and to examine relationships between psychiatric status and CDH symptom severity, as well as headache-related disability.
   Methods: Standardized psychiatric interviews (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, KSADS) were conducted with 169 youth ages 10-17 diagnosed with CDH. Participants provided prospective reports of headache frequency with a daily headache diary and completed measures of symptom severity, headache-related disability (PedMIDAS) and quality of life (PedsQL).
   Results: Results showed that 29.6% of CDH patients met criteria for at least one current psychiatric diagnosis, and 34.9% met criteria for at least one lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. No significant relationship between psychiatric status and headache frequency, duration, or severity was found. However, children with at least one lifetime psychiatric diagnosis had greater functional disability and poorer quality of life than those without a psychiatric diagnosis.
   Discussion: Contrary to research in adults with chronic headaches, most youth with CDH did not appear to be at an elevated risk for comorbid psychiatric diagnosis. However, patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis were found to have higher levels of headache-related disability and poorer quality of life. Implications for treatment are discussed.

AB Empirical evidence shows that no sharp change in cognitive functioning or in offending careers occurs on the 18th birthday. Many aspects of higher executive functioning, including impulse control, planning ahead, reasoning, thinking before acting, emotion regulation, delay of gratification, abstract thinking, and verbal memory, as well as resistance to peer influence, continue to mature through the mid-20s. Most young offenders naturally "grow out" of offending in the early 20s, which is the peak period for desistance. Adult court processing makes offenders worse; convictions are followed by an increase in offending, juveniles who are dealt with in adult court are more likely to reoffend than other juveniles, and sending young people to adult prisons leads to an increase in recidivism. The evidence suggests that the rehabilitative approach of the juvenile court is more successful than the punitive approach of the adult criminal court.

AB Because school violence is widespread, social and emotional competence must be targeted. Second Step is a social and emotional violence-prevention curriculum that teaches prosocial skills and reduces aggressive behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Second Step implementation on students (N = 403) in preschool through fourth grade who were predominately Latino, English language learners, and from families with low socioeconomic status. The data of 165 out of the 403 students were included in the present study. Analyses consisted of paired-samples t-tests to identify changes in social and emotional knowledge and behavioral and emotional risk. Results showed that there was a significant increase in both social and emotional knowledge and behavioral and emotional risk following the implementation of Second Step. These results are discussed with regard to previous and future research, limitations, and implications for school practice. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objective. Compulsive exercise is suggested to be a strategy to regulate emotions. This suggestion has never been studied in adolescents. Therefore, this study examined the cross-sectional association between emotion regulation and compulsive exercise attitudes in adolescents. Design. A cross-sectional design was employed for this study. Method. A sample of 1,630 adolescent boys and girls completed self-report measures of compulsive exercise, emotion regulation, and disordered eating attitudes, as part of ongoing research into exercise and eating attitudes in adolescents. Results. Compulsive exercise was significantly associated with emotion regulation, after controlling for disordered eating attitudes. Among boys, compulsive exercise was associated with internal functional, internal dysfunctional, and external functional emotion regulation strategies. In girls, internal functional and internal dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies predicted compulsive exercise. Conclusions. Adolescents compulsivity towards exercise is positively associated with different emotion regulation strategies. More work is needed to identify whether emotion regulation strategies longitudinally predict compulsive exercise.

AB Executive function (EF) abilities are increasingly recognized as an important protective factor for children experiencing adversity, promoting better stress and emotion regulation as well as social and academic adjustment. We provide evidence that early life adversity is associated with significant reductions in EF performance on a developmentally sensitive battery of laboratory EF tasks that measured cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control. Animal models also suggest that early adversity has a negative impact on the development of prefrontal cortex-based cognitive functions. In this study, we report EF performance 1 y after adoption in 2.5- to 4-y-old children who had experienced institutional care in orphanages overseas compared with a group of age-matched nonadopted children. To our knowledge, this is the youngest age and the soonest after adoption that reduced EF performance has been shown using laboratory measures in this population. EF reductions in performance were significant above and beyond differences in intelligence quotient. Within the adopted sample, current EF was associated with measures of early deprivation after controlling for intelligence quotient, with less time spent in the birth family before placement in an institution and lower quality of physical/social care in institutions predicting poorer performance on the EF battery.

AB Background: Sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as a common problem for children and adolescents with chronic pain conditions, but little is known about the prevalence, type, and impact of sleep problems in pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The objectives of the current study were two-fold: 1) to describe the pattern of sleep disturbances reported in a large sample of children and adolescents with FGIDs; and, 2) to explore the impact of sleep by examining the inter-relationships between sleep disturbance, physical symptoms, emotional problems, and functional disability in this population.
   Methods: Over a 3-year period, 283 children aged 8-17 years who were diagnosed with an FGID and a primary caretaker independently completed questionnaires regarding sleep, emotional functioning, physical symptoms, and functional disability during an initial evaluation for chronic abdominal pain at a pediatric tertiary care center. A verbal review of systems also was collected at that time. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the pattern of sleep disturbances reported, while structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test theorized meditational relationships between sleep and functional disability through physical and emotional symptoms.
   Results: Clinically significant elevations in sleep problems were found in 45% of the sample, with difficulties related to sleep onset and maintenance being most common. No difference was seen by specific FGID or by sex, although adolescents were more likely to have sleep onset issues than younger children. Sleep problems were positively associated with functional disability and physical symptoms fully mediated this relationship. Emotional symptoms, while associated with sleep problems, evidenced no direct link to functional disability.
   Conclusions: Sleep problems are common in pediatric FGIDs and are associated with functional disability through their impact on physical symptoms. Treatments targeting sleep are likely to be beneficial in improving physical symptoms and, ultimately, daily function in pediatric FGIDs.

AB The present study examined the relationships between the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies, physical-verbal aggression and depression in a sample of 248 adolescents. Specific emotion regulation strategies such as acceptance, rumination and catastrophizing explained significant variance in depression in adolescents. With respect to physical-verbal aggression, our results showed that the use of self-blame and rumination only predicted levels of aggression in boys but not girls. Regarding gender differences, girls tend to ruminate and to report more catastrophic thoughts than boys. Our findings suggest a profile of cognitive emotion regulation strategies related to physical-verbal aggression and depressive symptoms which might be taken into account in future socio-emotional learning programs for adolescents.

AB The typically positive relationship between cognitive reappraisal and psychological functioning may be nullified for Latinos embedded within multiple contexts of oppression (Perez & Soto, 2011). Multiply oppressive contexts are characterized by exposure to oppression at a societal level (distal oppression), in the immediate environment (proximal oppression), and at an individual level (personal oppression). We replicated and extended Perez and Soto's (2011) findings by examining whether the reappraisal-psychological functioning association was moderated by (a) relative numerical representation of Latinos within the environment (proximal oppression) and (b) personal perceptions of discrimination (personal oppression) among 425 Latino college students throughout the United States. For Latinos in high-Latino counties, greater use of reappraisal was associated with better psychological functioning, regardless of perceived discrimination; this relationship was absent for Latinos in low-Latino counties who perceived greater discrimination. Findings highlight the importance of considering how contextual factors can alter the adaptive functions of emotion regulation strategies.

AB Background: Despite the relatively high prevalence of marijuana use among college students, little information exists regarding health outcomes associated with different use patterns or trajectories.
   Methods: Seven annual personal interviews (Years 1-7) were administered to 1253 individuals, beginning in their first year in college. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify trajectories of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco use frequency during Years 1-6. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between marijuana use trajectories and several Year 7 health outcomes, holding constant Year 1 health, demographics, and alcohol and tobacco use trajectories.
   Results: Six marijuana use trajectories were identified: Non-Use (71.5%(wt) of students), Low-Stable (10.0%(wt)), Late-Increase (4.7%(wt)), Early-Decline (4.3%(wt)), College-Peak (5.4%(wt)), and Chronic (4.2%(wt)). The six marijuana trajectory groups were not significantly different on Year 1 health-related variables, but differed on all ten Year 7 health outcomes tested, including functional impairment due to injury, illness, or emotional problems; general health rating; psychiatric symptoms; health-related quality of life; and service utilization for physical and mental health problems. Non-Users fared significantly better than most of the marijuana-using trajectory groups on every outcome tested. Chronic and Late-Increase users had the worst health outcomes.
   Conclusions: Marijuana use patterns change considerably during college and the post-college period. Marijuana-using students appear to be at risk for adverse health outcomes, especially if they increase or sustain a frequent pattern of use. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Though much is known about the stable mood patterns that characterize depressive disorder, less attention has been directed to identifying and understanding the temporal dynamics of emotions. In the present study, we examined how depression affects the trajectory of dysphoric and angry adolescent emotional behavior during adolescent-parent interactions. Adolescents (72 depressed; 69 nondepressed) engaged in video recorded positive and negative interactions with their parents. Depressed adolescents showed a linear increase in dysphoric behaviors throughout the negative interactions, while the incidence of these behaviors remained relatively stable across the interactions among nondepressed adolescents. A similar linear increase was not found in angry behavior. These findings show that depression in adolescence is associated with greater escalation of dysphoria during conflictual interactions between adolescents and their parents.

AB Objective: Although problem behavior in children and adolescents has frequently been associated with overweight, it is unclear whether this relationship is already present in early childhood. We hypothesized that problem behavior is positively related to body mass index (BMI) in children of preschool age and that eating behavior explains part of this relation. Methods: The study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort with data available on BMI and problem behavior for 3137 children aged 3 to 4 years. Problem behavior was measured with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCI), and eating behavior was assessed using the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between the CBCI (expressed as z-scores). CEBQ, and BMI standard deviation scores (BMI-SDS), Bootstrapping was used to formally test mediation. Results: Children with higher levels of emotional problems had a lower BMI-SDS after adjustment for relevant covariates (e.g. beta [95% confidence interval {CI}] for mother report of emotional problems = -0.04 [-0.07, -0.001], father report = -0.04 [-0.08, -0.001]). Behavioral problems were not associated with BMI. Emotional and behavioral problems were not associated with underweight or overweight if studied categorically. The effect estimate for the relation of emotional problems with BMI-SDS attenuated to nonsignificance after adjustment for specific eating behaviors, i.e., they were accounted for by satiety responsiveness, fussiness, and emotional undereating. Conclusion: In this population-based study, emotional problems in pre-schoolers were negatively related to BMI, and this relation was fully explained by food avoidant eating behaviors.

AB Previous research has shown negative affect and emotion dysregulation to be significant predictors of adverse outcomes. Because justice-involved adolescents have demonstrated more negative emotionality and fewer adaptive emotion regulation strategies than their non-justice-involved peers, they may be particularly susceptible to maladaptive behavior. The current study investigated the extent to which negative affect and facets of emotion dysregulation were associated with violence and risky sexual behavior. Participants included 94 justice-involved adolescents who were recruited while waiting for their court date and asked to complete several questionnaires. Results suggest that global negative affect and emotion dysregulation are not associated with violence or risky sexual behavior. However, specific aspects of negative affect (anger) and emotion dysregulation (impulse control difficulties) did predict violence. Examination of conditional effects also suggested that negative affect is significantly associated with violence and risky sexual behavior in adolescents who have specific difficulties regulating their emotions (e.g., poor emotional clarity and limited access to emotion regulation strategies). This study demonstrates the utility of examining negative affect and emotion regulation as heterogeneous constructs that interact in specific ways to predict violence.

ID HIV INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION
AB This manuscript assesses priorities and challenges of adolescent females by conducting a meeting with teen advisory board (TAB) members to collect information regarding their lives and experiences pre-, during and post-incarceration in a juvenile detention facility. Multiple themes emerged regarding the impact of incarceration on young African-American females, including experiencing a loss of personal liberties, the importance of making money upon release, unfaithfulness by partners on the 'outside', substance use and lack of control over their environment upon release, including parents, peers and male sexual partners. Based on feedback from TAB members, unique barriers and challenges were identified that suggested areas where adaptations to an evidenced-based HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) intervention would be justified to more adequately meet the needs of this particular subgroup of young African-American women. Adaptations to the evidence-based interventions included enhancing activities related to goal setting, emotion regulation skills, decision-making, recognizing and utilizing support networks and addressing the relationship between substance use and risky sexual behavior. Future health education efforts focusing on either the creation of new HIV/STD interventions or adaptations to existing interventions should consider utilizing advisory boards with members of the priority population at the earliest stages of intervention planning.

AB The present study examined whether and which facets of emotion dysregulation serve an intervening role in the association between prior victimization and risk perception in an analogue sexual assault vignette. Participants were 714 university women who completed self-report measures of sexual victimization, emotion dysregulation, and a computer-administered written vignette of a college party scene that culminates in acquaintance rape. Approximately 42% of the sample reported lifetime sexual victimization during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Two individual aspects of emotion dysregulation, limited access to emotion regulation strategies and impulse control difficulties, mediated the association between lifetime victimization and leaving the scenario later. Findings suggest the importance of emotion dysregulation in predicting risk perception among victims and of improving victims' emotion regulation skills in revictimization risk reduction interventions.

AB The importance of genetic and environmental influences on children's behavioral and emotional problems may vary as a function of environmental exposure. We previously reported that 12-year-olds with divorced parents showed more internalizing and externalizing problems than children with married parents, and that externalizing problems in girls precede and predict later parental divorce. The aim of the current study was to investigate as to whether genetic and environmental influences on internalizing and externalizing problems were different for children from divorced versus non-divorced families.
   Maternal ratings on internalizing and externalizing problems were collected with the Child Behavior Checklist in 4,592 twin pairs at ages 3 and 12 years, of whom 367 pairs had experienced a parental divorce between these ages. Variance in internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 3 and 12 was analyzed with biometric models in which additive genetic and environmental effects were allowed to depend on parental divorce and sex. A difference in the contribution of genetic and environmental influences between divorced and non-divorced groups would constitute evidence for gene-environment interaction.
   For both pre- and post-divorce internalizing and externalizing problems, the total variances were larger for children from divorced families, which was mainly due to higher environmental variances. As a consequence, heritabilities were lower for children from divorced families, and the relative contributions of environmental influences were higher.
   Environmental influences become more important in explaining variation in children's problem behaviors in the context of parental divorce.

AB We aimed to assess the prevalence (at three levels of severity) and other epidemiological data of OCD in a sample of 1,514 Spanish non-referred children. The estimated prevalence was 1.8% for OCD, 5.5% for subclinical OCD and 4.7% for DC symptomatology. We did not find significant differences between genders or academic grade regarding DC symptoms and OCD, but more subclinical prevalence was found in males than in females. Socio-demographic variables were not related to any level of OCD, but academic performance was significantly lower in clinical OCD. The co-morbidity between OCD and any psychiatric disorder was high (85%) and higher for emotional disorders than for behavioral disorders. The impairment was associated with comorbidity and was worse for OCD with comorbid emotional problems. The results suggest that OCD is not rare in school children and adolescents and that it has an impact on their personal functioning. We suggest the possibility of an early diagnosis and treatment.

AB The younger siblings of childbearing adolescents have poorer school outcomes and exhibit more internalizing and externalizing problems compared to their peers without a childbearing sister. We test a model where living with an adolescent childbearing sister constitutes a major family stressor that disrupts mothers' parenting and well-being, and through which, adversely affect youths' adjustment. Data came from 243 Latino younger siblings (62% female, M age 13.7 years) and their mothers, 121 of whom lived with a childbearing adolescent sister and 122 of whom did not. Individual fixed-effects models controlled for earlier measures of each respective model construct, thereby reducing omitted variable bias from pre-existing group differences. Results show that, for boys, the relationship between living with a childbearing adolescent sister and youth outcomes was sequentially mediated through mothers' stress and parenting (i.e., monitoring and nurturance). For girls, however, the relationship was mediated through mothers' monitoring only. Findings elucidate the within-family processes that contribute to the problematic outcomes of youth living with childbearing adolescent older sisters.

AB porter s., holmes v., mclaughlin k., lynn f., cardwell c., braiden h.-j., doran j. & rogan s. (2012) Music in mind, a randomized controlled trial of music therapy for young people with behavioural and emotional problems: study protocol. Journal of Advanced Nursing68(10), 23492358. Abstract Aims. This article is a report of a trial protocol to determine if improvizational music therapy leads to clinically significant improvement in communication and interaction skills for young people experiencing social, emotional or behavioural problems. Background. Music therapy is often considered an effective intervention for young people experiencing social, emotional or behavioural difficulties. However, this assumption lacks empirical evidence. Study design. Music in mind is a multi-centred single-blind randomized controlled trial involving 200 young people (aged 816 years) and their parents. Eligible participants will have a working diagnosis within the ambit of International Classification of Disease 10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders and will be recruited over 15 months from six centres within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services of a large health and social care trust in Northern Ireland. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard care alone or standard care plus 12 weekly music therapy sessions delivered by the Northern Ireland Music Therapy Trust. Baseline data will be collected from young people and their parents using standardized outcome measures for communicative and interaction skills (primary endpoint), self-esteem, social functioning, depression and family functioning. Follow-up data will be collected 1 and 13 weeks after the final music therapy session. A cost-effectiveness analysis will also be carried out. Discussion. This study will be the largest trial to date examining the effect of music therapy on young people experiencing social, emotional or behavioural difficulties and will provide empirical evidence for the use of music therapy among this population. Trial registration.similar to This study is registered in the ISRCTN Register, ISRCTN96352204. Ethical approval was gained in October 2010.

AB This longitudinal study had three objectives: (a) to identify different profiles of second-year middle school students (Grade 8) in terms of academic, emotional, and social adjustment; (b) to test the contribution of worries at the end of Grade 6 to distinguish these profiles; and (c) to examine the moderating effect of mastery (MG) and performance goal (PG) structures in language arts class (Grade 7). A total of 342 mother-adolescent dyads participated in the study. Cluster analyses revealed three adjustment profiles: a well-adjusted group (WA), a socioemotionally adjusted group (SEA), and a socially adjusted group (SA). Hierarchical multinomial regression analyses showed that students who expressed worries had a lower probability of being in the WA. However, students who had a teacher who emphasized MG had a greater probability of being in the WA. Finally, worries about peers and teachers lowered the probability of being in the WA for students exposed to PG. Results are discussed in light of their implications for the literature on student adjustment, the elementary-to-middle school transition, and classroom goal structure.

AB The BASC-2 Behavioral and Emotional Screening System Teacher, Child/Adolescent Form (BESS Teacher Form C/A; Kamphaus & Reynolds, 2007) is a brief teacher-report rating scale designed to identify students who are at-risk for behavioral and emotional problems. The aim of this study was to describe the latent dimensions that underlie the responses to the BESS Teacher Form C/A. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) across two random subsets of a nationally representative sample of 2,582 children aged 6 to 12 years suggested that the BESS Teacher Form C/A contains a four-factor latent structure consisting of Externalizing Problems, Internalizing Problems, School Problems, and Adaptive Skills.

AB The aim of the current study was to examine the role of socio-emotional adjustment and behavioral problems in eleven years old children; as well as their relationships with school achievement and academic competence in Primary School. Teachers and mothers completed the Social Battery (BAS, Silva, & Martorell, 1999) in a sample of 49 children that take part in a longitudinal study. School achievement was measured by standardized test and qualifications in reading and math. The academic competence was evaluated by teachers with a questionnaire (HRI, Keogh, Juvonen, & Bernheimer, 1989). The effect of intelligence was controlled by the IQ. These data showed that intelligence with socio-emotional adjustment were both of them necessary to explain school achievement and academic competences. Also, results showed agreement between mothers and teachers in positive social adjustment and withdrawing. There were discrepancies as to the effect of socio-emotional adjustment on academic competence and school achievement. These data suggest that mothers and teachers agree in their view of children's socio-emotional behavior, but only teachers' views were related to school achievement.

AB The experiences of eight young women with excess weight were explored using a semi structured interview consisting of open ended questions and also the Child Attachment Interview (CAI). Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis indicated four group themes around participants' experience of having excess weight; emotional regulation, focus on family relationships, lack of control and sense of self. The CAIs indicated that many of the young women had adopted a caring role in their families, which were often characterized by conflict within family relationships. Dismissing their own vulnerability and emotional needs in preference for self reliance was the dominant attachment strategy adopted by participants. It is suggested that obesity is a complex condition and one that requires an understanding of each individual's experiences and relationship with food, in order to offer treatment that is most likely to be effective.

AB Objective: DSM-V is on its way and doubts have been raised regarding the validity of pediatric PTSD. It is the goal of the current review to critically review the empirical literature on PTSD in youth.
   Method: A search of PsycINFO, PubMed and reference lists was conducted. Empirical information considered relevant regarding the validity of the criteria was collected.
   Results/Conclusions: The validity of the symptom criteria and clusters varies, with the Avoidance/Numbing cluster outperforming the Re-experiencing-and Arousal cluster. Factor analytic findings suggest that Arousal criterion D4 should be placed within the Re-experiencing cluster, and that the Avoidance/Numbing cluster should be split up. Some non-DSM-IV PTSD symptoms, among which guilt, have considerable validity in trauma-exposed youth and their inclusion in DSM-V PTSD should be considered. As for preschool children, alternative criteria are recommended that are more developmentally sensitive.

AB Exposure to stress is associated with a wide range of internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents, including aggressive behavior. Extant research examining mechanisms underlying the associations between stress and youth aggression has consistently identified social information processing pathways that are disrupted by exposure to violence and increase risk of aggressive behavior. In the current study, we use longitudinal data to examine emotion dysregulation as a potential mechanism linking a broader range of stressful experiences to aggressive behavior in a diverse sample of early adolescents (N = 1065). Specifically, we examined the longitudinal associations of peer victimization and stressful life events with emotion dysregulation and aggressive behavior. Structural equation modeling was used to create latent constructs of emotion dysregulation and aggression. Both stressful life events and peer victimization predicted subsequent increases in emotion dysregulation over a 4-month period. These increases in emotion dysregulation, in turn, were associated with increases in aggression over the subsequent 3 months. Longitudinal mediation models showed that emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship of both peer victimization (z = 2.35, p = 0.019) and stressful life events (z = 2.32, p = 0.020) with aggressive behavior. Increasing the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies is an important target for interventions aimed at preventing the onset of adolescent aggressive behavior.

AB The authors review the literature on sibling relationships in childhood and adolescence, starting by tracing themes from foundational research and theory and then focusing on empirical research during the past 2 decades. This literature documents siblings' centrality in family life, sources of variation in sibling relationship qualities, and the significance of siblings for child and adolescent development and adjustment. Sibling influences emerge not only in the context of siblings' frequent and often emotionally intense interactions but also by virtue of siblings' role in larger family system dynamics. Although siblings are building blocks of family structure and key players in family dynamics, their role has been relatively neglected by family scholars and by those who study close relationships. Incorporating study of siblings into family research provides novel insights into the operation of families as social and socializing systems.

AB Investigation of the role of adolescents' patterns of close relationships with significant adults may be of particular interest in populations with learning disabilities ("LD") during adolescence, because attachment relationship variables may act as risk or protective factors during this developmental period when trajectories are set that can lead to difficulties in adulthood. Specifically, this study examined a model of protective factors comprising patterns of close relationships between adolescents (n=369; 53 % female; aged 15-17) and significant adults (mother, father, homeroom teacher) for explaining adolescents' socioemotional and behavioral adjustment, comparing adolescents with and without LD. The current assessment of adolescents' socioemotional adjustment included both internalizing aspects (loneliness, affect, and internalizing behavior syndrome) and externalizing aspects (externalizing behavior syndrome). On most measures, significant group differences emerged between adolescents with LD (n=181) and adolescents with typical development (n=188). SEM analysis found high fit between the theoretical model and empirical findings. Both groups showed similar paths between adolescent-mother attachment and adolescent adjustment, whereas significant group differences emerged for the contribution of adolescents' close relationships with fathers and teachers to adolescents' adjustment. The discussion focuses on the possible unique value of close relationships with each attachment figure at home and at school for adolescents with LD versus typical development.

AB The aim of the study was to examine the social networks of sexual minority youths and to determine the associations between social networks and depressive symptoms. Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative cohort study of American adolescents (N = 14,212). Wave 1 (1994-1995) collected extensive information about the social networks of participants through peer nomination inventories, as well as measures of sexual minority status and depressive symptoms. Using social network data, we examined three characteristics of adolescents' social relationships: (1) social isolation; (2) degree of connectedness; and (3) social status. Sexual minority youths, particularly females, were more isolated, less connected, and had lower social status in peer networks than opposite-sex attracted youths. Among sexual minority male (but not female) youths, greater isolation as well as lower connectedness and status within a network were associated with greater depressive symptoms. Moreover, greater isolation in social networks partially explained the association between sexual minority status and depressive symptoms among males. Finally, a significant 3-way interaction indicated that the association between social isolation and depression was stronger for sexual minority male youths than non-minority youths and sexual minority females. These results suggest that the social networks in which sexual minority male youths are embedded may confer risk for depressive symptoms, underscoring the importance of considering peer networks in both research and interventions targeting sexual minority male adolescents.

AB Objective As the number of North Korean adolescent refugees drastically increased in South Korea, there is a growing interest in them. Our study was conducted to evaluate the mental health of the North Korean adolescent refugees residing in South Korea.
   Methods The subjects of this study were 102 North Korean adolescent refugees in Hangyeore middle and high School, the public educational institution for the North Korean adolescent refugees residing in South Korea, and 766 general adolescents in the same region. The Korean version of Child Behavior Check List (K-CBCL) standardized in South Korea was employed as the mental health evaluation tool.
   Results The adolescent refugees group showed a significantly different score with that of the normal control group in the K-CBCL subscales for sociality (t=29.67, p=0.000), academic performance (t=17.79, p=0.000), total social function (t=35.52, p=0.000), social withdrawal (t=18.01, p=0.000), somatic symptoms (t=28.85, p=0.000), depression/anxiety (t=13.08, p=0.000), thought problems (t=6.24, p=0.013), attention problems (t=4.14, p=0.042), internalized problems (t=26.54, p=0.000) and total problems (t=5.23, p=0.022).
   Conclusion The mental health of the North Korean adolescent refugees was severe particularly in internalized problems when compared with that of the general adolescents in South Korea. This result indicates the need for interest in not only the behavior of the North Korean adolescent refugees but also their emotional problem. Psychiatry Investig 2012;9:217-222

AB We examined the agreement between mothers and fathers with regard to their children's internalizing symptoms and tested predictors of rating discrepancies. The clinic sample included 181 children (ages 3 to 8) and their mothers and fathers who were participating in a parenting treatment study for children with behavioral problems. Mother father agreement for ratings of internalizing problems was found to be moderate and consistent with previous research. Regression analyses revealed that parental stress, but not depression, predicted some of the variance associated with mother father rating discrepancies. A gender effect was also found such that parent discrepancies were larger for girls than for boys. Much of the variance associated with rating discrepancies was left unexplained. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.

AB The Department of Education in South Africa has adopted the concept of whole school development in the delivery of basic education. Social connectedness in the school environment is central to this concept and is protective of mental well-being and can contribute to reducing high risk behaviour in adolescents. The aim of this study was to develop an in-depth understanding of factors impeding school connectedness in a public South African school as a case study, with the view to making recommendations for interventions for school connectedness. The study utilised an ecological perspective. In gauging participants' perceptions of factors that impede school social connectedness, four focus groups with Grade 10 learners and seven individual interviews with teachers and managers, were conducted. Factors impeding school connectedness at the community school management level were education policies, management practices and discipline strategies. Education policies were viewed as non-reflective of the diversity of South African schools. "Top-Down" Management practices were viewed as creating communication barriers, and discipline strategies were viewed as contributing to deviance. At the interpersonal level, peer pressure to belong to groups where learners resist school regulations were highlighted. It also emerged that adolescents are more likely to seek help for interpersonal problems or issues from informal sources such as peers and family. At the intrapersonal level self-regulation skills, emotional competence and a positive future orientation were reportedly poorly developed amongst learners and attributed to poor discipline and a lack of warmth at home, a focus on academics and assessment at school and perceptions of limited post-school opportunities. Key recommendations include the formation of a school liaison group to promote policies and management practices; building protective peer networks, and programmes to develop emotional competence, self-regulation skills and a sense of positive future orientation.

AB Aims: Our aim was to examine changes in distress symptoms and parenting dimensions among parents in child psychiatry services (clinic parents) (n = 102). Parents were followed from referral and admission to 3-month and 12-month follow-ups of "treatment-as-usual" at inpatient family clinics. These measurements were compared with a sample of community parent (n = 439) standards. Methods: Standardized questionnaires measuring the child's problems, parental anxiety and depression symptoms (distress), and warmth protectiveness and authoritarianism (parenting dimensions), were distributed to parents four times (T0-T1-T2-T3). The family clinics received families whose children had long-term problems and unsatisfactory previous treatment outcomes. Results: Clinic mothers, but not fathers, showed an improvement in distress symptoms at the 3-month (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-ups relative to at admission (T1). Nevertheless, clinic mothers displayed distress symptoms at all measurement points compared with community parents. Parents of children with learning/developmental problems and attention disorders showed significantly higher warmth scores at the 3-month and 12-month follow-up compared with at admission, although the levels remained lower than those of community parents. In contrast, parents of children with emotional problems showed the same level of warmth as community parents and lower levels of protectiveness, but no change in these parenting dimensions T1-T2. Implications: Parental emotional distress symptoms and parenting characteristics should be addressed systematically in child psychiatry to inform evaluations of the context of the child's problems and the family's treatment needs. Systematic and effective treatment components related to parenting should be implemented.

AB To date, the relation between anxiety and risky behavior engagement among adolescents is unclear. While some research has shown a positive association, other research has indicated that anxious symptoms and such engagement are inversely related. In the current multi-wave, longitudinal study, the prospective relationship between stress, anxiety symptom clusters, and risky behavior engagement is explored among a sample of adolescents (N = 151). Moreover, the study also examined the role of stress-reactive rumination as a potential moderator between the stress and anxiety mediational pathway. Preliminary analyses indicated that whereas boys' anxiety predicted subsequent risky behavior engagement, this relationship was not significant among girls. Additionally results of time-lagged, idiographic multilevel models indicate that in boys, but not girls, total, physical, and social anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between stress and risky behavior engagement. Further, stress-reactive rumination moderated the mediational pathway between stress and anxiety for the total and physical anxiety symptom scales. These findings suggest that among boys anxious symptoms may be the path through which stress predicts risky behavior engagement, particularly in total and physical symptoms, and moreover, stress-reactive rumination moderates the mediational pathway between stress and anxiety.

AB Caspi et al. (2003) found an interaction between the serotonin transporter polymorphism gene (5-HTTLPR) and stressful life events on depression. Subsequent attempts to replicate have been inconsistent. The present research included long allele variants modified by SNP rs25531 and tested the interaction on adolescents' trajectories of anxious/depressed symptoms, with consideration of possible age effects. Adolescents (N = 574), of whom 436 were genotyped, were followed from ages 12 to 17. Analyses demonstrated a G x E interaction in predicting the development of anxious/depressed symptoms. Specifically, adolescents with lower serotonin transcriptional efficiency (TE) genotypes whose mothers reported more stressful events were reported to show more anxious/depressed symptoms and greater increases in the development of symptoms of anxiety and depression than were higher TE adolescents, particularly at ages 16 and 17. Interactions did not differ by gender. Findings demonstrate that stress may affect adolescents' likelihood of experiencing anxious/depressed symptoms when they have a low serotonin TE (A/G-modified 5-HTTLPR) genotype and suggest that the vulnerability may be stronger in late than early adolescence.

AB The primary aim of this study was to assess the moderating role of emotion regulation in the relationship between some components of social information processing (hostile interpretation and anger) and aggressive behavior. The secondary aim was to assess whether emotion regulation, hostile interpretation, and anger account for gender differences in aggressive behavior. A total of 1,125 adolescents (627 girls) filled out the social information processing questionnaire to assess hostile interpretation, anger, and emotion regulation. Reactive and proactive aggressive behaviors were assessed by self- and peer reports. The results showed that adaptive regulation negatively predicted aggressive behavior and moderated the relationship between anger and reactive aggressive behavior. Boys' higher scores for aggressive behavior were accounted for by their higher scores for anger and lower scores for emotion regulation. However, the strength of the relationships among variables was similar for both boys and girls. Findings of this study indicate the importance of emotion regulation as a target for aggressive behavior interventions.

AB This study examined whether the relation of motherchild attachment with anxiety symptoms is mediated by emotion regulation (ER) processes (poor emotional awareness, biased interpretations of emotionally charged events, and coping strategies). Attachment patterns were assessed in a sample of eighty-seven 10- to 12-year-olds using story-stem interviews. Children who were less secure and more disorganized reported more anxiety. Attachment was also related to ER; security was associated with less difficulty identifying emotions, and disorganization was associated with more catastrophizing interpretations and less active coping. Anxiety symptoms were related to all three ER processes. Finally, relations of security or disorganization with anxiety symptoms were partially mediated by ER processes.

AB Background Although distinctive neuropsychological impairments have been delineated in children with chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), social skills and social cognition remain less well-characterised. Objective To examine social skills and social cognition and their relationship with neuropsychological function/behaviour and psychiatric diagnoses in children with 22q11DS. Methods Sixty-six children with 22q11DS and 54 control participants underwent neuropsychological testing and were administered the Diagnostic Analysis of Non-Verbal Accuracy (DANVA) for face and auditory emotion recognition, a measure of social cognition: their parents/guardians were administered the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) parent version, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) parent version and the Computerised Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (C-DISC). Results The 22q11DS group exhibited significantly lower social skills total score and more problem social behaviours, lower neurocognitive functioning, higher rates of anxiety disorders and more internalising symptoms than the control group. Participants with 22q11DS also exhibited significant deficits in their ability to read facial expressions compared with the control group, but performed no differently than the control participants in the processing of emotions by tone of voice. Within the 22q11DS group, higher social competency was correlated with higher global assessment of functioning and parental socio-economic status. Social competency was worse in those with anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more than two psychiatric diagnoses on the C-DISC and higher internalising symptoms. No significant correlations of SSRS scores were seen with IQ, executive functions, attention, or verbal learning and memory. No correlations were found between social cognition and social skill scores. Conclusion Our results indicate that social skills in children with 22q11DS are associated with behaviour/emotional functioning and not with neurocognition. Thus, treating the behaviour or emotional problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorders may provide a pathway for improving social skills in these children.

AB In many mentally ill children, a new phenotype of affective and behavioural dysregulation can be observed. Not much is known about development and maintenance of this phenotype. A possible risk factor that has been suggested is disturbed sleep. The co-occurrence of sleep disturbances and psychiatric symptoms is significant and it has been postulated that there are specific patterns of sleep disturbances for different psychiatric symptoms. The aim of this study, therefore, is to investigate the specific relation of sleep disturbances and affective dysregulation in school children and whether a specific pattern of sleep disturbances is associated with or of predictive value for affective dysfunctions. 4,774 school children took part in the Cologne Sleep Study and emotional disturbances and sleep abnormalities were assessed by parent reports. Of the sample, 206 children were identified as showing signs of severe affective and behavioural dysregulation (DP), 276 children were reported as showing a subclinical form (SUB-DP). Both groups reported significantly more sleep disturbances than healthy controls with moderate to large effect sizes. Differences between SUB-DP and DP exist, however, were not of clinical relevance (d < 0.03). Particularly, emotional problems were associated with sleep disturbances with small to moderate correlation coefficients. The regression analysis revealed a small, but significant influence of impaired daytime behaviour on affective dysregulation with 16.1 % of variance being explained. No specific patterns of sleep disturbances could be identified. However, impaired sleep and daytime behaviour in both the SUB-DP and DP group are indicated. Consequently, practitioners should address sleep problems in children with affective dysregulation.

AB Asian Americans (AAs) are the second largest foreign-born population in the United States. Contrary to the model minority stereotype that this group is unitarily well adjusted and high achieving, recent research has revealed substantial differences in mental health adjustment among AA children. Although research to identify the risk processes for mental health problems among AA children is underway, it has paid little attention to related asset and protective processes. This article selectively reviews the theory and empirical evidence on a set of child-, family-, and neighborhood-level characteristics for their potential asset or protective roles in AA children's mental health adjustment. These characteristics include (a) child factors (maintenance of heritage culture, bilingualism, coping, and emotion regulation), (b) family factors (authoritative parenting and parental support), and (c) a neighborhood factor (ethnic community). Overall, systematic efforts to identify asset and protective factors for AA children's mental health and understand the underlying developmental mechanisms are nascent. Directions for future research in this area are also discussed.

AB Purpose of review
   To provide an update on the mental health needs of children and adolescents with learning disabilities, by examining salient studies published predominantly in the last 12-18 months.
   Recent findings
   There have been further articles published supporting the findings of earlier landmark studies demonstrating an increased prevalence of mental health disorders in young people with learning disabilities. These articles suggest higher rates of comorbidity than were previously recognized. There are few published studies pertaining to the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments, although there is a recognition that the latter are more routinely and perhaps inappropriately administered. Antipsychotics are the most commonly prescribed group of medications and, despite a lack of evidence, continue to be prescribed more to address challenging behaviours rather than in the treatment of an identified psychiatric disorder. Reviews examining services and policies in other countries further highlight that the health and social care needs of individuals with learning disabilities are receiving more attention, with a shared vision that services should be inclusive and preferably community based.
   Summary
   Although there is improved knowledge of the rates of mental health disorders in young people with learning disabilities, in clinical practice these mental health needs continue to be underrecognized and untreated.

AB Although there is strong evidence for the effect of interparental conflict on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems, little is known about the effect on the quality of adolescents' relationships. The current study investigates the link between adolescents' friendships and interparental conflict as reported by both parents and adolescents. It considers early adolescents' emotion regulation ability and attachment security as mediators. The analysis is based on a longitudinal study with two waves separated by 12 months. The participants were 180 two-parent families and their adolescent children (50.5 % girls), the average age of the latter being 10.61 years (SD = 0.41) at the outset (Time 1). Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that perceived interparental conflict increased the risk of instability in friendship relationships across the 1-year period. Structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the association between perceived interparental conflict and friendship quality was mediated by emotion regulation and attachment security. The discussion focuses on mechanisms whereby interparental conflict influences early adolescents' friendship relationships.

AB The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) are widely used measures of internalising and externalising problems in children and adolescents, but cross-cultural differences in these problems have not been examined in Australian children of Chinese and Anglo-Celtic ancestry. Fifty-nine Chinese (27 boys and 32 girls) and 65 Anglo-Celtic Australian (35 boys and 30 girls) children aged 1013 years completed the YSR, and one of their parents completed the CBCL. Cross-informant agreement between these two measures was also examined. No differences were found between the Chinese and Anglo-Celtic groups on parents' and children's ratings on any syndrome or overall scales. The overall level of agreement between YSR and CBCL scores was poor in the Anglo-Celtic group (intraclass correlation coefficient for total problems = 0.33), but there was no agreement between these scores in the Chinese group. Results highlight the need to obtain multiple sources of information in assessments of mental health problems in children from different cultural backgrounds.

Participants (815 years) were 103 Ghanaian children from a village setting, 142 Ghanaian children from a middle-class urban context, 106 Kenyan children from an impoverished urban context, and 170 children from the United States in lower to middle-class urban areas (58.8% Caucasian). Children completed the Children's Anger and Sadness Management Scales (Zeman, Shipman, & Penza-Clyve, 2001) to assess emotion management (i.e., effortful control, over control, under control). Comparisons across nations indicated that Ghanaian youth reported more overt anger expression than youth from Kenya and the United States and less anger inhibition than Kenyan youth. U.S. children reported less overt expression and more constraint over sadness than Kenyan and Ghanaian children, although Kenyans reported being calmer when experiencing sadness than Ghanaian and American youth. Comparing Ghanaian regional contexts, village children reported more anger control than urban children. Regardless of nationality, boys reported more control over sadness than girls who reported more under control of sadness and more over control of anger than boys. Future research is needed to build on these descriptive, preliminary findings examining under-studied cross-national contexts.

AB Background: Computerised Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (cCBT) offers the potential to make evidence based interventions more available and accessible for children and young people. Research is currently limited and proof of concept studies are required to explore the viability and possible therapeutic benefits of cCBT as a universal or targeted intervention in schools. Method: In Study 1, cCBT was provided as a universal intervention to 13 participants who were assigned to either group cCBT or a matched computer gaming condition. In Study 2, cCBT was provided as a targeted intervention by trained school nurses to 12 participants with mild or moderate emotional problems. Results: Both studies found cCBT to result in immediate post intervention benefits and feedback about the programme was very positive. Conclusion: This study provides proof of concept that cCBT provided as a universal or targeted emotional health intervention in schools is viable and may result in immediate therapeutic benefits. These findings are limited by the small sample size and absence of follow-up but suggest that more methodologically robust evaluations should be pursued.

AB To test proposals regarding the hierarchical organization of adult attachment, this study examined developmental origins of generalized and romantic attachment representations and their concurrent associations with romantic functioning. Participants (N = 112) in a 35-year prospective study completed the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and Current Relationship Interview (CRI). Two-way analysis of variance tested interactive associations of AAI and CRI security with infant attachment, early parenting quality, preschool ego resiliency, adolescent friendship quality, and adult romantic functioning. Both representations were associated with earlier parenting and core attachment-related romantic behavior, but romantic representations had distinctive links to ego resiliency and relationship-specific romantic behaviors. Attachment representations were independent and did not interactively predict romantic functioning, suggesting that they confer somewhat distinctive benefits for romantic functioning.

AB We described unmet information and service needs of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors (15-39 years of age) and identified sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with these unmet needs.
   We studied 523 AYAs recruited from seven population-based cancer registries, diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, germ cell cancer, or sarcoma in 2007-2008. Participants completed surveys a median of 11 months from diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations between unmet (information and service) needs and sociodemographic and health-related factors.
   More than half of AYAs had unmet information needs relating to their cancer returning and cancer treatments. AYAs needing services, but not receiving them, ranged from 29 % for in-home nursing to 75 % for a support group. The majority of AYAs who needed a pain management expert, physical/occupational therapist, mental health worker, or financial advice on paying for health care did not receive services. In multivariable analyses, older participants, men, participants of non-white race/ethnicity, and participants who reported less than excellent general health or fair/poor quality of care were more likely to report unmet information needs. Factors associated with both unmet service and information needs included physical health or emotional problems interfering with social activities or having a parts per thousand yen3 physical treatment-related symptoms.
   Recently diagnosed AYA cancer survivors have substantial unmet information needs varying by demographic and health-related factors.
   We identified subgroups of AYA cancer survivors with high unmet needs that can be targeted for interventions and referrals.

AB Objective To examine orphan status, mental health, social support, and HIV risk among adolescents in rural Kenya. Methods Randomly selected adolescents aged 10-18 years completed surveys assessing sexual activity, sex-related beliefs and self-efficacy, mental health, social support, caregiver-child communication, time since parental death, and economic resources. Analysis of covariance and regression analyses compared orphans and nonorphans; orphan status was tested as a moderator between well-being and HIV risk. Results Orphans reported poorer mental health, less social support, and fewer material resources. They did not differ from nonorphans on HIV risk indicators. Longer time since parental death was associated with poorer outcomes. In moderator analyses, emotional problems and poorer caregiver-youth communication were more strongly associated with lower sex-related self-efficacy for orphans. Conclusions Orphans are at higher risk for psychosocial problems. These problems may affect orphans' self-efficacy for safer sex practices more than nonorphans. Decreased HIV risk could be one benefit of psychosocial interventions for orphans.

AB Research suggests that difficulties in emotion regulation are an important correlate of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adults. Research examining this link in adolescents is limited by the lack of comprehensive instruments to assess difficulties in emotion regulation. Against this background, the aims of the current study were to (a) confirm the six-factor structure of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 23(4), 253-263, 2004) in a sample of adolescent inpatients (N = 218); (b) explore the relation between different aspects of emotion dysregulation and lifetime NSSI while controlling for psychopathology and sex; and (c) assess the clinical utility of the DERS in detecting lifetime NSSI status. Fit indices obtained through Confirmatory Factor Analysis indicated that the six-factor structure of the DERS fit the data adequately and that most items loaded strongly on their respective latent factor. All six latent factors were significantly correlated with each other, with the exception of lack of emotional awareness and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavioral when distressed. Regression analyses revealed that only the limited access to emotion regulation strategies subscale accounted for a significant portion of the variance in NSSI when controlling for other aspects of emotion dysregulation, sex, and psychopathology. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis indicated that the DERS limited access to emotion regulation strategies subscale score has moderate diagnostic accuracy in detecting the presence of NSSI. The optimal cut-off score was 21.5 when detecting NSSI among inpatient adolescents. Results provide further support for the relation between emotion regulation difficulties and NSSI. The DERS appears to be a useful measure of detecting NSSI in clinical samples of adolescents.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, increased impulsivity and emotion dysregulation. Linkage analysis followed by fine-mapping identified variation in the gene coding for Latrophilin 3 (LPHN3), a putative adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor, as a risk factor for ADHD. In order to validate the link between LPHN3 and ADHD, and to understand the function of LPHN3 in the etiology of the disease, we examined its ortholog lphn3.1 during zebrafish development. Loss of lphn3.1 function causes a reduction and misplacement of dopamine-positive neurons in the ventral diencephalon and a hyperactive/impulsive motor phenotype. The behavioral phenotype can be rescued by the ADHD treatment drugs methylphenidate and atomoxetine. Together, our results implicate decreased Lphn3 activity in eliciting ADHD-like behavior, and demonstrate its correlated contribution to the development of the brain dopaminergic circuitry.

AB This research examines differential associations between attachment dimensions (anxiety and avoidance) and emotion regulation (ER) strategies (dysregulation and suppression) in middle childhood and early adolescence. Furthermore, the study investigates how attachment and ER relate to depressive symptoms and perceived parenting. Two cross-sectional studies (N = 339 and N = 746) supported the hypothesized associations between attachment anxiety and avoidance and emotional dysregulation and suppression, respectively. Mixed evidence was found for ER as a mediator in associations between attachment and depressive symptoms. Study 2 found that parental responsiveness and autonomy-support are related differentially to the attachment dimensions. The Discussion focuses on the dynamics involved in associations between parenting, attachment, ER, and depression and on directions for future research.

AB Objective Information on who uses antipsychotic medication is limited to cross-sectional data. The objective of this study was to study the patterns of psychopathology at age 8?years and antipsychotic use between the ages of 12 and 25?years. Methods A total of 5525 subjects from the Finnish Nationwide 1981 birth cohort were linked to the National Prescription Register and the Hospital Discharge Register between 1994 and 2005. Information about parent-reported and teacher-reported conduct, hyperkinetic and emotional symptoms, and self-reported depressive symptoms was gathered at age 8?years. Information about antipsychotic use and about psychiatric disorders treated in hospitals between the ages of 12 and 25?years was register based. Diagnostic classes of hospital treatment included non-affective psychoses, affective disorders, and other psychiatric disorders. Results The cumulative incidence of antipsychotic use by age 25?years was 2.8% among men (n?=?69) and 2.1% among women (n?=?55). In both sexes, living with other than two biological parents at age 8?years was associated with antipsychotic use, and three fourths of antipsychotic users had been treated for psychiatric disorders in a hospital. Among men, the most common hospital diagnosis was non-affective psychoses (44% of all antipsychotic users), and antipsychotic use was associated with childhood conduct problems. Among women, the most common hospital diagnosis was affective disorders (38% of all antipsychotic users), and antipsychotic use was associated with emotional problems and self-reported depressive symptoms in childhood. Conclusions Antipsychotic use in adolescence and young adulthood is different among men versus women both with regard to hospital diagnoses and childhood psychiatric problems.

AB Background and objectives: Risky decision making and disadvantageous choices constitute core characteristics of patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consequences include negative psychosocial and health-related outcomes. However, risky decision making and its interrelations with emotional states in ADHD are poorly understood. Therefore, the authors investigated risky decision making without and after boredom induction in adults with and without ADHD.
   Methods: In study 1, ADHD patients (n = 15) and age/education matched controls (CG; n = 16) were compared on the Game of Dice Task (GDT), an established task measuring decision making in unambiguous situations. In study 2, ADHD patients (n = 14) and CG (n = 13) underwent boredom induction prior to the GDT.
   Results: In study 1, ADHD patients selected the disadvantageous alternatives significantly more often than CG. In study 2, no significant group differences were found due to an increase in risky decision making in CG following the boredom induction.
   Limitations: Even if severity of depression did not affect our results, it may be necessary to compare GDT responses in ADHD patients with and without current depression.
   Conclusions: Risk as a motor of disadvantageous decision making needs to be taken into account in therapeutic contexts as a maintenance factor of dysfunctional behaviour. The findings of study 2 are in line with postulated alterations of emotional state adjustment in ADHD. The link between decisions making and emotional regulation in ADHD needs further attention in research. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in adolescence and they are the cause of considerable suffering. Even so, adolescents are not inclined to seek professional help for emotional problems. Internet-based preventive interventions have been suggested as a feasible method of providing appropriate care to adolescents with internalizing symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of preventive Internet-based (guided) self-help problem-solving therapy (PST) for adolescents reporting mild to moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety as compared to a waiting list control group (WL).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 45 participants were randomized to the 2 conditions. PST consisted of 5 weekly lessons. Participants were supported by e-mail. Self-report measures of depression and anxiety were filled in at baseline and after 3 weeks, 5 weeks, and 4 months. Of the 45 participants, 28 (62.2%) completed questionnaires after 3 weeks, 28 (62.2%) after 5 weeks, and 27 (60%) after 4 months. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed overall improvement over time for both groups on depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, no significant group x time interactions were found. No differences were found between completers and non-completers.
   Conclusions/Significance: Results show that depressive and anxiety symptoms declined in both groups. No support was found, however, for the assumption that Internet-based PST was efficacious in reducing depression and anxiety in comparison to the waiting list control group. This finding could represent lack of power.

AB This study examined attentional biases for emotional faces in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Twenty-one outpatient youth (aged 15-24 years) meeting three or more DSM-IV BPD criteria and 20 community-derived participants (aged 15-24 years) with no history of psychiatric problems and not meeting any BPD criteria completed a modified dot-probe task that tested automatic (30 ms) and controlled (500 ms) stages of information processing. The findings indicate that, compared with healthy controls, youth with borderline features were faster to respond to congruent rather than incongruent fear stimuli. This effect was independent of state anxiety and was observed during the 30 ms presentation of fearful faces. There was no significant effect for happy or angry faces. Youth with borderline features were also slower to respond to incongruent rather than paired neutral trials, indicating difficulties in disengaging attention from the perceived threat. Such differences were not found for the healthy controls. Thus, youth with borderline features had an attentional bias for fearful faces that reflected difficulty in disengaging attention from threatening information during preconscious stages of attention. This finding extends previous research highlighting the diminished capacity for affect regulation and subsequent engagement in behavioural strategies to avoid distress in BPD. Future research should explore the relationship between information processing, emotion regulation in adult BPD samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine the influence of aggressive behaviour scores on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors throughout childhood.
   Methods: This study utilized cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study (n = 2900). Aggressive behaviour scores were derived from the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18(CBCL), Youth Self-Report/11-18 (YSR) and Teacher Report Form/6-18 (TRF). CVD risk factors included body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting lipids and homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
   Results: Girls with higher aggressive behaviour scores had higher BMI from 10 years of age (P <= 0.001), higher BMI trajectories throughout childhood (P = 0.0003) and at 14 years higher HOMA-IR (P = 0.008). At the 14-year survey, this equated to a difference of 1.7 kg/m(2) in the predicted BMI between the extreme CBCL scores in girls (top 5% (CBCL >= 17) vs. CBCL score = 0). Boys with higher aggressive behaviour scores had higher BMI at 5 years (P = 0.002), lower diastolic pressure at 14 years (P = 0.002) and lower systolic blood pressure trajectories throughout childhood (P = 0.016).
   Conclusion: Aggressive behaviour influences BMI from early childhood in girls but not boys. If this association is causal, childhood offers the opportunity for early behavioural intervention for obesity prevention.

AB This research focuses on offspring's perceptions of their parents' usage of conditional regard and autonomy-supportive practices in response to the offspring's experiences of negative emotion. Participants were 174 college students (60% were females). As predicted from self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), students' perceptions of parents as hinging their regard on students' expression or suppression of negative emotions predicted a maladaptive pattern of emotion regulation and intimacy capacity. In contrast, autonomy-supportive parenting predicted more adaptive emotion regulation and intimacy patterns. Also as predicted, emotion-regulation mode mediated the relations between parental practices and intimacy capacity. The innovative aspect of the study is the finding that parents who use conditional regard to encourage children's expression (sharing) of negative emotions may actually undermine their children's socioemotional capacities.

AB The well-documented higher rates of depression among sexual minority youth are increasingly viewed by developmentalists as a byproduct of the stigmatization of sexual minority status in American society and of the negative impact this stigma has on the processes associated with depression. This study attempted to spur future research by testing Hatzenbuehler's (2009) psychological mediation framework to investigate the ways in which peer harassment related to sexuality puts young people at risk by influencing the cognitive, social, and regulatory factors associated with depression. Analyses of 15 year olds in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development revealed that sexual minority status was largely associated with depressive outcomes via harassment, which was subsequently associated with depression via cognitive and social factors. Results point to various avenues for exploring the importance of the social world and self-concept for the outcomes of sexual minority adolescents in the future.

AB Adolescents sometimes cut themselves to relieve distress; however, the mechanism is unknown. Previous studies have linked self-injury to deficits in processing emotions symbolically through language. To investigate expressive language of adolescent cutters, the authors analyzed 100 narratives posted on the Internet. Most narratives (n = 66) displayed idiosyncratic use of language indicating poor differentiation between the real and the symbolic, such as blood substituting for negative emotions, which can then be released from the self; or emotional pain magically transforming into physical pain, which can then be managed. This kind of magical thinking correlated with cutting to relieve distress, to see blood, and to feel pain, but negatively correlated with complex representation of people, understanding social causality, and self-esteem. The results suggest that magical thinking represents a pre-symbolic mental state that processes and organizes distressing emotions through body schema. Magical thinking thus provides a plausible mechanism for why cutting works. (C) 2012 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by elevated stress, heightened risky behaviors, and increases in psychopathology. Emotion dysregulation is a hypothesized contributor to negative outcomes and to the onset of psychopathology during adolescence. However, the dysregulation of negative emotion has been the focus of research while the literature on positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology is limited. This review highlights both the development of normative and dysregulated positive emotion during adolescence. First, the literature on normative adolescent emotional development and on negative emotional regulation is briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of current theories of positive emotion, which are grounded in the adult literature. From a developmental perspective, the dimension of approach motivation within positive emotion is emphasized throughout and frames the review. This conceptualization guides organization of literatures on normative experiences of positive emotion in adolescence and the role of dysregulated positive emotion in adolescent psychopathology, specifically adolescent depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, externalizing disorders and eating disorders. Last, future directions in the study of adolescent positive emotion and its regulation and the implications of highlighting approach motivation in normative and dysregulated positive emotion in adolescence are detailed.

AB Aim To investigate perceived maternal acceptance/rejection in a group of sexually abused children/adolescents. Quality of the relationship between caregiver and child has been linked to many behavioral and emotional problems of childhood. For those children/adolescents subject to sexual abuse, perceived parental acceptance/rejection is an important component of well being.
   Methods A total of 28 abused children/adolescents and their mothers participated in the study. The victims were sent by the court to the Uludag University Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department for psychiatric evaluation. Numerical variables are presented with mean and standard deviation, categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Nonparametric correlation analysis was used for the relationship between psychological adjustment and perceived parental acceptance of children.
   Results The results of the study show that there was a significant correlation among child and mother reports of perceived acceptance. Children/adolescents also displayed more psychological adjustment than maladjustment. According to the Children's Depression Inventory, 15 victims were depressed and 13 were not. There was no remarkable difference between depressed and non-depressed subjects in terms of depression scores. Overall, the results of the study showed that both abused children/adolescents and their mothers perceived a positive relationship as measured by Perceived Parental Acceptance and Rejection Questionnaire-Control scores.
   Conclusion The findings suggested that a well-established, healthy emotional bond is resilient to challenges, as was the case in the sexually abused children/adolescents of the study.

AB Objective: Parent and teacher ratings of core attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, as well as behavioral and emotional problems commonly comorbid with ADHD, were compared in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
   Method: Participants were 86 children (66 boys; mean: age = 9.3 years, intelligence quotient [IQ] = 84) who met American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) criteria for an ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Parent and teacher behavioral ratings were compared on the Conners' Parent and Teacher Rating Scales (CPRS-R; CTRS-R). The degree to which age, ASD subtype, severity of autistic symptomatology, and medication status mediated this relationship was also examined.
   Results: Significant positive correlations between parent and teacher ratings suggest that a child's core ADHD symptoms-as well as closely related externalizing symptoms-are perceived similarly by parents and teachers. With the exception of oppositional behavior, there was no significant effect of age, gender, ASD subtype, or autism severity on the relationship between parent and teacher ratings. In general, parents rated children as having more severe symptomatology than did teachers. Patterns of parent and teacher ratings were highly correlated, both for children who were receiving medication, and for children who were not.
   Conclusions: Parents and teachers perceived core symptoms of ADHD and closely-related externalizing problems in a similar manner, but there is less agreement on ratings of internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety). The clinical implication of these findings is that both parents and teachers provide important behavioral information about children with ASD. However, when a clinician is unable to access teacher ratings (e.g., during school vacations), parent ratings can provide a reasonable estimate of the child's functioning in these domains in school. As such, parent ratings can be reliably used to make initial diagnostic and treatment decisions (e.g., medication treatment) regarding ADHD symptoms in children with ASDs.

AB Biological markers of vulnerability for current or future risk of suicide in adolescents could be important adjuncts to the treatment and prevention of this phenomenon.
   We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles published between January 1990 and June 2011 using the following search terms: ("hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal" OR "HPA") AND ("adolescence" OR "adolescent" OR "teenager") AND ("depression" OR "major depressive disorder" OR "suicidal behavior" OR "suicidal ideation" OR "suicidal thoughts" OR "deliberate self-harm" OR "suicidal attempt" OR "suicide").
   HPA axis activity can be examined using different methods that do not have the same biological interpretation. An abnormal HPA axis functioning together with an anomalous interaction between HPA mechanisms and other systems such as the serotonergic system may be one of the neurobiological correlates of emotion dysregulation (ED). ED may play an important role in adolescent suicidal behavior. Some psychopathological conditions such as depression or childhood psychological trauma that increase suicidal risk in adolescents are also associated with HPA axis dysregulation. ED, a personality trait, can also be viewed as a predisposing factor that augments the vulnerability to suffer from psychiatric conditions.
   Correlating HPA axis dysfunction with psychological factors such as ED could lead to a better understanding of the role of HPA abnormalities in adolescent suicide and may enhance preventive and treatment strategies.

AB Past studies have shown that aggressive children exhibit rigid (rather than flexible) parent-child interactions; these rigid repertoires may provide the context through which children fail to acquire emotion-regulation skills. Difficulties in regulating emotion are associated with minimal activity in dorsal systems in the cerebral cortex, for example, the anterior cingulate cortex. The current study aimed to integrate parent-child and neurocognitive indices of emotion regulation and examine their associations for the first time. Sixty children (8-12 years old) referred for treatment for aggression underwent two assessments. Brain processes related to emotion regulation were assessed using dense-army EEG with a computerized go/no-go task. The N2 amplitudes thought to tap inhibitory control were recorded, and a source analysis was conducted. In the second assessment, parents and children were videotaped while trying to solve a conflict topic. State space grids were used to derive two dynamic flexibility parameters from the coded videotapes: (a) the number of transitions between emotional states and (b) the dispersion of emotional states, based on proportional durations in each state. The regression results showed that flexibility measures were not related to N2 amplitudes. However, flexibility measures were significantly associated with the ratio of dorsal to ventral source activation: for transitions, Delta R-2 = .27, F (1, 34) = 13.13, p = .001; for dispersion, Delta R-2 = .29, F (1, 35) = 14.76, p < .001. Thus, in support of our main hypothesis, greater dyadic flexibility was associated with a higher ratio of dorsomedial to ventral activation, suggesting that children with more flexible parent-child interactions are able to recruit relatively more dorsomedial activity in challenging situations.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the independent and joint effects of child gender and informant (mother-report vs. child self-report) on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms in an at-risk sample of children of mothers with a history of depression. Data were obtained from mothers with a history of major depressive disorder (N = 149) and their 9- to 15-year-old children (74 males, 75 females) to assess children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Little evidence was found that maternal depression amplified the typical gender differences in the prevalence of depressive symptoms and behavioral problems. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that maternal depression may equalize the rates of symptoms in boys and girls. There was also some evidence that maternal depression may reverse typical patterns of gender differences in depressive symptoms; i.e., using normative T scores to account for expected rates of problems, boys reported more symptoms than girls. Mothers and children reported significantly different levels of problems depending on child gender. Future research should investigate the processes of risk that may lead to changes in the normative patterns of gender differences in the context of maternal depression.

AB Females begin to demonstrate greater negative affective responses to stress than males in adolescence. This may reflect the concurrent emergence of underlying differences in physiological response systems, including corticolimbic circuitries, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). This review examines when sex differences in physiological reactivity to acute psychosocial stress emerge and the directionality of these differences over development. Indeed, the literature indicates that sex differences emerge during adolescence and persist into adulthood for all three physiological response systems. However, the directionality of the differences varies by system. The emerging corticolimbic reactivity literature suggests greater female reactivity, particularly in limbic regions densely innervated by gonadal hormone receptors. In contrast, males generally show higher levels of HPAA and ANS reactivity. We argue that the contrasting directionality of corticolimbic and peripheral physiological responses may reflect specific effects of gonadal hormones on distinct systems and also sex differences in evolved behavioral responses that demand different levels of peripheral physiological activation. Studies that examine both subjective reports of negative affect and physiological responses indicate that beginning in adolescence, females respond to acute stressors with more intense negative affect than males despite their comparatively lower peripheral physiological responses. This dissociation is not clearly explained by sex differences in the strength of the relationship between physiological and subjective responses. We suggest that females' greater subjective responsivity may instead arise from a greater activity in brain regions that translate stress responses to subjective awareness in adolescence. Future research directions include investigations of the role of pubertal hormones in physiological reactivity across all systems, examining the relationship of corticolimbic reactivity and negative affect, and sex differences in emotion regulation processes.

AB An increasing number of studies has shown that emotion dysregulation plays a key role in relation to childhood anxiety. While gender differences are commonly associated with emotional competence, no study has yet examined whether the relation between emotion dysregulation and anxiety is the same for girls as it is for boys. The present study investigated the possibility of gender differences in the relation between emotion dysregulation and anxiety in a community sample of 544 children and adolescents (298 girls and 246 boys) in the age of 9-16 years. Anxiety was assessed using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-Revised (SCARED-R). Emotion dysregulation was measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Four results emerged from this study. In accordance with previous research, (1) girls experience more anxiety and greater difficulties regulating their negative emotions than boys, and (2) emotion dysregulation has a significant impact on anxiety. Not previously shown, (3) emotion dysregulation is more predictive of anxiety in girls than in boys, and (4) different types of emotion regulation difficulties account for anxiety in girls and boys. Participants' age did not have an impact on anxiety scores. Findings are discussed with respect to clinical implications and future directions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Results and a case study for a DBT-enhanced habit reversal treatment (HRT) for adult trichotillomania (TTM) (Keuthen & Sprich, 2012) is adapted for use with adolescents. Trichotillomania in adolescence is a very important but understudied problem. Onset often occurs in adolescence, and yet very little treatment research exists. DBT-enhanced habit reversal has shown promise in adult samples (Keuthen et al., 2008) and may prove useful as a model for further study in adolescents. Here, we provide a case study using DBT-enhanced HRT with an adolescent girl. The treatment emphasizes traditional CBT for TTM and also includes a focus on emotion regulation, mindfulness, and distress tolerance to help manage both focused and automatic pulling.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the deliberate destruction of one's own body tissue in the absence of suicidal intent (e.g., cutting or burning the skin). Previous studies have found that people with a history of NSSI display diminished pain perception. However, it remains unclear why this effect occurs. In the present study, we used a sample of participants with (n = 25) and without (n = 47) a history of NSSI to test the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation partially explains why NSSI is associated with diminished pain perception. Pain perception was quantified as pain threshold, pain tolerance, and pain intensity ratings assessed during the cold pressor task. Nonsuicidal self-injury was associated with increased emotion dysregulation and diminished pain perception. Results showed that emotion dysregulation was correlated with diminished pain perception within both groups, demonstrating that this association exists regardless of NSSI history. Results also specified that emotion dysregulation partially accounted for the association between NSSI and pain tolerance but not other pain variables. Overall, results were consistent with the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation may increase NSSI risk in part by increasing the willingness to experience the pain involved in self-injury. Studies are needed to more directly investigate this hypothesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Empirical evidence is increasing in support of the validity of the construct of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adolescence. There is growing consensus that the early identification and treatment of emerging borderline traits may be an important focus. However, few diagnostic (questionnaire- or interview-based) measures specifically developed or adapted for adolescents and children exist. The Childhood Interview for DSM-IV Borderline Personality Disorder (CI-BPD) [Zanarini, 2003] is a promising interview-based measure of adolescent BPD. Currently, no studies have explicitly been designed to examine the psychometric properties of the CI-BPD. The aim of the current study was to examine various psychometric properties of the CI-BPD in an inpatient sample of adolescents (n = 245). A confirmatory factor analytic approach was used to examine the internal factor structure of the 9 CI-BPD items. In addition, internal consistency, interrater reliability, convergent validity (with clinician diagnosis and 2 questionnaire-based measures of BPD), and concurrent validity (with Axis I psychopathology and deliberate self-harm) were examined. Similar to several adult studies, the confirmatory factor analytic results supported a unidimensional factor structure for the CI-BPD, indicating that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria on which the CI-BPD is based constitute a coherent combination of traits and symptoms even in adolescents. In addition, other validity criteria were excellent. Taken together, the current study provides strong evidence for the validity of the CI-BPD for use in adolescents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Accumulating research suggests that psychopathy can be disaggregated into low-anxious primary and high-anxious secondary variants, and this research may be important for understanding antisocial youths with callous unemotional traits. Using model-based cluster analysis, the present study disaggregated 165 serious male adolescent offenders (M age = 16) with high scores on the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory into primary and secondary variants based on the presence of anxiety. The results indicated that the secondary, high-anxious variant was more likely to show a history of abuse and scored higher on measures of emotional and attentional problems. On a picture version of the dot-probe task, the low-anxious primary variant was not engaged by emotionally distressing pictures, whereas the high-anxious secondary variant was more attentive to such stimuli (Cohen d = 0.71). Although the two groups differed as hypothesized from one another, neither differed significantly in their emotional processing from a nonpsychopathic control group of offending youth (n = 208). These results are consistent with the possibility that the two variants of psychopathy, both of which were high on callous unemotional traits, may have different etiological pathways, with the primary being more related to a deficit in the processing of distress cues in others and the secondary being more related to histories of abuse and emotional problems.

AB This study examined the relationship between the executive control process of inhibition and self-reported dispositional mindfulness, controlling for gender, grade, and cortisol levels in 99 (43% female) fourth- and fifth-graders ((X) over bar = 10.23 years, SD = 0.53). Students completed a measure of mindful attention awareness and a computerized executive function (EF) task assessing inhibitory control. Morning cortisol levels also were collected and were used as an indicator of neuroendocrine regulation. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for gender, grade, and cortisol levels, higher scores on the mindfulness attention awareness measure significantly predicted greater accuracy (% correct responses) on the inhibitory control task. This research contributes to understanding the predictors of EF skills in early adolescents' cognitive development. Specifically, it identifies mindfulness-a skill that can be fostered and trained in intervention programs to promote health and well-being-as significantly related to inhibitory processes in early adolescence.

AB The Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index-IV-adolescent and parent versions (BPDSI-IV-ado/p) are DSM-IV based semi-structured interviews for the assessment of the severity of symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adolescents. The present study evaluates the psychometric properties of the BPDSI-IV-ado/p. The interviews were administered to 122 adolescents, aged 14-19 years and their parents/caretakers who were referred to mental health centres for emotion regulation problems, and to 45 healthy controls. The interrater reliability and internal consistency of all nine subscales (following the nine BPD symptoms in DSM-IV) proved to be good to excellent. Discriminant, concurrent, and construct validity were satisfactory. Cut-off scores that optimize sensitivity and specificity were derived. Informant agreement between adolescents and parents/caretakers was modest. The results of this study suggest that the BPDSI-IV adolescent and parent versions are valid and reliable instruments for the assessment of BPD symptom severity in adolescents.

AB Parenting behaviors have been linked to children's self regulation, but it is less clear how they relate to adolescent psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is a broad construct that describes an individual's ability to respond appropriately to environmental demands and internal experiences in the service of their goals. We examined the longitudinal relationships between perceived parenting style and psychological flexibility among students at five Australian schools (N = 749) over 6 years, beginning in Grade 7 (50.3% female, mean age 12.39 years). Parenting style was measured in Grades 7 and 12, and psychological flexibility from Grade 9 through 12. Psychological flexibility decreased, on average, with age. Multi-level modelling indicated that authoritarian parenting (low warmth, high control) in Grade 7 predicted later (low) psychological flexibility. Moreover, increases in authoritarian parenting and decreases in authoritative parenting (high warmth and control) were associated with adolescent psychological flexibility across the high school years. Change in parenting predicted future psychological flexibility but did not predict change over time. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that adolescent psychological flexibility in Grade 9 predicted later decreases in authoritarian and increases in authoritative parenting. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how parenting changes and the consequences of such change for the development of psychological flexibility.

AB Experience with and management of stress has implications for adolescents' behavioral and socioemotional development. This study examined the relationship between adolescents' physiological response to an acute laboratory stressor (i.e., Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) and anger regulation and interpersonal competence in a sample of 175 low-income urban adolescents (51.8% girls). Findings suggested that heightened reactivity as indicated by cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure was associated with increased interpersonal competence and anger regulation. However, these findings were context dependent such that, for youth high in self-reported child maltreatment, heightened reactivity was associated with decreased interpersonal competence and anger regulation. Results highlight the importance of considering how context may condition the effect of stress reactivity on functioning during adolescence.

AB Emotion-regulation difficulties have been identified as one of the core components in Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), a behaviour often beginning in adolescence. This pilot study evaluated differences in emotion processing between 18 female adolescents with and without NSSI by using verbal responses and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Responses to pictures taken from the International Affective Picture System and slides with reference to NSSI were recorded both by verbal rating of valence and arousal and by fMRI. The NSSI group rated pictures with self-injurious reference as significantly more arousing than controls. For emotional pictures, the NSSI group showed a significantly stronger brain response in the amygdala, hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally. Depression explained differences between groups in the limbic area. Furthermore, the NSSI group also showed increased activity in the middle orbitofrontal cortex, and inferior and middle frontal cortex when viewing NSSI picture material. Participants with NSSI showed decreased activity in correlation to arousal in the occipital cortex and to valence in inferior frontal cortex when watching emotional pictures. The fMRI data support the notion that individuals with NSSI show an altered neural pattern for emotional and NSSI pictures. Behavioural data highlight proneness to excitement regarding NSSI topics. This fMRI study provides evidence for emotion-regulation deficits in the developing brain of adolescents with NSSI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study sought to examine whether children's spontaneous use of the emotion regulation strategies suppression and reappraisal during a psychosocial stress task was related to their cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to that task.
   Salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to a psychosocial stress task were assessed in 158 10-year-old children (83 girls). The children completed a self-report questionnaire measuring use of reappraisal and suppression during the task. Results showed overall increases in cortisol and alpha-amylase in response to the stressor, with higher cortisol reactivity in girls than in boys. With regard to emotion regulation, more use of suppression was related to lower cortisol reactivity in girls, and lower alpha-amylase reactivity and quicker alpha-amylase recovery in all children. The use of reappraisal was not related to the children's cortisol or alpha-amylase responses.
   The current study is the first to investigate the relation between the spontaneous use of reappraisal and suppression, and physiological stress responses to a psychosocial stressor in children. Our results indicate that reappraisal and suppression are used and can be measured even in 10-year-olds. At this age reappraisal appears ineffective at down-regulating physiological responses, while suppression was related to lower physiological responses. For cortisol reactivity there was a sex difference in the relation with suppression, indicating the importance of including sex as a moderator variable in research studying stress reactivity and its correlates in this age group.

AB We present results of a meta-analysis of gene-by-environment (G x E) studies involving the serotonin transporter genotype 5HTTLPR to evaluate empirical support for two competing conceptual frameworks in developmental psychopathology: diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility. From a diathesis-stress perspective, the cumulative negative effects of the short allele (ss and sl genotypes) and adverse environments on development have been stressed. From a differential-susceptibility perspective, carriers of the s allele are predicted to be more open to adverse as well as positive environments, for better and for worse. Studies with children and adolescents up to 18 years of age (N = 9361) were included. We found 41 effect sizes (N 5863) for the association between negative environments and developmental outcomes with or without significant moderation by 5HTTLPR genotype and 36 effect sizes (N 3498) for the potentially 5HTTLPR-moderated association between positive environments and developmental outcomes. Five moderators were examined: age, ethnicity, genotyping (biallelic or triallelic) and methods used to assess environment and outcome. In the total set of studies, including studies with mixed ethnicities, we found that ss/sl carriers were significantly more vulnerable to negative environments than II carriers, thus supporting the diathesis-stress model. In the Caucasian samples, however, ss/sl carriers also profited significantly more from positive environmental input than II carriers. Associations between (positive or negative) environment and (positive or negative) developmental outcome were absent for II carriers. The meta-analytic findings support the hypothesis that in Caucasian samples 5HTTLPR is a genetic marker of differential susceptibility. G x E interactions might be critically dependent on ethnicity.

AB This study examined the relationship between parent and peer attachment and Internalizing and Externalizing problems in a sample of 816 adolescents (413 males and 403 females) aged 11-19 years old. Their responses to the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment indexed attachment quality, and Internalizing and Externalizing problems were measured by the Youth Self-Report. Our analyses revealed: a) gender differences in attachment to parents, with females reporting stronger attachment than males, and age differences in attachment to parent and peer, with middle adolescents reporting stronger attachment than adolescents; b) gender differences in Internalizing problems and Total problems, with females reporting higher scores than males, and age differences, with adolescents reporting higher scores than middle adolescents. Internalizing problems were predicted by Alienation by parents and Trust (IPPA-Peer) dimension in the expected directions, and Externalizing problems were predicted only by parental attachment dimensions. Results showed that adolescents with comorbid Internalizing and Externalizing problems scored significantly lower on the dimensions of parent attachment compared to Internalizing problems (pure), those with Externalizing (pure) problems or the control group. Adolescents with Internalizing problems (pure) scored significantly lower on the dimensions of peer attachment compared to other groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study explored whether specific cognitive coping strategies moderated the relation between global eating disorder symptomatology and binge eating frequency. Global eating disorder symptomatology and cognitive coping strategies (i.e., self-blame, acceptance, rumination, positive refocusing, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and other-blame) were evaluated in a sample of women who reported engaging in binge eating in the absence of compensatory behaviors (N = 419). Moderation analyses indicated that most positive cognitive coping strategies were associated with reduced binge eating frequency; however, there was no such buffering effect among individuals who reported engaging in acceptance, or in negative coping strategies. These results suggest that focusing on specific positive cognitive coping skills might be an effective approach to decreasing binge eating frequency, although additional experimental research is needed.

AB Suicidality among college students is associated with binge drinking and alcohol-related problems. Consistent with motivational models of alcohol use, drinking to cope (DTC) is a significant intervening variable in the association between suicidal ideation and alcohol use and problems among students. This study examined whether several factors shown to be associated with both suicidal ideation and DTC (i.e., impulsivity, mood regulation expectancies, and coping skills) account for the relationship between these variables, as well as the associations of depression and hopelessness with DTC. Participants were 109 emerging adult (18- to 25-year-old) college students who reported at least one episode of binge drinking during a typical month in the past year. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that while greater negative urgency and low negative mood regulation expectancies were significantly associated with DTC, suicidal ideation remained significantly associated with DTC, even when controlling for depression. Suicidal ideation showed a stronger association with DTC than either depression or hopelessness both before and after accounting for other variables. These findings suggest that suicidal ideation has a direct association with DTC, and that negative urgency and mood regulation expectancies may be useful treatments targets for reducing alcohol misuse among emerging adult students who experience suicidal ideation.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Basic Empathy Scale (BES). The Chinese version of BES was administered to a sample (n = 1,524) aged 9-18 and 65 males with conduct disorder aged 13-18. The result of confirmatory factor analysis showed a two-factor structure with four items deleted to be the most adequate model (cognitive empathy, affective empathy). Empathy was positively correlated with a measure of prosocial behaviour and a measure of emotional problems. Boys with conduct disorder scored significantly lower than matched participants on cognitive empathy. Moreover, in line with previous researches, girls were found to score significantly higher on empathy than boys and the scores on both cognitive and affective empathy increased with age. The Chinese revision exhibited satisfactory internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability.

AB In a four-year longitudinal study, changes in and continuity of behavioral and emotional problems were examined in 814 subjects from kindergarten to primary school. Mental health problems were assessed by means of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The distribution of the CBCL broadband groups revealed a high level of continuity of internalizing symptoms over the four-year period and a shift from externalizing symptoms at baseline towards a combination of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at follow-up. The presence of mental health problems at follow-up was correlated with gender (higher amongst boys), pre-existing mental health problems at baseline, and separation or divorce of the parents, but not with single-family status or the age and educational level of the mother. The increasing number of children with a combination of internalizing and externalizing symptoms demonstrates the increasing complexity of child mental health problems in the developmental span from preschool age to school age.

AB While white matter structural integrity is likely to influence the responses to social-emotional stimuli and emotional regulation during development, no longitudinal data are available on such relationships.
   We investigated the relationships between white matter Fractional Anisotropy (FA) derived by DTI voxelwise Tract Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and tractography measured at ages 14-15, and cerebral event-related N400 amplitudes in response to happy, neutral and angry facial expressions and Cloninger's Harm Avoidance (HA) measured at ages 7-9.
   Whole-skeleton TBSS analyses revealed reduced FA associated to smaller N400 amplitudes in response to anger, and to higher HA. Region-of-Interest TBSS analyses showed high correlations (ranging -0.69-0.82, p<0.01-0.001) between FA and N400 amplitudes across the Inferior Longitudinal, the Inferior Frontoccipital, and the left Uncinate Fasciculus, and between FA and Harm Avoidance in right Uncinate Fasciculus (-0.71, p<0.01). Tractography showed that these relationships were mainly present in the left Inferior Longitudinal and the right Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus for N400 amplitudes, and in the right Uncinate Fasciculus for HA.
   Ventral limbic pathways' white matter organisation affects the neural responses to expressions - such as anger - that are perceptually more challenging and/or communicate social rejection, and compounds the neural pathways that predispose to avoidant behaviour and shyness with strangers.

AB Depression is associated with impairments in cognitive control including action monitoring processes, which involve the detection and processing of erroneous responses in order to adjust behavior. Although numerous studies have reported altered error-related brain activity in depressed adults, relatively little is known about age-related changes in error-related brain activity in depressed youth. This study focuses on the error-related negativity (ERN), a negative deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) that is maximal approximately 50 ms following errors. High-density ERPs were examined following responses on a flanker task in 24 youth diagnosed with MDD and 14 low-risk healthy controls (HC). Results indicate that compared to HC, MDD youth had significantly smaller ERN amplitudes and did not exhibit the normative increases in ERN amplitudes as a function of age. Also, ERN amplitudes were similar in depressed youth with and without comorbid anxiety. These results suggest that depressed youth exhibit different age-related changes in brain activity associated with action monitoring processes. Findings are discussed in terms of existing work on the neural correlates of action monitoring and depression and the need for longitudinal research studies investigating the development of neural systems underlying action monitoring in youth diagnosed with and at risk for depression.

AB A group of 20 children and adolescents hospitalized and treated at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Department of Psychiatry, Osijek University Hospital Center for epilepsy and psychiatric cotnorbidities were included in the study. The aim of the study was to investigate psychiatric comorbidity and cognitive characteristics of children with epilepsy and compare them according to gender Diagnoses were based on the current ICD-10 classification criteria, whereas the following standardized psychological tests were used to determine cognitive characteristics of patients: Colored Progressive Matrices, Standard Progressive Matrices, Cognitive Nonverbal Test, Bender Motor Gestalt Test, Revised Beta Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Study results showed hyperkinetic disorder alone or in combination with conduct disorder to be the most common comorbidity in boys. On the other hand, the most common comorbidity diagnosed in girls was depressive disorder and anxiety disorder alone or combined with primary nocturnal enuresis. According to the results of psychological testing, most girls had average intellectual abilities; 69.23% of them showed signs of disorders of visuomotor coordination, whereas 61.54% showed signs of short-term memory impairment. Unlike girls, most boys (57.14%) had either borderline or subnormal intellectual abilities. All boys showed signs of disorders of visuomotor coordination and signs of short-term memoty impairment. Early identification and treatment of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses are important components in determining optimal and comprehensive treatment of children with epilepsy.
