AB There is a long and varied history of research on hypersexuality, but no consensus on either etiology or therapeutic interventions. In an effort to advance understanding of hypersexuality, we review the largely separate literatures on hypersexuality and emotion dysregulation, which has recently been suggested to be a critical factor in the development and maintenance of mental health problems. Unfortunately, there is also a lack of consensus on the various primary and intervening factors involved in development of emotion regulation or emotion dysregulation. First, we review theories and empirical evidence to try to explain how emotion dysregulation could contribute to the onset of hypersexuality or other inappropriate sexual behavior. Next, an attachment-theory perspective is used to develop a common etiological model for both emotion dysregulation and hypersexuality. Finally, we address the issue of hypersexual behavior in the context of couple relationships, taking an interpersonal perspective on emotion and emotion regulation. We refer to different age categories, ranging from adolescence to elderly, as emotion regulation skills are likely to change throughout the lifespan.

AB Development of emotion regulation strategy use involves a transition from reliance on suppression during childhood to greater use of reappraisal in adolescence and adulthood-a transition that parallels developmental changes in executive functions. We evaluated the relationship between emotion regulation strategy use and executive functioning in the everyday life of 70 typically developing adolescents who completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Youth and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Self-Report. Results indicated that greater reliance on reappraisal was associated with better executive functions, while reliance on suppression was related to poorer executive functions. Findings suggest that adolescents who rely on reappraisal may have more cognitive resources to help them remain attentive and well regulated in their daily lives. On the other hand, if better executive functions facilitate the use of reappraisal, adolescents' ability to regulate their emotions could potentially be enhanced via supports for executive functions.

AB Adolescents presenting with gender-related concerns are increasingly seeking support from providers from a variety of disciplines within health care settings across the world. For those treating young people who meet the criteria for the DSM 5 diagnosis of gender dysphoria (GD), complex decisions in clinical care are common. Defining best practice with this population with respect to interventions that span mental health, physical, and surgical domains can be challenging, given a relative dearth of empirical data available; yet practice guidelines have emerged from different professional organizations which can aid with this. For this review paper, a broad literature search was performed to identify relevant studies pertaining to the care of adolescents with GD. In addition, an overview of trends in clinical practice, including shifts in conceptualization of how clinicians and patients define care that is considered affirming when working with this population, is described. This paper explores the characteristics of referral patterns to specialized clinics, provides a brief overview of gender identity development in adolescence, and then describes the phenomenology of known aetiological factors and co-occurring psychiatric issues in adolescents with GD. Additionally, clinical management considerations that detail assessment aims and common treatment interventions across disciplines will be explored.

AB This study examined whether development of two forms of cognitive control (proactive and reactive) between early and midadolescence was associated with the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) during the same period and if it prospectively predicted MDD onset between mid- and late adolescence. Adolescents (N=165) completed 3 waves of assessments, at 12 (T1), 16 (T2), and 18 (T3) years of age. Diagnostic interviews were conducted at each time point to identify three groups of adolescents: early MDD, those who developed MDD between early (T1) and mid- (T2) adolescence (n=23); late MDD, those who developed MDD between mid- (T2) and late (T3) adolescence (n=20); and controls, those who did not develop MDD (n=122). A modified Stroop task was completed at T1 and T2 to examine development of proactive and reactive cognitive control. Adolescents with early MDD exhibited significant declines in reactive control, as well as a trend level decline for proactive control, during this period compared to controls. No significant differences in reactive or proactive control were identified in adolescents with late MDD compared to controls, but they did exhibit significant improvements in proactive control compared to those with early MDD. These findings suggest that normative maturation of reactive, and possibly proactive, cognitive control abilities are impaired in adolescents who develop MDD between early and midadolescence. This has implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying certain forms of behavioral dysregulation that are commonly seen in MDD.

AB Depression in adolescence is a widespread problem and leads to extensive psychosocial impairments. For these reason, a resource diary has been developed as a four-week positive writing intervention. The aims of this intervention were to enhance well-being, to promote emotion regulation and resource realization, as well as to prevent symptoms of depression in adolescence. Seventy-seven students of 8th form were randomized either to a positive writing group (n=38) or to a neutral writing group (n=39). At the post-test, the positive writing group showed a lower dysphoric mood, fewer worries and less rumination in comparison with the neutral writing group. No effects on resource realization were detected. This study provides the first evidence of the beneficial effects of positive writing on indicators of well-being and depressive symptoms. In conclusion, the resource diary represents an economical intervention for preventing depression in adolescence.

AB The article considers the main fields and onotogenetic development processes of mentalization and empathy. The neural measures and psychological studies results show that there is an active formation process of mentalization and empathy in adolescence. The article highlights the disputable character of the results of modern studies of social cognition in adolescence. The neural measures require further interpretation. The differences in mechanisms of empathy and mentalization are discussed, specifically the order of empathy components (cognitive or emotionally) forming in the onotogenetic development process. The various results of studies showing the proximity of these processes and prove their relative independence (including at the level of neural networks). The article contains the evidence that strong mentalization reduces the risk of emotional maladjustment and aggressive behavior, while its deficits correlate with bullying. We consider the current study of mentalization and empathy family factors. Particular attention is paid to the E. Mains study, which summarizes the research of social cognition ontogenetic development factors in building on the cultural and historical theory development of the of the psyche L.S. Vygotsky.

AB The rate of growth of Latino populations in some communities exceeds the resources available to assist Latino families in adapting to new environments. Some risk factors for depression center on their acculturative experiences; however, it is often unclear under what circumstances these experiences become stressful. Moreover, it is often unclear which protective factors should be given priority in developing interventions that reduce depressive symptoms in this context. The current study examines the relationship between acculturation, emotion regulation, environmental mastery, and depressive symptoms among first-generation Latino youth (N = 56). It was hypothesized that the interaction between enculturation and acculturation would positively relate to depressive symptoms while emotion regulation would prove to be a stronger protective factor over environmental mastery. The findings support these hypotheses and implications are provided.

AB Perceived relationship with parents and peers and the association with anxiety and depression in adolescents of Entre Rios Adolescence is a stage of life in which important physical, cognitive, and social transformations are generated. The present study aimed to determine whether the quality of the bonds with peers (siblings and friends) predicted depression and anxiety above and beyond the relationship with parents. To this end, a sample of 1,151 was recruited from middle schools (46% male, mean age=14.7). Furman and Bhurmester Network of Relationship Inventory was applied to measure the quality of relationships. They also completed Rosenberg Psychosomatic Scale and Kovacs Children Depression Inventory. Data were analyzed using SPSS Program 20. Results indicated that satisfaction with the relationship with peers predicted levels of emotional problems above and beyond the parents, but the bond with parents was more significant in this respect. In the conclusion the implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Mindfulness is defined as a non-judgemental awareness and accepting of present-moment experience. With intentional attendance to one's ongoing stream of thoughts, sensations and emotions as they arise, it allows the individual to react with less impulsivity and flexibility. However, empirical findings of mindfulness to date have largely been confined to outcome studies using clinical populations. This cross-sectional study examined the relationships between mindfulness, self-esteem, resiliency and mental health symptoms (anxiety, stress, depression and cognitive inflexibility) in a sample of 106 healthy adolescents. Participants completed a set of questionnaires. First, we found moderate effect size for anxiety, depression and self-esteem and large effect size for cognitive inflexibility. These results, when compared with clinical samples, demonstrated similar trends found in a healthy adolescent sample. Second, predictive value of mindfulness was examined and we found significant contribution of mindfulness to mental and psychological health.

When the coach / teacher has emotional well-being and expresses positive attitudes are more effective learning. Also, goal-setting and regulation of emotions is crucial in the learning process. Therefore, the coach / teacher has the responsibility to make teaching approaches from an emotional perspective, where teaching when setting goals, positive learning climates and emotional regulation is considered.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify elements of success in the family reintegration of children with street connections who have experienced chronic violence and loss in the context of poverty. This paper outlines the application of complex trauma theory into a practice model developed by the JUCONI Foundation in Puebla, Mexico to help children and families prepare and manage reintegration.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a 15-month qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with families and boys at three stages: preparing for return, in the first three months of reintegration and successfully reintegrated. The study comprises interviews with frontline workers and focus group discussions with the project team. In addition, six youths who did not return to their families were interviewed.
   Findings - The study focuses on an attachment and trauma-based approach to family reintegration of streetconnected children outside parental care. The findings highlight the need for careful preparation of both child and families (including siblings/extended family) prior to reunification. Preparation needs to focus on resolving the underlying problems that have led to the child being on the street and "phased" reintegration (beginningwith visits to the family) is recommended. Follow-up visits/family work by staff are usually essential to ensure that child/youth and family adjust to each other. The theoretical framework and rationale behind the use of the tools and strategies described needs to be understood, so that they are used intentionally and consistently.
   Research limitations/implications - The study cohort involved only boys and other factors are likely to affect the reintegration of girls. The study took place in Mexico only and methods used by JUCONI need to be tested in other contexts.
   Practical implications - The integration of children without parental care into families is an issue of critical interest, but there is currently very limited research or guidance on reintegration of children who have lived on the street, especially in low and middle income countries. The study should be of interest to practitioners interested in assessing whether safe and sustainable reintegration is possible and facilitating this. The paper may be of interest to practitioners working with children growing up without parental care who do not have "street connections", but who have experienced chronic violence and loss.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to describe the application of an attachment and trauma perspective to work with children who have lived on the street.

AB The link between a physical illness and a psychological disorder in children and adolescents is well explored. Chronic somatic illness encompasses a broad spectrum of disorders including more common problems such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, asthma, epilepsy, eczema, and less prevalent conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hematological disorders or cancer. Many children more or less successfully adapt to live with chronic physical conditions. However, others suffer from various types of distress. Chronic illness doubles the risk for behavioral and emotional problems. If the medical condition is associated with a visible physical deformity, the risk is triple.
   The prevalence of social-emotional difficulties in children with chronic illnesses is higher when compared to healthy children. Liaison child psychiatrists commonly encounter adjustment disorders, acute stress reactions, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and depression in child pediatric hospitals. These psychiatric disorders may occur both during the treatment of a somatic disorder, or they may have onset later in the life (during adolescence or adulthood).

AB Children of substance abusing parents (COSAPs) are in need of supportive services but are rarely the focus of targeted interventions within a family context. This study is a pilot evaluation of the Renascent Children's Program, a family-based group program for COSAPs in Canada. Participants (N = 26) were assessed at baseline and at 1-3 month follow-up on a number of key child, parent, and family outcomes. Results demonstrated significant improvements in child well-being, parenting style, emotion regulation, and family functioning, with large effect sizes. These findings suggest that this program is an effective method of intervention for families struggling with addiction and recovery with school-age children.

AB The present study examined emotion regulation as a potential mechanism in the relationship between Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression among 50 inpatient adolescents receiving psychiatric care at an inpatient mental hospital. PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with emotion dysregulation and depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses and bias-corrected bootstrapping techniques supported emotion dysregulation as a mechanism underlying the association between PTSD and depression symptoms. These findings support the notion that adolescents with clinical levels of PTSD symptoms may engage in ineffective emotion regulation strategies, such as emotional avoidance and suppression, which may, in turn, be associated with increased depression. Findings and implications are discussed.

AB Background and Objective: Negative parent-child interaction patterns have been linked to youth depression, with a causal influence being assumed. However, the majority of empirical studies examining this issue have used self-report methods to assess parent-child relationships, which cannot capture the temporal dynamics of dyadic interactions and may be subject to reporting bias. This review considers the association between parent-child interactions and youth depression with a specific focus on observational methodology.
   Method: A literature search was conducted including studies that investigated the association between observed parent-child interactions and youth depressive symptomology. Literature was obtained using database searches, citation searches and screening of recent reviews.
   Results and Conclusion: Maternal disengagement, reduced adolescent autonomy granting, adolescent maladaptive emotion regulation, parental suppression of adolescent positivity and incongruent parent-child communication styles were relatively consistently related to youth depression. Nonetheless, there were conflicting findings and several studies demonstrated little or no contribution of parent-child interaction factors to youth depression. Overall, the evidence suggests that causal influences are likely to be modest. The majority of studies relate to maternal versus paternal interactions. Furthermore, the factors that mediate the association between parent-child interactions and youth depression remain largely unknown. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB This article shows development of therapeutic design for a 14-year-old female adolescent with self-injurious behavior as an emotional regulation tool in different self states. The objective is to try and show the importance of not limiting our attention to the symptom of self-harm, however impacting it may be, but investigating the complexity of its origins and functions, and to make clear the importance of therapeutic action from a relational perspective, focusing attention on the complexity of what occurs at every moment of encounter and disagreement. The importance of emotional regulation throughout life, for mental health, and in the psychotherapeutic context is also stressed. Before presenting the case, a theoretical introduction will help understand this work.

AB The present study investigated differences between girls and boys regarding stress vulnerability and symptomatology as well as coping strategies in primary school children. We assessed stress vulnerability, stress symptoms, and coping strategies (in social and academic situations) using the SSKJ 3-8 questionnaire (Lohaus, Eschenbeck, Kohlmann, & Klein-Hessling, 2006) in a sample of 485 children (51.1% girls) in Grades 3 and 4 (aged 8-11 years). The results show that girls reported higher scores concerning stress vulnerability and more stress symptoms than boys did. Furthermore, girls applied more social-support-seeking strategies than boys did, whereas boys achieved higher scores in avoidant coping. Even if these gender differences did not differ significantly with the type of situation, it was noticeable that the strategies of seeking social support, avoidant coping, and anger-related emotion regulation were used more often in the social situation. These results indicate a special need for support for girls and a need for gender-adjusted programs for primary school children.

AB Treatment guidelines recommend that psychotherapy be used in conjunction with pharmacotherapy in children with bipolar disorder. A well-established category of psychotherapy is family skill-building plus psychoeducation; 3 examples of this are family-focused treatment, psychoeducational psychotherapy, and child-and family-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy. These treatments share several common elements that are important in pediatric populations, including being family-based, providing psychoeducation on symptoms and their management, and training patients and families in emotion regulation, communication, and problem-solving skills. Clinicians may also wish to explore nutritional interventions; multinutrient complexes are experimental, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements are possibly efficacious. Nutritional interventions are particularly attractive in this patient population because of their favorable safety profile.

AB This study examined the main and interactive effects of MDD and lifetime nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) on current suicide risk and past suicide attempts. We predicted that individuals with a history of NSSI and current MDD would be at greater suicide risk than those with either risk factor alone. An interaction between lifetime MDD and NSSI was hypothesized for past suicide attempts. 204 substance dependent inpatients completed self-report measures and a diagnostic interview. Patients with both a history of NSSI and current MDD, relative to all other groups, had the greatest suicide risk. No support was found for the lifetime MDD by NSSI interaction. Conclusion: Findings suggest the relevance of both NSSI and MDD in suicide risk.

AB This article contributes to the broader discussion of promotion, prevention, and intervention in child and adolescent mental health by describing implementation and early outcomes of an 8-school district demonstration project aimed at making the promotion of social and emotional learning a systemic part of school districts' practice. Eight districts are 2-3 years in to their participation in the 6-year project. The districts are large, are predominantly urban, and serve many students who are at disadvantage. The evaluation involved collection of qualitative data to measure the degree to which the districts realized the goals established in the initiative's theory of action, as well as school climate data, extant student records, and surveys of students' social and emotional competence. To date, results show that districts have followed highly individual pathways toward integrating social and emotional learning systemically, and all have made progress over time. Although school-level implementation remains at moderate levels, 2 districts in which we could examine school climate showed gains from preinitiative years. Four of 6 measured districts showed improvement in social and emotional competence for students in Grade 3, and achievement and discipline showed overall improvements across all districts. Overall findings show that implementation of the initiative's theory of action by school districts is feasible, even in times of budgetary stress and leadership turnover. This establishes the potential for school districts to serve as a lever of change in the promotion of students' social and emotional development and mental wellness.

AB Background: In borderline personality disorder (BPD), attentional bias (AB) to emotional stimuli may be a core component in disorder pathogenesis and maintenance. Sampling: 11 emotional Stroop task (EST) studies with 244 BPD patients, 255 nonpatients (NPs) and 95 clinical controls and 4 visual dot-probe task (VDPT) studies with 151 BPD patients or subjects with BPD features and 62 NPs were included. Methods: We conducted two separate meta-analyses for AB in BPD. One meta-analysis focused on the EST for generally negative and BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words. The other meta-analysis concentrated on the VDPT for negative and positive facial stimuli. Results: There is evidence for an AB towards generally negative emotional words compared to NPs (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.311) and to other psychiatric disorders (SMD = 0.374) in the EST studies. Regarding BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words, BPD patients reveal an even stronger AB than NPs (SMD = 0.454). The VDPT studies indicate a tenden-cy towards an AB to positive facial stimuli but not negative stimuli in BPD patients compared to NPs. Conclusions: The findings rather reflect an AB in BPD to generally negative and BPD-specific/personally relevant negative words rather than an AB in BPD towards facial stimuli, and/or a biased allocation of covert attentional resources to negative emotional stimuli in BPD and not a bias in focus of visual attention. Further research regarding the role of childhood traumatization and comorbid anxiety disorders may improve the understanding of these underlying processes. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Objective: This study aimed to examine the association of eczema, asthma and hay fever with mental health in a general child population and to assess the influence of parental socioeconomic position on these associations.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional health survey of children aged 3, 6, 11 and 15 years in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark. Individual questionnaire data on eczema, asthma, and hay fever and mental health problems assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was linked to register data on demographics and parental socioeconomic position. 9215 (47.9%) children were included in the analyses.
   Results: Linear regression analyses showed that children with current eczema symptoms had higher SDQ scores (mean difference, 95% CI) of emotional problems (0.26, 0.12 to 0.39), conduct problems (0.19, 0.09 to 0.29) and hyperactivity problems (0.32, 0.16 to 0.48); children with current asthma symptoms had higher SDQ scores of emotional problems (0.45, 0.32 to 0.58), conduct problems (0.28, 0.18 to 0.38) and hyperactivity problems (0.52, 0.35 to 0.69); and children with current hay fever symptoms had higher SDQ scores of emotional problems (0.57, 0.42 to 0.72), conduct problems (0.22, 0.11 to 0.33), hyperactivity problems (0.44, 0.26 to 0.61) and peer problems (0.14, 0.01 to 0.26), compared with children without current symptoms of the relevant disease. For most associations, parental socioeconomic position did not modify the effect.
   Conclusions: Children with eczema, asthma or hay fever had more emotional, conduct and hyperactivity problems, but not peer problems, compared with children without these diseases. Atopic diseases added equally to the burden of mental health problems independent of socioeconomic position.

AB Prior research demonstrates a positive association between mental health problems and sexual risk for African American women. Using the social skills deficit hypothesis, we proposed that social skills mediate this relationship. African American women (n = 557, M age = 20.58) completed measures of depression, stress, emotional dysregulation, sexual risk behaviors, and perceptions of their social skills with their primary sexual partner. Social skills mediated the link between the mental health assessments and a composite sexual risk index. Theoretical implications of extending the social skill deficit hypothesis are discussed as well as implications for interventions.

AB Despite the many studies that have documented the association between symptoms of ADHD and social difficulties in children and adolescents, few have examined this phenomenon in college students. In addition, the underlying factors contributing to such social difficulties are still poorly understood. We hypothesised that college students with symptoms of ADHD, namely inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, would continue to display social behavioural difficulties, and that emotion regulation would play a mediating role in that relationship. Ninety-nine 17-24-year-old college students filled out three questionnaires to assess Inattentive and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Symptoms, Social Skills, and Emotion Regulation abilities. Analysis revealed that emotion regulation is a significant mediator between Inattentive Symptoms and Social Skills for female students. There was no significant correlation between ADHD symptoms and Social Skills for males. Female college students report social functioning difficulties associated with their inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, and impaired emotion regulation abilities mediate this relationship for inattentive symptoms only.

AB The current longitudinal study used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) to examine a model of development that emphasizes early caregiving environments as predictors of social emotional competence (including classroom competence). This path analysis model included features of parenting, emotion regulation, preschool language skills, and attention to predict child outcomes in 1st grade. Early caregiving environments were directly predictive of peer relationship satisfaction, oppositional behavior, social skills, and classroom competence over and above significant mediated effects through preschool self-regulation (language, inattention, and anger/frustration). These results suggest that the characteristics of supportive and stimulating caregiving shift in valence over time, such that qualities of the infant-child relationship that are significant in predicting early childhood outcomes are not the same as the caregiving qualities that move to the foreground in predicting primary school outcomes. Implications for school-readiness programming are discussed, including interventions in the early caregiving system to encourage sensitive and supportive parent-child interactions to bolster school readiness via the development of social-emotional competence.

ID YOUNG-ADULTS; PATTERNS; PARENTIFICATION
AB Family communication is a strong predictor of the attitudes and behaviors children and adolescents have toward alcohol. This study explored perspectives of family communication about the topic of alcohol in focus groups consisting of adult children of alcoholics and adult children of nonalcoholics. The study utilized Koerner and Fitzpatrick's (2002) family communication patterns theory and Gottman's (2001) emotion regulation theory to guide research and focus group questions. A group of trained coders conducted an analysis of transcripts from four focus groups-two were comprised of self-proclaimed adult children of alcoholics and two consisted solely of adult children of nonalcoholic parents. Based on responses from both groups, five themes emerged: Experiences of Open Communication, Family Decision Making, Communication about Alcohol, Ability to Express Emotion, and Feelings Toward the Alcoholic. Results suggest that adult children of alcoholics have a very different experience when it comes to family communication, communication about the topic of alcohol, and the ability to express emotion. These findings provide insight to the communication dynamics in families of alcoholics and suggest avenues for future research.

AB Background: Mental health services for youths in Singapore were challenged by accessibility and resource constraints. A community-based mental health program working with schools and other partners was developed to address the population needs.
   Aim: To describe the formation of a community-based mental health program and evaluate the program in terms of its outcome and the satisfaction of the users of this program.
   Methods: Based on needs analyses, a community multidisciplinary team was set up in 15 schools to pilot a new model of care for youths. Implemented progressively over five years, networks of teams were divided into four geographic zones. Each zone had clusters of 10 to 15 schools. These teams worked closely with school counselors. Teams were supported by a psychiatrist and a resident. Interventions were focused on empowering school-based personnel to work with students and families, with the support of the teams.
   Results: 4,184 students were served of whom 10% were seen by the school counselors and supported by the community team. Only 0.15% required referral to tertiary services. Outcome measured by counselor and teacher ratings showed improvements in the Clinical Global Impression scale and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. These included reductions in conduct problems, emotional problems, hyperactive behaviors and peer problems. Furthermore, prosocial behavior also significantly improved. Preliminary cost effectiveness analyses suggest that community treatments are superior to clinic interventions.
   Conclusion: There is evidence that a population-based community mental health program with schools can be implemented through a multisectoral approach with good outcomes that is cost effective.

AB The role of an educational and child psychologist involves the promotion of mental health and wellbeing. While adolescents who have insomnia are usually referred to Primary Healthcare services, it might be argued that insomnia can be seen as a barometer of psychological wellbeing and should warrant a psychological intervention. A search of PSYCHINFO and Medline revealed that interventions carried out thus far with adolescents who have difficulty initiating and/or maintaining quality sleep include Sleep Hygiene and Sleep Education, Cognitive Behavioural and Multi Component interventions. In this review it will be posited that using multi-modal approaches which are tailored to specific needs may have the most positive outcomes in the treatment of insomnia, by helping adolescents to develop a sense of self-efficacy and emotional regulation in the context of family and peer support. Educational and child psychologists are ideally placed to offer this type of input to adolescents with insomnia.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the longitudinal influence of parental attachment and emotion regulation on changes in Internet delinquency. This study used the Korean Youth Panel Survey (KYPS) data, in which 2,844 school-age children were annually assessed from Grade 4 in 2004 to Grade 8 in 2008 in South Korea. Latent growth models were used to examine developmental trajectories of Internet delinquency, parental attachment, and emotion regulation longitudinally. This study showed that adolescents experience an increase in Internet delinquency over the fourth year and a decline in the fifth year. The initial level of parental monitoring had significant effects on the initial level of emotion regulation. In addition, the initial level of parental attachment was associated with a slower rate of acceleration of Internet delinquency across time. The study findings indicate that parental attachment influences Internet delinquency among Korean adolescents. The practice implications of the findings are discussed in terms of Internet delinquency reduction efforts.

AB Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to prior studies, emotion dysregulation can cause externalizing behavior problems and social impairment. Parental factors are important for children's emotional regulation. We aimed to evaluate emotional dysregulation in children with ADHD and their mothers comparing with controls. Methods: The study group consisted of 62 children (6-12 years old) diagnosed with ADHD. The control group (62 children) comprised patients of other clinics at hospital and was matched for gender and age to the ADHD patients. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) was used to diagnose ADHD and allowed comorbidities. We evaluated disorder severity at the time of assessment using the Clinic Global Impression Scale (CGI-S). All patients were treatment-naive. Emotional Regulation Checklist (ERC) and child behavior checklist (CBCL) were used to examine children emotional regulation and behavioral profiles. Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to indicate maternal emotional dysregulation status. Results: There was no significant difference between sociodemographic data of two groups. Children with ADHD had difficulties in anxiety, social functioning, thought problems, attention, agression and rule breaking areas of CBCL. Mothers of children with ADHD had higher scores in all goals, impulsivity, strategies, and nonacceptance subscales of DERS. Emotional lability scores were statistically significant higher in ADHD group. Conclusion: ADHD generally continues into adolescence and adulthood and multiple functional impairments can be occured due to ADHD. If the relationship between emotion regulation and ADHD is understood well, treatment of ADHD and emotion dysregulation will be provided easily. Further studies are needed for improving treatment of ADHD and emotion dysregulation.

AB The purpose of this mixed methods study was to examine the process whereby college students with a history of problem behavior during adolescence made the transition from problematic adolescence to positive adaptation in young adulthood. College students (N = 149) between the ages of 18 and 22 were screened to determine if they met the criteria for a history of adolescent problem behavior and adaptive functioning in young adulthood. Of the 74 (49.7%) participants who met criteria for a history of problem behavior during adolescence, 31 (41.9%) were currently functioning well during young adulthood. Of these 31 individuals, 7 were interviewed to determine factors that contributed to the resolution of adolescent problem behavior in young adulthood. The results of this study suggested that there were developmental (e.g., psychosocial maturation), interpersonal (e.g., parental support and reconciliation with family members), and emotional (e.g., managing emotional problems) themes that were associated with the resolution of adolescent problem behavior.

ID DIFFICULTIES
AB The regulation, expression, and suppression of emotion is often conceptualized differently in different cultures (Su, Wei, & Tsai, 2014). A common factor, however, between cultures is the need of the individual to exercise a sense of control, or regulation, over their emotions (Gross, 1998). Emotional regulation is defined as the process by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions (Gross, 1998). An individual may present regulation through deliberate internalization of positive or negative emotions (Kim & James, 2015). In turn, this internalization can have positive or negative effects depending on the context. Emotional suppression is a common maladaptive coping mechanism (Gross & Levenson, 1993). Emotional suppression can be defined as an internalization of emotions during emotional arousal (Gross & Levenson, 1993). Bottled Up is an experiential intervention, developed by the authors, for use with clients experiencing emotional suppression. This article provides a review of literature that covers emotional regulation, specifically emotional suppression. We then explain the intervention (Bottled Up), how to implement it, and its relevance to the marriage and family therapy more broadly.

AB The present investigation was conducted to examine the effect of gender, family size and birth order on emotional adjustment of adolescents. Samples of 150 adolescents (75 males and 75 females) in the age range of 16-18 years, studying in 11th and 12th standard were selected from four English medium schools of Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. Global Adjustment Scale developed by Psy-Com Services (1994) was used for measuring emotional adjustment among the selected sample of adolescent boys and girls. A 2*2*2 analysis of variance with unequal replicates was carried out to see the independent and interactive effect of gender, family size and birth order on emotional adjustment of adolescents. Results revealed that gender has established significant effect on emotional adjustment of adolescent with boys having significantly better emotional adjustment as compared to girls. Furthermore, findings also reported that family size and birth order does not seem to play its significant role on emotional adjustment of adolescents in Himachal Pradesh.

AB This study compares life stressors and school outcomes among newcomer immigrant adolescents from Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean. Participants attended a predominantly low-income, urban international public high school in the northeast. The Latina/o students were exposed to more life stressors and had lower attendance and achievement than non-Latina/o students. Life stressors mediated the relationship between ethnicity and academic outcomes. Results deepen experts' understanding of the achievement gap, suggesting that newcomer immigrant adolescents from Latin America face unique risks and deserve intervention efforts focused on sociocontextual stressors that may prevent these students from achieving their full academic potential.

   Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides a brief overview of some of these processes.
   Findings - The author argues that despite the wealth of research affirming the special significance of pregnancy, babyhood and toddlerhood in human development, the predominant political and cultural institutions go on failing to protect new parents and their relationships with their infants. The current policies and practices are short-sighted.
   Originality/value - The author shows that there is a failure to recognise the significance of good emotional regulation - learnt in secure early relationships - to a thriving society.

AB This article reports on an innovative pedagogical approach within the Learning Partnerships program in which school students help to 'teach the teachers' within pre-service teacher education. Classes of school students join with classes of pre-service teachers to provide input on how teachers can enhance school students' engagement and wellbeing. The article draws on data collected from 125 students (aged 13-16) and 120 pre-service teachers in these workshops. Findings generated from a mixed methods study combining pre-workshop focus groups (n = Students: 38, Teachers: 33) and post-workshop focus groups (n = Students: 69, Teachers: 15) and post-workshop surveys (n = Students: 96; Teachers: 101) demonstrated that the workshops were mutually beneficial for both students and pre-service teachers. Participants found that workshopping together enhanced their belief in the possibility of positive student-teacher relationships. The pre-service teachers reported greater confidence in communicating with young people about the issues that affect student engagement and wellbeing. The school students reported that they were more willing to use teachers as a source of help. Implications include the need for increased attention to a 'third space' for learning in teacher development which provides opportunity for learning with and from young people about how to foster their engagement and wellbeing.

AB The survival of childhood brain tumors has improved in the past 30years, but acquired brain injury due to damage caused by tumor invasion and side effects of different treatment modalities frequently occurs. This study focused on residual impairments, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and emotional and behavioral problems in 2 cohorts of survivors diagnosed and treated for various types of brain tumors. Survivors in the 2004 cohort visited the Erasmus Medical Centre for standardized follow-up between 2003 and 2004, and in the 2014 cohort, between 2012 and 2014. Data of neurologically impairments of all children were extracted from medical records. Parents and survivors filled out questionnaires on quality of life and emotional and behavioral problems. In both cohorts, approximately 55% of the survivors displayed neurologic impairments. In comparison with the healthy reference group, a reduced parent-reported quality of life was found on the Motor, Cognition, and Autonomy (Cohort 2004) scales. Comparison between the cohorts showed that parents in the 2004 cohort reported a higher HRQoL on the Motor and Cognitive functioning scales. In the 2014 cohort, children reported less negative emotions than healthy children. No increase in emotional or behavioral problems were reported by children in both cohorts, whereas parents reported problems in social functioning and isolation related to a delay in emotional development. Children surviving brain tumor treatment have a reduced quality of life. The authors therefore recommend regular screening of HRQoL and emotional and behavioral problems and referral to specific aftercare.

AB To study whether and how emotion regulation (EmR) strategies are associated with adolescents' well-being, 633 Italian adolescents completed a survey that measured, using the emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ), the strategies of cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES), and their relationship with several well-being measures. Factor analysis and reliability results confirmed the validity of ERQ to assess adolescents' regulation strategies. Correlation and regression results showed that a greater reliance on CR was positively associated with better well-being outcomes for most indicators, especially life satisfaction, social support perception, and positive affect; greater preference for ES conversely was associated with lower well-being level for all indicators, including psychological health, emotional loneliness, and negative affect. Neither gender nor age differences were observed for CR and ES; CR and ES were positively correlated with each other. Both analysis of variance and regression results showed gender to be a significant factor for well-being indicators (e.g. males' higher positive affect and life satisfaction than females'), whereas age was associated with differences in psychological health only, with 16-year olds reporting the lowest health, and 14-year olds the highest. The findings overall show that adolescents' well-being is related to preferred EmR strategies, mirroring associations found in the adult population. The study results also suggest the need to further explore this relationship in adolescence.

AB Stress during pregnancy can increase the incidence of emotional problems, learning and language difficulties in human infants and pre-adolescents. Most preclinical studies in rats that attempted to find experimental support for these observations were performed in adult male offspring, but the results are inconsistent. The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of prenatal stress on novel object recognition (NOR) and spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) of juvenile rats of both sexes. By the use of fluorescence immunohistochemistry and protein measurements by Western blot, we measured the expression of markers of neurogenesis (doublecortin, DCX) and neuronal activity that are important for synaptic plasticity and learning (c-fos, GluR1, nNOS). Since neuronal activity in the developing and adult brain can be regulated by astrocytes, we also measured the number of astrocytes and the expression of two astroglial proteins (GFAP and S100B) in the stress-responsive hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Experiments were performed on littermates of rats in which its effects on behavior were measured. We found for the first time that juvenile females performed better than males in the NOR and MWM tests. They also had higher densities of DCX and c-fos in the DG, together with the expression of nNOS and GluR1 in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG. There were no sex differences in the expression of GFAP and S100B in astrocytes. Prenatal stress did not affect NOR in females, but improved it in males, together with an increase in DCX+ and c-fos, the number of GFAP-expressing astrocytes and the intensity of GFAP and S100B immunofluorescence in the DG. Staining intensity of GluR1 and nNOS in the hilus and SGZ of the DG, and protein expression in the whole DG, was unchanged in prenatally stressed males. Thus, prenatal stress changed the behavior and expression of key proteins in the DG to resemble that in females. A reduction in plasma testosterone, which although not attaining statistical significance was associated with that in anogenital distance, may contribute to the effect of prenatal stress in males. In females, prenatal stress had no effect on c-fos, DCX or the number of astrocytes but reduced the staining intensity of GluR1 and nNOS. Protein expression of nNOS was also significantly lower than that in prenatally stressed males. The differential effects of prenatal stress on hippocampal neuronal and glial markers may help to explain the sex-dependent effect on spatial learning in prepubertal rats. (C) 2016 S.

AB This study tested within-person associations between intoxication, negative affect, and self-control demands and two forms of self-control failure, interpersonal conflict, and neglecting responsibilities. Effortful control was hypothesised to act as a buffer, reducing individual susceptibility to these within-person effects. In contrast, reactivity was hypothesised to potentiate the within-person associations. 274 young adults aged 18-27 (56% women, 93% white) completed experience sampling assessments for up to 49 days over the course of 1.3 years. Results indicated independent within-person effects of intoxication, negative affect, and self-control demands on the outcomes. Hypothesised moderating effects of reactivity were not supported. Effortful control did not moderate the effects of self-control demands as expected. However, effortful control exhibited a protective effect when individuals were intoxicated or upset to reduce the likelihood of maladaptive behavioural outcomes.

AB Background: Several recent studies highlighted that both attachment insecurity and emotion regulation difficulties form a key part of conceptual models of anorexia nervosa (AN), but they had never been analyzed in the same controlled study. Method: This study examined the attachment states of mind, assessed by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), and emotion regulation difficulties, measured by the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), among 25 girls with AN diagnosis aged 14-18 years (M age=16.52, SD=1.23), and 25 general population controls, matched for gender, age, years of education and SES. Results. The AN group reported both significantly higher attachment insecurity (75% vs 46%, Fisher Exact Test, p=.04), dismissing (Ds) in particular (chi(2)=6.41, df=2, p=.03), and difficulties with emotion regulation than non-clinical controls. Two AAI's scales connected to Ds classification-idealization of mother and lack of recall-were significantly correlated to lack of emotional awareness and clarity. Conclusions. Our results provide support for conceptualization of AN emphasizing the role of attachment insecurity and emotional dysregulation in the development and maintenance of this restrictive type of eating disorder. These findings may have implications for treatment programs which may prove more fruitful integrating attachment-based intervention with clinical work focused on development of emotion regulation abilities.

AB Background: Complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often found after repeated experiences of violence in childhood and adolescence, and it includes, additional to PTSD core symptoms, emotion regulation difficulties, instable relationships, and a high rate of comorbidity. Many therapists have concerns about the use of exposure-based treatments in this patient group. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT; [Resick et al., 2007]) in its cognitive-only version (CPT-C) represents an effective alternative method, which does not need formal exposure. Besides presenting this method, the authors give an overview of evaluative studies and describe the application of this technique by a case example. Case Report: The patient sought out treatment after childhood sexual abuse. Besides PTSD, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The authors describe the use of CPT-C interventions, the course of treatment, treatment results, and demonstrate special features in the treatment of complex PTSD. Conclusions: The cognitive version of CPT, the CPTC, allows quitting formal exposure and is as effective as exposure-based methods. Therefore, CPT-C should be broader implemented in PTSD treatment, especially in the treatment of complex PTSD.

AB Research on samples of truant adolescents is limited, with little known about mental health problems among truant youths. This study provided an exploratory, multilevel examination of mental health problems for a sample of 300 truant adolescents. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a single factor of multiple mental health problems at the individual level, but the structure of these problems was not the same at the school level. A number of covariate effects were found at the individual level on the mental health factor. Further, youths attending middle school were more likely to report attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems than those in high school. Service and practice implications of better understanding school and mental health issues of truant youth are discussed.

AB Unaccompanied refugee minors in Europe are at high risk of developing mental health problems and experiencing poor quality of life. However, there have been few studies on psychiatric disorders, behavioral problems, and quality of life among these adolescents. Furthermore, previously conducted studies in different European countries have reported inconsistent findings. This study investigated the frequency of emotional and behavioral problems in unaccompanied refugee minors residing in youth welfare institutions in Germany, using data from both self-reports and caregiver reports. Additionally, health-related quality of life was investigated, using caregiver reports only. Data on 191 male refugees, between the ages of 12 and 20 from 24 different countries of origin, living in 16 youth welfare institutions in Germany were included in the analysis. Residents completed the self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for the detection of emotional and behavioral problems, while caregivers completed the teacher version. Caregivers additionally completed a questionnaire on health-related quality of life domains, and provided general sociodemographic information. The results of the SDQ and the questionnaires on health-related quality of life were compared with age-matched norms, using t tests and chi(2) tests. According to both self-reports and caregiver reports, the rates of internalizing problems (emotional problems and peer relationship problems) in this sample were significantly higher than in norms, with frequencies ranging from 35 to 61%. By contrast, externalizing problems were rated as significantly lower than for norms, particularly hyperactivity with frequencies ranging from only 4 to 7%. Both sets of informants reported high levels of prosocial behavior. Caregivers and residents gave similar ratings on most measures but differed for conduct problems, with the ratings by the former corresponding to norms while those by the latter being significantly lower. Health-related quality of life was rated by caregivers as being poorer than in the normative sample; the only exception was found in the domain of peer relationships, where participants showed average results. The findings of this study confirm that unaccompanied refugee minors are a highly vulnerable group, and suggest that mental health screenings should be done regularly in the youth welfare institutions that care for them. It is important to use culturally sensitive instruments and multi-informant methods to detect problems despite possible differences between caregiver and self-reports. Appropriate support systems should be developed and implemented, including access to mental health care as well as psychosocial and educational interventions within schools and youth welfare institutions. Thus, the health and quality of life of these young people can be improved as they adjust to life in the resettlement countries and develop a future perspective.

AB Objective: Despite a long history of interest in personality as well as in the mechanisms that regulate sleep, the relationship between personality and sleep is not yet well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore how personality affects sleep.Design: The present cross-sectional study, based on a sample of 1291 participants with a mean age of 31.16 years (SD=12.77), investigates the impact of personality styles, assessed by the Personality Adjectives Checklist (PACL), on subjective sleep quality, as well as the possible mediation of this relationship by dispositional emotion regulation (ER) styles.Results: The dispositional use of suppression was a quite consistent predictor of poor subjective sleep quality for individuals scoring high on Confident, Cooperative or Introversive personality traits, but low on Respectful personality traits. Although a positive relationship between reappraisal and subjective sleep quality was found, there was only little evidence for a relationship between the assessed personality styles and the use of cognitive reappraisal.Conclusion: The present results indicate that in the evaluation of subjective sleep, the impact of personality and ER processes, such as emotion suppression, should be taken into account.

AB The aim of the study was to validate the "German Health Behavior in Children Questionnaire" (GEKI; Meier, Eschenbeck, & Kohlmann, 2013) by examining agreement among children's self-reports and their parents' and classmates' proxy ratings. In Study 1, 284 parent-child pairs and 82 classmate-child pairs were included; Study 2 comprised 396 child-parent-classmate triads. The self-other correlations between the corresponding subscales of health protective behaviors (road safety, sun safety, dental hygiene) and eating behaviors (unhealthy eating, healthy eating, bringing school lunch) were modest to high. Correlations were higher for road safety and bringing school lunch and lower for sun safety and dental hygiene. Self-other correlations were (with one exception) not moderated by the child's gender or age. After controlling for gender and age, the proxy ratings from parents and classmates remained significant predictors for all self-reported health behaviors. Especially for road safety and unhealthy eating, parents rated their child's behavior more favorably. Results support the validity of the newly developed health behavior questionnaire.

AB The literature on the psychological well-being of children impacted by HIV/AIDS in Africa highlights increased vulnerability due to loss of parents and environmental stressors (e.g., hunger). Research shows that the lack of attachment and social support due to loss limits the grieving process in children. Access to trusting adults and social support through caregivers can be an important protective factor to allow for coping and better emotional adjustment in the future. This study examined social support systems across varying living environments to determine if social support promoted higher levels of well-being in children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. The participants included 100 children from a small targeted population in southern Africa who receive varying levels of support from a private not-for-profit organization. Children's well-being was assessed through the Psycho-Social Adjustment Scale-Adolescents developed specifically for vulnerable child populations in Africa. Children were individually interviewed either on their homestead, school or hostel. Data demonstrated that children who do not share their feelings had significantly lower measures of positive well-being (M=2.61 (0.87) vs. M=3.10 (0.57), d=0.60). Children with trusted adults were significantly more likely to share their feelings and had lower incidence of hunger (49.1% vs. 62.5%), suicide ideation (15.1% vs. 62.5%) and witnessing violence (69.8% vs. 87.5%). Sharing feelings with caregivers was more pronounced among children who had greater access to trusted adults and correlated with stronger attachment scores (r=.30, p<.01). An important component to decrease levels of anxiety and depression in this vulnerable population is providing access to trusted individuals. Social support interventions are discussed.

TI Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Adolescents: Addressing the Function and the

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FAMILY THERAPY

DT Article
ID EMOTION REGULATION; HARM; PEOPLE; BEHAVIORS; SERVICES
AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescence has been increasing steadily over the past several decades. Mental health professionals frequently address NSSI solely within an individual context. Behaviorally focused therapy is the norm for treating NSSI in adolescents, but existence of the behavior as a larger manifestation of structural family problems is missing from this modality of therapy. Although short-term outcomes display a reduction or cessation of NSSI, long-term efficacy is still not proven for behaviorally focused therapies. Addressing the function of NSSI in a family context will help shift the perspective of clinicians from behavioral, individual therapy to structural family therapy.

AB The relationship between early sexual abuse and college problem drinking was examined using an integration of the self-medication and vulnerability-stress models. Baseline survey data from parti-cipants (N = 213; 135 men and 78 college women) completing a mandated, brief alcohol intervention were utilized. Representative of the self-medication model, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms mediated the early sexual abuse/problem drinking relationship. Two psychological vulnerability factorsemotion dysregulation and dissociative tendencieswere incorporated into self-medication findings via more advanced mediational models. Results highlighted that problem drinking increased as dissociative tendencies increased, and relations between the vulnerability factors and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were in an unexpected direction.

AB Family breakdown problems have been an alarming increase in Spain in recent years. They often cause adaptation problems such as emotional reactions in family members. This work presents the evaluation and intervention in an adolescent who suffers an adaptive problem with anxiety and depression symptoms due to a family breakdown problem. During the evaluation, information was collected in order to evaluate the problem, and measures of anxiety and depression degree - indicating difficulty breathing, inability to relax and general interest loss, among others symptoms -, were used. The cognitive behavioral therapy program consisted in 50-minute six sessions and was applied during one month and a half. It provides strategies for training to regulate physiological activation, exposure with response prevention and cognitive restructuring. After treatment, it was obtained a clinically significant reduction of symptomatology, although some degree of loss of interest in others persisted. This study shows the utility to implement brief early interventions in adolescents who suffer adaptive problems associated to family breakdown situations.

AB This research work analyses the emotional intelligence (EI) and the social cognitive attitudes and strategies in adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age in residential care. The aim of the work is to identify those aspects that hinder their socio-emotional competence, requiring a more urgent intervention. We explore the presence of significant differences between the variables under study according to gender and age range (12-14 and 15-17) and we analyse the relationship between the dimensions of their EI and their social competence. The results show a lack of EI in these adolescents, with all three dimensions being affected: emotional attention, clarity of feelings and emotional repair. As for social competence, it can be seen that the adolescents are characterised by a lack of confidence and firmness in their interactions. Worthy of note is the impulsive cognitive style, as are the rigidity of thought and the tendency towards social mistrust and suspicion. There are many difficulties concerning the strategies for resolving social problems. This research highlights the need to design training programmes for the residential care centres that will favour their socio-emotional development.

AB Positive development models shift focus for intervention from avoiding problems, deficits, or psychopathology to promoting skills, assets, and psychological well-being as the critical interests in development and intervention. The field can be characterized as multiple parallel lines of empirical inquiry from four frameworks: Social Competence, Social and Emotional Learning, Positive Youth Development, and Positive Psychology. This review is meant to organize understanding of implications for intervention by comparing these four frameworks along several dimensions including (1) key conceptual frameworks and constructs, (2) populations of interest, (3) measurement practices, and (4) intervention design and content implications to point out areas of overlap and distinction. Furthermore, the authors provide suggestions for the advancement beyond isolated scientific inquiry and unclear overlap and distinction, toward a more integrated approach to study and intervention design that promotes positive development.

AB Impaired automatic emotion regulation (AER) is closely related to major depressive disorder. Our research in adults has identified two AER-related components, Go N2 and NoGo P3, in an implicit emotional Go/NoGo paradigm. However, it is unclear whether Go N2 and NoGo P3 reflect the development of AER in adolescents and the relationship of these components with subclinical depressive symptoms and trait anhedonia. We collected EEG data from 55 adolescents while they completed the implicit emotional Go/NoGo task. After the experiment, the subjects completed the Chinese version of the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Consistent with results in adults, we determined that Go N2 represents automatic top-down attention to emotions in Go trials, whereas NoGo P3 represents automatic response inhibition in NoGo trials. These AER components exhibited age-dependent improvement during adolescence. Additionally, NoGo P3 amplitudes elicited by viewing positive faces were positively correlated with trait anhedonia, whereas NoGo P3 amplitudes elicited by viewing negative faces were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Our observations provide further understanding of the neurodevelopmental mechanism of AER and yield new insight into dissociable impairments in AER in adolescents with major depressive disorder during positive and negative implicit processing.

AB This article presents an individual intervention combining cognitive-behavioral and behavior-analytic approaches to target severe emotion dysregulation in verbal youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) concurrent with intellectual disability (ID). The article focuses on two specific individuals who received the treatment within a therapeutic school setting. Single-subject methodology utilizing a nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design across behaviors and participants was used to evaluate the intervention. The two participants presented with severe behavioral challenges, including physical aggression and verbal threats to harm others. Results suggest positive outcomes, including a reduction in the frequency and intensity of severe aggressive behavior and an increase in the use of coping skills, self-advocacy, and social participation. The planning and implementation of specific skills-generalization strategies was one innovative element of the intervention that proved to be pivotal to its successful application. Assessment and treatment techniques for different intervention phases are detailed along with two case examples. Intervention challenges, treatment outcomes, and future directions for clinical research are discussed.

AB Six- and nine-year-old children (N=97) heard illustrated stories evoking anger in a story character and provided evaluations of the effectiveness of eight anger regulation strategies. Half the stories involved the child's mother as social partner and the other half involved a peer. Attachment security was assessed via the Security Scale. Children reported greater effectiveness for seeking support from adults and peers in the peer context than the mother context, but perceived venting as more effective with mothers. Children with higher security scores were more likely to endorse problem solving and less likely to endorse aggression in both social contexts than those with lower security scores. Early evidence for gender differences was found in that boys endorsed the effectiveness of distraction while girls endorsed venting their emotion.

AB With a prevalence of 5-8%, specific developmental disorders of speech and language are among the most common developmental disorders. Impaired language skills strongly influence other areas of development. Owing to the essential importance of language abilities for different aspects of life, developmental language disorders impair not only the educational but also the social and emotional development of children and they continue into adolescence and adulthood. Not only the affected children and adolescents themselves, but also their families are heavily strained by social impairments and mental health problems. This paper gives an overview of the psychosocial stress in affected children and adolescents and their families. It is assumed that about 30% of children with developmental language disorders meet other psychiatric diagnoses, too. They are at increased risk for comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders. Thus, children with developmental language impairments more often show attention deficits, emotional problems, and aggressive behavior. Furthermore, their higher risk for difficulties with peers becomes increasingly more important in adolescence. The affected children and adolescents have difficulties in building friendships and are more often victims of defamation (bullying) than their peers. In comparison with the general population, parents of children with developmental language disorders show higher values in stress and depression. These higher values are particularly affected by the lack of acceptance and support by the social environment. Moreover, mothers of children with developmental language impairments show more disappointment and feelings of aggression based on the developmental problems of their children. Additionally, conflicts occur more frequently in these families. Possible causes of psychosocial stress in developmental language disorders are discussed. For example, possible causes of emotional problems in children with developmental language disorders are difficulties in the control of emotional processes, frequent failure, frustration, a lack of acceptance of schoolmates, low joy for learning, and reduced belief in their own competence. There are not enough therapeutic services adapted to the particular situation of the affected children, and most of them are based on written or oral language. The additional emotional and behavioral problems, as well as problems with peers, in children and adolescents with developmental language disorders require speech therapy as well as psychotherapeutic treatments to ensure optimal support. Moreover, work with parents should be implemented, and parent training appears to be particularly effective. Future research should investigate the association between the severity and extent of symptoms, the psychosocial stress of affected children, and the strain of their parents.

AB The present study investigated differences between adolescents with ADHD and control subjects in their adaptive und maladaptive regulation of negative emotions. We assessed emotion regulation strategies using the German self-report questionnaire FEEL-KJ in a sample of adolescents (between 11 and 18 years) with ADHD (disturbance of activity; impulsivity and attention: n = 32, hyperkinetic conduct disorder: n = 26) and controls (n = 58). We found that adolescents with ADHD reported using less adaptive strategies for dealing with negative emotions than control subjects. No effects were found for maladaptive emotion regulation strategies for anger, fear and sadness. Our findings indicate that adolescents with ADHD should be encouraged in the development of adaptive emotion regulation.

AB Objective: considering the increasing prevalence of suicide and its social, cultural, familial and personal consequences, the present research was conducted with the aim of comparing big five personality traits, brain-behavioral systems and cognitive emotion regulation strategies in women who committed suicide by poisoning and normal women. Methodology: the present research was fundamental in terms of objective and descriptive in terms of data collection. Research population consisted of all women who were hospitalized in the poisoning section of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Kermanshah in October, November and December 2014 among whom 50 individuals were chosen as a sample size using convenience sampling method. In addition, 50 women visitors who were matched in terms of gender, age and education were chosen as a comparison group. The research instrument consisted of Big Five personality traits, also known as the five factor model (FFM), questionnaire, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) and Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scale. The obtained data were analyzed using diagnosis analysis. Findings: the results indicated that neuroticism, extraversion, consciousness, behavioral inhibition system, abnormal strategies, normal strategies, openness, acceptance, behavioral activation system and fight-or-flight system assist the two groups of suicide attempters and normal women in order of importance. Conclusion: given the importance of the issue of suicide, regarding the issue of prevention and detection of risk factors and implementing various interventions to modify it seems necessary.

TI Is poor self-rated health associated with low-grade inflammation in 43

AB Objective: Self-rated health is a powerful predictor of long-term health and mortality, hence the importance of a better understanding of its biological determinants. Previous studies have shown that low-grade inflammation is associated with poor self-rated health in clinical and healthy populations, but the evidence is sparse in men and completely lacking for men in late adolescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between low-grade inflammation and self-rated health among conscripts. It was hypothesised that high levels of inflammatory factors would be associated with poor self-rated health.
   Design: Data from 49 321 men (18-21 years) conscripted for military service in 1969 and 1970 were used. Inflammation had been measured through erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Self-rated health had been assessed on a five-point scale, and was dichotomised into Good ('Verygood'/'Good'/'Fair') versus Poor ('Poor'/'Very poor'). Data from 43 110 conscripts with normal levels of ESR, and who reported self-rated health remained after exclusion of those with ESR <1 and >11 mm/h. Associations were calculated using logistic regression analyses. Adjustments were made for body mass index, socioeconomic position, inflammatory disease, emotion regulation, smoking, risky use of alcohol and physical activity.
   Results: High levels of ESR were associated with higher odds for poor self-rated health (OR: 1.077 for each unit mm/h increase in ESR, 95% CI 1.049 to 1.105).
   Conclusions: The present study shows for the first time a significant association between a marker of inflammation and self-rated health in late adolescent men, adding to evidence of an association between low-grade inflammation and subjective health perception also in men, as previously demonstrated in women. Further support for inflammation as part of a general psychobiological process that underpins subjective health perception is hereby provided.

AB Previous studies show an association between traditional and cyber victimization. However, there seem to be differences in how these forms of being bullied relates to emotional problems in the victims. Few studies focus on symptoms of general anxiety and depression as separate variables when comparing traditional and cyber victimization. Self-assessment was used from a sample of 3,046 Norwegian adolescents: 1,583 boys and 1,463 girls, ages 15 to 16 years. Significantly higher prevalence of traditional victimization than cyber victimization for both genders was found. The prevalence of being a victim of either type of victimization was significantly higher for boys than girls. Structural equation models showed significant differences between traditional victimization and cyber victimization and their relation to emotional problems. There was a stronger association between traditional victimization and depressive symptoms than between cyber victimization and depressive symptoms. Results also showed a stronger association between cyber victimization and symptoms of anxiety than between traditional victimization and symptoms of anxiety.

AB This study examined the relationship between recalled peer victimization, coping styles, and current social anxiety. College students (N = 298, 87.9% female) completed a demographic questionnaire, the Recalled Victimization Questionnaire-Revised (RVQ-R), the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE), and the Coping Styles Questionnaire (CSQ). Three separate linear regression analyses were performed to test for mediation of coping style on the relationship among peer victimization and symptoms of social anxiety. Emotional coping was confirmed as a partially mediating variable between peer victimization and social anxiety through Sobel's (1982) test for mediation. The results of this mediational analysis emphasize the importance of focusing on coping strategies among adolescents who experience peer victimization.

AB Aim: Hemoencephalography (HEG) is an emerging procedure for clinical application in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other disorders, regardless of age. It is available to any research group for its relative simplicity and low cost and is a useful tool for assessing prefrontal-dependent functions. Older teenagers pose peculiarities in the prefrontal maturation, and we aim to establish HEG patterns that might have clinical applicability.
   Methods: The HEG patterns of 70 university students (56 women and 14 men, 21-48 years old, mean 31.84, SD 10.65, standard error of mean 0.31) were compared with those of 59 adolescents 13-14-year-old secondary education students, 28 females and 31 males. The HEG patterns were obtained in response to the observation of shocking, unpleasant, and pleasant pictures. We use one-way and two-way analysis of variance to disentangle the differences between groups. All effects were analyzed with F-tests.
   Results: In all cases, university students and adolescents showed a decrease in prefrontal activity, indicative of differences in the emotional inner networks between groups, which are responsible for security-insecurity processing. Compared with university students, adolescents showed statistically significant differences in decreased activity in very unpleasant (shocking) tests that demand increased security-insecurity processing. Adolescents showed lower decrease. In addition, adolescents, compared with university subjects, did not show statistically significantly decreased HEG activity compared with the baseline in very unpleasant tests.
   Conclusion: Teens showed distinguishable patterns of HEG, which were consistent with the cognitive emotional dysregulation in cognition and emotion interaction, that is, exterior network versus internal network interactions. Disability in regulation (modulation) of emotional response to negative emotional stimuli (fear of insecurity) in adolescence is an indicator of possible future clinical and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety with high incidence of onset at this critical age and frequent comorbidity in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. HEG pattern might be a useful marker to define maturation and future possible mental dysfunctions.

AB This study had the objective of evaluating the profile of children referred to mental health services and of discussing the impact of functional problems presented at school, which may be neglected by the Brazilian public policies. Data from 160 schoolchildren, of both genders, was collected from their respective caretakers in three mental health services using two instruments: an identification form to characterize the participants, the caretakers, the social-demographic profile, the person responsible for the referral and demand; and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age. Data obtained showed a high demand due to emotional/behavioral difficulties combined with learning, relationship and daily life difficulties named functional disorders by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) and not attended by the special education policies, which were referred by health centers and not mainly by the school, which would be the standard. Except for the referral, data is consistent with the literature, which points out a high incidence of these difficulties in children and adolescents, creating academic barriers and problems that have a great impact throughout their academic and personal lives. In this regard, intervention models based in schools have increasingly widened the concept of inclusion and offered promising alternatives of alliances between schools and mental health services, which may inspire future public policies in the area.

AB Background:. Family conflict exacerbates the course of bipolar disorder (BP) among adults. However, few studies have examined family conflict among adolescents with BP, and fewer have looked at adolescent-reported and parent-reported family conflict separately.
   Methods:. Subjects were 89 adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, with a diagnosis of BP on the basis of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL). Subjects were divided into high-conflict and low-conflict groups using a median split on the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (child report and parent report). The chi(2) analyses and independent samples t tests were performed for univariate analyses. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on variables with P<0.2.
   Results:. Parent-reported and adolescent-reported Conflict Behavior Questionnaire scores were significantly correlated (r=0.50, P<0.001). High parent-reported family conflict was positively associated with recent manic symptoms, externalizing comorbidities, and dimensional scores reflecting emotional dysregulation. High adolescent-reported family conflict was positively associated with recent manic symptoms and emotional dysregulation, and negatively associated with socioeconomic status and lifetime psychiatric hospitalization. Bipolar subtype was significantly associated with high versus low family conflict.
   Limitations:. The limitations of this study included being a cross-sectional study, use of a medium-sized sample, and lack of a control group.
   Conclusions:. Despite substantial agreement between adolescents and parents regarding the amount of family conflict, there were meaningful differences in the factors associated with adolescent-reported and parent-reported conflict. These findings demonstrate the importance of ascertaining family conflict from adolescents as well as from parents. Moreover, these findings can potentially inform family therapy, which is known to be effective for adolescents with BP.

AB Introduction. The reasons underlying self-harm in persons with autism do not appear to have a single, straightforward and simple explanation. Biological predisposition, certain psychological states involving stress, atypical sensory processing, communication disorders, medical problems, and limited emotional regulation, among others, can lead persons with autism to harm themselves.
   Aims. In this article a distinction is drawn, first of all, between self-harm related to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and self-harm linked to other psychiatric conditions. Second, a preliminary approach to an integrated model for the understanding of self-harm in autism is proposed.
   Development. Some of the hypotheses put forward to account for self-harm in autism are focused on atypical sensory processing, on communication disorders and medical problems, and on emotional dysregulation.
   Conclusions. The limited number of studies conducted in this area and the inconsistency of the data resulting from them have led to great efforts being made to separate the facts from the suppositions in this subject. This modest initial proposal makes it possible to draw up a roadmap to guide and help persons with autism, their families and professionals in the process of reducing or eliminating this behaviour. It is suggested that self-harm should no longer be considered a disruptive behaviour and that it should be interpreted instead as an (inadequate) self-regulatory response to stress.

AB Because mothers continue to serve as a secure base throughout adolescence, this study examined the unique role of late adolescents' attachment style with mother in self-reported, partner-reported, and observed disagreements as well as in positive and negative emotions with a close peer. Forty-four adolescents (30 females; age 17-19 years) were videotaped with a romantic partner or same-sex friend discussing 2 problems in their relationship. Adolescents rated their attachment style with their mother, assessing dimensions of anxiety and avoidance at 2 different time points, averaged. As well, they reported attachment to the peer. Outcome measures (i.e., reported and observed disagreements, positive emotions, and negative emotions) were combined into a single index of negativity. Adolescents were more negative with a romantic partner than with a friend. Adolescents higher in attachment anxiety with mother were less negative with their romantic partner. Moreover, when variability associated with attachment style with mother was controlled, adolescents higher in attachment avoidance with their peer were more negative, and girls were more negative than boys. Findings support the continued role of attachment style with mother, and attachment anxiety, in adolescents' emotion regulation behaviour with close peers, particularly romantic partners.

AB The number and timing of stressors experienced during pregnancy were investigated using longitudinal data from the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Study cohort (N=2,900). Motor development data were collected at 10 (n=1,622), 14 (n=1,584), and 17 (n=1,222) years using the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development. Linear mixed models were used to examine the effect of stress on motor development, accounting for repeated measures. Number of stressful events and mean Neuromuscular Development Index were negatively related (=-1.197, p=.001). Stressful events experienced in late pregnancy were negatively related with offspring motor development (=-0.0541, p=.050), while earlier stressful events had no significant impact.

AB This study tested whether children's more anxious and avoidant attachment is linked to decreased support-seeking behavior toward their mother during stress in middle childhood, and whether children's decreased support-seeking behavior enhances the impact of experiencing life events on the increase of depressive symptoms 18months later. Ninety-eight 8- to 12-year-old children filled out questionnaires assessing their level of anxious and avoidant attachment and depressive symptoms. Children's support-seeking behavior was observed through measuring the time children waited before calling for their mother's help while carrying out a stressful task. Results supported the hypothesis that more anxiously or avoidantly attached children waited longer before seeking maternal support. Moreover, waiting longer was related to increased depressive symptoms at follow-up in children who reported more experienced life events.

AB The goal of this study was to identify profiles of individual (identity, initiative, emotion regulation, and teamwork and social skills) and social experiences (social integration in the activity peer group and support from the activity leader) in organized activities and examine activity-related and youth-related characteristics associated with profile membership. A total of 413 youths (57% girls; M-age = 14.44) involved in 33 different activities were surveyed. Three distinct profiles emerged from the data, characterized by low, average, and high scores on both individual and social experiences, respectively. Membership in these profiles was, predicted by the type of activity, the intensity of participation, and the extent to which youths experienced "flow" while participating. Overall, this study revealed that most youths reported high frequencies of positive individual and social experiences in their organized activities and that few activity-related and youth-related characteristics predicted profile membership.

AB This study explored the effects of being bullied from a dual-factor lens, specifically examining the relation between victimization and constructs that contribute to social-emotional well-being. Prior to carrying out the main analyses, the factor structure of self-report items related to experiencing bullying and harassment from the California Healthy Kids Survey, which was administered to more than 14,000 high school students, was examined to establish that these items represent an overall factor: students' experience of victimization. This factor was then used as an independent variable in a series of planned comparisons with a dependent variable represented by constructs addressed by the Social Emotional Health Survey-Secondary: belief-in-self, emotional competence, belief-in-others, and engaged living. With increased frequency of victimization, suicidality increased and belief-in-others decreased. For other constructs, belief-in-self, engaged living, and depression, there were significant differences found between individuals who had experienced frequencies of bullying as low as less than once a month and those who did not experience bullying at all but no further detrimental impacts were seen with even higher frequencies of victimization, indicating that being victimized at all is significantly worse than not being victimized for these variables. Implications and future directions for research are explored.

AB Priapism is the prolonged, painful erection of penile tissue not accompanied by sexual arousal. Priapism has been established as a rare adverse drug reaction to drugs such as antipsychotics, psychostimulants, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers. Immediate intervention is needed to prevent destructive and irreversible complications, such as erectile dysfunction, disfigurement, inability of the penis to stay erect, and related social/emotional problems. Antipsychotic-induced priapism may result from the alpha receptor occupancy property of those drugs. We report the case of a 13-year-old suffering from attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder plus conduct disorder with priapism related to antipsychotics. Episodes occurred with risperidone plus methylphenidate, quetiapine plus methylphenidate, and chlorpromazine alone.

AB The present study examined (a) whether sleep related problems (SRPs) improved following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth with anxiety disorders, (b) whether variables that may link anxiety and SRPs (e.g., pre-sleep arousal, family accommodation, sleep hygiene) changed during treatment, and (c) whether such changes predicted SRPs at posttreatment. Youth were diagnosed with anxiety at pretreatment and received weekly CBT that targeted their principal anxiety diagnosis at one of two specialty clinics (N = 69 completers, Mage = 10.86). Results indicated that parent-reported SRPs improved from pre to post-treatment and that treatment responders with regard to anxiety yielded greater SRP improvements than nonresponders. Parent report of bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety showed significant improvements. Youth reported lower rates of SRPs compared to their parents and did not demonstrate pre- to post-treatment changes in SRPs. Pre-sleep arousal and family accommodation decreased over treatment but did not predict lower SRPs at posttreatment. Higher accommodation was correlated with greater SRPs. Sleep hygiene evidenced no change and did not mediate links between accommodation and posttreatment SRPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evidence for effective treatment for behavioral problems continues to grow, yet evidence about the effective mechanisms underlying those interventions has lagged behind. The Stop Now and Plan (SNAP) program is a multicomponent intervention for boys between 6 and 11. This study tested putative treatment mechanisms using data from 252 boys in a randomized controlled trial of SNAP versus treatment as usual. SNAP includes a 3 month group treatment period followed by individualized intervention, which persisted through the 15 month study period. Measures were administered in four waves: at baseline and at 3, 9 and 15 months after baseline. A hierarchical linear modeling strategy was used. SNAP was associated with improved problem-solving skills, prosocial behavior, emotion regulation skills, and reduced parental stress. Prosocial behavior, emotion regulation skills and reduced parental stress partially mediated improvements in child aggression. Improved emotion regulation skills partially mediated treatment-related child anxious-depressed outcomes. Improvements in parenting behaviors did not differ between treatment conditions. The results suggest that independent processes may drive affective and behavioral outcomes, with some specificity regarding the mechanisms related to differing treatment outcomes.

AB Background:The use of virtual reality or three-dimensional (3D) simulation programs has been explored in different mental health problems and contexts. One of the applications that showed evidence of a suitable assessment for behavioral and emotional problems in adolescents is the 3D questionnaire called MySchool4web. The aim of this work was to analyze the psychometric properties of a tailored version of MySchool4web.Materials and Methods:A correlational, nonexperimental, cross-sectional study was carried out. The participants were 668 secondary students from schools in Santiago, Chile with a mean age of 15.74 years. Adolescents completed MySchool4web in the informatics classroom of each school.Results:Results indicated that two of the items had to be removed, and a three-factor solution was found representing the dimensions substance use, bullying, and body image. This final model of 10 items showed acceptable internal consistency per factor, and its scores were significantly associated with other related measures in nine items.Conclusions:These outcomes suggest that this version of MySchool4web is a reliable and valid measure of a 3D instrument for the screening of risky behaviors and emotional problems in adolescents and young adults in a school context.

AB Objective: This study examined whether the use of tobacco and marijuana by fathers or mothers predicted onset of alcohol use in their offspring over and above effects of parental alcohol use. Method: The present study included 146 children of 93 parents (90 fathers and 85 mothers). The fathers were originally recruited as boys to the Oregon Youth Study, a study of community, familial, and individual risk factors for delinquency. Results: Only mothers' but not fathers' alcohol use was associated with children's age at onset. Children's age at onset was predicted by mothers' tobacco use and by the interaction of fathers' marijuana use and alcohol use. These effects were observed when controlling for parental education, child's gender, and also child's antisocial behavior a general developmental risk factor for substance use onset in adolescence. Conclusions: Mothers' substance use played a major role in childhood onset of alcohol use, yet the role of maternal substance use as a risk factor for their children has previously received less attention than the role of paternal substance use. Also, findings imply that it may be important to identify children of polysubstance-using parents for targeted prevention programs.

AB Objective: Trauma processing is central to healthy recovery, but few studies examine how youth process experiences of child sexual abuse (CSA). The current study builds on our prior work identifying individual differences in CSA processing strategies (i.e., Constructive, Absorbed, Avoidant) to examine whether abuse stigmatization, PTSD symptoms, and negative reactions from others experienced during the year after abuse discovery were associated with subsequent CSA processing strategies. Method: Participants included 160 ethnically diverse youth (8-15 years, 73% female) with confirmed cases of CSA. Predictors were measured at abuse discovery (T1) and 1 year later (T2). Individual differences in CSA processing strategies were assessed 6 years after discovery (T3) from participants' abuse narratives. Results: The persistence of abuse stigmatization from T1 to T2 significantly increased the odds of using either an Avoidant or Absorbed (vs. Constructive) strategy at T3. Higher levels of PTSD symptoms at T1 as well as their persistence from T1 to T2 each significantly increased the odds of having an Absorbed versus Constructive strategy. The persistence of perceived negative reactions from others from T1 to T2 increased the odds of an Absorbed versus Avoidant strategy. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large (M d = 0.636). Conclusions: Results further validate prior work identifying distinct CSA processing strategies and suggest the persistence of abuse-specific disruptions over the year after abuse discovery may be associated with subsequent problems processing CSA experiences.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether adolescents living in households with food insecurity have poorer parent-reported mental health (MH) than peers.
   METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from similar to 8600 adolescents who participated in the 2007 (8th grade) wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten. Household food insecurity (HFI) was assessed by parental report on the 18-item US Household Food Security Scale. Total Difficulties score >13 on the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) indicated problems with adolescent MH. SDQ subscale scores (Emotional, Conduct, Hyperactivity, Peer Problems) were also calculated. Associations between HFI and MH were explored in bivariate and multivariable analyses. Interactions of HFI and gender and HFI and receipt of free/reduced-price school lunch were analyzed with regard to problems with MH.
   RESULTS: A total of 10.2% of adolescents lived with HFI; 11.2% had SDQ >13. Adolescents with HFI had higher rates of overall MH problems (28.7% vs 9.2%), emotional problems (21.6% vs 6.6%), conduct problems (26.5% vs 11.6%), hyperactivity (22.4% vs 11.3%), and peer problems (19.8% vs 8.6%) (all P < .01). After adjustment for confounders, the association between HFI and overall MH problems (odds ratio 2.3; 95% confidence interval 1.6-3.3) remained Interactions of HFI and gender and HFI and free/reduced-price school lunch were not significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: HFI was associated with increased risk of parent-reported MH problems among both male and female adolescents. Free/reduced-price school lunch did not significantly alter this relationship. Effective interventions to promote MH and reduce HFI among adolescents are necessary.

AB Objective Many psychosocial factors have been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), including hostility, anger, and depression. We tested the hypothesis that these factors may have their basis in emotion regulation abilities. Our aim was to determine whether poor emotional control predicted long-term risk of CHD.
   Methods This Swedish national study includes 46,393 men who were conscripted for military service in 1969 and 1970. The men were aged 18 to 20 years at the time of conscription. Psychologists used a brief semistructured interview to retrospectively assess the conscripts' level of emotional control in childhood and adolescence. The outcome measure was a first fatal or nonfatal event of CHD. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for poor and adequate versus good emotional control.
   Results After 38 years of follow-up (1971-2009), 2456 incident cases of CHD had occurred. Poor emotional control increased the risk of CHD (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.18-1.45), adjusting for childhood socioeconomic position, anxiety, depression, and parental history of CHD. Further adjustment for life-style-related factors, for example, smoking and body mass index, attenuated the HR to 1.08 (95% CI = 0.97-1.21). In stratified analyses, the fully adjusted association between poor emotional control with CHD remained significantly elevated among men with a parental history of CHD (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.11-2.01, p interaction = .037).
   Conclusions In the overall study population, poor emotional control had no direct effect on CHD beyond life-style-related factors. However, in men with a parental history of CHD, poor emotional control in adolescence remained significantly predictive of long-term CHD risk even when adjusting for life-style-related factors.

AB Objective: To examine self-reported positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) among youth with ADHD (only and comorbid) and other non-ADHD-referred youth in an ethnically diverse clinical sample. Method: Semi-structured interviews identified 80 pure ADHD, 284 ADHD plus one or more comorbidities, and 730 non-ADHD youth (e.g., other diagnoses or no diagnosis). The Positive and Negative Affect Scale-Children (PANAS-C) was used to assess affective states. Results: Even after controlling for the influence of potential confounds, youth with only ADHD reported higher PA and lower NA than other clinic-referred youth. The ADHD-comorbid group reported higher PA than the non-ADHD group, but these groups did not differ on level of NA. ADHD subtype did not influence results. Conclusion: Among clinic-referred youth, ADHD is associated with higher levels of PA and when there are no comorbid disorders, lower levels of NA.

AB This study aimed to evaluate an intervention designed to enhance early adolescents' emotion regulation skill use and to decrease risk behaviors. Adolescents 12 to 14 years old (N = 420; 53 % male) with mental health symptoms were referred for participation in either an Emotion Regulation (ER) or Health Promotion (HP) intervention consisting of 12 after-school sessions. Participants completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires on laptop computers. Using a generalized analysis of covariance controlling for baseline scores, participants in the ER intervention were less likely to be sexually active and engage in other risk behaviors, such as fighting, at the conclusion of the program. Additionally, participants in the ER intervention reported greater use of emotion regulation strategies and more favorable attitudes toward abstinence. Interventions directly targeting emotion regulation may be useful in addressing health risk behaviors of adolescents with mental health symptoms.

AB Early life adversity has been related to a number of psychological disorders including mood and other disorders that can manifest as inappropriate or aggressive responses to social challenges. The present study used post-weaning social isolation (PSI) in rats, a model of early life adversity, to examine its effects on Fos protein expression produced by exposure to a novel social encounter. We have previously reported that the social encounter-induced increase in Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex observed in group-housed controls (GRP) was attenuated in rats that had experienced PSI. Here we assessed Fos expression in other brain regions thought to be involved in emotion regulation and social behavior. Male and female rats were housed in same-sex groups or in isolation (ISO) for 4 weeks beginning on postnatal day (P) 21 and were exposed to a single 15 min social encounter with a novel same-sex conspecific on P49. Fos positive cells were assessed using immunohistochemistry in 16 regions within the forebrain. Exposure to a novel conspecific increased Fos expression in the forebrain of GRP rats in a region- and sex-specific fashion. This increase was blunted or absent in ISO rats within many regions including cortical regions, thalamus, habenula, dentate gyrus, lateral septum, and basolateral amygdala. In several regions, the increase in Fos was greater in male than in female group housed rats. Negative relationships were observed between social interactions and Fos in some regions. Forebrain hypofunction produced by early-life adversity may be involved in socially inappropriate behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data from the Head Start Impact Study (N = 3540) were used to test for differential benefits of Head Start after one program year and after kindergarten on pre-academic and behavior outcomes for children at risk in the domains targeted by the program's comprehensive services. Although random assignment to Head Start produced positive treatment main effects on children's pre-academic skills and behavior problems, residualized growth models showed that random assignment to Head Start did not differentially benefit the pre-academic skills of children with risk factors targeted by the Head Start service model. The models showed detrimental impacts of Head Start for maternal-reported behavior problems of high-risk children, but slightly more positive impacts for teacher-reported behavior. Policy implications for Head Start are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Children affected by HIV/AIDS have unique psychosocial needs that often go unaddressed in traditional treatment approaches. They are more likely than unaffected peers to encounter stigma, including overt discriminatory behaviors, as well as stereotyped attitudes. In addition, HIV-affected children are at risk for experiencing negative affect, including sadness and depression. Previous studies have identified a link between HIV stigma and the subsequent emotional status of children affected by HIV/AIDS. However, limited data are available regarding protective psychological factors that can mitigate the effects of HIV stigma and thus promote resiliency for this vulnerable population. Utilizing data from 790 children aged 6-17 years affected by parental HIV in rural central China this study aims to examine the association between HIV stigma, including both enacted and perceived stigma, and emotional status among HIV-affected children, as well as to evaluate the mediating effects of emotional regulation on the relationship between HIV stigma and emotional status. In addition, the moderating role of age is tested. Multiple regression was conducted to test the mediation model. We found that the experience of HIV stigma had a direct positive effect on negative emotions among children affected by HIV. Emotional regulation offers a level of protection, as it mediated the impact of HIV stigma on negative emotions. Moreover, age was found to moderate the relationship between perceived stigma and negative emotions. A significant interaction between perceived stigma and age suggested that negative emotions increase with age among those who perceived a higher level of stigmatization. Results suggest that children affected by HIV may benefit from interventions designed to enhance their capacity to regulate emotions and that health professionals should be aware of the link between stigma and negative emotion in childhood and adolescence and use the knowledge to inform their treatments with this population.

AB The aims of this study were to analyze which coping strategies are more adequate and which are less adequate during adolescence and to examine any gender differences observed in this respect. Participants were 762 adolescents aged between 16 and 18. To assess coping strategies, an adaptation of the Responses to Stress Questionnaire was used. To assess whether or not the coping strategies used were adequate, three indexes were used: decrease in anxiety, satisfaction with oneself and improvement in relationships. The correlational analyses revealed significant positive correlations between the three indexes and the coping strategies generally considered to be positive, and significant negative correlations between the indexes and coping strategies generally considered to be negative. The results also revealed that girls and boys tend to use different coping strategies. These results are consistent with those found in previous studies.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore the association between subjective insomnia and self-reported emotional competence in areas such as regulating and perceiving one's own emotions and empathy, in a sample of adolescents. Gender differences were also explored. 366 adolescents in 10th to 12th grade (mean age: M = 16.9 years) took part in this cross-sectional study. They completed questionnaires related to emotional competencies, empathy, and sleep. Higher scores for insomnia were associated with lower scores for some aspects of emotional competence and empathy. Compared to males, females generally had higher scores for emotional competence. Poor sleep as subjectively experienced among adolescents is associated with specific impairments in emotional competence and empathy. Gender-related patterns were also observed.

AB Introduction We aim to determine the effectiveness of a school-based violence prevention programme implemented in Jamaican preschools, on reducing the levels of aggression among children at school, and violence against children by teachers.
   Methods and analysis This is a 2-arm, single-blind, cluster-randomised controlled trial with parallel assignment. Clusters are 76 preschools in Kingston, and all teachers and classrooms in the selected schools are included in the study. In addition, a random sample of up to 12 children in the 4-year-old classes have been selected for evaluation of child-level outcomes. The intervention involves training teachers in classroom behaviour management and in strategies to promote children's social-emotional competence. Training is delivered through five full-day workshops, monthly in-class coaching over 2 school terms, and weekly text messages. The primary outcome measures are: (1) observed levels of child aggression and (2) observed violence against children by teachers. Secondary outcomes include observations of the levels of children's prosocial behaviour and the quality of the classroom environment, teachers' reports of their mental health, teacher-reported child mental health, direct tests of children's self-regulation and child attendance.
   Ethics and dissemination If this intervention were effective at improving the caregiving environment of young children in school, this would have significant implications for the prevention of child mental health problems, and prevention of violence against children in low and middle-income countries where services are often limited. The intervention is integrated into the school system and involves training existing staff, and thus, represents an appropriate strategy for large-scale implementation and benefits at the population level. Ethical consent for the study was given by the School of Psychology Ethics and Research Committee, Bangor University (ref: 2014-14167), and by the University of the West Indies Ethics Committee (ref: ECP 50,14/15).

AB Objective: Several developmental models of borderline personality disorder (BPD) emphasize the role of disrupted interpersonal relationships or insecure attachment. As yet, attachment quality and the mechanisms by which insecure attachment relates to borderline features in adolescents have not been investigated. In this study, we used a multiple mediational approach to examine the cross-sectional interplay between attachment, social cognition (in particular hypermentalizing), emotion dysregulation, and borderline features in adolescence, controlling for internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Methods: The sample included 259 consecutive admissions to an adolescent inpatient unit (M-age = 15.42, SD = 1.43; 63.1% female). The Child Attachment Interview (CM) was used to obtain a dimensional index of overall coherence of the attachment narrative. An experimental task was used to assess hypermentalizing, alongside self-report measures of emotion dyregulation and BPD.
   Results: Our findings suggested that, in a multiple mediation model, hypermentalizing and emotion dysregulation together mediated the relation between attachment coherence and borderline features, but that this effect was driven by hypermentalizing; that is, emotion dysregulation failed to mediate the link between attachment coherence and borderline features while hypermentalizing demonstrated mediational effects.
   Conclusions: The study provides the first empirical evidence of well-established theoretical approaches to the development of BPD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Cannabis use typically commences during adolescence, a period during which the brain undergoes profound remodeling in areas that are high in cannabinoid receptors and that mediate cognitive control and emotion regulation. It is therefore important to determine the impact of adolescent cannabis use on brain function.
   Objective: We investigate the impact of adolescent cannabis use on brain function by reviewing the functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in adolescent samples.
   Method: We systematically reviewed the literature and identified 13 functional neuroimaging studies in adolescent cannabis users (aged 13 to 18 years) performing working memory, inhibition and reward processing tasks.
   Results: The majority of the studies found altered brain function, but intact behavioural task performance in adolescent cannabis users versus controls. The most consistently reported differences were in the frontal-parietal network, which mediates cognitive control. Heavier use was associated with abnormal brain function in most samples. A minority of studies controlled for the influence of confounders that can also undermine brain function, such as tobacco and alcohol use, psychopathology symptoms, family history of psychiatric disorders and substance use.
   Conclusion: Emerging evidence shows abnormal frontal-parietal network activity in adolescent cannabis users, particularly in heavier users. Brain functional alterations may reflect a compensatory neural mechanism that enables normal behavioural performance. It remains unclear if cannabis exposure drives these alterations, as substance use and mental health confounders have not been systematically examined.

AB This study used structural equation modeling to examine the relationships between emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), and suicide. One hundred forty-eight undergraduates completed a brief structured interview and self-report measures of emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, and NSSI and suicidal behaviors. Results indicated a significant indirect effect of emotion dysregulation on NSSI via internalizing symptoms and on suicide attempts via NSSI. Findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the indirect association between emotion dysregulation and NSSI and suicidal behaviors. Implications for the potential utility of targeting internalizing symptoms as well as emotion dysregulation in interventions addressing NSSI and suicidal behaviors are discussed.

AB The study of development is, in and of itself, the study of change over time, but emotions, particularly emotional reactivity and emotional regulation, also unfold over time, albeit over briefer time-scales. Adolescence is a period of development characterized by marked changes in emotional processes and rewiring of the underlying neural circuitry, making this time of life formative. Yet this period is also a time of increased risk for anxiety and mood disorders. Changes in the temporal dynamics of emotional processes (e.g. magnitude, time-to-peak and duration) occur during this developmental period and have been associated with risk for mood and anxiety disorders. In this article, we describe how the temporal dynamics of emotions change during adolescence and how they may increase risk for these psychopathologies. We highlight studies that illustrate how formalizing temporal neurodynamics of emotion may enhance links among levels of analyses from neurobiological to real-world, moment-to-moment experiences.

AB Emerging research suggests that early exposure to environmental adversity has important implications for the development of brain regions associated with emotion regulation, yet little is known about how such adversity translates into observable differences in children's emotion-related behavior. The present study examines the relationship between geocoded neighborhood crime and urban pre-adolescents' emotional attention, appraisal, and response. Results indicate that living in a high-crime neighborhood is associated with greater selective attention toward negatively valenced emotional stimuli on a dot probe task, less biased appraisal of fear on a facial identification task, and lower rates of teacher-reported internalizing behaviors in the classroom. These findings suggest that children facing particularly high levels of environmental threat may develop different regulatory processes (e.g. greater use of emotional suppression) than their peers from low-crime neighborhoods in order to manage the unique stressors and social demands of their communities.

AB Few studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation across adolescence and young adulthood. Existing studies of cognitive reappraisal indicate that improvements in regulatory efficiency may develop linearly across this period, in accordance with maturation of prefrontal cortical systems. However, there is also evidence for adolescent differences in reappraisal specific to the activation of "social-information processing network" regions, including the amygdala and temporal-occipital cortices. Here, we use fMRI to examine the neural correlates of emotional reactivity and reappraisal in response to aversive social imagery in a group of 78 adolescents and young adults aged 15-25 years. Within the group, younger participants exhibited greater activation of temporal-occipital brain regions during reappraisal in combination with weaker suppression of amygdala reactivity-the latter being a general correlate of successful reappraisal. Further analyses demonstrated that these age-related influences on amygdala reactivity were specifically mediated by activation of the fusiform face area. Overall, these findings suggest that enhanced processing of salient social cues (i.e., faces) increases reactivity of the amygdala during reappraisal and that this relationship is stronger in younger adolescents. How these relationships contribute to well-known vulnerabilities of emotion regulation during this developmental period will be an important topic for ongoing research.

AB Physical activity programs are viable contexts to foster life skills. Researchers contend that programs must be structured to deliberately teach life skills and teach how such skills can be transferred. The purpose of this study is to understand female youths' perceptions of life skills transfer from participation in a physical activity-based life skills program. Interviews were conducted with eight youth. Results indicated that youth learned intrapersonal (i. e., emotional regulation, focus, goal setting), interpersonal (i. e., respect, responsibility, social skills), and physical activity skills and applied these skills in other life domains. Leaders' practical strategies used to explicitly teach transferable skills are discussed.

AB Members of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine developed consensus recommendations for the amount of sleep needed to promote optimal health in children and adolescents using a modified RAND Appropriateness Method. After review of 864 published articles, the following sleep durations are recommended: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Sleeping the number of recommended hours on a regular basis is associated with better health outcomes including: improved attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health. Regularly sleeping fewer than the number of recommended hours is associated with attention, behavior, and learning problems. Insufficient sleep also increases the risk of accidents, injuries, hypertension, obesity,

AB Objective:Risk factors associated with adverse behavioral outcomes in very preterm (VPT) or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants are poorly understood. The aim of this article is to identify prognostic factors for behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders in children born 32 weeks gestational age or with birth weight 1250 g.Method:A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, and Pyscinfo databases to identify studies published between January 1, 1990 and June 1, 2014 reporting multivariable prediction models for behavioral problems or psychiatric disorders in VPT/VLBW children. Fifteen studies were identified and 2 independent reviewers extracted key information on study design, outcome definition, risk factor selection, model development, reporting, and conducted a risk of bias assessment.Results:The 15 studies included reported risk factor analyses for the following domains: general behavioral problems (n = 8), any psychiatric disorder (n = 2), autism spectrum symptoms/disorders (n = 5), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 1). Findings were inconclusive because of the following: small number of studies in each domain, heterogeneity in outcome measures, lack of overlap in the risk factors examined, and differences in strategies for dealing with children with neurological impairments.Conclusion:There is a lack of evidence concerning risk factors for behavior problems and psychiatric disorders among VPT/VLBW survivors. This review has identified the need for further research examining the etiology of disorders of psychological development in the VPT/VLBW population to refine risk prediction and identify targets for intervention. Large well-conducted studies that use standard diagnostic evaluations to assess psychiatric disorders throughout childhood and adolescence are required.

Parent/caregiver reports of psychobehavioral functioning indicated significant decreases in children's emotional symptoms and marginally significant reductions in conduct problems. Child reports of emotion regulation indicated significant increases in emotion awareness, significant decreases in emotion suppression, and nonsignificant increases in emotion-focused coping and dysregulated expression. Parents/caregivers and children reported high satisfaction with CLIMB (R). Results suggest CLIMB (R) is a promising intervention for improving psychobehavioral functioning and emotion regulation in children with a parent/caregiver with cancer.

AB Recent research has pointed to the importance of the interaction of emotions, perception of emotional expressions in social contexts, and emotion regulation for nonaggressive behavior in children. Evaluations underline the positive impact of prevention programs rather than interventional therapy for children. Long-term curricular training aiming at nonviolent behavior was shown to be successful; however, comprehensive programs cannot always be administered in every-day school contexts. Thus, a short-term prevention program for elementary school fourth-graders was developed for training in the classroom. The program Peaceful Cooperation in Conflict Situations aims at improving the sensitivity and understanding of emotions in self and others, perspective taking in conflict situations, and knowledge of how to communicate nonviolently. In a longitudinal control group study including block randomization, 184 elementary school children in fourth grade participated in the study; 177 complete data records entered the final analysis. The pretest instruments were (a) a paper-andpencil test measuring the children's social-emotional competencies (i.e., identifying emotional expressions in pictures; describing emotions of aggressors and victims in conflict situations involving children; writing down options of positive behavior to solve the situation peacefully) and (b) teachers' ratings of their pupils' altruistic behavior and emotional and social problems. Two weeks later, the training was administered during three 90-min lessons within a period of 4 weeks. The controls received no special treatment. At posttest 16 weeks after the training, the same tests were administered. Data analyses (MANOVA, ANOVA) revealed that the intervention group improved considerably and with great effects in their social-emotional proficiency as a result of the training. At posttest, they had far advanced in all tested abilities in comparison with their pretest results. They acquired a significantly better understanding of emotions and perspective taking in conflict situations than the controls did. The trained children were rated more favorably by their teachers with respect to their prosocial behavior than at pretest 5 months earlier. The study supports findings from two previous studies with third graders. It shows that a short-term program aiming at enhancing social-emotional knowledge in children can lead to positive results with effects lasting at least several months later. The program can help to prevent the escalation of conflicts and to further peaceful communication. For implementation in schools on a larger scale, measures will have to be taken to ensure the transfer of the reported results.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a screening tool that enables the evaluation of emotional and behavioural difficulties, and prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents from a multi-informant perspective. The main goal of this article is to carry out a selective review on the main evidence concerning the psychometric and epidemiologic characteristics of the SDQ. The psychometric properties are adequate with regard to the reliability of the scores and the five-factor structure is the most accepted (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behaviour). In addition, different studies support the appropriateness of the SDQ for use as an evaluation tool in clinical and school contexts. The results show that gender and age have an influence on the phenotypic expression of emotional and behavioural difficulties. In conclusion, the SDQ is a short, easy to use, and useful measurement tool for evaluating problems, difficulties, and capacities related to childhood and adolescence and it may be used with Spanish children and adolescents.

TI Breaking Down the Coercive Cycle: How Parent and Child Risk Factors

AB SYNOPSISObjective. Parent-child coercive cycles have been associated with both rigidity and inconsistency in parenting behavior. To explain these mixed findings, we examined real-time variability in maternal responses to children's off-task behavior to determine whether this common trigger of the coercive cycle (responding to child misbehavior) is associated with rigidity or inconsistency in parenting. We also examined the effects of risk factors for coercion (maternal hostility, maternal depressive symptoms, child externalizing problems, and dyadic negativity) on patterns of parenting. Design. Mother-child dyads (N=96; M child age=41months) completed a difficult puzzle task, and observations were coded continuously for parent (e.g., directive, teaching) and child behavior (e.g., on-task, off-task). Results. Multilevel continuous-time survival analyses revealed that parenting behavior is less variable when children are off-task. However, when risk factors are higher, a different profile emerges. Combined maternal and child risk is associated with markedly lower variability in parenting behavior overall (i.e., rigidity) paired with shifts toward higher variability specifically when children are off-task (i.e., inconsistency). Dyadic negativity (i.e., episodes when children are off-task and parents engage in negative behavior) are also associated with higher parenting variability. Conclusions. Risk factors confer rigidity in parenting overall, but in moments when higher-risk parents must respond to child misbehavior, their parenting becomes more variable, suggesting inconsistency and ineffectiveness. This context-dependent shift in parenting behavior may help explain prior mixed findings and offer new directions for family interventions designed to reduce coercive processes.

AB The Responses to Positive Affect questionnaire (RPA) assesses responses that either tend to dampen or enhance positive affect. Previously, using factor analysis, enhancing (i.e., positive rumination, PR) has been divided into self-focused and emotion-focused strategies. Whereas these PR types are mostly treated as different factors, they are also examined as a single factor, for instance in adolescents. Given that self-concept changes through adolescence, there might be an age effect such that self-focused PR and emotion-focused PR become more differentiated through adolescence. The present aim was to investigate the distinction between emotion-focused and self-focused PR by comparing the RPA structure in three age groups, i.e., early, middle, and late adolescence (Study 1); and by conducting a systematic review of the relationship between both strategies in published research (Study 2). In Study 1, we found no evidence that the two types of PR were more differentiated in the oldest than in the youngest group. In Study 2, related to Study 1, self-focused and emotion-focused PR were highly correlated in most of the published research. Also, there were item switches between the PR factors in RPA translations. In sum, it is justifiable to investigate PR as a single construct when using the RPA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: A recent cross-sectional study showed that maternal rejection is associated with emotional eating of obese youngsters seeking treatment, and that this relation is mediated by maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) of the youngsters. We wanted to build on this study and investigate the relation between parental rejection, maladaptive ER and emotional eating in a community sample using longitudinal data.Design: Participants were 81 youngsters between the ages of 10 and 16years. Participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal and paternal rejection, ER strategies and emotional eating, at two time moments (M=71days between time moments). Latent change models were used to estimate level and change of each variable.Results: Results showed that the levels of maternal rejection, maladaptive ER and emotional eating were related. The indirect effect of the level of maternal rejection on the level of emotional eating through the level of maladaptive ER was marginally significant. On average, maternal rejection showed no change over time, whereas the other variables decreased. The changes in the variables were not related.Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of assessing the emotional bond between mother and youngster and the ER of youngsters with an emotional eating style.

AB Evidence has suggested that some cognitive emotion regulation strategies people adopt when they encounter stress may exacerbate anxiety, whereas some may help to buffer the impeding effects of stress. However, studies were conducted mainly with adolescents and adults and research done with children is limited. The present study tested how childhood anxiety was related to cognitive emotion regulation strategies and daily hassles, including whether regulation strategies mediate the relation between daily hassles and anxiety. Data were collected from 999 Hong Kong-Chinese children (56.6% boys), aged between 9 and 12 (mean age = 9.90). Results showed that stress was a strong positive predictor of anxiety. Furthermore, rumination (reiterating negative events and emotions) and catastrophizing (envisaging the worst results of a negative event) coping strategies were vulnerability factors for childhood anxiety, whereas positive reappraisal served a protective function. Results also revealed that rumination and catastrophizing partially mediated the effects of stress on anxiety. It is suggested that mental health education should be provided to help children to understand the impeding effects of maladaptive cognitive strategies and to practice the use of adaptive cognitive strategies. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Background: Late adolescents are under increased risk of developing depressive symptoms. Behavioral activation is an effective treatment for subthreshold depression, which can prevent the development of subthreshold depression into a major depressive disorder. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the efficacy of behavioral activation have not been clearly understood. We investigated neural responses during reward processing by individuals with subthreshold depression to clarify the neural mechanisms of behavioral activation.
   Methods: Late adolescent university students with subthreshold depression (n=15, age 18-19 years) as indicated by a high score on the Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and 15 age-matched controls with a low BDI-II score participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning conducted during a monetary incentive delay task on two occasions. The Individuals in the subthreshold depression group received five, weekly behavioral activation sessions between the two scanning sessions. Moreover, they did not receive any medication until the study was completed.
   Results: Behavioral activation significantly reduced depressive symptoms. Moreover, compared to the changes in brain functions in the control group, the behavioral activation group showed functional changes during loss anticipation in brain structures that mediates cognitive and emotional regulation, including the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus.
   Limitations: Replication of the study with a larger sample size is required to increase the generalizability of these results.
   Conclusions: Behavioral activation results in improved functioning of the fronto-parietal region during loss anticipation. These results increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying specific psychotherapies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Early temperamental sensitivity may form the basis for the later development of socioemotional maladjustment. In particular, temperamental negative affect places children at risk for the development of anxiety. However, not all children who show negative affect go on to develop anxiety or extreme social withdrawal. Recent research indicates that reactive control, in the form of attention to threat, may serve as a bridge between early temperament and the development of later social difficulties. In addition, variation in effortful control may also modulate this trajectory. Children (mean age = 5.57 years) were assessed for attention bias to threatening and pleasant faces using a dot-probe paradigm. Attention bias to threatening (but not happy) faces moderated the direct positive relation between negative affect and social withdrawal. Children with threat biases showed a significant link between negative affect and social withdrawal, whereas children who avoided threat did not. In contrast, effortful control did not moderate the relation between negative affect and social withdrawal. Rather, there was a direct negative relation between effortful control and social withdrawal. The findings from this short report indicate that the relations among temperament, attention bias, and social withdrawal appears early in life and point to early emerging specificity in reactive and regulatory functioning.

AB Objective: The present study aimed to assess the direct and indirect impacts of the metacognition, emotional schema and emotion regulation in prediction of post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptom.
   Method: Participants consisted of 678 high school students from earthquake-stricken areas of eastern Azerbaijan selected from Varzaghan,Ahar and Hells by multistage cluster sampling. PTSD Symptom Scale Self Report (PSS-SR), Metacognition Questionnaire Adolescent Version (MCQ-A), Leahy Emotional Schema Scale (LESS) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were utilized for data collection. SPSS software and LISREL software were used for data analysis.
   Results: The results of SEM and path analysis indicated the direct and indirect (through emotion regulation) impacts of metacognition and also indirect (through emotion regulation) impact of emotional schema on PTS symptom. Model examination presented the good fitness of the proposed theoretical model.
   Conclusions: Consistent with metacognitive model and also emotional schema model, results of this study indicated the impact of metacognition and emotional schema on post-traumatic stress symptom through emotion regulation. This finding emphasizes that both metacognitive and emotional factors are important in explanation of PTS symptom. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Children of parents with a mental illness or substance use disorder (COPMI) have an increased risk of developing social-emotional problems themselves. Fear of stigmatisation or unawareness of problems prevents children and parents from understanding each other. Little is known about COPMI with mild intellectual disabilities (ID), except that they have a high risk of developing social-emotional problems and require additional support. In this study, we introduce a program for this group, the effectiveness of which we will study using a quasi-experimental design based on matching. The program 'You are okay' consists of a support group for children and an online educational program for parents. The goal of the program is to increase children and parents' perceived competence with an aim to prevent social-emotional problems in children.
   Methods/Design: Children between ten and twenty years old with mild ID (IQ between 50 and 85) and at least one of their parents with a mental illness will be included in the study. The children will receive part time treatment or residential care from an institute for children with mild ID and behavioural problems. Participants will be assigned to the intervention or the control group. The study has a quasi-experimental design. The children in the intervention group will join a support group, and their parents will be offered an online educational program. Children in the control group will receive care as usual, and their parents will have no extra offer. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-test, and follow up (6 months). Children, parents, and social workers will fill out the questionnaires.
   Discussion: The 'You are okay' program is expected to increase children and parents' perceived competence, which can prevent (further) social-emotional problem development. Because the mental illness of parents can be related to the behavioural problems of their children, it is important that children and parents understand each other. When talking about the mental illness of parents becomes standard in children's treatment, stigmatisation and the fear for stigmatisation can decrease.

AB Depression is a worldwide mental health problem among adolescents. The current study aimed to examine the roles of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS), behavioral activation system (BAS), and emotion regulation on adolescent depression. A total of 330 Chinese adolescents were recruited to complete initial assessments of BIS/BAS, emotion regulation, and depression, with a follow-up after one year. Depression on these two occasions was positively correlated with gender, age, initial scores of BIS/BAS activity, and with Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire scores for self-blame, rumination, putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and blaming others, and negatively correlated with initial positive reappraisal scores. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that higher BIS activity, catastrophizing, rumination, and lower positive reappraisal predicted depression after one year. However, after controlling for initial depression, these variables were indirectly related to subsequent depression. Implications are discussed for assessments of depression and interventions targeted at the BIS, BAS, and emotion regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   The presence of non-suicidal self-injury acts in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is very prevalent. These behaviors are a public health concern and have become a poorly understood phenomenon in the community. It has been proposed that the commission of non-suicidal self-injury might be related to a failure in the brain network regulating executive functions. Previous studies have shown that BPD patients present an impairment in their capacity to monitor actions and conflicts associated with the performance of certain actions, which suppose an important aspect of cognitive control.
   Method
   We used Event Related Potentials to examine the behavioral and electrophysiological indexes associated with the error monitoring in two BPD outpatients groups (17 patients each) differentiated according to the presence or absence of non-suicidal self-injury behaviors. We also examined 17 age-and intelligence-matched healthy control participants.
   Results
   The three groups did not show significant differences in event-related potentials associated with errors (Error-Related Negativity and Pe) nor in theta power increase following errors.
   Conclusions
   This is the first study investigating the behavioral and electrophysiological error monitoring indexes in BPD patients characterized by their history of non-suicidal self-injury behaviors. Our results show that error monitoring is preserved in BPD patients and suggest that non-suicidal self-injury acts are not related to a dysfunction in the cognitive control mechanisms.

AB Bullying victimization is commonly associated with anxiety among individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and both bullying victimization and anxiety are more prevalent among youth with ASD than in the general population. We explored individual and contextual factors that relate to anxiety in adolescents and young adults with ASD who also experience bullying victimization. Participants included 101 mothers of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ASD. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between bullying victimization and anxiety in children with ASD, as well as parenting stress as a potential moderator of that relationship. Findings indicate that parenting stress moderates the association between bullying victimization and anxiety. The severity of anxiety was most strongly associated with bullying victimization when mothers reported high levels of stress. Implications for interventions that assist parents with coping and address bullying victimization are discussed. (C) 2015 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study investigated concurrent links between adolescent romantic couples' reports of aggression (relational and physical) and relationship functioning (e.g., attachment security, conflict prevalence, coping strategies, jealousy, and affiliative and romantic relationship quality) using a pattern-oriented approach. The sample included 194 romantic partner dyads (Mage = 16.99 years for females and Mage = 18.41 years for males). A hierarchical cluster analysis identified five distinct subgroups of dyads based on male and female reports of relational and physical aggression, ranging from nonaggressive couples (42%), to those characterized by aggressive females (18%), aggressive males (14%), physically aggressive females (20%), and mutually aggressive females and males (6%). Clusters in which one partner was perceived as either relationally or physically aggressive were characterized by higher rates of conflict, less adaptive coping, and more jealousy (particularly in males). The mutually aggressive couples showed the least adaptive relationship functioning, with high rates of conflict, a deficit in reflection and emotion regulation in conflict situations, and a lack of affiliative relationship qualities. The discussion focuses on the formative character of aggression in these early romantic relations, the aggravating impact of mutual aggression on relationship functioning, and the gender-specific functions of aggression in relationships characterized by unilateral aggression.

AB Using a meta-analytic approach, this investigation examines the association between early pubertal timing and externalizing behaviors in adolescence and early adulthood. The findings showed that the effect size of early pubertal maturation on externalizing behaviors was r = 0.180. This small, yet significant effect size is consistent with the models of early pubertal maturation in that early maturation is associated with higher levels of externalizing behaviors. Using contrast analyses, we examined three potential moderators of this association: sex, the concurrent versus long-term effect of early puberty, and types of puberty assessments. Neither sex nor type of pubertal timing assessment moderated the effect significantly. However, results indicated that the effect was stronger for studies that measured pubertal timing and externalizing behaviors concurrently rather than longitudinally (i.e., examining prospective effect of pubertal timing on later externalizing behaviors). The findings are discussed in terms of implications for future research. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Mental and behavioral disorders increase in prevalence with the passage through puberty. Yet the first symptoms for many children emerge between seven and 11 years, before the pubertal rise in gonadal hormones. A possibility that symptom onset may be linked to the adrenarchal rise in androgens has been little explored.
   Methods: The Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study recruited a stratified random sample of 1,239 eight-nine year olds from primary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Saliva samples were assayed for dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), and testosterone. Emotional and behavioral problems were assessed through parental report on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results: In males, high levels of all androgens were associated with greater total difficulties and peer problems. Higher dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone were associated with emotional symptoms and DHEA-S with conduct problems. In females, DHEA-S was associated with peer problems.
   Conclusions: In late childhood, androgens are associated with emotional and behavioral problems in males, raising a possibility that the adrenarchal transition plays a contributing role. If so, the late primary school years may prove to be an important phase for preventing the onset of mental health and behavioral problems in boys. (C) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

TI Sibling relationships as sources of risk and resilience in the

AB Sibling relationships are a unique and powerful context for children's development, characterized by strong positive features, such as warmth and intimacy, as well as negative qualities like intense, potentially destructive conflict. For these reasons, sibling interactions may be both a risk and a protective factor for the development and maintenance of emotional and behavioral dysfunction. We review evidence indicating that sibling interactions are linked to internalizing and externalizing symptoms and identify possible mechanisms for these associations. Sibling conflict contributes uniquely to symptomatology and may be particularly problematic when accompanied by lack of warmth, which is generally associated with decreased internalizing and externalizing problems. On the other hand, greater warmth can be associated with heightened externalizing symptoms for later-born children who may model the behavior of older siblings. Although it will be important to monitor for increased sibling collusion, several intervention studies demonstrate that it is possible to reduce conflict and increase warmth between brothers and sisters, and that improving sibling interactions can teach children social-cognitive skills that are beneficial in other relationships (e.g., friendships). Developing brief assessment tools differentiating normative from pathogenic sibling conflict would assist clinical decision making. Future intervention work could provide a more stringent test of the hypothesis that strengthening sibling relationships improves children's socio-emotional adjustment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The authors examined several different predictive and mediation models of longitudinal parental inconsistency over a 3-year time span. They hypothesized that parental behavior (communication/affection, kindness, and positive control) mediated the relationship between parental inconsistency (mother or father) and two emotional problems in children: (a) aggression and (b) depression. Data were obtained from a 3-wave study (2007, 2008, and 2009) of 523 Spanish families with children ranging from 9-15 years of age at the beginning of Wave 1 (41.3% boys). Structural equation models revealed that multiple dimensions of parenting (mother or father) fully or partially mediated the relationship between longitudinal parental inconsistency and the child's adjustment. Communication/affection and kindness are the main processes through which parental inconsistency affects a child's aggression and depression. These results represent an important contribution to the improvement of parenting models of relationships between parental inconsistency and child adjustment.

AB Young adults with ASD and no intellectual impairment are more likely to exhibit clinical levels of anxiety than typically developing peers (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This study tests a mechanistic model in which anxiety culminates via emotion dysregulation and social motivation. Adults with ASD (49 males, 20 females) completed self-report measures on emotion regulation, caregivers completed measures on ASD severity and both on social anxiety. Results indicated that emotion dysregulation (p < .001; p < .05) and social motivation (p < .05, p < .001) significantly predicted social anxiety as reported by caregivers and young adults respectively. However, social motivation did not appear to play a moderating role in the relationship between emotion regulation and anxiety, even when controlling for social awareness. Significant predictor variables of social anxiety varied based on reporter (i.e. caregiver versus young adult), with difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviors during negative emotions serving as the only shared predictor.

AB We investigated whether synchrony at a physiological level (i.e., real-time correspondence of biological indices between two individuals) related to observed levels of dyadic attunement (i.e., levels of connectedness, joint attention, and reciprocity), and whether these measures could distinguish between mother-child dyads with and without clinical levels of externalizing behavioral problems. Eighty-three clinical and 35 nonclinical dyads (7-12 years-old) discussed a contentious topic preceded and followed by a positive topic while their heart rates were recorded. Changes in dyadic attunement from the last discussion relative to the first were taken as an index of how well dyads 'repaired' their relationship. Results showed that clinical dyads had lower levels of dyadic attunement across all discussions compared to nonclinical dyads. Evidence that physiological synchrony could distinguish clinical from nonclinical dyads, however, was merely suggestive. Physiological synchrony was sensitive to the emotional context of the discussions as more dyads demonstrated physiological synchrony in the last compared to the first discussion. Moreover, dyads who demonstrated physiological synchrony also showed higher levels of repair. The outcomes of this study suggest that physiological synchrony between mothers and their children is sensitive to emotional context during interactions, and particularly during periods of repair when dyads more actively reconnect with each other after a negative interaction.

AB Emotional dysregulation in daily life is very common in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is however not clear whether this reflects a specific deficit or that it may be the result of generic executive function (EF) deficits. The current study addresses this question by means of an emotional working memory (WM) task with 2 memory load conditions and four possible backgrounds (blank screen, neutral, positive or negative picture), which was administered to 38 typically developing children and 29 children with ADHD. Children responded slower on trials when negative pictures were presented at the background versus when neutral pictures were presented, indicating an emotional interference effect; however crucially, groups did not differ in this respect. Reaction times were also slower on trials with a neutral picture as background versus trials without a picture, with children with ADHD showing an enhanced interference effect. There was a main effect of WM load on performance, but it did not interact with interference or group effects. To summarize, the findings indicate a generic interference control deficit in the children with ADHD in the current sample, while they could not provide support for an emotional interference deficit.

AB Children with ADHD often demonstrate a pattern of emotional lability characterized by sudden and intense shifts in affect. Emotional lability has been linked to emotional and behavioral problems in children with and without ADHD, but few studies have examined emotional lability over time. This study examined the effects of emotional lability over time on the behavioral and emotional difficulties of children with and without ADHD using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology. One hundred and two children aged 8-12 years (56 with ADHD and 46 without ADHD) and their parents completed baseline measures of the children's behavioral and emotional difficulties. Parents then completed a 28-day 3-times daily EMA assessment protocol to rate their child's emotional lability. Results suggested that emotional lability was associated with internalizing and/or externalizing diagnoses independent of ADHD diagnostic status, but was not directly associated with ADHD. Hierarchical regression analyses supported ADHD diagnostic status as a moderator of the association of greater EMA-derived emotional lability with children's behavioral difficulties, such that greater emotional lability was associated with greater behavioral difficulties among children with ADHD but not among children without ADHD. Results indicated that greater emotional lability was directly linked with greater emotional difficulties and that this relation was not moderated by ADHD diagnostic status. Overall, this study suggested that emotional lability is related to emotional difficulties independent of ADHD, but is differentially related to behavioral difficulties among children with and without ADHD.

AB Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is the gold standard treatment for pediatric PTSD. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes in TF-CBT are highly variable, indicating a need to identify reliable predictors that allow forecasting treatment response. Here, we test the hypothesis that functional neuroimaging correlates of emotion processing predict PTSD symptom reduction during Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among adolescent girls with PTSD. Thirty-four adolescent girls with PTSD related to physical or sexual assault were enrolled in TF-CBT, delivered in an approximately 12 session format, in an open trial. Prior to treatment, they were engaged in an implicit threat processing task during 3T fMRI, during which they viewed faces depicting fearful or neutral expressions. Among adolescent girls completing TF-CBT (n = 23), slopes of PTSD symptom trajectories during TF-CBT were significantly related to pre-treatment degree of bilateral amygdala activation while viewing fearful vs neutral images. Adolescents with less symptom reduction were characterized by greater amygdala activation to both threat and neutral images (i.e., less threat-safety discrimination), whereas adolescents with greater symptom reduction were characterized by amygdala activation only to threat images. These clinical outcome relationships with pre-treatment bilateral amygdala activation remained when controlling for possible confounding demographic or clinical variables (e.g., concurrent psychotropic medication, comorbid diagnoses). While limited by a lack of a control group, these preliminary results suggest that pre-treatment amygdala reactivity to fear stimuli, a component of neurocircuitry models of PTSD, positively predicts symptom reduction during TF-CBT among assaulted adolescent girls, providing support for an objective measure for forecasting treatment response in this vulnerable population.

This study examined negative affective transactions between mothers and youth across 5-min conflict and fun-activity planning discussions, in relation to depressive symptoms and maternal and youth respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Maternal depressive symptoms predicted more negative affect. Maternal and youth RSA interacted with maternal depressive symptoms to predict both overall affect and the stability of affect across time. The beneficial effects of youth RSA were stronger, but maternal RSA weaker, in the face of elevated maternal depression.

AB The present study tests whether aggression and prosocial behavior can coexist as part of a socially functional and adaptive profile among early adolescents. Using a person-centered approach, the study examined early adolescents' likelihood of being classified into profiles involving aggressive and prosocial behavior, social status (popular, liked, cool), machiavellianism, and both affective and cognitive components of empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking, respectively). Participants were 1170 early adolescents (10-12 years of age; 52 % male) from four schools in metropolitan Santiago, Chile. Through latent profile analysis, three profiles emerged (normative-low aggressive, high prosocial-low aggressive, and high aggressive-high popular status). Both empathic concern and perspective taking were higher in the high prosocial-low aggressive profile, whereas the high aggressive-high popular status profile had the lowest scores on both empathy components as well as machiavellianism. No profile emerged where aggressive and prosocial behaviors were found to co-exist, or to be significantly above the mean. The results underscore that aggressive behavior is highly contextual and likely culturally specific, and that the study of behavioral profiles should consider social status as well as socio-emotional adjustment indicators. These complex associations should be taken into consideration when planning prevention and intervention efforts to reduce aggression or school bullying and to promote positive peer relationships.

AB A core goal of inclusive education worldwide is to maximize the learning potential of students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream educational settings. However, little research attention has been paid to SEN children's social and emotional gains from inclusive education compared to their academic performance. This study included social, emotional, and academic variables in a single research design, not only to test their relationships but also to explore the predictive roles of social and emotional factors in academic performance for SEN students. Participants were 515 SEN students in grades 1-6 in mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong. The results showed that the social and emotional competences of children with SEN were significant predictors of their academic performance (p < .001), with emotional competence having the larger impact. Although SEN students' relationships with peers and teachers were not found to be direct significant predictors of academic performance as reported in previous studies; they positively and significantly predicted emotional and social competences of SEN students (p < .001). Implications for establishing a caring campus, as well as developing educational interventions which will increase SEN students' positive emotional experiences and foster and maintain their adaptive social and emotional competences are discussed.

AB Using data from a large UK cohort (n = 11,656), we investigated the determinants of 7-year-old children's aspirations, and the role of these aspirations in emotional and behavioural problems, as reported by both parents and teachers. Aspirations were classified to reflect their occupational status, masculinity/femininity and intrinsic/extrinsic motivation. Children's aspirations had significant antecedents in social disadvantage, parental involvement in learning, parental values and cognitive ability. Children with low occupational aspirations had more emotional problems as reported by both parents and teachers, and more teacher-reported peer problems. In the teacher report, masculine aspirations were also related to hyperactivity. Gender differences in the association between aspirations and emotional and behavioural problems were few and weak. Intrinsic aspirations were related to peer problems, especially in boys. The inverse relation between feminine aspirations and hyperactivity and peer problems was relatively stronger in girls, as was the association between low aspirations and emotional problems.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and dangerous phenomenon associated with many negative outcomes, including future suicidal behaviors. Research on these behaviors has primarily focused on correlates; however, an emerging body of research has focused on NSSI risk factors. To provide a summary of current knowledge about NSSI risk factors, we conducted a meta-analysis of published, prospective studies longitudinally predicting NSSI. This included 20 published reports across 5078 unique participants. Results from a random-effects model demonstrated significant, albeit weak, overall prediction of NSSI (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.50 to 1.69). Among specific NSSI risk factors, prior history of NSSI, cluster b, and hopelessness yielded the strongest effects (ORs >3.0); all remaining risk factor categories produced ORs near or below 2.0. NSSI measurement, sample type, sample age, and prediction case measurement type (i.e., binary versus continuous) moderated these effects. Additionally, results highlighted several limitations of the existing literature, including idiosyncratic NSSI measurement and few studies among samples with NSSI histories. These findings indicate that few strong NSSI risk factors have been identified, and suggest a need for examination of novel risk factors, standardized NSSI measurement, and study samples with a history of NSSI.

AB Adolescence is a phase of the lifespan associated with widespread changes in emotional behavior thought to reflect both changing environments and stressors, and psychological and neurobiological development. However, emotions themselves are complex phenomena that are composed of multiple subprocesses. In this paper, we argue that examining emotional development from a process-level perspective facilitates important insights into the mechanisms that underlie adolescents' shifting emotions and intensified risk for psychopathology. Contrasting the developmental progressions for the antecedents to emotion, physiological reactivity to emotion, emotional regulation capacity, and motivation to experience particular affective states reveals complex trajectories that intersect in a unique way during adolescence. We consider the implications of these intersecting trajectories for negative outcomes such as psychopathology, as well as positive outcomes for adolescent social bonds.

AB Background In patient-centred care, professionals should recognize their patient's needs and adapt their communication accordingly. Studies into patients' communication needs suggest priorities vary depending on sociodemographic characteristics, and type and severity of the complaints. However, evidence lacks on priorities in the communication needs of adolescents in psychosocial care and their parents.
   Objective To assess adolescents' and parents' importance ratings concerning affective communication, information provision, shared decision-making, interprofessional communication and the degree to which client and care characteristics determine these.
   Methods Adolescents aged 12-18 (n = 403) and one of their parents (n = 403) rated the importance of communication before the psychosocial care process started. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to determine which characteristics were associated with the 25% lowest importance ratings for communication aspects.
   Results Adolescents and parents considered affective communication to be the most important, with shared decision-making the least important. For adolescents, lower importance ratings were associated with dissatisfaction with prior care (OR 1.8), negative expectations (ORs 1.9-2.4), emotional problems (ORs 0.2-0.5) and low prosocial behaviour skills (ORs 2.0). For parents, low education (ORs 1.7-1.8), negative expectations (OR 0.4), adolescent's hyperactivity/inattention (ORs 0.4-0.5) and low prosocial behaviour skills (ORs 1.8-2.6) determined lower importance ratings.
   Conclusions Affective communication has highest priority for adolescents and their parents. Client and care characteristics are associated with client priorities in communication. Being attentive to clients' educational level, previous care experiences, current expectations and specific problem types might help professionals to adapt better to their clients' communication needs.

AB Abnormal connectivity patterns have frequently been reported as involved in pathological mental states. However, most studies focus on "static," stationary patterns of connectivity, which may miss crucial biological information. Recent methodological advances have allowed the investigation of dynamic functional connectivity patterns that describe non-stationary properties of brain networks. Here, we introduce a novel graphical measure of dynamic connectivity, called time-varying eigenvector centrality (tv-EVC). In a sample 655 children and adolescents (7-15 years old) from the Brazilian "High Risk Cohort Study for Psychiatric Disorders" who were imaged using resting-state fMRI, we used this measure to investigate age effects in the temporal in control and default-mode networks (CN/DMN). Using support vector regression, we propose a network maturation index based on the temporal stability of tv-EVC. Moreover, we investigated whether the network maturation is associated with the overall presence of behavioral and emotional problems with the Child Behavior Checklist. As hypothesized, we found that the tv-EVC at each node of CN/DMN become more stable with increasing age (P < 0.001 for all nodes). In addition, the maturity index for this particular network is indeed associated with general psychopathology in children assessed by the total score of Child Behavior Checklist (P = 0.027). Moreover, immaturity of the network was mainly correlated with externalizing behavior dimensions. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in functional network dynamics during neurodevelopment may provide unique insights regarding pathophysiology. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this study, we examined interrelationships among emotional overexcitability, perfectionism, emotion regulation, and subjective well-being. Dabrowski and Piechowski's theoretical conceptualization of overexcitabilities and J. J. Gross and John's constructs of emotion regulation strategies provided a framework to guide hypotheses in the present study. Participants were 191 adults who responded to surveys administered via online methodology. Multiple-regression analyses revealed that participants in the present study with higher emotional overexcitability had lower degrees of emotion regulation overall, whereas individuals reporting higher levels of adaptive perfectionism (strivers) had higher levels of emotion regulation. Furthermore, strivers and those who used cognitive reappraisal strategies for emotion regulation were linked to higher subjective well-being for participants in this study.

AB Background: The past decade has seen an unprecedented increase in research activity on personality disorders (PDs) in adolescents. The increase in research activity, in addition to major nosological systems legitimizing the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adolescents, highlights the need to communicate new research on adolescent personality problems to practitioners. Scope: In this review, we provide up-to-date information on the phenomenology, prevalence, associated clinical problems, etiology, and intervention for BPD in adolescents. Our aim was to provide a clinically useful practitioner review and to dispel long-held myths about the validity, diagnostic utility, and treatability of PDs in adolescents. Findings and conclusion: Alongside providing up-to-date information on the phenomenology, prevalence, and etiology, we also report on associated clinical problems and interventions for adolescent BPD. It is only through early active assessment and identification of youngsters with these problems that a lifetime of personal suffering and health system burden can be reduced or altogether avoided. A variety of evidence-based approaches are now available to treat BPD and related clinical problems in young people. Future research should focus on establishing optimal precision in the diagnostic processes in different treatment settings.

AB This article examines the relationship between parenting styles and the development of depressive symptoms among adolescents. We analyzed a nationally representative longitudinal data set of adolescents aged 12 to 14 in Taiwan. Results from growth mixture modeling revealed a nonlinear increase in the intensity of depressive symptoms between early and middle adolescence. More pronounced depressive symptoms in earlier years were also shown to be associated with more rapid development of similar symptoms later in adolescence. Perceived parenting styles, as manifest in parental warmth and harsh discipline, were categorized into 4 latent heterogeneous classes: attentive, reserved, austere, and conflicting. Adolescents living under austere parenting tend to report the most pronounced depressive symptoms from early to middle adolescence; however, the development of symptoms in this group was the slowest. We also discuss the role of harsh parenting in Chinese culture, as it pertains to the roles traditionally assumed by the father and mother.

AB Although neuroimaging studies in adults demonstrate that cognitive reappraisal effectively down-regulates negative affect and results in increased prefrontal and decreased amygdala activity, very limited empirical data exist on the neural basis of cognitive reappraisal in children. This study aimed to pilot test a developmentally-appropriate guided cognitive reappraisal task in order to examine the effects of cognitive reappraisal on children's self-reports of affect and brain responses. Study 1 (N = 19, 4-10 years-old) found that children successfully employed guided cognitive reappraisal to decrease subjective ratings of negative affect, supporting the effectiveness of the guided cognitive reappraisal task. Study 2 (N = 15, ages 6-10 years-old) investigated the neural responses to guided cognitive reappraisal and found that the neural responses showed increased activation in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the cognitive reappraisal condition compared to the no regulation condition. In addition, amygdala activity was positively correlated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation during cognitive reappraisal. Findings suggest that the neural networks supporting cognitive reappraisal in children involve similar brain regions but brain responses deviate from findings in adults. Our findings suggest that the neural networks supporting emotion regulation are still developing during middle childhood, and future research is necessary to delineate age-related development of the neural network involved in cognitive reappraisal.

AB Previous studies reported an association of depressive disorder and structural alteration of frontolimbic brain regions in subjects with emotional abuse experiences during childhood and adolescence. The results suggest that aberrant function of the frontolimbic circuit and its relation with psychiatric symptoms can be found in adolescents with preclinical status. We investigated functional changes of frontolimbic networks during implicit negative emotional face processing and their relationships with depressive symptoms in adolescents with previous verbal abuse experiences. We designed a gender discrimination task using emotional faces to induce an implicit level of emotional exposure, and was completed by 31 preclinical male adolescents during an fMRI scan. The right amygdala activity and its functional connectivity with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during implicit processing of negative emotional faces showed a significant relationship with previous verbal abuse experiences. The hierarchical regression analyses showed that their current depressive symptoms were associated with aberrant functional interaction between the right amygdala activity and right amygdala-rostral ACC connectivity. Our findings of verbal abuse-related functional changes in the right frontoamygdala circuit may be related to vulnerability to future mood disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Neuroimaging studies have shown continued structural and functional development in neural circuitry underlying social and emotional behaviour during adolescence. This article explores adolescent neurocognitive development in two domains: sensitivity to social rejection and Theory of Mind (ToM). Adolescents often report hypersensitivity to social rejection. The studies presented here suggest that this is accompanied by reduced responses in brain regions involved in emotion regulation. Studies on social rejection in adolescents with autism spectrum conditions will also be discussed. ToM is another social cognitive domain which undergoes neurocognitive development between adolescence and adulthood. ToM refers to the ability to understand others' thoughts and intentions. Neuroimaging data suggest that the ability to integrate emotional information into ToM decisions continues to develop between adolescence and adulthood. In sum, these studies demonstrate ongoing development of social and emotional cognition during adolescence at both behavioural and neural levels, providing a neurocognitive framework for understanding adolescent behaviour.

AB Substantial research has indicated that media violence induces both short- and long-term increases in aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Recently, neuroimaging techniques have begun to identify the mechanisms driving these changes. An important avenue that these neuroimaging tools can address is how exposure to media violence in childhood affects brain development, which can have lifelong behavioral consequences. This review highlights neuroimaging research examining how media violence exposure affects the pediatric brain. While such research is limited, evidence suggests that prefrontal mechanisms for controlling emotion and behavior are altered by exposure to violent media. Therefore, long-term increases in aggression and decreases in inhibitory control due to excessive media violence exposure may result from impaired development of prefrontal regions. However, additional neuroimaging research is necessary to establish whether and how exposure to media violence specifically shapes subsequent neural maturation. To optimize the use of neuroimaging in this inquiry, imaging studies should not stand on their own, but instead must be integrated with more traditional research paradigms to establish a more complete picture of effects. Future research must employ more longitudinal approaches to better characterize long-term effects that high exposure to violent screen media may have on brain development, particularly prefrontal and limbic brain regions.

AB To examine the relationship between Chinese students' three-domain competences (academic, personal-social, career competence) and their problems in key schools and regular schools from East, Central, and West China, we performed SEM with academic/personal-social/career competences, internalizing problems (including depression and anxiety) and externalizing problems in 18,164 Grade 10-12 students. The MANOVA revealed there were significant differences in regions and types of schools on the six study variables. Additionally, the SEM results demonstrated that students' academic and personal-social competence negatively predicted their internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas career competence negatively predicted internalizing problems but positively predicted externalizing problems. Moreover, the model comparisons indicated personal-social competence was the strongest predictor of internalizing problems, and academic competence was the strongest predictor of externalizing problems. Therefore, our findings provide effective theoretical support for intervention models that are aimed the reduction of problems by enhancing competences.

AB The present study explored the effects of child sexual abuse (CSA) on the adaptation of male juveniles who subsequently sexually offended (JSOs; n = 178; age, M = 16.05 years, SD = 0.27, range = 12-22). It examined multiple levels of interpersonal closeness between the perpetrators of sexual abuse and their JSO victims. JSOs who were sexually abused by older children or adults who cohabitated with them for at least 3 months reported higher levels of emotional dysregulation, callousness/manipulativeness, and sexualization than did both JSOs who were sexually abused by someone they had never lived with and JSOs who reported no experiences of sexual abuse. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Levels of parental expressed emotion (EE) are prospectively associated with the symptomatic course of a range of childhood psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the literature linking parental EE to youth psychopathology and proposes a novel framework for understanding its mechanisms of action. We find that, despite noteworthy methodological limitations, parental EE is linked consistently to a more deleterious course of mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders in youth. Its mechanism of action is unknown. Models of "toxic family stress" (referring to frequent, sustained, and uncontrollable stress without protective influences) provide one framework for understanding how high EE environments interact with individual biological vulnerabilities to promote illness onset and recurrence. Research aimed at understanding biological responses (e.g., stress reactivity, arousal) to familial EE is needed. Such work may inform efforts to understand how EE affects the course of psychiatric disorders and may guide the development of novel interventions emphasizing emotion regulation strategies.

AB Exposure to violence during adolescence is a highly prevalent phenomenon associated with a range of deleterious outcomes. Theoretical literature suggests that emotion dysregulation is one consequence of exposure to violence associated with the manifestation of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and borderline personality (BP) pathology. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine the mediating role of emotion dysregulation in the relation between exposure to violence and both PTSS and BP pathology in a sample of 144 adolescents (age 10- to 17-years; 51 % male; 55 % African American) admitted to a psychiatric residential treatment center. Exposure to violence was associated with greater emotion dysregulation, which, in turn, was associated with greater PTSS and BP pathology. Furthermore, emotion dysregulation mediated the associations between exposure to violence and both PTSS and BP pathology. Findings suggest the importance of assessing and treating emotion dysregulation among violence-exposed adolescents in psychiatric residential treatment.

AB Research investigating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and co-occurring disorders such as oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, and depression has surged in popularity; however, the developmental relations between ADHD and these comorbid conditions remain poorly understood. The current paper uses a developmental psychopathology perspective to examine conditions commonly comorbid with ADHD during late childhood through adolescence. First, we present evidence for ADHD and comorbid disorders. Next, we discuss emotion regulation and its associations with ADHD. The role of parenting behaviors in the development and maintenance of emotion regulation difficulties and comorbid disorders among children with ADHD is explored. An illustrative example of emotion regulation and parenting over the course of development is provided to demonstrate bidirectional relations among these constructs. We then present an integrated conceptual model of emotion regulation as a shared risk process that may lead to different comorbid conditions among children with ADHD. Implications and directions for future research are presented.

AB Social isolation during the vulnerable period of adolescence produces emotional dysregulation that often manifests as abnormal behavior in adulthood. The enduring consequence of isolation might be caused by a weakened ability to forget unpleasant memories. However, it remains unclear whether isolation affects unpleasant memories. To address this, we used a model of associative learning to induce the fear memories and evaluated the influence of isolation mice during adolescence on the subsequent retention of fear memories and its underlying cellular mechanisms. Following adolescent social isolation, we found that mice decreased their social interaction time and had an increase in anxiety-related behavior. Interestingly, when we assessed memory retention, we found that isolated mice were unable to forget aversive memories when tested 4 weeks after the original event. Consistent with this, we observed that a single train of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) enabled a late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region of isolated mice, whereas only an early-phase LTP was observed with the same stimulation in the control mice. Social isolation during adolescence also increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus, and application of a tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor inhibitor ameliorated the facilitated L-LTP seen after isolation. Together, our results suggest that adolescent isolation may result in mental disorders during adulthood and that this may stem from an inability to forget the unpleasant memories via BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity. These findings may give us a new strategy to prevent mental disorders caused by persistent unpleasant memories.

AB In adult attachment research, a group of individuals who convey secure attachments despite recalling difficult early caregiver relationships has been identified. The term earned security refers to individuals in this group, whereas continuous security refers to individuals who convey secure attachments and describe caring early relationships. Evidence on the validity of earned security in adults is mixed-with one longitudinal study showing that earned secure adults, despite contrary recollections, are actually more likely to have experienced positive caregiving than continuous secure adults. There is currently no evidence of earned security in adolescence, and exploring it in this age group may help shed light on the overall problem of the validity of this construct. Therefore, the broad aim of this study was to examine the construct of earned security in a group of inpatient adolescents. First, the authors aimed to identify a group of adolescents with secure attachments and memories of difficult caregiver relationships (i.e., proposed earned secure group) in a sample of 240 inpatient adolescents. Next, to explore external validity, the authors examined whether this group differed from others with regard to internalizing distress and emotion regulation. Findings indicated that a subset of secure adolescents recall difficult caregiving, as has been noted in adults, and that they differ from others with regard to emotion regulation. Despite this preliminary evidence that earned security can be identified in adolescents, the authors conclude with a discussion of the caveats of applying this construct in adolescents as well as adults.

AB Although non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) occurs in people with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD), few studies have compared the clinical characteristics of these two groups. The present study sampled adults with a history of NSSI and compared those with and without BPD on (a) NSSI features, (b) co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and (c) severity of depression, suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation. Participants (NSSI+BPD, n=46; NSSI Only, n=54) completed semi-structured interviews and self-report measures. Whereas the groups did not differ in age of NSSI onset, the NSSI+BPD group engaged in more frequent, recent and severe NSSI, and reported higher rates of skin carving, head banging, self-punching and self-scratching than the NSSI Only group. Participants with BPD also showed greater diagnostic comorbidity, particularly for anxiety disorders, but did not differ from participants without BPD in rates of mood, substance or psychotic disorders. The NSSI+BPD group reported more severe depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation than the NSSI Only group. Supplementary analyses on the subset of participants with recent (past year) NSSI revealed similarly medium to large differences between those with and without BPD. Implications for assessment and treatment are discussed. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The purpose of the present study was to examine correlations between behavioral and clinical symptoms by administering an extensive neuropsychological battery to a sample of children and adolescents from a developing country. The sample was divided into three groups: non-ADHD, ADHD-non-comorbid, and ADHD + comorbidity. A full neuropsychological battery and clinical assessment found that 105 children met DSM-5 criteria, of whom 46.6% had the predominantly inattentive presentation, 37.3% had combined presentation, and 16% were predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation. The internal correlation between neuropsychological tests did not reach statistical significance in the comparison between ADHD and non-ADHD cases (p < 0.17). Clinical ADHD cases, including both + comorbidity and non-comorbid groups, performed substantially worse on continuous performance test (CPT), working memory. Comparing ADHD-non-comorbid and ADHD + comorbidity groups, the latter did significantly worse on inhibitory control, time processing, and the level of perseveration response on CPT indexes, as well as on working memory performance and child behavior checklist (CBCL) tests particularly the CBCL-deficient emotional self regulation test in the ADHD + comorbidity group. Children diagnosed as ODD or with conduct disorder showed close correlations between clinical CBCL profiles and externalized symptoms. Our findings suggest that ADHD + comorbidity and ADHD non-comorbid cases may be differentiated by a number of neuropsychological measures, such as processing speed, inhibitory control, and working memory, that may reflect different levels of involvement of the hot and cool executive domains, which are more impaired in cases of severe symptomatic-externalized behavior and emotional regulation problems. Therefore, profiles based on clinical and behavioral findings can help clinicians select better strategies for detecting neuropsychological impairment in Brazilian children with ADHD.

AB Background: Individuals severely affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including those with intellectual disability, expressive language impairment, and/or self-injurious behavior (SIB), are underrepresented in the ASD literature and extant collections of phenotypic and biological data. An understanding of ASD's etiology and subtypes can only be as complete as the studied samples are representative.
   Methods: The Autism Inpatient Collection (AIC) is a multi-site study enrolling children and adolescents with ASD aged 4-20 years admitted to six specialized inpatient psychiatry units. Enrollment began March, 2014, and continues at a rate of over 400 children annually. Measures characterizing adaptive and cognitive functioning, communication, externalizing behaviors, emotion regulation, psychiatric co-morbidity, self-injurious behavior, parent stress, and parent self-efficacy are collected. ASD diagnosis is confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - 2 (ADOS-2) and extensive inpatient observation. Biological samples from probands and their biological parents are banked and processed for DNA extraction and creation of lymphoblastoid cell lines.
   Results: Sixty-one percent of eligible subjects were enrolled. The first 147 subjects were an average of 12.6 years old (SD 3.42, range 4-20); 26.5 % female; 74.8 % Caucasian, and 81.6 % non-Hispanic/non-Latino. Mean non-verbal intelligence quotient IQ = 70.9 (SD 29.16, range 30-137) and mean adaptive behavior composite score = 55.6 (SD 12.9, range 27-96). A majority of subjects (52.4 %) were non-or minimally verbal. The average Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Irritability Subscale score was 28.6, well above the typical threshold for clinically concerning externalizing behaviors, and 26.5 % of the sample engaged in SIB. Females had more frequent and severe SIB than males.
   Conclusions: Preliminary data indicate that the AIC has a rich representation of the portion of the autism spectrum that is understudied and underrepresented in extant data collections. More than half of the sample is non-or minimally verbal, over 40 % have intellectual disability, and over one quarter exhibit SIB. The AIC is a substantial new resource for study of the full autism spectrum, which will augment existing data on higher-functioning cohorts and facilitate the identification of genetic subtypes and novel treatment targets. The AIC investigators welcome collaborations with other investigators, and access to the AIC phenotypic data and biosamples may be requested through the Simons Foundation (www.sfari.org).

AB Background: Young people's mental health is a public health priority. Given the influences of migration and resettlement on mental health, synthesis of current research with young people from migrant backgrounds can help inform mental health promotion initiatives that account for and are responsive to their needs.Aims: This article distils the results of a review of published literature on the mental health of adolescent immigrants (ages 10-19) living in Canada.Method: Scoping review methods were used to define inclusion and exclusion criteria; inform the search strategies; and extract and synthesize key findings.Results: Fourteen articles met criteria for inclusion. Analysis of the studies indicate diversity in mental health indicators, e.g., mental distress, emotional problems and behavioral problems, as well as a wide range of influences on mental health from age at migration and length of stay to place of residence, income and discrimination.Conclusions: Findings support the need to account for the array of influences on young people's mental health in relation to migration and to augment initiatives beyond the level of individual intervention.

AB Increasing motivation and raising retention rates are considerable challenges for providers of adolescent substance abuse treatment. Research has shown that motivation for treatment, social influences (peers, family, counselors), and for some clients external pressure from the juvenile justice system, can serve as key factors in successful retention. To further understand influences on motivation and retention, focus groups were conducted in two residential treatment facilities. Adolescent clients, parents, and treatment staff were asked to describe their experiences with the treatment process focusing specifically on factors related to treatment attrition and retention. Qualitative data analysis revealed five themes affecting retention either positively or negatively. Themes included relationships (with family, peers, and counselors), responsibility (degree to which clients embrace jobs, roles, and rules), emotional regulation (ability to express feelings appropriately), thinking (identifying behavior patterns and recognizing consequences), and self-efficacy (feelings of empowerment). Implications for future research and for developing strategies aimed at increasing motivation and retention are discussed.

AB Early stressful life events predict depression and anxiety in carriers of specific polymorphisms and alter brain responses but brain structural phenotypes are largely unknown. We studied the interaction between short-term stress during specific time-windows and emotion-regulation using a genetic animal model of depression, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat. Brain structural alterations were analyzed using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). WKY (n=49) and Wistar (n=55) rats were divided into experimental groups: Early stress (ES): From postnatal day (PND) 27 rats were exposed to three consecutive days of stressors; Late stress (LS): From PND 44 rats were exposed to the same protocol; Control: No stressors. From PND 50, all animals were behaviorally tested for levels of anxiety and despair-like behaviors and then scanned. Gene x Environment x Timing (G x Ex T) interactions (p=0.00022 after Hochberg correction) were found in ventral orbital cortex, cingulate cortex, external capsule, amygdala and dentate gyrus and in the emotion regulation measures. WKY showed longer immobility in forced swim test, but no effect of ES was detected. ES increased open-field anxiety-like behaviors in Wistar rats but not in WKY, possibly indicating a ceiling effect in WKY. Stress in pre-pubertal or adolescent phases in development may influence structural integrity of specific brain regions and emotion regulation behaviors depending on genetic vulnerability, consistent with a G x E x T interaction in mood dysregulation.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition in the child maltreatment population. However, not all children who have been maltreated will develop MDD or MDD symptoms, suggesting the presence of unique risk pathways that explain how certain children develop MDD symptoms when others do not. The current study tested several candidate risk pathways to MDD symptoms following child maltreatment: neuroendocrine, autonomic, affective, and emotion regulation. Female adolescents (N = 110; age range = 14-19) were recruited into a substantiated child maltreatment or comparison condition and completed a laboratory stressor, saliva samples, and measures of emotion regulation, negative affect, and MDD symptoms. MDD symptoms were reassessed 18 months later. Mediational modeling revealed that emotion regulation was the only significant indirect effect of the relationship between child maltreatment and subsequent MDD symptoms, demonstrating that children exposed to maltreatment had greater difficulties managing affective states that in turn led to more severe MDD symptoms. These results highlight the importance of emotion dysregulation as a central risk pathway to MDD following child maltreatment. Areas of future research and implications for optimizing prevention and clinical intervention through the direct targeting of transdiagnostic risk pathways are discussed.

   PATHWAYS; PSYCHOPATHIC TRAITS
AB Child maltreatment is associated with disruptions in physiological arousal, emotion regulation, and defensive responses to cues of threat and distress, as well as increased risk for callous unemotional (CU) traits and externalizing behavior. Developmental models of CU traits have focused on biological and genetic risk factors that contribute to hypoarousal and antisocial behavior, but have focused less on environmental influences (Blair, 2004; Daversa, 2010; Hare, Frazell, & Cox, 1978; Krueger, 2000; Shirtcliff et al., 2009; Viding, Fontaine, & McCrory, 2012). The aim of the present investigation was to measure the independent and combined effects of child maltreatment and high CU traits on emotion-modulated startle response in children. Participants consisted of 132 low-income maltreated (n = 60) and nonmaltreated (n = 72) children between 8 and 12 years old who attended a summer camp program. Acoustic startle response (ASR) was elicited in response to a 110-dB 50-ms probe while children viewed a slideshow of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant IAPS images. Maltreatment status was assessed through examination of Department of Human Services records. CU traits were measured using counselor reports from the Inventory of Callous and Unemotional Traits (Frick, 2004), and conduct problems were measured using counselor and child self-report. We found no significant differences in emotion-modulated startle in the overall sample. However, significant differences in ASR by maltreatment status, maltreatment subtype, and level of CU traits were apparent. Results indicated differential physiological responses for maltreated and nonmaltreated children based on CU traits, including a pathway of hypoarousal for nonmaltreated/high CU children that differed markedly from a more normative physiological trajectory for maltreated/high CU children. Further, we found heightened ASR for emotionally and physically neglected children with high CU and elevated antisocial behavior in these children. Results provide further support for differential trajectories by which experience and biology may influence the development of antisocial behavior in youth and highlight potential avenues for intervention.

   OUTCOMES; READERS; SPEECH; TRIAL
AB Background: Children with language impairment show academic outcomes that are consistently poorer than those of their typically developing peers. A contributor to this is difficulty with reading comprehension. Although these difficulties are reported to continue well into adolescence, this population is generally underserved with regard to therapy. The efficacy of interventions for reading comprehension is well established in the research literature, but whether the same effects are achievable within a reasonable time reflecting available resources in real-life circumstances is less clear.
   Aims: Efficacy trials may significantly overestimate how strong an effect will be when the treatment is used under more natural conditions and within local constraints. The aim was to discover whether a short classroom intervention would be effective in improving reading comprehension in adolescents with the heterogeneous profiles of general or specific learning disabilities, additional diagnoses and behavioural and socio-emotional problems found in mainstream schools today.
   Method & Procedures: Twenty-eight adolescents with heterogeneous language and reading profiles were recruited from a mainstream school. The intervention programme comprised eight sessions of instruction in multiple reading comprehension strategies, held over 4 weeks. Experiment 1 had 10 participants. Experiment 2 had 18 participants who underwent the same programme, plus the addition of a session dedicated to decoding skills. Efficacy was evaluated within a pre- and post-study design, with baseline and post-therapy measures taken using the York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension (YARC).
   Outcomes & Results: Both experiments showed a significant group difference pre/post-intervention, with similar large effect sizes. Experiment 2 also showed a significant group difference in decoding ability pre and post the single intervention session.
   Conclusions & Implications: This short intervention programme proved effective in a population with heterogeneous profiles, and fitted well with delivery in a mainstream school setting. It showed significant gains can be attained for this client group with relatively few resources.

AB This study examines the widely accepted but under-studied proposition that the greater the cultural distance (CD) between home country and country of resettlement the greater the mental health risk for immigrant and refugee youth. The study also explores pathways through which CD, a macro-social stressor, might exert its mental health effect through meso-environmental stressors including poverty and discrimination, as well as micro-environmental familial stressors. Acculturation strategies and personal competencies are also examined as sources of resilience. The study sample consists of 2074 immigrant and refugee girls and boys, ages 11-13, belonging to 16 different ethnocultural communities, and living in six different Canadian cities. Study data consist of interviews with youth and with the parent deemed the most knowledgeable. Results reveal that CD did adversely affect youth mental health but the effect was relatively small. Family environment variables, particularly parental depression and harsh parenting, accounted for about one third of the effect of CD. Parents in ethnocultural communities that were culturally distant from Canada were more likely to employ harsh parenting practices than parents coming from culturally closer countries. Immigrant youth from culturally distant backgrounds were more likely to perceive discrimination than youth from culturally closer backgrounds. Social competence had an inverse relationship with emotional symptoms. An integration style of acculturation was more advantageous than an isolated, assimilated or marginalized style. The longer youth from culturally distant backgrounds lived in Canada, the worse their mental health tended to be: for youth from culturally closer backgrounds, the opposite was true. The discussion addresses implications for resettlement interventions and policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Describe social participation of a group of children with specific language impairment.
   Method: 26 parents of children with specific language impairment (SLI) aged from 5 to 13 years and 11 school professionals participated in the study. Data collection was performed with the adapted version for children aged from 5 to 13 years old of the Assessment of Life Habits (Fougeyrollas et al., 2001). The questionnaire encompasses 196 life habits, grouped in 12 dimensions: nutrition, fitness, personal care, communication, housing, mobility, responsibilities, interpersonal relationships, community life, education, work and recreation (Fougeyrollas, 2010).
   Results: According to their parents and school professionals, children in this study carried out without difficulty life habits related to housing and mobility. However, they experienced difficulty with life habits related to interpersonal relationships, recreation and responsibilities, in addition to communication and education.
   Conclusions: Children with SLI are perceived by their parents and school professionals as having reduced social participation in many aspects of their daily life. Social participation should be considered as a major outcome when offering services in school to these children. This study proposes specific ways to help children with SLI.

AB Early life stress (ELS) may induce long-lasting psychological complications in adulthood. The protective role of resilience against the development of psychopathology is also important. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships among ELS, resilience, depression, anxiety, and aggression in young adults. Four hundred sixty-one army inductees gave written informed consent and participated in this study. We assessed psychopathology using the Korea Military Personality Test, ELS using the Childhood Abuse Experience Scale, and resilience with the resilience scale. Analyses of variance, correlation analyses, and hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were conducted for statistical analyses. The regression model explained 35.8%, 41.0%, and 23.3% of the total variance in the depression, anxiety, and aggression indices, respectively. We can find that even though ELS experience is positively associated with depression, anxiety, and aggression, resilience may have significant attenuating effect against the ELS effect on severity of these psychopathologies. Emotion regulation showed the most beneficial effect among resilience factors on reducing severity of psychopathologies. To improve mental health for young adults, ELS assessment and resilience enhancement program should be considered.

AB Purpose: To develop a temporal framework that can be utilized to develop quality measures for children and youth in foster care.
   Methods: A targeted assessment of published scientific articles, guidelines, evidence reviews, reports, and relevant websites with health recommendations for children in foster care was reviewed to provide supporting documentation for the framework.
   Results: Numerous recommendations for quality measures in children are relevant for children in foster care and additional measures have been proposed. From the moment a child enters foster care, through changes in foster home and eventual exit from foster care, the evidence suggests high variability and low adherence to recommended healthcare services.
   Conclusions: A set of nationally standardized measures are needed to inform child welfare agencies and policy makers about the gaps in care that need to be addressed to improve the quality of care for this population. The framework and domains presented in this manuscript offer a basis by which to develop a comprehensive set of quality measures for foster care children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Genome-wide association studies have identified allelic variation in CACNA1C as a risk factor for multiple psychiatric disorders associated with limbic system dysfunction, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression. The CACNA1C gene codes for a subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which modulate amygdala function. Although CACNA1C genotype appears to be associated with amygdala morphology and function in adults with and without psychopathology, whether genetic variation influences amygdala structure and function earlier in development has not been examined.
   Methods: In this first investigation of the neural correlates of CACNA1C in young individuals, we examined associations between two single nucleotide polymorphisms in CACNA1C (rs1006737 and rs4765914) with amygdala volume and activation during an emotional processing task in 58 adolescents and young adults 13-20 years of age.
   Results: Minor (T) allele carriers of rs4765914 exhibited smaller amygdala volume than major (C) allele homozygotes (=-0.33, p=0.006). Furthermore, minor (A) allele homozygotes of rs1006737 exhibited increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the amygdala when viewing negative (vs. neutral) stimuli (=0.29, p=0.040) and decreased BOLD signal in the amygdala when instructed to downregulate their emotional response to negative stimuli (=-0.38, p=0.009). Follow-up analyses indicated that childhood trauma did not moderate the associations of CACNA1C variation with amygdala structure and function (ps>0.170).
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that CACNA1C-related differences in amygdala structure and function are present by adolescence. However, population stratification is a concern, given the racial/ethnic heterogeneity of our sample, and our findings do not have direct clinical implications currently. Nevertheless, these results suggest that developmentally informed research can begin to shed light on the time course by which genetic liability may translate into neural differences associated with vulnerability to psychopathology.

AB Increased reports of impulsivity and aggression in male adolescents with Internet gaming might reflect their dysfunction in emotion regulation, particularly in suppression of negative emotions, which should affect the various stages of Internet gaming disorder. This study tested the hypothesis that adolescents with Internet gaming disorder would be more disturbed by the emotional interference and demonstrate compromised dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during a Stroop Match-to-Sample task. In addition, functional connectivity analysis was conducted to examine the interplays between neural correlates involved in emotional processing and how they were altered in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. The Internet gaming disorder group demonstrated weaker dACC activation and stronger insular activations to interfering angry facial stimuli compared with the healthy control group. Negative functional connectivity between stronger insular activation and weaker dorsolateral prefrontal activation correlated with higher cognitive impulsivity in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder. These findings provide evidence of the compromised prefrontal cognitive control over emotional interference in adolescents with Internet gaming disorder.

AB This study explored the development of mood variability in 474 Dutch adolescents (56.8% male, 90.1% medium to high socioeconomic status) from a community sample, followed from ages 13 to 18years. Three times per year, adolescents reported on daily happiness, anger, sadness, and anxiety for 5days using Internet diaries (15 assessment weeks; from 2006 to 2010). Mood variability scores were calculated as means of absolute differences between consecutive days. Results showed that happiness, anger, and sadness variability continuously declined across adolescence, while anxiety variability increased initially, then decreased, and then increased toward late adolescence. Despite females experiencing higher happiness and sadness variability, the rate of change across adolescence was similar for both sexes. Implications for normative emotional development and future studies are discussed.

AB High rates of comorbidity and overlapping diagnostic criteria between pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) contribute to diagnostic and treatment confusion. To advance what is known about both disorders, we compared effect of emotional stimuli on response control in children with primary BD, primary ADHD and typically developing controls (TDC). Participants included 7-17 year olds with either "narrow-phenotype" pediatric BD (n = 25), ADHD (n = 25) or TDC (n = 25). Groups were matched on participant age and FSIQ. The effect of emotional stimuli on response control was assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Affective Go/No-Go task (CANTAB AGN). We found a group by target valence interaction on commission errors [F(2,71) = 5.34, p < 0.01, AE (p) (2) = 0.13] whereby ADHD, but not TDC participants, made more errors on negative than positive words [t(24) = -2.58, p < 0.05, r = 0.47]. In contrast, there was a nonsignificant trend for BD participants to make fewer errors on negative versus positive words compared to ADHD and TDC participants. Between-subjects effects showed that ADHD participants made more errors than TDC, but not BD participants. Our main finding advances what is known about the effect of emotional stimuli on response control in children with ADHD. Our results suggesting a positive affective processing bias in children with ADHD compliment emerging literature show that difficulties with emotional processing and regulation may be core features of ADHD. Further, given the observed pattern of results in children with ADHD compared to BD children, our behavioral results suggest the importance of examining differences in the brain-behavior mechanisms involved in affective processing in children with ADHD compared to BD children.

AB Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at risk for emotional dysregulation and behavior problems that can escalate to levels requiring psychiatric hospitalization. Evaluating the etiology of such behaviors can be challenging for health care providers, as individuals with ASD can have difficulty self-reporting concerns. This brief report introduces the Iceberg Assessment Interview (IAI), a tool to organize and elucidate the assessment of issues potentially underlying problem behaviors. A summary of IAIs from a chart review of patients ages 5-18 with ASD (n = 23) admitted to a specialized psychiatric hospital unit illustrates the clinical utility of this tool. Summarized IAI data includes presenting crisis behaviors, caregiver-perceived environmental conditions, and underlying psychosocial and medical problems.

AB Traumatic childhood events are associated with a wide range of negative physical, psychological and adaptive outcomes over the life course and are one of the few identifiable causes of psychiatric illness. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be at increased risk for both encountering traumatic events and developing traumatic sequelae; however, this topic has been understudied. This review considers the rationale for examining traumatic events and related symptomology in individuals with ASD and summarizes the limited research on this topic. A conceptual framework for understanding the interplay of ASD, trauma and traumatic sequelae is proposed and recommendations for future research presented.

AB Extensive evidence links youth mental health to family functioning, highlighting the need to document causal pathways. This will require longitudinal studies, but traditional methods for longitudinal clinical research have several limitations, including high cost and resource demands, underrepresentation of fathers, and attrition bias. We tested whether an online alternative might address limitations of-and thus provide a useful complement to-traditional methods. We used the Mechanical Turk (MTurk) survey program to obtain reports from parents (N = 177) on family functioning, the parents' own symptoms, their children's behavioral and emotional problems, and parenting stress, with assessments in three consecutive months. Parents provided largely high-quality data (e.g., passed consistency checks); measures showed acceptable psychometrics at each time-point; and correlations among study measures paralleled those observed in prior research. Compared to prior studies using traditional longitudinal methods, the MTurk method was (a) much lower in cost and resource requirements, (b) successful in enrolling fathers, (c) comparable in participant attrition, and (c) similar in attrition bias, participant race/ethnicity, and enrollment of single parents. Overall, findings suggest that MTurk is a viable tool with its own set of strengths and limitations, and a potentially useful complement to traditional longitudinal methods. In particular, MTurk might be a cost-effective first step in generating causal hypotheses about family processes and youth mental health, for later testing via more traditional methods.

AB We investigated the associations of bullying and victimization with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as well as the mediating role of depressive mood in a sample of 785 adolescents. Further, we explored the moderating role of parental support in these associations. All participants completed questionnaires on bullying, victimization, NSSI, depressive mood, and parental support. Almost 21 % of adolescents engaged in at least one form of NSSI. Both bullying and victimization of being bullied increased the risk of engaging in NSSI. The relationships of both bullying and victimization with NSSI were partially mediated by depressive mood. Finally, the relationships of both bullying and victimization with NSSI and of depressive mood with NSSI were found to be moderated by parental support, indicating that these relationships were less pronounced in adolescents who experienced high parental support. Hence, we underscore the need to include both emotion-regulation training and family-based interventions into bully intervention programs to prevent NSSI.

AB BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging research suggests that major depressive disorder (MDD) in both adults and adolescents is marked by aberrant connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) during resting state. However, emotional dysregulation is also a key feature of MDD. No studies to date have examined emotion-related DMN pathology in adolescent depression. Comprehensively understanding the dynamics of DMN connectivity across brain states in individuals with depression with short disease histories could provide insight into the etiology of MDD.
   METHODS: We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data during an emotion identification task and during resting state from 26 medication-free adolescents (13-17 years old) with MDD and 37 well-matched healthy control subjects. We examined between-group differences in blood oxygenation level-dependent task responses and emotion-dependent and resting-state functional connectivity of the two primary nodes of the DMN: medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Additionally, we examined between-group differences in DMN functional connectivity and its relationship to depression severity and onset.
   RESULTS: Relative to healthy control subjects, unmedicated adolescents with MDD demonstrated reduced medial prefrontal cortex and PCC emotion-related deactivation and greater medial prefrontal cortex and PCC emotion-dependent functional connectivity with precuneus, cingulate gyrus, and striatum/subcallosal cingulate gyrus. The PCC-subcallosal cingulate connectivity remained inflexibly elevated in the subjects with MDD versus healthy control subjects during resting state. Stronger PCC emotion-dependent functional connectivity was associated with greater depression severity and an earlier age of depression onset.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent depression is associated with inflexibly elevated DMN connections. Given more recent evidence of DMN maturation throughout adolescence, our findings suggest that early-onset depression adversely affects normal development of functional brain networks.

AB While maltreatment is known to impact social and emotional functioning, threat processing, and neural structure, the potentially dimorphic influence of sex on these outcomes remains relatively understudied. We investigated sex differences across these domains in a large community sample of children aged 10 to 14 years (n = 122) comprising 62 children with verified maltreatment experience and 60 well-matched nonmaltreated peers. The maltreated group relative to the nonmaltreated comparison group exhibited poorer social and emotional functioning (more peer problems and heightened emotional reactivity). Cognitively, they displayed a pattern of attentional avoidance of threat in a visual dot-probe task. Similar patterns were observed in males and females in these domains. Reduced gray matter volume was found to characterize the maltreated group in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal lobes, and bilateral supramarginal gyrus; sex differences were observed only in the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, a disordinal interaction between maltreatment exposure and sex was found in the postcentral gyrus. Finally, attentional avoidance to threat mediated the relationship between maltreatment and emotional reactivity, and medial orbitofrontal cortex gray matter volume mediated the relationship between maltreatment and peer functioning. Similar mediation patterns were observed across sexes. This study highlights the utility of combining multiple levels of analysis when studying the "latent vulnerability" engendered by childhood maltreatment and yields tentative findings regarding a neural basis of sex differences in long-term outcomes for maltreated children.

AB General cognitive ability ('general intelligence') has been shown to buffer the effects of family adversity and poverty on emotional and behavioural problems in school age children. Yet, little is known about whether it can protect younger children or change the problem trajectories of at-risk children. We modelled simultaneously the effects of family poverty, neighbourhood poverty and adverse family events on children's trajectories of emotional and behavioural problems at ages 3,5 and 7. We then tested the role of general intelligence both in changing the trajectories of problems and in buffering the effects of these risk factors at each age, and explored gender differences in its expected protective effects. We analyzed data on 16,916 children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. General intelligence was derived from principal components analysis of several cognitive ability measures at ages 3,5 and 7. Although general intelligence was not associated with the growth of at-risk children's problems overtime, it was associated with the level of positive emotional and behavioural outcomes, and conferred concurrent protection from risk. At age 5, poor children with higher general intelligence had fewer emotional problems than similarly poor children with lower intelligence. Children exposed to family adversity were less likely to have emotional problems at any age if they had higher general intelligence. Higher general intelligence was also related to fewer behavioural problems for children experiencing family adversity at age 5, but not at ages 3 or 7. General intelligence moderated the effect of neighbourhood poverty on behavioural problems at ages 3 and 7, and its effect on emotional problems at age 5. In general, the protective effects of general intelligence, especially for emotional outcomes, applied mainly to girls. General intelligence appears to assist children in building resilience to both family and neighbourhood risk across childhood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often associated with emotional distress and psychiatric comorbidities. Atypical emotion regulation (ER) may underlie these accompanying features. This special issue of the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders presents a series of mechanistic and applied papers on ER and emotional experiences in ASD. Important concepts for future research are discussed, including how to conceptualize emotion dysregulation in ASD, the importance of capturing variability in emotion dysregulation in ASD studies, and the promise of intervention approaches that target ER impairments. This special issue highlights the growing emphasis on ER and emotional distress in ASD, and aims to encourage continued research in this area given the potential for this line of inquiry to lead to improved outcomes.

AB Only a few morphological studies have focused on changes in white matter (WM) volume in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We evaluated alterations in WM volume and its correlation with symptom severity and duration of illness in adults with GAD.
   The 44 subjects were comprised of 22 patients with GAD (13 males and nine females) diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and 22 age-matched healthy controls (13 males and nine females). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were processed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis based on diffeomorphic anatomical registration using the exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithm in SPM8.
   Patients with GAD showed significantly reduced WM volume, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC), and midbrain. In addition, DLPFC volume was negatively correlated with GAD-7 score and illness duration. ALIC volume was negatively correlated with GAD-7 score. Female patients had significantly less orbitofrontal cortex volume compared to that in male patients.
   The findings demonstrate localized changes in WM volume associated with cognitive and emotional dysfunction in patients with GAD. The finding will be helpful for understanding the neuropathology in patients with GAD.

AB Sixteen million US children (21%) live in households without consistent access to adequate food. After multiple risk factors are considered, children who live in households that are food insecure, even at the lowest levels, are likely to be sick more often, recover from illness more slowly, and be hospitalized more frequently. Lack of adequate healthy food can impair a child's ability to concentrate and perform well in school and is linked to higher levels of behavioral and emotional problems from preschool through adolescence. Food insecurity can affect children in any community, not only traditionally underserved ones. Pediatricians can play a central role in screening and identifying children at risk for food insecurity and in connecting families with needed community resources. Pediatricians should also advocate for federal and local policies that support access to adequate healthy food for an active and healthy life for all children and their families.

Mental health and park staff co-facilitated sports and games to teach and practice problem solving, emotion regulation, and effective communication. Additional practice occurred during multi-family groups and summer internships as junior camp counselors. We examined feasibility and promise via an open trial (n = 3 parks, 46 youth, 100 % African American, 100 % low-income, 59 % female, M = 13.09 years old). Improvements in social skills and reductions in problem behaviors lend support to after school programs as a space for mental health promotion.

Seventy-seven (43 female) fifth graders from elementary schools located in a small town in the Midwest completed a friendship quality measure, in addition to daily reports (seven school days) of mood and peer experiences. Multilevel modeling showed that children who had NPEs in which no one intervened had more negative and less positive mood. For negative mood, this result was attenuated if the child had a friend who was generally helpful. The results demonstrate the positive role of bystanders during NPEs and highlight the protective role of high-quality friendships.

AB Given the increasing prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder and recent advances in preventative treatments for this disorder, an important challenge in pediatric neuroimaging is the early identification of individuals at risk for depression. We examined whether machine learning can be used to predict the onset of depression at the individual level. Thirty-three never-disordered adolescents (10-15 years old) underwent structural MRI. Participants were followed for 5 years to monitor the emergence of clinically significant depressive symptoms. We used support vector machines (SVMs) to test whether baseline cortical thickness could reliably distinguish adolescents who develop depression from adolescents who remained free of any Axis I disorder. Accuracies from subsampled cross-validated classification were used to assess classifier performance. Baseline cortical thickness correctly predicted the future onset of depression with an overall accuracy of 70% (69% sensitivity, 70% specificity; p = 0.021). Examination of SVM feature weights indicated that the right medial orbitofrontal, right precentral, left anterior cingulate, and bilateral insular cortex contributed most strongly to this classification. These findings indicate that cortical gray matter structure can predict the subsequent onset of depression. An important direction for future research is to elucidate mechanisms by which these anomalies in gray matter structure increase risk for developing this disorder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: While suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among college students are common, the associations between STB and academic performance are not well understood.
   Methods: As part of the World Mental Health Surveys International College Student project, web based self reported STB of KU Leuven (Leuven, Belgium) incoming freshmen (N=4921; response rare = 65.4%) was collected, as well as academic year percentage (AYP), and the departments to which students belong. Single- and multilevel multivariate analyses were conducted, adjusted for gender, age, parental educational level, and comorbid lifetime emotional problems.
   Results: Lifetime suicide plan and attempt upon college entrance were associated with significant decreases in AYP (3.6% and 7.9%, respectively). A significant interaction was found with average departmental AYP, with STB more strongly associated with reduced AYP in departments with lower than higher average AYP.
   Limitations: Limited sample size precluded further investigation of interactions between department-level and student-level variables. No information was available on freshman secondary school academic performance.
   Conclusions: Lifetime STB has a strong negative association with academic performance in college. Our study suggests a potential role for the college environment as target for treatment and prevention interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research suggests that individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) do not have difficulty generating alternatives to social problems but choose more negative solutions, suggesting a deficit in decision-making. However, studies report no significant differences in risky decision-making on a performance-based task among individuals with and without NSSI histories. A limitation of these studies is that decision-making was only assessed at baseline. As individuals with a history of NSSI typically self-injure when experiencing negative emotions, decision-making ability may become impaired specifically in the presence of these emotions. The aim of the current study was to investigate decision-making ability among individuals with and.without NSSI histories both at baseline and following a distressing social exclusion task. We compared individuals with (n=48) and without (n=72) NSSI histories on the Iowa Gambling Task, a behavioral measure of risky decision-making, before and after exclusion or inclusion on the Cyberball task. Results indicated no significant group differences in performance regardless of condition. When participants were grouped by racial/ethnic minority status, results indicated that non-Hispanic White individuals with a history of NSSI exhibited deterioration in risky decision-making ability following social exclusion. Potential explanations for these findings and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Borderline personality disorder is a severe mental disorder that usually has its onset in youth, but its diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. Psychosocial 'early intervention' is effective in improving symptoms and behaviours, but no trial has studied adaptive functioning as a primary outcome, even though this remains the major persistent impairment in this patient group. Also, the degree of complexity of treatment and requirements for implementation in mainstream health services are unclear. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of three forms of early intervention for borderline personality disorder in terms of adaptive functioning. Each treatment is defined by combining either a specialised or a general service delivery model with either an individual psychotherapy or a control psychotherapy condition.
   Methods/design: The study is a parallel-group, single-blind, randomised controlled trial, which has randomised permuted blocking, stratified by depression score, sex and age. The treatments are: (1) the specialised Helping Young People Early service model plus up to 16 sessions of individual cognitive analytic therapy; (2) the Helping Young People Early service plus up to 16 sessions of a control psychotherapy condition known as 'befriending'; (3) a general youth mental health care model plus up to 16 sessions of befriending. Participants will comprise 135 help-seeking youth aged 15-25 years with borderline personality disorder. After baseline assessment, staff blind to the study design and treatment group allocation will conduct assessments at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. At the 12-month primary endpoint, the primary outcome is adaptive functioning (measures of social adjustment and interpersonal problems); secondary outcomes include measures of client satisfaction, borderline personality disorder features, depression and substance use.
   Discussion: The results of this trial will help to clarify the comparative effectiveness of a specialised early intervention service model over and above general youth mental health care, along with the contribution of individual cognitive analytic therapy over and above specialised general clinical care in early intervention for borderline personality disorder. Consequently, the findings will also inform the level of training and competency required for effective delivery of early intervention services.

AB The aim of this study was to examine unique contributions of different dimensions of students' temperament (self-control, positive affectivity and negative affectivity), students' emotional regulation, students' adjustment problems (the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms), and students' perception of parental behavior of their mothers and fathers (parental dimensions of emotionality, acceptance and rejection) in explaining their school success. The sample consisted of 553 students (275 girls and 278 boys) mean age of 13 years. By using hierarchical regression analysis, the results obtained in the subsample of boys revealed a significant and unique contribution of students' temperament, emotional regulation and parental behavior in explaining the variability of school success. Boys who are more prone to anger but are less fearful, who regulate their emotions effectively, and who perceive to be accepted by their mothers and fathers, have higher levels of school success. On the subsample of girls, only emotional regulation has a significant and positive contribution in the explanation of their school success; girls who regulate their emotions effectively have higher grades.

AB Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to risk behaviors as, in this life stage, they are experiencing intense physical, psychological and social changes. Adolescents who are overweight/obese, but particularly those who perceive themselves as such, are more likely to engage in risk behaviors than those who are, or perceive, themselves of normal-weight. Weight stigma and discrimination may contribute to this association as they reinforce poor body image and create intense stress. Stress is associated with poor emotion regulation, more impulsive, contextually-determined, and less rational decision-making, leading to greater engagement in risk behaviors. However, pathways from weight stigma/discrimination to risk behavior may be moderated by adolescents' social networks. This review provides a conceptual model and empirical evidence to illustrate the proposed pathways from weight stigma and discrimination to risk behaviors. Public health implications and future research directions are also discussed.

AB The China Jintan Child Cohort study began in 2004 with 1656 pre-school participants and a research focus on studying the impact of environmental exposures, such as lead, on children's neurobehavioural outcomes. This population cohort now includes around 1000 of the original participants, who have been assessed three times over a period of 10 years. Since the original IJE cohort profile publication in 2010, participants have experienced a critical developmental transition from pre-school to school age and then adolescence. The study has also witnessed an increase in breadth and depth of data collection from the original aim of risk assessment. This cohort has added new directions to investigate the mechanisms and protective factors for the relationship between early health factors and child physical and mental health outcomes, with an emphasis on neurobehavioural consequences. The study now encompasses 11 domains, composed of repeated measures of the original variables and new domains of biomarkers, sleep, psychophysiology, neurocognition, personality, peer relationship, mindfulness and family dynamics. Depth of evaluation has increased from parent/teacher report to self/peer report and intergenerational family report. Consequently, the cohort has additional directions to include: (i) classmates of the original cohort participants for peer relationship assessment; and (ii) parental and grandparental measures to assess personality and dynamics within families. We welcome interest in our study and ask investigators to contact the corresponding author for additional information on data acquisition.

AB Children's ability to manage the expression of sadness is critical to their development and adjustment. Although parents have been the primary focus of research examining sadness socialization, many acknowledge the influence of other agents such as children's peers. The present research evaluated one type of emotion socialization-reactions to sadness-by two different socialization agents: mothers and best friends. The sample included 125 third-grade through fifth-grade children enrolled in classrooms for typically developing children who reported on their sadness management, their depressive symptoms, and their mother's and best friend's responses to their sadness. Results revealed that reactions to children's sadness made unique contributions to children's ability to manage sadness and were further related to children's depressive symptoms. Mothers' reactions appeared to be directly associated with children's depressive symptoms, and best-friend reactions were indirectly associated with depressive symptoms through emotion management. These results highlight the value of examining multiple emotion socialization agents in children's lives.

AB Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with self-injurious behavior, it is currently unclear what mechanisms may account for this relationship. Sleep disturbances may be relevant as they are common among those with PTSD and are associated with emotion regulation difficulties, which may increase vulnerability to self-injurious behavior. As such, we investigated the relationship between PTSD and self-injurious behaviors, and the mediating roles of nightmares and insomnia. Hypotheses were tested cross-sectionally in a sample of psychology clinic outpatients (N=255). Participants completed a structured clinical interview assessing PTSD and self-report questionnaires measuring insomnia, nightmares, and self-injurious behaviors (i.e., Have you ever cut, burned, or scratched yourself on purpose?). PTSD was associated with self-injurious behavior after covarying for depression, and nightmare severity mediated the relationship between PTSD and self-injurious behavior. Findings are consistent with research indicating that sleep disturbances, specifically nightmares, are important predictors of poor outcomes among those with PTSD, and extend this research to suggest their role in self-injurious behaviors as well.

AB Background: There is abundant evidence that offspring of depressed mothers are at increased risk for persistent behavior problems related to emotion regulation, but the mechanisms by which offspring incur this risk are not entirely clear. Early adverse caregiving experiences have been associated with structural alterations in the amygdala and hippocampus, which parallel findings of cortical regions altered in adults with behavior problems related to emotion regulation. This study examined whether exposure to maternal depression during childhood might predict increased aggression and/or depression in early adulthood, and whether offspring amygdala: hippocampal volume ratio might mediate this relationship. Methods: Participants were 258 mothers and sons at socioeconomic risk for behavior problems. Sons' trajectories of exposure to maternal depression were generated from eight reports collected prospectively from offspring ages 18 months to 10 years. Offspring brain structure, aggression, and depression were assessed at age 20 (n = 170). Results: Persistent, moderately high trajectories of maternal depression during childhood predicted increased aggression in adult offspring. In contrast, stable and very elevated trajectories of maternal depression during childhood predicted depression in adult offspring. Increased amygdala: hippocampal volume ratios at age 20 were significantly associated with concurrently increased aggression, but not depression, in adult offspring. Offspring amygdala: hippocampal volume ratio mediated the relationship found between trajectories of moderately elevated maternal depression during childhood and aggression in adult offspring. Conclusions: Alterations in the relative size of brain structures implicated in emotion regulation may be one mechanism by which offspring of depressed mothers incur increased risk for the development of aggression.

AB Background: Impaired emotion regulation is increasingly recognized as a core feature of depressive disorders. Indeed, currently and previously depressed adults both report greater problems in attenuating sadness (mood repair) in daily life than healthy controls. In contrast, studies of various strategies to attenuate sad affect have mostly found that currently or previously depressed adults and controls were similarly successful at mood repair in the laboratory. But few studies have examined mood repair among depression-prone youths or the effects of trait characteristics on mood repair outcomes in the laboratory. Methods: Adolescents, whose first episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) had onset at age 9, on average (probands), and were either in remission or depressed, and control peers, watched a sad film clip. Then, they were instructed to engage in refocusing attention (distraction) or recalling happy memories. Using affect ratings provided by the youths, we tested two developmentally informed hypotheses about whether the subject groups would be similarly able to attenuate sadness via the two mood repair strategies. We also explored if self-reported habitual (trait) mood repair influenced laboratory performance. Results: Contrary to expectations, attention refocusing and recall of happy memories led to comparable mood benefits across subjects. Control adolescents reported significantly greater reductions in sadness than did depressed (Cohen's d = .48) or remitted (Cohen's d = .32) probands, regardless of mood repair strategy, while currently depressed probands remained the saddest after mood repair. Habitual mood repair styles moderated the effects of instructed (state) mood repair in the laboratory. Conclusions: Whether depressed or in remission, adolescents with MDD histories are not as efficient at mood repair in the laboratory as controls. But proband-control group differences in mood repair outcomes were modest in scope, suggesting that the abilities that subserve affect regulation have been preserved in probands to some degree. Further information about the nature of mood repair problems among youths with depression histories would help to better understand the clinical course of MDD and to design personalized interventions for depression.

AB IMPORTANCE Despite its high prevalence and morbidity, the underlying neural basis of major depressive disorder (MDD) in youth is not well understood.
   OBJECTIVES To identify in youth diagnosed as having MDD the most reliable neural abnormalities reported in existing functional neuroimaging studies and characterize their relations with specific psychological dysfunctions.
   DATA SOURCES Searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published from November 2006 through February 2015. The current analysis took place from August 21, 2014, to March 28, 2015.
   STUDY SELECTION We retained articles that conducted a comparison of youth aged 4 to 24 years diagnosed as having MDD and age-matched healthy controls using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and a voxelwise whole-brain approach.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS We extracted coordinates of brain regions exhibiting differential activity in youth with MDD compared with healthy control participants. Multilevel kernel density analysis was used to examine voxelwise between-group differences throughout the whole brain. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed by computing null hypothesis distributions from 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations and calculating the cluster size necessary to obtain the familywise error rate control at P < .05.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Abnormal levels of activation in youth diagnosed as having MDD compared with control participants during a variety of affective processing and executive functioning tasks.
   RESULTS Compared with age-matched healthy control participants (n = 274), youth with MDD (n = 246) showed reliable patterns of abnormal activation, including the following task-general and task-specific effects: hyperactivation in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (P < .05) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (P < .05) and hypoactivation in caudate (P < .01) across aggregated tasks; hyperactivation in thalamus (P < .03) and parahippocampal gyrus (P < .003) during affective processing tasks; hypoactivation in cuneus (P < .001), dorsal cingulate cortex (P < .05), and dorsal anterior insula (P < .05) during executive functioning tasks; hypoactivity in posterior insula (P < .005) during positive valence tasks; and hyperactivity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (P < .001) and superior temporal cortex (P < .003) during negative valence tasks.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Altered activations in several distributed brain networks may help explain the following seemingly disparate symptoms of MDD in youth: hypervigilance toward emotional stimuli from the overactivation of central hubs in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus that lead to a cascade of other symptoms; ineffective emotion regulation despite increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during affective processing, which may reverse across development or the clinical course; maladaptive rumination and poor executive control from difficulties shifting from default mode network activity to task-positive network activity during cognitively demanding tasks; and anhedonia from hypoactivation of the cuneus and posterior insula during reward processing.

AB Risk of developing emotional and behavioral mental health problems increases markedly during adolescence. Despite this increasing need, most adolescents, particularly ethnic minority youth, do not seek professional help. Informed by conceptual models of health behavior, the current study examined how cultural values are related to help seeking among adolescents from 2 distinct racial/ethnic groups. Using a prospective survey design, 169 Vietnamese American and European American youth in 10th and 11th grade reported on their mental health need, as measured by emotional/behavioral mental health symptoms and stressful life events, with participants reporting on their help-seeking behavior at 6-month follow-up assessments. Multinomial logistic regression analyses indicated that mental health need interacted with cultural values and ethnicity to predict help-seeking behavior. Specifically, associations between symptoms and stressful life events, and help-seeking behavior were smaller among Vietnamese American adolescents, and among adolescents with strong family obligation values. These results underscore the complex sociocultural factors influencing adolescents' help-seeking behavior, which have important implications for engaging youth in needed mental health care.

AB Individuals with non-suicidal self-injury tend to suppress emotion expressions like crying. If crying is inhibited, several communicative und regulatory functions are blocked, too. With regard to functionality, crying and self-injury show considerable overlap. Therefore it could be argued that self-injury will serve as dysfunctional equivalent to crying. We examine if the association between sadness and self-hate on one hand and self-harm on the other hand is moderated by crying. To answer this question, 116 female adolescents and young women aged 14 to 29 years with eating disorders filled in questionnaires measuring functions of non-suicidal self-injury, borderline specific cognitions as well as eating disorder and depression severity. Crying, sadness and self-hate were measured in each case with a single item. Contrary to expectations, relationships between emotion intensity and functions of non-suicidal self-injury were not moderated by crying. Crying and sadness were associated uniquely and positively with non-suicidal self-injury for purpose of psychological functioning. Eating disorders severity accounts for the largest part of variance with regard to psychological regulation of self-injury. Reported self-hate was negative correlated with psychological functions.
   Subjective feeling of sadness and crying seem to increase self-harm. Self-hate diminishes non-suicidal self-injury. Results suggested that self-injury supports crying with regard to self-regulatory processes.

AB Aim: Enuresis is a common childhood disorder that negatively affects children's social and psychological well-being. This study investigated the psychological and emotional problems of children in Taiwan who wet the bed between the ages of six and 15 by comparing feedback from the children, their parents and a control group.
   Methods: This case study featured 93 children with primary nocturnal enuresis from enuresis clinics, and their parents, and 98 nonenuretic controls and parents from the local community. All the parents completed the Behavioural and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS) and all the children completed the Teenage Self-Concept Scale (TSCS). T-scores were used for statistical comparisons and high scores related to higher self-concept.
   Results: The parents and their children displayed different perceptions of enuresis, with more behavioural and emotional problems in enuretic children. Older children and children with more severe enuresis reported more difficulties, and low maternal education was also a risk factor.
   Conclusion: Parental attitudes and perceptions towards bed-wetting were different from their children's. The children's age, enuresis severity and their mothers' educational level were potential risk factors that affected well-being. Health practitioners need to facilitate communication between enuretic children and their parents in addition to monitoring their psychological well-being.

AB Background: This study investigated the association between the religiosity of parents and pre-adolescents, and pre-adolescents' psychiatric problems.
   Method: In a clinic-referred cohort of 543 pre-adolescents at least once referred to a mental health outpatient clinic mental health problems were assessed using self-reports (Youth Self-Report; YSR), parent reports (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL), and teacher reports (Teacher's Report Form; TRF) of child behavioral and emotional problems. Paternal, maternal, and pre-adolescent religiosity were assessed by self-report. MANCOVAs were performed for internalizing and externalizing problems as dependent variables, with maternal religiosity, paternal religiosity, pre-adolescent religiosity, parental religious harmony, and gender as independent variables, and socioeconomic status and divorce as covariates.
   Results: Internalizing problems. Pre-adolescents of actively religious mothers had more internalizing symptoms than pre-adolescents of nonreligious mothers. Harmony and gender did not significantly affect the association between maternal religiosity and internalizing problems. Externalizing problems. No associations between religiosity of pre-adolescents, religiosity of mothers, religiosity of fathers and/or harmony of parents and externalizing problem behavior have been found.
   Discussion and conclusions: Overall, associations between mental health and religiosity were modest to absent. Results are discussed in the context of a clinic-referred cohort, the quest phase of internalizing religious beliefs and role modeling of parents. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Previous reports have painted a complex picture of the associations between dark personality features and emotion dysregulation. To provide a more comprehensive picture, 532 college students completed measures of dark personality features the Dark Triad (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), sadism, and spitefulness and emotion dysregulation. We found that the grandiose and leadership facets of narcissism were negatively associated with various aspects of emotion dysregulation. In contrast, spitefulness, the callous aspect of psychopathy, and Machiavellianism were positively associated with some aspects of emotion dysregulation. Sadism was not associated with emotion dysregulation. The implications of these results for the understanding of dark personality features are discussed.

AB An extensive empirical literature has focused on the self-concealment (SC) construct. In this article, we review 137 studies that used the Self-Concealment Scale (SCS) with varied populations (e.g., adolescent; intercultural; international; lesbian, gay, and bisexual; and intimate partner). We propose a working model for the psychology of SC and the mechanisms of action for its effects on well-being. A dual-motive conflict between urges to conceal and reveal is seen to play a central role in these health effects. Meta-analytic techniques identify significant associations for SC with 18 constructs falling into six general categories: antecedents, disclosure and concealment, emotion regulation, social well-being, psychological and physical health, and psychotherapy. We interpret these findings with reference to current research and theory on secret keeping and health as well as emotion- and self-regulatory processes. This first integrative review supports the construct validity of the SCS and demonstrates the value of the SC construct for the study of psychological phenomena in which secret keeping is a recognized issue.

AB Research on school bullying often focuses on the directional path of bullying and/or victimization leading to psychosocial problems, while such one-dimensional views have been shown to be too simplistic. Furthermore, recent research has shown that patterns of bullying at school differ for boys and girls, which makes gender a particularly relevant factor in exploring the causes and consequences of bullying. Therefore, the present study explored the bidirectional, longitudinal associations of bullying and bullying victimization on several psychosocial problems via a longitudinal cross-lagged panel study in 1243 adolescents in the Netherlands, while taking into account potential gender differences. Data were collected in September 2011 and 2012. Results showed that both bullied boys as well as girls reported more conduct problems at follow-up. Both boy and girl bullies reported less pro-social behavior and more peer problems at follow-up, but boys also reported more conduct problems at follow-up, while girls did not. Furthermore, in girls, emotional problems were associated with more victimization at follow-up, while inattention-hyperactivity problems and less pro-social behavior were related to increased chances of being a perpetrator of bully at follow-up. Conversely, in boys, baseline inattention-hyperactivity problems were not associated with being a bully later on, but rather with increased chances of being a bullying victim at later times. These results can help to tailor future anti-bullying interventions at schools.

AB Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate a school-based intervention program focussing on reducing perfectionism in pre-adolescent children.
   Method: A 2-lesson intervention or the control condition was implemented across three schools (N = 125; M age = 11.60 years; 47.2% girls). Students completed assessments at baseline, post-intervention and 4-week follow-up.
   Results: Significant between group differences for self-oriented perfectionism-striving were identified post-intervention and were maintained at 4-week follow-up (d = 0.47 and 0.40 respectively). Significant interactions between group and time favouring the intervention group were identified for the hyperactivity and emotional problems.
   Discussion: Findings from this study provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of a perfectionism intervention at an earlier age than has been targeted to date. While these findings appear promising, the justification of such approaches with this age group will require follow-up investigations with expanded intervention content, longer follow-up assessments, larger samples, and evidence of impact on other variables such as well-being.

AB Research has shown that loneliness may impair mental health and psychosocial adjustment during adolescence. There is separate evidence of the role of relatedness and emotional repair as predictors of perceived loneliness during adulthood. The objective of the present study was to analyze the mediating role of relatedness between emotional repair and loneliness in high school students. The sample included 703 students attending five different schools. Results of a simple mediation analysis seemed to support the mediating role of relatedness. However, since the interaction between emotional repair and relatedness was significant, a moderated mediation was conducted, which showed that the proposed mediation was dependent on the levels on repair and relatedness. Specifically, relatedness only had a mediating role when the levels of relatedness were low and the levels of repair were high. These and other results point to a more complex relation between emotional repair, relatedness, and loneliness than initially expected. We discuss our findings in relation to Salovey and Mayer's (Imagin Cognit Personal 9(3):185-211, 1990) theory of emotional intelligence and the basic psychological needs theory (Deci and Ryan in Psychol Inq 11:227-268, 2000).

AB Recognition of emotional expressions plays an essential role in children's healthy development. Anomalies in these skills may result in empathy deficits, social interaction difficulties and premorbid emotional problems in children and adolescents with schizophrenia.
   Twenty-six subjects with early onset schizophrenia spectrum (EOSS) disorders and twenty-eight matched healthy controls (HC) were instructed to identify five basic emotions and a neutral expression. The assessment entailed presenting visual, auditory and congruent cross-modal stimuli. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we found no significant association for handedness, age or gender. However, significant associations emerged for emotion type, perception modality, and group. EOSS patients performed worse than HC in uniand cross-modal emotional tasks with a specific negative emotion processing impairment pattern. There was no relationship between emotion identification scores and positive or negative symptoms, self-reported empathy traits or a positive history of developmental disorders. However, we found a significant association between emotional identification scores and nonverbal communication impairments. We conclude that cumulative dysfunctions in both nonverbal communication and emotion processing contribute to the social vulnerability and morbidity found in youths who display EOSS disorder.

   STRATEGIES
AB Emotion regulation is the ability to recruit processes to influence emotion generation. In recent years there has been mounting interest in how emotions are regulated at behavioural and neural levels, as well as in the relevance of emotional dysregulation to psychopathology. During adolescence, brain regions involved in affect generation and regulation, including the limbic system and prefrontal cortex, undergo protracted structural and functional development. Adolescence is also a time of increasing vulnerability to internalising and externalising psychopathologies associated with poor emotion regulation, including depression, anxiety and antisocial behaviour. It is therefore of particular interest to understand how emotion regulation develops over this time, and how this relates to ongoing brain development. However, to date relatively little research has addressed these questions directly. This review will discuss existing research in these areas in both typical adolescence and in adolescent psychopathology, and will highlight opportunities for future research. In particular, it is important to consider the social context in which adolescent emotion regulation develops. It is possible that while adolescence may be a time of vulnerability to emotional dysregulation, scaffolding the development of emotion regulation during this time may be a fruitful preventative target for psychopathology.

AB AimsThe first aim of the present study is to assess the overlap between borderline and schizotypal traits during adolescence. The second objective is to examine whether some psychological factors (i.e. cognitive coping mechanisms, impulsivity and encoding style) are differentially related to borderline and schizotypal traits and may therefore improve the efficiency of clinical assessments.
   MethodsOne hundred nineteen community adolescents (57 male) aged from 12 to 19 years completed a set of questionnaires evaluating the expression of borderline and schizotypal traits as well as cognitive emotion regulation (CER), impulsivity and encoding style.
   ResultsOur data first yielded a strong correlation between borderline and schizotypal scores (r=0.70, P<0.001). Secondly, linear regression models indicated that the catastrophizing' CER strategy and the lack of premeditation' impulsivity facet accounted for the level of borderline traits, whereas an internal encoding style predominantly explained schizotypal traits.
   ConclusionsOur results support the abundant literature showing that borderline and schizotypal traits frequently co-occur. Moreover, we provide original data indicating that borderline and schizotypal traits during adolescence are linked to different specific psychological mechanisms. Thus, we underline the importance of considering these mechanisms in clinical assessments, in particular to help disentangle personality disorder traits in youths.

AB Ample research documents a link between parent and child anxiety, yet little work has examined parents' and children's emotional reactivity for their association with parent-child anxiety transmission. Using a community sample, here we evaluate parents' subjective emotional reactions to imagining their children feeling afraid and examine (1) their link with parental anxiety and (2) whether this reactivity moderates the association between parent anxiety and children's subjective and physiological reactivity [resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)]. Finally, we evaluate whether these two indices of children's reactivity act as indirect effects between parental anxiety and child anxiety, and whether this association is moderated by parents' reactivity to the child's fear (moderated mediation). School-aged children (N = 75) and their primary caregivers reported on their anxiety symptoms. Parents and children then completed parallel paradigms in which they imagined the child feeling afraid and reported on their reactivity. Children's resting RSA was assessed as they watched a nature video. The association between parental anxiety and children's subjective and physiological reactivity was moderated by parents' reactivity, such that only when parents reported high reactivity was there a significant association between parental anxiety and children's self-reported and physiological reactivity. Further, children's physiological reactivity acted as an indirect effect in the link between parents' and children's anxiety symptoms, but only for parents who reported high levels of reactivity to child fear. Results are discussed in terms of their contribution to the literature on parent-child relationships and anxiety.

AB Objectives A systematic review was conducted to (1) investigate family resilience in the context of pediatric cancer, and (2) examine theoretical, methodological, and statistical issues in this literature. Family resilience was operationalized as competent family functioning after exposure to a significant risk. Methods Following guidelines for systematic reviews, searches were performed using Web of Science, Pubmed, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Embase. After screening 5,563 articles, 85 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were extracted for review. Results Findings indicated that most families are resilient, adapting well to the crisis of cancer diagnosis. However, a subset still experiences difficulties. Methodological issues in the current literature hamper strong nuanced conclusions. Conclusions We suggest future research with a greater focus on family resilience and factors predicting it, based on available theory, and conducted with attention toward unit of measurement and use of appropriate statistical analyses. Improvements in research are needed to best inform family-based clinical efforts.

AB Bullying is shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but only a few studies have prospectively examined the effects of childhood bullying on adult outcomes. Our Series paper focuses on prospective longitudinal studies that used large, population-based, community samples analysed through quantitative methods and published between 1960 and 2015. We describe the results of childhood bullying in adulthood in three of the most burdensome areas: psychopathology, suicidality, and criminality. We note that the different groups involved (ie, victims, bullies, and bully-victims) are at risk of difficulties later in life, but their risk profiles differ and the contributions are probably not independent. Controlling for confounders reduces the risk and sometimes eliminates it. Victims are at a high risk of internalising disorders. Bullies seem to be at risk of later externalising disorders and criminality, mainly violent crime and illicit drug misuse. Bully-victims seem to be at risk of internalising disorders, externalising disorders, and criminality, but not all studies examined bully-victims as a separate group. Boys and girls differ in their long-term outcomes. A dose effect exists in which frequent bullying involvement in childhood is most strongly associated with adult adversities. Future studies need to control for additional factors (including genetic, psychosocial, and environmental) to account for the mechanisms behind the reported longitudinal associations.

ID BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS; DISORDERS; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; SAMPLE
AB Our purpose was to determine the effects of gender and age on Kosovar YSR scores and the prevalence of self-reported behavioral/emotional problems in Kosovar adolescents based on scores above a cutpoint.
   Participants were 1351 adolescents recruited from secondary schools in seven regions of Kosova who completed the Youth Self-Report.
   The oldest adolescents had the highest scores on many YSR scales. Although Kosova's mean problems scores were not elevated relative to international norms, the percentage of adolescents scoring in the deviant range (borderline + clinical) was much higher than expected for almost all YSR problem scales, including Total Problems (31.2 %), Internalizing (40.8 %), and Externalizing (23.4 %). The 23 % prevalence of elevated scores on Stress Problems was triple the expected 7 % prevalence based on a 93rd percentile cutpoint.
   Results revealed much higher prevalence of psychopathology than would be expected based on international norms, with 25-40 % of Kosovar adolescents scoring in the deviant range on YSR scales, Thus, our research indicates a need for expanding psychiatry services to meet the pressing mental health needs of Kosovar adolescents as well as the importance of considering mental health problems in their social context.

AB AimsPatients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) suffer the symptoms of psychological distress, including excessive and uncontrollable anxiety. Until now, the functional neuroanatomy for working memory (WM) in conjunction with the major anxiety symptoms in GAD patients has not yet been clearly identified. This study investigated the neural activation patterns associated with the effect of neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors during the delayed-response WM task in GAD patients.
   MethodsEighteen patients with GAD and 18 age-matched healthy controls participated in this study. The functional magnetic resonance images were obtained while the subjects performed a delayed-response WM task with neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors.
   ResultsDuring the neutral distractor, GAD patients compared to controls showed significantly lower activities in the fusiform gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, precuneus, superior occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, cuneus, calcarine gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and cerebellar cortex. During the anxiety-inducing distractor, GAD patients showed significantly higher activity in the hippocampus, whereas they showed lower activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, precuneus, superior occipital gyrus and cerebellar cortex. The blood-oxygen-level dependent signal changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in GAD patients during the anxiety-inducing distractor were negatively correlated with Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised scores.
   ConclusionsThis study identified the specific brain areas associated with the interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive function associated with neutral and anxiety-inducing distractors during WM maintenance in GAD patients. These findings will be helpful for understanding the neural mechanism on the WM-related cognitive deficits and emotional dysfunction with typical anxiety symptoms in GAD.

AB Children with severe intellectual disabilities are at increased risk of presenting with self-injurious, aggressive and destructive behaviour. Severity of these behaviours is an important predictor of psychological and behavioural service use by people with intellectual disabilities. However, studies suggest that the needs of children with intellectual disabilities and their families are not being met. The aims of the present study were to: (1) describe the self-injurious, aggressive and destructive behaviours and subsequent support needs of children with severe intellectual disabilities attending special schools in one major city within the UK, (2) compare teacher and primary carer ratings of behaviour and service need and (3) explore the extent to which the needs of children with intellectual disabilities are being met in terms of contact with relevant specialist services. Questionnaires were completed by teachers and primary family carers of children with a severe intellectual disability. Results indicated that at least 5.3% and 4.1% of children showed at least one behaviour at a clinically significant frequency and management difficulty respectively. Primary carers identified more children with significant behaviour difficulties and support needs than teachers. The odds for children presenting with high levels of the behaviours of interest for having a service need for behavioural intervention were at least 13 times those for children not showing the behaviours, yet only doubled for contact with a specialist relevant health-care professional. These results quantify the magnitude of the substantial gap between level of need and relevant support received. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Children (0-18 years) with maltreatment histories are vulnerable to experiencing difficulties across multiple domains of functioning, including educational outcomes that encompass not only academic achievement but also mental well-being. The current literature review adopted Slade and Wissow's model to examine (1) the link between childhood maltreatment and academic achievement, (2) the link between childhood maltreatment and mental health outcomes (i.e., emotional and behavioral difficulties), and (3) the bidirectional relationship between childhood academic achievement and mental health. In addition, we reviewed variables that might influence or help explain the link between childhood maltreatment and educational outcomes, drawing on developmental perspectives and Bronfenbrenner's ecological model. Finally, whenever possible, we presented findings specific to maltreated children in out-of-home care to highlight the unique challenges experienced by this population. Results indicated that children with maltreatment histories often experience impairments in both their academic performance (e.g., special education, grade retention, lower grades) and mental well-being (e.g., anxiety, low mood, aggression, social skills deficits, poor interpersonal relationships). These impairments appeared to be particularly pronounced among maltreated children in out-of-home care. Findings, albeit sparse, also indicated that mental health difficulties are negatively associated with children's academic achievement and, similarly, that academic achievement deficits are linked with mental health problems. The link between childhood maltreatment and educational outcomes may be partly explained through the disruption of key developmental processes in children, such as attachment, emotion regulation, and sense of agency. As well, maltreatment characteristics and the functioning of various systems in which children are embedded (e.g., family, school, child welfare) can serve to positively or negatively influence the educational outcomes of maltreated children. The theoretical, research, and applied implications stemming from the findings are considered.

AB Parental anxiety confers risk for the development of an anxiety disorder in children, and this risk may be transmitted through children's stress reactivity. Further, some children may be more vulnerable to reactivity in the presence of parent factors such as anxiety. In this study, we examined whether parents' anxiety symptoms prospectively predict school-aged children's physiological reactivity following stress, assessed through their electrodermal activity (galvanic skin response) during recovery from a performance challenge task, and whether this varies as a function of children's temperamental fearfulness. Parents and their children (N = 68) reported on their anxiety symptoms at Time 1 of data collection, and parents characterized the extent to which their children had fearful temperaments. At Time 2 children completed the performance challenge and two recovery tasks. Greater parental anxiety symptom severity at Time 1 predicted children's higher electrodermal response during both recovery tasks following the failure task. Further, these effects are specific to children with medium and high fearful temperament, whereas for children low in fearfulness, the association between parent anxiety and child reactivity is not significant. Findings provide additional evidence for the diathesis-stress hypothesis and are discussed in terms of their contribution to the literature on developmental psychopathology.

AB The present study examines the unique contributions of the caregiving system to predicting adolescent behavioral problems as well as examining the interplay between the caregiving systems in both parents. Two hundred and sixty six, adolescents (147 females and 119 males; aged 11-19) and their parents completed measure of socio-emotional problems and caregiving representations, respectively. Maternal mental representation of caregiving-self was a significant predictor for internalizing and externalizing problems. The inclusion of paternal mental representations of caregiving-other in the model increased the variance only for externalizing problems. Our findings confirm that mental representations based on inability to perceive others as deserving help, and negative self-perception of abilities and skills to give help predict socio-emotional problems in their adolescents. The implications of the findings for future theoretical and empirical development of research in this field are discussed.

AB Objective: Evaluate an online coping skills program to prevent mental health problems in children and adolescents from divorced or separated families. Method: Children ages 11-16 (N = 147) whose families had filed for divorce were recruited using public court records. Participants were blocked by risk-score and randomly assigned to either a control (Internet self-study condition, Best of the Net (BTN) or the experimental intervention, Children of Divorce-Coping With Divorce (CoD-CoD), a 5-module highly interactive online program to promote effective coping skills. Program effects were tested on measures of children's self-reported coping and parent and youth reports of children's mental health problems. Results: Significant main effects indicated that youth in CoD-CoD improved more on self-reported emotional problems relative to BTN youth (d = .37) and had a lower rate of clinically significant self-reported mental health problems (OR = .58, p = .04). A significant Baseline x Treatment interaction indicated that the 55% of youth with highest baseline problems improved more than those in BTN on their self-report of total mental health problems. A significant interaction effect indicated that CoD-CoD improved youth coping efficacy for the 30% of those with the lowest baseline coping efficacy. For the 10% of youth with lowest parent-reported risk at baseline, those who received BTN had lower problems than CoD-CoD participants. Conclusions: CoD-CoD was effective in reducing youth-reported mental health problems and coping efficacy particularly for high risk youth. Parent-report indicated that, relative to BTN, CoD-CoD had a negative effect on mental health problems for a small group with the lowest risk.

AB This study investigated the relationship between parent emotion socialization and youth somatic complaints (SC) in an early adolescent sample using a longitudinal experimental design. An emotion-focused parenting intervention, which taught parent's skills to improve their emotional competence and emotion socialization, was used to examine whether changes in parent emotion socialization affected the young person's SC. Questionnaires were completed prior to intervention and 10 months later by 225 youth (121 intervention) and their parents. Results indicated that changes in parents' awareness and regulation of emotion and emotion socialization practices resulted in reduced youth SC. These findings have important implications for the prevention of SC.

AB BACKGROUNDPhysical activity and structural differences in the hippocampus have been linked to educational outcome. We investigated whether a curriculum-based physical activity intervention correlates positively with children's academic achievement, psychological well-being, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), fitness, and structural development of the brain.
   METHODSThe study had a quasi-experimental design and a control group. National test results were gathered from 545 students, 122 in the intervention school, and 423 in 3 control schools. HRQoL and socioemotional data were collected with child and proxy versions of KIDSCREEN and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire. Overall, 79 students in grades 5 and 6 were recruited for an in-depth study, consisting of a submaximal oxygen consumption test and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. HRQoL and socioemotional data were collected from 349 students (65%), 182 (52%) in the intervention school, and 167 (48%) in one of the control schools.
   RESULTSGirls attending the intervention school were more likely to pass national tests in Swedish (odds ratio 5.7) and Mathematics (odds ratio 3.2). The fourth to sixth graders in the intervention school reported lower levels of conduct problems (p<.05), and the girls were also less likely to report hyperactivity (p<.05). Girls reported higher levels of emotional problems (p<.05) than boys. Boys in the intervention group had significantly higher levels of estimated maximal oxygen uptake (p<.05) than controls. No difference in hippocampal structure was seen.
   CONCLUSIONSCurriculum-based physical activity in school may improve the academic achievement and psychological health of children, particularly for girls.

AB Episodic rage represents an important and underappreciated clinical feature in pediatric anxiety. This study examined the incidence and clinical correlates of rage in children with anxiety disorders. Change in rage during treatment for anxiety was also examined. Participants consisted of 107 children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and their parents. Participants completed structured clinical interviews and questionnaire measures to assess rage, anxiety, functional impairment, family accommodation and caregiver strain, as well as the quality of the child's relationship with family and peers. Rage was a common feature amongst children with anxiety disorders. Rage was associated with a more severe clinical profile, including increased anxiety severity, functional impairment, family accommodation and caregiver strain, as well as poorer relationships with parents, siblings, extended family and peers. Rage was more common in children with separation anxiety, comorbid anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and behavioral disorders, but not depressive symptoms. Rage predicted higher levels of functional impairment, beyond the effect of anxiety severity. Rage severity reduced over treatment in line with changes in anxiety symptoms. Findings suggest that rage is a marker of greater psychopathology in anxious youth. Standard cognitive behavioral treatment for anxiety appears to reduce rage without adjunctive treatment.

AB High risk behavior in adolescents is associated with injury, mental health problems, and poor outcomes in later life. Improved understanding of the neurobiology of high-risk behavior and impulsivity shows promise for informing clinical treatment and prevention as well as policy to better address high-risk behavior. We recruited 21 adolescents (age 14-17) with a wide range of high-risk behavior tendencies, including medically high-risk participants recruited from psychiatric clinics. Risk tendencies were assessed using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Screen (ARBS). ARBS risk scores correlated highly (0.78) with impulsivity scores from the Barratt Impulsivity scale (BIS). Participants underwent 4.7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an emotional Go/NoGo task. This task presented an aversive or neutral distractor image simultaneously with each Go or NoGo stimulus. Risk behavior and impulsivity tendencies exhibited similar but not identical associations with fMRI activation patterns in prefrontal brain regions. We interpret these results as reflecting differences in response inhibition, emotional stimulus processing, and emotion regulation in relation to participant risk behavior tendencies and impulsivity levels. The results are consistent with high impulsivity playing an important role in determining high risk tendencies in this sample containing clinically high-risk adolescents.

AB Background: Young adults are a high-risk group for nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). It is important to have a better understanding of these behaviors in order to facilitate effective research, intervention, and treatment. Models have been presented to explain these behaviors where emotion regulation, coping, and support play a role. Yet conflicting results have occurred based on demographic factors such as race and sex. While controlling for the observable demographic factors, this study sought to examine differences between individuals who currently engage in NSSI, engaged in NSSI in the past, and never engaged in NSSI related to emotions, coping strategies, interpersonal support, and ethnic identity and belonging.
   Methods: Participants were selected from freshman students at two universities, in geographically different locations in the United States (N = 282). Participants in this study were matched on demographic factors: race, sex, and university. This led to demographically matched groups (current, past, never engagement in NSSI; n = 94 per group). Groups were compared on intrapersonal factors (i.e., emotions: depression and anxiety; coping strategies: adaptive and maladaptive; interpersonal support: family, friend, and significant other; and ethnic identity and belonging). Descriptive statistics and ANOVA with post hoc Scheffe were utilized to explicate differences between groups.
   Results: Individuals who never engaged in NSSI reported significantly higher levels of ethnic belonging and interpersonal support and lower levels of depression and anxiety than both groups who engaged in NSSI. Individuals who never self-injured used less adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies than participants who self-injured. Young adults who currently engaged in NSSI reported higher levels of depression and anxiety, higher levels of both types of coping, and perceived less support.
   Conclusions: It is important to understand the differences between individuals who self-injure in comparison to those who do not so that mental health clinicians can provide more effective services and preventative efforts.

AB Background: 13-18% of all preschool children have severe behavioral problems at least transiently, sometimes with long-term adverse consequences. In this study, the social training program " Lubo aus dem All! - Vorschulalter" (Lubo from Outer Space, Preschool Version) was evaluated in a kindergarten setting.
   Methods: 15 kindergartens were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group, in a 2: 1 ratio. The intervention was designed to strengthen emotional knowledge and regulation, the ability to take another person's point of view, communication skills, and social problem solving. The control group continued with conventional kindergarten activities. The primary endpoint was improvement in social-cognitive problem solving strategies, as assessed with the Wally Social Skills and Problem Solving Game (Wally). Secondary endpoints were improvement in prosocial behavior and reduction in problematic behavior, as assessed with the Preschool Social Behavior Questionnaire (PSBQ) and the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF). Data were collected before and after the intervention and also 5 months later. Mixed models were calculated with random effects to take account of the cluster design and for adjustment for confounding variables.
   Results: 221 children in kindergarten, aged 5-6 years, were included in the study. Randomization was unsuccessful: the children in the intervention group performed markedly worse on the tests carried out before the intervention. Five months after the end of the intervention, the social-cognitive problem solving strategies of the children in the intervention group had improved more than those of the children in the control group: the intergroup difference in improvement was 0.79 standard deviations of the Wally test (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-1.46). This effect was just as marked 5 months later (0.63, 95% CI 0.03-1.23). Prosocial behavior, as measured by the PSBQ, also improved more in the intervention group, with an intergroup difference of 0.37 standard deviations (95% CI 0.05-0.71).
   Conclusion: An age-appropriate program to prevent behavioral disorders among kindergarten children improved both the children's knowledge of prosocial problem solving strategies and their prosocial behavior.

AB Recent research has attempted to explain the mechanisms through which parental attachment affects social and emotional outcomes (e.g., Burnette, Taylor, Worthington, & Forsyth, 2007; Panfile & Laible, 2012). The authors' goal was to examine negative emotionality and emotion regulation as mediators of the associations that attachment has with empathy, forgiveness, guilt, and jealousy. One hundred forty-eight adolescents reported their parental attachment security, general levels of negative emotionality and abilities to regulate emotional responses, and tendencies to feel empathy, forgiveness, guilt, and jealousy. Results revealed that attachment security was associated with higher levels of empathy, forgiveness, and guilt, but lower levels of jealousy. In addition, emotion regulation mediated the links attachment shared with both empathy and guilt, such that higher levels of attachment security were linked with greater levels of emotion regulation, which led to greater levels of empathy and guilt. Alternatively, negative emotionality mediated the links attachment shared with both forgiveness and jealousy, such that higher levels of attachment security were associated with lower levels of negative emotionality, which in turn was linked to lower levels of forgiveness and higher levels of jealousy. This study provides a general picture of how attachment security may play a role in shaping an individual's levels of social emotions.

AB Few published studies have looked at the moderating role of coping styles on the association between stress reactivity and internalizing/externalizing problems despite theory suggesting that particular constellations of stress reactivity and coping may be uniquely problematic. The present study aimed to test the interactive effects of coping and psychophysiology on self- and parent-report broad-spectrum problems in a normative adolescent sample. Sixty-six late adolescents (ages 16-17; 60% female, 13% ethnic minority) completed questionnaires on coping, stressful life events, and behavioral/emotional problems, with parents also providing data on problems. In addition, skin conductance and heart rate data were obtained during a brief interview designed to elicit the feeling of reexperiencing a recent stressful experience. Path analytic results suggested evidence for several interaction effects between coping and skin conductance. Most commonly, the pattern of effects was consistent with a buffering effect for productive (or problem-focused) coping strategies against elevated internalizing and externalizing problems for individuals who demonstrated high physiological stress reactivity. Evidence for interaction effects related to respiratory sinus arrhythmia was less frequent and less consistent with a priori hypotheses. Although our cross-sectional results should be interpreted cautiously, the interactions reported here suggest that improving coping skills may be particularly beneficial for youth with high psychophysiological arousal.

AB This article reviews central nervous system substrates and autonomic correlates of emotion dysregulation and offers several suggestions for future research. Studies conducted in the last two decades indicate that effective emotion regulation requires efficient top-down, cortically mediated regulation of bottom-up, subcortically mediated individual differences in trait impulsivity and trait anxiety. Without making critical distinctions between highly heritable individual differences in trait impulsivity and trait anxiety, versus less heritable and more socialized deficiencies in emotion regulation, progress in understanding the development of psychopathology among children and adolescents will be hampered. Future research can also be improved by measuring emotion dysregulation across multiple level of analysis, specifying physiological mechanisms through which operant reinforcement shapes emotional lability, improving the internal and external validity of psychophysiological measures, integrating emotion dysregulation into factor analytic and behavioral genetic models of psychopathology, identifying molecular genetic risk for emotion dysregulation, and expanding neuroimaging research on emotion dysregulation among children and adolescents.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; QUESTIONNAIRE; DISORDERS
AB Although the field of emotion regulation in children and adolescents is growing, there is need for age-adjusted measures that assess a large variety of strategies. An interesting instrument in this respect is the FEEL-KJ because it measures 7 adaptive and 5 maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in response to three different emotions. However, the FEEL-KJ has not yet been validated extensively. Therefore, the current study aims to test the internal structure and validity of the FEEL-KJ in a large sample of Dutch-speaking Belgian children and adolescents (N = 1102, 8-18 years old). The investigation of the internal structure confirms earlier reports of a two-factor structure with Adaptive and Maladaptive Emotion Regulation as overarching categories. However, it also suggests that the two-factor model is more complex than what was previously assumed. The evaluation of the FEEL-KJ validity furthermore provides evidence for its construct and external validity. In sum, the current study confirms that the FEEL-KJ is a valuable and reliable measure of emotion regulation strategies in children and adolescents.

AB Today, researchers consider sports as one of the methods of reinforcement in the development of psychological parameters. The aim of the present study was to compare the alexithymia and its components, in athletes and non-athletic adolescents. Its components consist of difficulty in identifying feelings (DIF), difficulty in describing feelings (DDF), and externally oriented thinking (EOT). The statistical sample of the research included 100 athlete students and 100 non-athlete students, who were selected using multistage cluster sampling. They were asked to fill out the Farsi version of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20. The obtained results showed that there were significant differences in the mean scores of the alexithymia and its three components: difficulty in identifying feelings, difficulty in describing and externally oriented thinking in both groups (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). The results revealed that athletic students had less emotional problems than non-athlete students; it is recommended that physical activity be part of the strategies to improve emotional health among non-athletic students.

AB Objectives: To systematically review empirical research on awareness deficits in children and adolescents following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), ERIC (Education Resources Information Centre), PsycBITE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to August 8, 2013, using key terms relating to awareness of deficits and brain injury in childhood/adolescence. Studies of children or adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI), systematic measurement of awareness of deficits, and reporting of quantitative data were included. Details of participants, methodology, and findings were summarized for each study, and methodological quality was rated. Results: Review of 12 eligible studies yielded mixed evidence concerning the presence of awareness deficits after childhood TBI. Awareness deficits were most evident both for memory and executive function impairments and for children and adolescents with severe TBI. Methodological variability, including sampling characteristics, objects of awareness, measurement issues, and approach to statistical analysis, contributed to the mixed findings. Conclusions: Further research focusing on factors contributing to awareness deficits following pediatric TBI, the course of recovery, and relation to functional outcomes is warranted.

AB Art therapy (AT) is frequently used in the treatment of patients diagnosed with cluster B/C personality disorders, but there is little evidence for its efficacy. This study aimed to provide insight into the perceived effects of AT. We interviewed 29 adult patients in individual and focus-group in-depth interviews, including a 'negative case', starting with a topic list coming from the literature study. Data were gathered and analysed using the Grounded Theory Approach in order to generate concepts and interrelated categories. The constructed theoretical model of effects of AT consisted of five core categories: improved sensory perception; personal integration; improved emotion/impulse regulation; behaviour change; and insight/comprehension. Compared to verbal therapy (VT), patients experienced AT as an experiential therapeutic entry with a complementary quality next to VT and a more direct way to access emotions, which they attributed to the appeal of art materials and art making to bodily sensations and emotional responses. AT was found to fit well the core problems of patients with personality disorders, to offer a specific pathway to more emotional awareness and constructive emotion regulation. The perceived effects give input for further development and research and the development of an assessment tool to examine the efficacy of AT and within clinical practice. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Several national reports and many individuals in the clinical oncology community have defined the adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer population as individuals diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39. However, neuroscience and developmental research have identified important decision-making skills (e.g., information processing, reasoning, emotion regulation) that are not fully developed during adolescence, making general, AYA-focused doctor-patient interaction guidelines potentially questionable for the adolescent cancer population. Most studies include adolescents in samples of pediatric cancer patients or include adolescents in samples of young adult cancer patients, but studies rarely consider adolescent cancer patients as a distinct, developmentally unique group. A systematic literature review was undertaken in October 2014 to begin to understand what is known about the doctor-patient relationship and communication preferences within adolescent oncology. From the 25 included studies, three important conclusions emerged: (1) discrepancies among adolescent patients, parents, and providers about the desired extent of involvement in treatment-related decisions; (2) patient desire for developmentally and culturally appropriate information provision; and (3) the desire and preference for how information is delivered, with recognition that these preferences may change with age. There was some variation in themes by study design, with studies directly observing medical consultations reporting less adolescent involvement in discussions than studies that surveyed doctors. The results of this review support the need for developmentally focused research and clinical guidelines that emphasize the experience of adolescent cancer patients separate from their older and younger counterparts.

AB Cardiac autonomic balance (CAB) indexes the ratio of parasympathetic to sympathetic activation (Berntson, Norman, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2008), and is believed to reflect overall autonomic flexibility in the face of environmental challenges. However, CAB has not been examined in depression. We examined changes in CAB and other physiological variables in 179 youth with a history of juvenile onset depression (JOD) and 161 healthy controls, in response to two psychological (unsolvable puzzle, sad film) and two physical (handgrip, and forehead cold pressor) challenges. In repeated measures analyses, controls showed expected reductions in CAB for both the handgrip and unsolvable puzzle, reflecting a shift to sympathetic relative to parasympathetic activation. By contrast, JOD youth showed increased CAB from baseline for both tasks (p's<.05). No effects were found for the forehead cold pressor or sad film tasks, suggesting that CAB differences may arise under conditions requiring greater attentional control or sustained effort.

AB The impact of a school-based violence prevention program, Second Step, on peer victimization and aggression, and emotion regulation was evaluated among 457 sixth graders. A cluster-randomized trial was conducted with classrooms randomly assigned to intervention (n = 14) or control (n = 14) conditions. A repeated measures analysis of covariance on each measure was conducted using random effects. Several intervention effects were moderated by gender and disability status. Teacher-rated relational victimization at posttest decreased for students with disabilities in intervention but not control classrooms. Students without disabilities in intervention classrooms reported greater decreases from pretest to 6-month follow-up in overt aggression. Boys in the intervention classrooms had smaller increases in teacher-rated overt aggression at posttest than boys in control classrooms. Girls in intervention classrooms reported greater decreases from pretest to 6-month follow-up in relational aggression than girls in control classrooms. Study implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Results of a 3-year randomized clinical trial of Second Step: Student Success Through Prevention (SS-SSTP) Middle School Program on reducing bullying, physical aggression, and peer victimization among students with disabilities are presented. Teachers implemented 41 lessons of a sixth- to eighth-grade curriculum that focused on social-emotional learning (SEL) skills, including empathy, bully prevention, communication skills, and emotion regulation. Two school districts in a larger clinical trial provided disability information. All sixth-grade students (N = 123) with a disability were included in these analyses, including intervention (n = 47) and control (n = 76) conditions. Linear growth models indicated a significant intervention effect for bully perpetration; compared with students in the control condition, intervention students' bullying perpetration scale scores significantly decreased across the 3-year study ( = -.20, 95% confidence interval = [-.38, -.03]). SEL offers promise in reducing bully perpetration among students with disabilities.

AB Background Preterm, and more recently early term, birth has been identified as a risk factor for poor health. Whether the sequelae of late preterm or early term birth extends to poor mental health and well-being in adolescence is unclear and has not been systematically assessed.
   Method Linear regression was used to assess the adjusted associations of gestational age (very/moderate preterm (<34 weeks, n=85), late preterm (34-36 weeks, n=305), early term (37-38 weeks, n=2228), full term (39-40 weeks, n=4018), late term (41 weeks, n=809), post-term (>= 42 weeks, n=213)) with self-reported self-esteem at similar to 11 years (n=6935), parent-reported Rutter score assessing the common emotional and behavioural problems at similar to 7 years (n=6292) and similar to 11 years (n=5596) and self-reported depressive symptoms at similar to 13 years (n=5795) in a population-representative Hong Kong Chinese birth cohort 'Children of 1997' where gestational age has little social patterning.
   Results Very/moderate preterm birth was associated with higher Rutter subscore for hyperactivity (beta coefficients 0.5, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.00) at similar to 7 years but not at similar to 11 years, adjusted for sex, age, socioeconomic position, parents' age at birth, birth order and secondhand smoke exposure. Similarly adjusted, late preterm, early term, late term and post-term birth were not associated with self-esteem or depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions In a population-representative birth cohort from a non-Western-developed setting, gestational age had few associations with mental health and well-being in adolescence, whereas very preterm birth was specifically associated with hyperactivity in childhood. Inconsistencies with studies from Western settings suggest setting specific unmeasured confounding may underlie any observed associations.

AB Objective: Explore psychological functioning in adolescents with a cleft at age 16 from a broad perspective, including cognitive, emotional, behavioral, appearance-related, and psychosocial adjustment. High-risk groups were identified within each area of adjustment to investigate whether vulnerable adolescents were found across domains or whether risk was limited to specific areas of adjustment.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data based on psychological assessments at age 16 (N = 857). The effect of gender, cleft visibility, and the presence of an additional condition were investigated on all outcome variables. Results were compared with large national samples.
   Measures: Hopkins Symptom Checklist, Harter Self-Perception Scale for Adolescents, Child Experience Questionnaire, and Satisfaction With Appearance scale.
   Results: The main factor influencing psychological adjustment across domains was gender, with girls in general reporting more psychological problems, as seen in reference groups. The presence of an additional condition also negatively affected some of the measures. No support was found for cleft visibility as a risk factor except for dissatisfaction with appearance. Correlation analyses of risk groups seem to point to an association between social and emotional risk and between social risk and dissatisfaction with appearance. Associations between other domains were found to be weak.
   Conclusions: The results point to areas of both risk and strength in adolescents born with a cleft lip and/or palate. Future research should investigate how protective factors could counteract potential risk in adolescents with a cleft.

AB Few published studies have reported on the psychological well-being of family members of individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT). Eighty-seven mothers of girls and women with RTT completed a questionnaire survey about their daughters' behavioral phenotype, current health, and behavior problems, and their own and a sibling's well-being. Mothers reported increased anxiety but similar levels of depression when compared to a normative sample. Across all problem domains on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, child and adolescent siblings (n = 39) were reported by mothers to have fewer difficulties than a normative sample. The severity of their daughters' RTT behavioral phenotype predicted increased anxiety and stress for mothers. Increased RTT daughters' current health problems predicted more maternal perceptions of positive gain.

AB This exploratory, qualitative study was designed to be the first stage of an action research project to investigate whether graduates from BSc children's nursing programmes are sufficiently prepared to assess children's emotional health. Early identification of children's and young people's emotional problems is important for timely interventions to be initiated. Data were gathered from a focus group and a series of semi-structured interviews and interpreted using thematic analysis approaches. The findings indicated those interviewed can recognise when a child was emotionally unwell, reporting that assessments were brief, subjective and completed without the use of age-appropriate assessment tools. It is concluded that assessment of a child's emotional health appears to take low priority in comparison to its physical counterpart.

AB In this study, we tested the validity of a dissociative subtype in a sample of 225 detained adolescents (142 boys, 83 girls) likely meeting full or partial criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Competing theories of dissociation pose controversy regarding dissociation as a taxon versus a continuum, and results of the current study contribute to this debate by providing evidence of distinct group differences between those high and low in dissociation. Mixture modeling revealed 2 groups of youth with differing levels of depersonalization/derealization dissociative symptoms. Differences between the 2 groups of youth were investigated regarding trauma exposure and several posttraumatic reactions: posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), emotion dysregulation, and emotional numbing. Compared with youth classified in the low-dissociation group, youth who exhibited high levels of dissociation demonstrated higher levels of total PTSS, posttraumatic symptom clusters of emotional numbing, intrusion, and associated features, as well as reporting more difficulties with emotion dysregulation. To test theory regarding the factors that increase the likelihood of persistent dissociation, bootstrapped regression analyses were performed to examine the possibility of an indirect effect of peritraumatic dissociation. Results consistent with statistical mediation suggested that the presence of peritraumatic dissociation at the time of trauma may contribute to the continuation of dissociative symptoms as a more generalized pattern. The results of the current study have implications for clinical treatment with traumatized youth.

AB The goal of this study was to explore associations between short- and long-term self-regulation and dimensions of oral and coital sexual risk-taking in emerging adulthood. A total of 287 unmarried heterosexual young adults ages 18 to 26 years (62% female; 87% European American; 81% enrolled in college) provided study data via Internet surveys. High levels of long-term self-regulation predicted later initiation of oral sex and coitus, fewer lifetime coital partners, increased likelihood of condom and other contraceptive use at last intercourse, and low composite levels of coital risk. High levels of short-term self-regulation predicted reduced likelihood of condom use and high overall coital risk. The discussion focuses on the interpretation of these effects and potential directions for future research.

AB Objective: Impairments in cognitive emotion regulation (CER) have been linked to functional neural abnormalities and the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of CER in samples with depression. As CER develops in childhood, understanding dysfunctional CER-related alterations in brain function during this period could advance knowledge of the developmental psychopathology of MDD.
   Method: This study tested whether neural activity in brain regions known to support cognitive reappraisal differed between healthy 7- to 15-year-old children and same-age peers with a history of MDD (MDD-ever). A total of 64 children participated in this event-related fMRI study, which used a developmentally appropriate and validated fMRI reappraisal task. Children were instructed to passively view sad or neutral images and to decrease negative emotions using cognitive reappraisal.
   Results: MDD-ever and healthy children showed similar patterns of cortical activation during reappraisal, but with a significant difference found in 1 key CER region, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In addition, individual differences in CER were associated with left IFG activity during reappraisal.
   Conclusion: Alterations in the neurocircuitry of reappraisal are evident in children with a depression history compared to healthy controls. The finding that MDD-ever children showed reappraisal-related neural responses in many regions similar to healthy controls has clinical implications. Findings suggest that identification of alterations in reappraisal in children with remitted depression, for whom much, although not all, of the neural circuitry remains intact, may be an important window of opportunity for intervention.

AB We examined the correspondence between reported reasons and consequences for a specific act of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and their relationship with lifetime NSSI frequency. College students with a history of NSSI (n = 52) indicated reasons for and consequences from their most recent NSSI episode. A match was coded when a reason and its corresponding consequence(s) were both endorsed by the participant. Reasons and consequences were significantly correlated, but their correspondence was not related to lifetime NSSI frequency. Automatic negative reasons explained lifetime NSSI frequency, but consequences and match between reasons and consequences did not. Reported reasons for NSSI may be more important in understanding maintenance of NSSI than either consequences or match.

AB The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is commonly used to assess difficulties recognizing and managing negative affect. Scores on the scale are strongly correlated with measures of psychopathology and are inversely correlated with measures of psychological well-being. Evidence supports the use of the DERS with adolescents and adults; to date, however, few studies have investigated the extent to which the psychometric properties of the DERS are consistent across demographic groups. The overarching goal of the present study was to examine the extent to which the factor structure of the DERS and the reliability and validity of DERS scores are consistent across gender and race in a diverse sample of adults. A total of 1,050 students from a medium-sized, urban university were included in the present study. Participants included 75.6% women and 24.4% men; 42.5% of participants identified as Caucasian, 40.4% as African American, and 17.1% as Asian American. Results showed that the DERS exhibits similar psychometric properties across men and women and all 3 racial groups that were included in this study. As such, the overall scale, as well as the original 6-factor solution of the DERS, can be reliably applied to individuals from the demographic groups investigated in the current study, and results can be interpreted in accordance with those from the preliminary DERS validation sample.

AB This study compares the socio-emotional problems experienced by deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students with those of hearing students in Ethiopia. The research involved a sample of 103 grade 4 students attending a special school for the deaf, a special class for the deaf and a regular school. Socio-emotional problems were measured using Goodman's self-report measure, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for children and adolescents. Participants were selected from seven towns in Ethiopia. The results show that, compared to the hearing sample, the DHH students experienced more severe socio-emotional problems across all dimensions, regardless of whether they were in special classes or special schools. The DHH children reported that socio-emotional difficulties interfered with their home lives, friendships, classroom learning, and ability to get along with the people around them. The DHH students scored higher in the externalising behavioural domains than did the hearing students. There was no statistically significant difference between the DHH students in the special school and special class settings. The results show that DHH children expressed great concern about their socio-emotional difficulties. Teachers and other professionals need to raise their awareness about DHH issues in order to help these children overcome their challenges.

AB The physical manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) can cause chronic pain. This study investigated the impact of pain in youth with NF1 and plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) and its relationship to disease factors, social-emotional functioning, and quality of life (QOL) within a biopsychosocial framework. Caregivers of 59 children and adolescents with NF1 and PNs (6-18 years), and 41 of these youth (10-18 years), completed questionnaires assessing social-emotional functioning and QOL, including an item on pain interference. Measures of disease severity included total PN volume by percent body weight and number of disease complications. Both caregiver (73%) and self-report (59%) ratings indicated that pain interferes with the child's daily functioning despite 33% taking pain medication. Based on care-givers' behavior ratings, more symptoms of anxiety and larger tumor volumes predicted greater pain interference, while greater pain interference, worse depressive symptoms, and more disease complications predicted poorer QOL. As rated by adolescents, more symptoms of anxiety predicted greater pain interference, while greater pain interference and social stress predicted poorer QOL. Further, social-emotional problems mediate the relationship between pain interference and QOL. Thus, pain interferes with daily functioning in the majority of youth with NF1 and PNs even when using pain medication. The impact of pain interference, disease severity, and particularly social-emotional problems on QOL highlights the interaction between physical and psychological states in NF1. Future research and treatment of pain in this population should utilize a biopsychosocial approach and involve multidisciplinary therapies including psychological interventions that target social-emotional functioning.

The study was conducted on a sample of 2,400 adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age. Participants were selected from 20 schools in Western Andalusia. The results showed significant correlations between some of the emotional competencies with self-esteem and life satisfaction. Moreover, two types of relationships were found between these competences related to empathy and emotional intelligence, one at emotional level and another at cognitive level. Furthermore, gender differences were in favor of girls in empathy and emotional attention, whereas boys scored higher on clarity, emotional repair, and self-esteem.

AB Coping research has consistently shown that accommodative coping is positively correlated with individuals' health. Until now, however, there have been little to no studies on the prognostic impact of accommodative coping on health, and only a few studies investigating its buffering effect on the relation between stress and health in childhood and adolescence. Thus, two main research questions were tracked in two longitudinal studies: Study 1 investigated if accommodative coping is indeed a functional resource that longitudinally predicts well-being in a sample of N = 403 adolescents (aged 12-15 years at Wave 1). Study 2 examined the function of accommodative coping under stressful conditions by investigating its buffering effect on the negative impact of school-related stress on well-being in a sample of N = 86 children (aged 9-12 years at Wave 1). Study 1 revealed accommodative coping longitudinally predicting well-being, and, conversely, there was no prediction of well-being through accommodative coping over time. Study 2 revealed a significant moderating effect and gives a first indication that accommodative coping buffers the negative impact of school-related stress on well-being in childhood. The results indicate that accommodation is a functional coping resource in adolescence that diminishes the negative impact of specific stressors. All main and further results are discussed, and implications for further research are given.

AB The purpose of the present article is to compare the individual, peer, family, and school risk and protective factors for both traditional and cyber-bullying victimization. This article draws on data from 673 students from Victoria, Australia, to examine Grade 7 (aged 12-13 years) predictors of traditional and cyber-bullying victimization in Grade 9 (aged 14-15 years). Participants completed a modified version of the Communities That Care youth survey. There were few similarities and important differences in the predictors of traditional and cyber-bullying victimization. For Grade 9 cyber-bullying victimization, in the fully adjusted model, having been a victim of traditional bullying in Grade 7 and emotional control in Grade 7 were predictors. For Grade 9 traditional bullying victimization, predictors were Grade 7 traditional bullying victimization, association with antisocial peers, and family conflict, with family attachment and emotional control marginally statistically significant. The use of evidence-based bullying prevention programs is supported to reduce experiences of both traditional and cyber-bullying victimization, as is the implementation of programs to assist students to regulate their emotions effectively. In addition, traditional bullying victimization may be reduced by addressing association with antisocial friends, family conflict, and bonding to families.

AB Disclosure, or revealing personal information to others, is important for the development and maintenance of close relationships (Jourard, 1971; Rotenberg, 1995). More recently within developmental psychology, however, the focus has been the study of adolescent disclosure to parents as a means of information management regarding their daily activities. This research assumes that a) disclosure between multiple adolescents and parents within the same family are similar, and b) only information transmitted from adolescents to parents is important for adolescent well-being. Thus, this article presents the findings of 2 within-family studies to investigate differences in the amount and social domain (Smetana, 2006; Turiel, 2002) of youth disclosure to mothers versus siblings, and the influence of disclosure to siblings on relationship quality and youth emotional adjustment. Study 1 utilized 101 sibling dyads with youth ranging in age from 11-21 years, but all siblings living together. Study 2 investigated a sample of 58 sibling dyads in which all first-borns were first-year college students and all second-borns were in high school. All participants completed questionnaire measures to assess study variables. Findings revealed that while youth disclosed more to mothers than siblings, this difference disappears by emerging adulthood, particularly depending on the domain of the issue. Additionally, while greater disclosure among siblings was positive for the quality of the relationship, sibling disclosure was differentially associated with emotional adjustment depending on whether youth were the disclosers or being disclosed to, the domain of the issues disclosed, and the gender composition of the dyad.

AB This study tests Common Sense Parenting (CSP)(A (R)), a widely used parent-training program, in its standard form and in a modified form known as CSP Plus, with low-income 8th graders and their families during the high school transition. The six-session CSP program proximally targets parenting and child emotion regulation skills. CSP Plus adds two sessions that include youth, and the eight-session program further targets skills for avoiding negative peers and activities in high school. Over two cohorts, 321 families were enrolled and randomly assigned to either CSP, CSP Plus, or minimal-contact control conditions. To date, pretest and posttest assessments have been completed, with 93 % retention over about a 6-month interval. Here, analyses of preliminary outcomes from pretest to posttest focus on data collected from parents, who represent the primary proximal intervention targets. Intent-to-treat structural equation modeling analyses were conducted. CSP and CSP Plus had statistically significant effects on increased parent-reported child emotion regulation skills. CSP Plus further showed a statistically significant effect on increased parent perceptions of their adolescent being prepared for high school, but only in a model that excluded the CSP condition. Neither program had a significant proximal effect on parenting practices. Emotion regulation, one indicator of self-control, is a robust protective factor against problem behaviors. Intervention effects on this outcome may translate into reduced problems during high school. Moreover, CSP Plus showed some limited signs of added value for preparing families for the high school transition.

AB We studied 1,397 youth undergoing treatment in a multi-program, multiservice agency serving vulnerable youth in both community and residential settings, testing for associations between four indicators of youth's emotional distress dispositions and the frequency of crisis events demanding a crisis response within the first 6 months of youth's participation in a treatment program. We addressed individual and program-level research aims employing a two-level hierarchical model considering both individual and program levels of influence. Results indicated the presence of strong associations for youth's anger control and frustration management issues, a weaker association for anxiety/anxious disposition, and no significant association for irritability/poor self-control problems. Aggregate emotional distress differences for youth in school, probation, wraparound, residential, or community mental health programming contributed little beyond emotional distress differences among individual youth. Consistent with psychological theory, clinically measured emotional distress dispositions prompt significant behavioral disruption for youth in residential placements as well as in community settings, and they can be detected early in treatment for guiding remedial efforts.

AB This study aimed to examine (1) the presentation of binge eating and compensatory weight-control behaviors in a community sample of individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), (2) the relationship of NSSI features and ED symptoms, and (3) the relationship of psychopathology with ED symptoms. Participants with histories of NSSI (n = 118) were recruited from online self-injury forums and completed measures of ED, NSSI, general psychiatric symptoms and borderline personality (BP) symptoms through online questionnaires. Two thirds of the participants (66.1 %) engaged in compensatory weight-control behaviors at least once per week within the past 3 months, 57.6 % engaged in weekly fasting, and 57.6 % engaged in weekly binge eating. Greater versatility and medical severity of NSSI were positively associated with ED symptoms. Furthermore, BP symptoms were positively associated with increased ED symptoms, even after controlling for general psychiatric symptoms. These findings highlight NSSI versatility, NSSI medical severity and BP symptoms as important correlates of increased ED symptoms in individuals who engage in NSSI, and highlight a need to integrate assessment for ED among individuals who engage in NSSI.

AB A subset of children with school refusal also have anxiety disorders. Though the combination of school refusal and anxiety in youth has been associated with a host of poor outcomes (Epstein and Sheldon in J Educ Res 95:308-318, 2002. doi:10.1080/00220670209596604; Birmaher et al. in Pediatr Clin North Am 45:1187-1204, 1998. doi:10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70069-9), little is known about youth with anxiety disorders who exhibit school reluctance. Youth with school refusal actually miss school, whereas youth who are school reluctant may want to avoid school but do attend. It is important to consider emotional and social functioning in youth with school reluctance, given that school reluctance may be common among anxious youth. Additionally, school reluctant youth may still exhibit significantly greater distress despite their school attendance than non-school reluctant youth. This study examined associations among school reluctance, somatic problems, social and emotional functioning, and anxiety severity in a sample of youth diagnosed with one or more anxiety disorders. Based on child self-report, school reluctant (SR) children exhibit greater loneliness and negative affect than their non-school reluctant (NSR) peers. Clinicians rated SR children as having greater anxiety severity than NSR children based on semi-structured interviews administered to each child. Additionally, SR children have greater somatic problems than NSR children according to parent-report. Results of this study suggest the need for parents, teachers, and clinicians to work together in the treatment of school reluctance in children with anxiety disorders.

AB Positive mental health and well-being for school-aged children have become key areas of research, with studies that show school climate and physical activity as being potentially modifiable correlates of these outcomes. As such, the purpose of this study was to examine the role school climate and physical activity play in the well-being and emotional problems of younger (elementary) and older (secondary) students. Using data obtained from the 2009/2010 administration of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, this study plotted the combined and independent roles of school climate and physical activity in the perceived emotional well-being and emotional problems of adolescents across Canada (N = similar to 26,000 students, Grades 6-10). We ran a series of regressions to assess both the independent and combined influences of physical activity and school climate on (1) emotional well-being and (2) emotional problems. Our findings suggest that (1) there is no significant effect of grade, (2) for emotional well-being, both physical activity and school climate contribute significantly and relatively equally and independently, (3) for emotional problems, physical activity and school climate have independent but differential contributions, (4) physical activity and school climate are more predictive of emotional well-being than of emotional problems. In conclusion, school climate and physical activity are potentially modifiable factors for school settings and could potentially be targeted to facilitate emotional well-being and reduce emotional problems in young people.

AB This study aimed to identify neuroimaging measures associated with risk for, or protection against, bipolar disorder by comparing youth offspring of parents with bipolar disorder versus youth offspring of non-bipolar parents versus offspring of healthy parents in (i) the magnitude of activation within emotional face processing circuitry; and (ii) functional connectivity between this circuitry and frontal emotion regulation regions. The study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre. Participants included 29 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (mean age = 13.8 years; 14 females), 29 offspring of non-bipolar parents (mean age = 13.8 years; 12 females) and 23 healthy controls (mean age = 13.7 years; 11 females). Participants were scanned during implicit processing of emerging happy, sad, fearful and angry faces and shapes. The activation analyses revealed greater right amygdala activation to emotional faces versus shapes in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder and offspring of non-bipolar parents than healthy controls. Given that abnormally increased amygdala activation during emotion processing characterized offspring of both patient groups, and that abnormally increased amygdala activation has often been reported in individuals with already developed bipolar disorder and those with major depressive disorder, these neuroimaging findings may represent markers of increased risk for affective disorders in general. The analysis of psychophysiological interaction revealed that offspring of parents with bipolar disorder showed significantly more negative right amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity to emotional faces versus shapes, but significantly more positive right amygdala-left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity to happy faces (all P-values corrected for multiple tests) than offspring of non-bipolar parents and healthy controls. Taken together with findings of increased amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, and decreased amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity previously shown in individuals with bipolar disorder, these connectivity patterns in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder may be risk markers for, rather than markers conferring protection against, bipolar disorder in youth. The patterns of activation and functional connectivity remained unchanged after removing medicated participants and those with current psychopathology from analyses. This is the first study to demonstrate that abnormal functional connectivity patterns within face emotion processing circuitry distinguish offspring of parents with bipolar disorder from those of non-bipolar parents and healthy controls.

AB Although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been linked to emotion dysregulation, few studies have experimentally investigated this whilst controlling for the effects of comorbid conduct disorder (CD). Economic decision-making games that assess how individuals respond to offers varying in fairness have been used to study emotion regulation. The present study compared adolescent boys with ADHD (n = 90), ADHD + CD (n = 94) and typical controls (n = 47) on the Ultimatum Game and examined the contribution of ADHD and CD symptom scores and callous and unemotional traits to acceptance levels of unfair offers. There were no significant differences in acceptance rates of fair and highly unfair offers between groups, and only boys with ADHD did not significantly differ from the controls. However, the subgroup of boys with ADHD and additional high levels of aggressive CD symptoms rejected significantly more ambiguous (i.e., moderately unfair) offers than any other subgroup, suggesting impaired emotion regulation in those with ADHD and aggressive CD. Correlations within the CD group showed that the rejection rate to moderately unfair offers was predicted by aggressive CD symptom severity, but not callous and unemotional traits. These findings highlight the fact that ADHD is a heterogeneous condition from an emotion regulation point of view.

   ANXIETY; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; VICTIMIZATION
AB Background
   Studies have shown that maternal depression during pregnancy predicts offspring depression in adolescence. Child maltreatment is also a risk factor for depression.
   Aims
   To investigate (a) whether there is an association between offspring exposure to maternal depression in pregnancy and depression in early adulthood, and (b) whether offspring child maltreatment mediates this association.
   Method
   Prospectively collected data on maternal clinical depression in pregnancy, offspring child maltreatment and offspring adulthood (18-25 years) DSM-IV depression were analysed in 103 mother-offspring dyads of the South London Child Development Study.
   Results
   Adult offspring exposed to maternal depression in pregnancy were 3.4 times more likely to have a DSM-IV depressive disorder, and 2.4 times more likely to have experienced child maltreatment, compared with non-exposed offspring. Path analysis revealed that offspring experience of child maltreatment mediated the association between exposure to maternal depression in pregnancy and depression in adulthood.
   Conclusions
   Maternal depression in pregnancy is a. key vulnerability factor for offspring depression in early adulthood.

AB Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience impairments in a number of functional domains. Although current evidence-based treatments for ADHD reduce symptoms and improve academic and behavioral functioning, they have minimal impact on social functioning or on risky behaviors (see Evans et al. in J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol, 43:527-551, 2014 for review). Preliminary evidence indicates that emotion dysregulation (ED) is associated with impairments across the developmental spectrum, such as social impairment and risky behaviors, and that its relative absence/presence is differentially associated with treatment response. It thus stands to reason that by incorporating a focus on ED in interventions targeting social impairment and risky behaviors, we may be able to increase the number of youth who respond to such interventions and decrease the prevalence or degree of these impairments and behaviors among youth and adults with ADHD. However, a number of questions remain unaddressed about the association between ADHD and ED, such as the portion of individuals with ADHD who experience ED, the extent to which ED is associated with the above impairments and behaviors, and whether or not ED is malleable. To begin addressing these questions, we summarize and critically evaluate the literature on the association between ADHD and ED and make recommendations for future basic, translational, and treatment outcome research.

AB Mindfulness training is increasingly being introduced in schools, yet studies examining its impact on the developing brain have been scarce. A neurodevelopmental perspective on mindfulness has been advocated as a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of underlying neurocognitive changes that have implications for developmental well-being research and the implementation of mindfulness in education. To stimulate more research in the developmental cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness, this article outlines possible indexes of mindfulness-based change in adolescence, with a focus on event-related brain potential (ERP) markers. We provide methodological recommendations for future studies and offer examples of research paradigms. We also discuss how mindfulness practice could impact on the development of prefrontal brain structures and enhance attention control and emotion regulation skills in adolescents, impacting in turn on their self-regulation and coping skills. We highlight advantages of the ERP methodology in neurodevelopmental research of mindfulness. It is proposed that research using established experimental tasks targeting ERP components such as the contingent negative variability, N200, error-related negativity and error positivity, P300, and late positive potential could elucidate developmentally salient shifts in the neural plasticity of the adolescent brain induced by mindfulness practice.

AB We examined psychopathology-neuroendocrine associations in relation to the transition into adolescence within a developmental framework that acknowledged the interdependence of the HPA and HPG hormone systems in the regulation of responses to everyday affective contexts. Saliva samples were collected during anxiety and anger inductions from 51 young adolescents (M13.47, SD=.60 years) to evaluate cortisol, DHEA, and testosterone responses. Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at pre-adolescence (M=9.27, SD=.58 years) while youths were in elementary school and concurrently with hormones in early adolescence. Externalizing problems from elementary school predicted adolescents' reduced DHEA reactivity during anxiety induction. Follow up analyses simultaneously examining the contributions of elementary school and adolescent problems showed a trend suggesting that youths with higher levels of internalizing problems during elementary school eventuated in a profile of heightened DHEA reactivity as adolescents undergoing anxiety induction. For both the anxiety and the anger inductions, it was normative for DHEA and testosterone to be positively coupled. Adolescents with high externalizing problems but low internalizing problems marshaled dual axes co-activation during anger induction in the form of positive cortisol-testosterone coupling. This is some of the first evidence suggesting affective context determines whether dual axes coupling is reflective of normative or problematic functioning in adolescence.

ID ADJUSTMENT; STRATEGIES; VALIDITY; MOOD
AB Introduction. The aim of the present research is to experimentally assess the effects of a videogame program (Spock) in order to improve emotional intelligence (EI) as an ability among a sample of adolescents.
   Method. The sample has been made up of 92 adolescents, aged 17 to 19, who are currently studying the second year of Bachillerato. The instrument used has been the following: Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). The study used a quasi-experimental design, a design of pre-test / post-test repeated measurements with a control group. In order to assess the effect of the program, descriptive analyses (average and standard deviations) and variance analyses (ANOVAs) were carried out by the adolescents assigned to the experimental and control condition in the pre-test stage. In the second place, descriptive and covariance analyses of the post-test scoring were carried out (ANCOVAs post-test covarying the pre-test), which allows to demonstrate the impact of the program. Moreover, the effect size was reckoned (d of Cohen).
   Results. The results of the ANCOVAs post-tests (covarying the pre-test differences) in the variables of emotional intelligence as an ability which were under study in the experimental and control condition confirm statistically-significant differences in the global scoring of emotional intelligence as an ability, in the variable of emotional perception, emotional facilitation and emotional regulation. On the other hand, the results of the ANCOVA post-test show that the change stimulated by the program was similar in both sexes. However, the results obtained in the ANCOVAs post-tests confirm statistically-significant differences in favor of male participants in their global scoring of emotional intelligence as an ability.
   Discussion. The study provides an effective intervention tool which has been experimentally validated. The overall results allow for emphasizing the importance of the implementation of programs aimed at encouraging EI as an ability throughout adolescence.

AB Background: In the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as well as in most armies throughout the world, the leading cause of death during peace-time is suicide. This study examines emotional regulation of mental pain as a contributor to suicidal ideation in soldiers.
   Methods: One hundred sixty-eight IDF soldiers (aged 18-21 years, 59% males) completed the following self-report questionnaires: Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI); Orbach & Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale (OMMP); and Emotional Regulation of Mental Pain questionnaire. Participants were divided into 3 groups: soldiers who attempted suicide (AS group, n = 58), soldiers under treatment by a mental health professional and reporting no suicidal behavior (PT group, n = 58), and controls (C group, n = 50).
   Results: Suicide ideation, mental pain, and low emotional regulation were significantly higher in the suicidal group as compared to the two other groups (P < 0.001). Mental pain was significantly related to more suicide ideation in soldiers with low ability to regulate mental pain (P < .001 for the interaction).
   Conclusion: Emotional regulation of mental pain moderates the link between mental pain and suicide ideation. Soldiers with high mental pain and low regulation of mental pain exhibited higher suicidal ideation. These findings may assist in planning prevention programs in the army and similar settings.

AB BackgroundPreschool hyperactivity is an early risk factor for adult mental health problems and criminality. Little is known about; (a) the patterns of long-term service costs associated with this behavioural marker in the general population and (b) the specific factors predicting hyperactivity-related costs. We undertook a prospective study investigating associations between preschool hyperactivity and average individual annual service costs up to late adolescent and young adulthood.
   MethodsOne-hundred and seventy individuals rated as hyperactive by their parents and 88 nonhyperactive controls were identified from a community sample of 4,215 three years olds. Baseline information about behaviour/emotional problems and background characteristics were collected. At follow-up (when individuals were aged between 14 and 25years) information was obtained on service use, and associated costs since the age of three. Based on this information we calculated the average cost per annum incurred by each individual.
   ResultsCompared to controls, preschoolers with hyperactivity had 17.6 times higher average costs per annum across domains (apart from nonmental health costs). These were 562 for each hyperactive individual compared with 30 pound for controls. Average annual costs decreased as a function of age, with higher costs incurred at younger ages. The effects of hyperactivity remained significant when other baseline factors were added to the model. Effects were fully mediated by later psychiatric morbidity. When the hyperactive group were examined separately, costs were consistently predicted by male gender and, for some cost codes, by conduct problems.
   ConclusionsPreventative approaches targeting early hyperactivity may be of value. Services should be targeted towards high-risk individuals with careful consideration given to the cost-to-benefit trade-off of early intervention strategies.

AB In clinical child psychology, co-morbidity is the norm rather than exception. Single disorder manuals are limited in their scope and applicability to patients with several presenting problems. Emotion dysregulation and perfectionism are two salient pathways to various internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders in youth. In order to treat these children efficiently and effectively, psychotherapists must be equipped with an approach that is able to target these common corridors to psychopathology. Transdiagnostic modular cognitive behavioral procedures are matched to the individual patients' contexts. The article begins with a brief discussion of emotional regulation, perfectionism, and transdiagnostic modular cognitive behavior therapy. Three confabulated clinical case examples are presented to illustrate the case conceptualization process and the application of modular CBT.

AB Objective: The strong associations between child maltreatment and psychopathology have generated interest in identifying neurodevelopmental processes that are disrupted following maltreatment. Previous research has focused largely on neural response to negative facial emotion. We determined whether child maltreatment was. associated with neural responses during passive viewing of negative and positive emotional stimuli and effortful attempts to regulate emotional responses.
   Method: A total of 42 adolescents aged 13 to 19 years, half with exposure to physical and/or sexual abuse, participated. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response was measured during passive viewing of negative and positive emotional stimuli and attempts to modulate emotional responses using cognitive reappraisal.
   Results: Maltreated adolescents exhibited heightened response in multiple nodes of the salience network, including amygdala, putamen, and anterior insula, to negative relative to neutral stimuli. During attempts to decrease responses to negative stimuli relative to passive viewing, maltreatment was associated with greater recruitment of superior frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and frontal pole; adolescents with and without maltreatment down-regulated amygdala response to a similar degree. No associations were observed between maltreatment and neural response to positive emotional stimuli during passive viewing or effortful regulation.
   Conclusion: Child maltreatment heightens the salience of negative emotional stimuli. Although maltreated adolescents modulate amygdala responses to negative cues to a degree similar to that of non-maltreated youths, they use regions involved in effortful control to a greater degree to do so, potentially because greater effort is required to modulate heightened amygdala responses. These findings are promising, given the centrality of cognitive restructuring in trauma-focused treatments for children.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is characterized by excessive daydreaming, mental confusion, slowness, and low motivation. Several teacher-and parent-report measures of SCT have recently been developed but a child self-report measure of SCT does not yet exist despite clear links between SCT and internalizing psychopathology (for which self-report is often desired). This study examined the initial reliability and validity of the Child Concentration Inventory (CCI), a child self-report measure of SCT symptoms, in a school-based sample of 124 children (ages 8-13; 55% female). Children completed the CCI and measures of academic/social functioning, emotion regulation, and self-esteem. Teachers completed measures of psychopathology symptoms (including SCT) and academic/social functioning. Although exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) supported a 3-factor model of the CCI (consisting of slow, sleepy, and daydreamer scales closely resembling the factor structure of the parent-report version of this measure), bifactor modeling and omega reliability indices indicated that the CCI is best conceptualized as unidimensional. CCI scores were significantly correlated with teacher-rated SCT and were statistically distinct from teacher-rated ADHD and child-rated anxiety/depression. After controlling for sex, grade, and other psychopathology symptoms, the CCI total score was significantly associated with poorer child-reported academic/social functioning and self-worth in addition to increased loneliness and emotion dysregulation. Child ratings on the CCI were moderately to strongly correlated with poorer teacher-rated academic/social functioning but these associations were reduced to nonsignificance after controlling for demographics and other psychopathology symptoms. Findings provide preliminary support for the CCI, and future directions include replication with adolescents and clinical samples in order to further examine the CCI's factor structure, reliability, validity, and clinical utility.

AB Traumatic events such as abuse, bullying, and exposure to violence are commonplace among typically developing children and occur at least as often among those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children with ASD are vulnerable to traumatization due to their deficits in social communication and emotion regulation. Research on posttraumatic symptoms among children with ASD is reviewed. Bullying has received much attention while there is a paucity of research on other types of trauma. Anxiety, social isolation, and developmental regression are associated with trauma. Further research is needed to clarify the symptom presentation and frequency of PTSD. Sensitive self-report measures are needed as well as validation of existing measures for assessing trauma in this population.

AB The literature underlines that lesbian mother and gay father families are similar to those with heterosexual parents, regarding family functioning, dyadic satisfaction, and child development. This paper compares 40 same-sex families and 40 heterosexual parents in the Italian context. In Italy, it is impossible for same-sex couples or single lesbians and gay men to adopt a child, become married, or enter civil partnerships. The participants were administered self-reports, in order to investigate the dyadic relationships, family functioning, and emotional and social adjustment of their children. Lesbian and gay parents reported higher levels of dyadic adjustment, flexibility, and communication in their family than heterosexual parents. Data from the present study demonstrated that children raised by lesbian and gay parents showed a similar level of emotion regulation and psychological well-being than children raised by heterosexual parents. In Italy, negative attitudes towards same-sex families persist, and educational programs should be developed to deconstruct stereotypes regarding gay and lesbian parent families. These results have important implications in both clinical and social fields.

AB This study used functional MRI (fMRI) to examine a novel aspect of emotion regulation in adolescent development: whether age predicts differences in both the concurrent and lasting effects of emotion regulation on amygdala response. In the first, active regulation, phase of the testing session, fMRI data were collected while 56 healthy individuals (age range: 10.50-22.92years) reappraised aversive stimuli so as to diminish negative responses to them. After a short delay, the second, re-presentation, phase involved passively viewing the aversive images from the reappraisal task. During active regulation, older individuals showed greater drops in negative affect and inverse rostrolateral prefrontal-amygdala connectivity. During re-presentation, older individuals continued to show lasting reductions in the amygdala response to aversive stimuli they had previously reappraised, an effect mediated by rostrolateral PFC. These data suggest that one source of heightened emotionality in adolescence is a diminished ability to cognitively down-regulate aversive reactions.

ID CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; FIT INDEXES
AB Korean middle school students are experiencing high rates of behavioral and emotional problems, suggesting a need for comprehensive screening instruments with strong psychometric properties in school settings. The present study investigated the utility of the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 Self-Report of Personality, Adolescent Form (BASC-2 SRP-A) to assess clinical problems and adaptive strengths among Korean middle school students. For this revalidation study of the BASC-2, we first translated the BASC-2 SRP-A into Korean (K-BASC-2 SRP-A). Then, using a total of 458 Korean middle school students aged 12 to 15 years, we examined the factor structure and reliability of the clinical, adaptive, and composite scale scores of the K-BASC-2 SRP-A. We also used a separate sample of 45 middle school students to examine the convergent validity of a subset of the K-BASC-2 SRP-A scales targeting the common problem areas of anxiety, depression, and inattention. Based on the current results, we found strong psychometric properties of the K-BASC-2 SRP-A for use among adolescents in Korea, including a well-fitting factor structure consistent with the originally proposed model, adequate reliability estimates, and validity coefficients falling in the acceptable range. The K-BASC-2 SRP-A can offer the Korean school mental health field a useful and much-needed multidimensional screening measure for middle school youths.

AB Despite the growing study of adolescents' emotion regulation (ER) and its importance for developmental trajectories, research has focused mainly on psychopathology by contrast with positive functioning. The lack of adequate age measures on emotion regulation has been also largely recognized. The present study aims to explore psychometric properties and construct validity of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA) (Gullone and Taffe, 2012) in a sample of 809 Portuguese adolescents. The Portuguese version (QRE-CA) showed adequate reliability and the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis presented a good fit confirming the two-factor model found by Gullone and Taffe (2012). Measurement invariance tests showed intergroup invariance for gender and school grade. Additionally, convergent validity showed positive associations between the reappraisal strategy and measures of positive psychological functioning (self-esteem and satisfaction with life). The suppression strategy presented negative associations with those same variables.
   Findings suggest that the QRE-CA is a valid and reliable measure for evaluating strategies of ER. Final considerations highlight the importance of extending research on adolescents' emotion regulation and positive functioning.

AB Background: Substantial evidence that some modifiable parental factors are associated with childhood depression and anxiety indicates that parents can play a crucial role in the prevention of these disorders in theft children. However, more effective translation of research evidence is required.
   Methods: This study employed the Delphi methodology to establish expert consensus on parenting literature search identified 289 recommendations for parents. These were presented to a panel 0144 international experts over three survey rounds, who rated theft preventive importance.
   Results: 171 strategies were endorsed as important or essential for preventing childhood depression or anxiety disorders by >= 90%), of the panel. These were written into a parenting guidelines document, with 11 subheadings: Establish and maintain a good relationship with your child. Be involved and support increasing autonomy, Encourage supportive relationships. Establish family rules and consequences, Encourage good health habits, Minimise conflict in the home, Help your child to manage emotions. Help your child to set goals and solve problems, Support your child when something is bothering them. Help your child to manage anxiety, and Encourage professional help seeking when needed.
   Limitations: This study relied on experts from Western countries; hence the strategies identified may not be relevant for all ethnic groups.
   Conclusions: This study produced new parenting guidelines that are supported by research evidence and/or international experts, which can now be promoted in Western English-speaking communities to help parents protect their children from depression and anxiety disorders.

AB The aim of this study was to examine insomnia symptoms, behavioral problems, and suicidality among adolescents of insomniac parents (IP) and non-insomniac parents (NIP). A family survey of sleep and health was conducted among 1090 adolescents and their parents in Jinan, China. Adolescents completed a sleep and health questionnaire to report their sleep and mental health problems. Parents reported their insomnia symptoms and history of mental disorders. Insomnia, behavioral problems, and suicidal behavior were compared between IP adolescents and NIP adolescents. IP adolescents were more likely than NIP adolescents to report insomnia symptoms, use of sleep medication, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt. IP adolescents scored significantly higher than NIP adolescents on withdrawn and externalizing behavioral problems. After adjustment for demographics and behavioral problems, parental insomnia remained to be significantly associated with adolescent suicidal ideation and suicide plan. Our findings support the need for early screening and formal assessment of sleep and mental health in adolescents of insomniac parents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined associations between relationship difficulties with parents and peers and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Particular emphasis was placed on examining mediating pathways through emotion dysregulation, as per commonly accepted theory. Participants were 1153 university students (905 females; M-age=19.35 years, S.D.=1A9); 79 of these participants had engaged in NSSI during the previous 6 months (63 females, M-age=19.35 years, S.D.=1.51). Participants completed questionnaires assessing NSSI, quality of relationships with parents and peers, and emotion dysregulation. Hierarchical logistic regressions suggest that the quality of parent child relationships has a greater impact on the prediction of NSSI engagement than the quality of peer relationships. Results of a structural equation model showed that feelings of alienation in both parent and peer relationships had indirect effects on NSSI through deficits in emotion regulation (ER). Results suggest the importance of examining emotion dysregulation in association with NSSI, and that both parent and peer relationships are implicated in NSSI engagement through emotion regulation deficits. Important clinical implications regarding the need to acknowledge both emotion dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties when treating NSSI in young adults are discussed.

AB Although the Internet is an important tool in our daily life, the control of Internet use is necessary to address difficult problems. This study set out with the aim of assessing the cognitive control of affective events in Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and has examined the influence of IGD on neural activities with regard to swear words in young adolescents. We demonstrated the differences between adolescents with IGD and healthy control adolescents (HC) with respect to swear, negative and neutral word conditions. Swear words induced more activation in regions related to social interaction and emotional processing such as the superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) when compared with negative words. In this study, adolescents with IGD exhibited reduced activation in the right OFC related to cognitive control and in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) related to social rejection during the swear word condition. In addition, adolescents with IGD were negatively correlated with activity in the right amygdala toward swear words, indicating the important role of the amygdala in the control of aggression in adolescents with IGD. These findings enhance our understanding of social-emotional perception in adolescents with IGD.

ID EMOTION REGULATION; SUICIDE; IDEATION; OPTIMISM; HARM
AB Background: Conducting psychological research with adolescents is imperative for better understanding, prevention and treatment of mental illness. However there is concern that research addressing topics such as mental illness, substance use and suicidality has potential to distress participants, particularly youth.
   Method: We administered a questionnaire to 1973 adolescents (13-18 years) at two time points, one year apart. Participants responded to items regarding nonsuicidal self-injury, psychological distress, history of physical and/or sexual abuse, adverse life events, alcohol use, suicidal behaviour, self-efficacy, and coping skills as well as two open-ended questions regarding whether they enjoyed participating in the research and whether participation worried or upset them.
   Results: Most youth (74 %) enjoyed participation and cited altruistic reasons and a greater self-awareness as reasons. Those reporting being upset by the questionnaire (15 %) reported poorer psychological functioning than their peers. Youth who were upset by their participation at baseline, but who reported enjoying the questionnaire at follow-up reported improved psychosocial functioning over time, while the reverse was true for those who initially enjoyed participation but later reported the questionnaire upset them.
   Conclusions: Results suggest researchers acknowledge benefits for young people who participate in research, but also be mindful of the potential for distress among the most at risk youth.

AB Background: An increasing number of young people have made contact with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). However, only a small proportion of the population with emotional problems, actually seek specialized care. Research concerning the help-seeking process and pathways to care of a clinical sample could help to develop effective health policies to facilitate access to specialized care.
   Aim: To analyze the access pattern for CAMHS, reasons of contact and care pathways of a consecutive sample of first-time patients. Our aim was to analyze the association between source of referral, socio-demographic and clinical variables.
   Methods: Standardized assessment instruments and information concerning access patterns and care pathways were collected from 399 patients at first-time contact with CAMHS in a Northern Italian Region.
   Results: Most patients were referred to CAMHS by school teachers (36 %) or health professionals (32 %), while only 17 % of the parents sought help by themselves. School issues (50 %) and emotional problems (17 %) were the most frequent reasons for contact. The proportion of first-time contacts with no diagnosis of mental disorder at their first consultation did not differ by source of referral. Parents of children who did not receive a clinical diagnosis of mental disorders described them as "psychosocially impaired" and their condition as "clinically severe" likewise parents of patients who received a psychiatric diagnosis. Patients with externalizing problems were more frequently referred by the parents themselves, while youth with internalizing problems were more often referred through health professionals. Families with non-traditional structures (adoptive, foster care, mono-parental) were more likely to consult CAMHS directly, while immigrant youth were more often referred by teachers.
   Conclusion: Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics can affect pathways to care. To improve early access to care for children and adolescents with ongoing mental disorders, a plan for proper action addressed to teachers and health professionals may well be important. This would improve their ability to recognize emotional and behavioral problems and use proper referral pathways, while informative intervention addressed to non-Italian families should inform them about the functioning and the mission of CAMHS.

AB Adolescence encompasses a sensitive developmental period of enhanced clinical vulnerability to nicotine, tobacco, and e-cigarettes. While there are sociocultural influences, data at preclinical and clinical levels indicate that this adolescent sensitivity has strong neurobiological underpinnings. Although definitions of adolescence vary, the hallmark of this period is a profound reorganization of brain regions necessary for mature cognitive and executive function, working memory, reward processing, emotional regulation, and motivated behavior. Regulating critical facets of brain maturation are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). However, perturbations of cholinergic systems during this time with nicotine, via tobacco or e-cigarettes, have unique consequences on adolescent development. In this review, we highlight recent clinical and preclinical data examining the adolescent brain's distinct neurobiology and unique sensitivity to nicotine. First, we discuss what defines adolescence before reviewing normative structural and neurochemical alterations that persist until early adulthood, with an emphasis on dopaminergic systems. We review how acute exposure to nicotine impacts brain development and how drug responses differ from those seen in adults. Finally, we discuss the persistent alterations in neuronal signaling and cognitive function that result from chronic nicotine exposure, while highlighting a low dose, semi-chronic exposure paradigm that may better model adolescent tobacco use. We argue that nicotine exposure, increasingly occurring as a result of e-cigarette use, may induce epigenetic changes that sensitize the brain to other drugs and prime it for future substance abuse.

First, we will outline the crucial developmental changes in the attachment system and discuss how they might be related to the early onset of the disease. Then we will report on the major results from attachment studies using self-report and narrative instruments in that age group. Studies with a developmental approach on attachment will be analyzed in more detail. The high incidence of the unresolved attachment pattern in eating disorder samples is striking, especially for patients with anorexia nervosa. Interestingly, this predominance of the unresolved category was also found in their mothers. To date, these transgenerational aspects are still poorly understood and therefore represent an exciting research frontier. Future studies that include larger adolescent samples and provide a more detailed description including symptom severity and comorbidity would contribute to a better understanding of this complex and painful condition.

TI Psychosocial and Neurocognitive Outcomes in Adult Survivors of
   Adolescent and Early Young Adult Cancer: A Report From the Childhood
   Cancer Survivor Study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; BRAIN; CHILDREN; PUBERTY; COHORT; RISK
AB Purpose
   To characterize psychological and neurocognitive function in long-term cancer survivors diagnosed during adolescence and early young adulthood (AeYA).
   Methods
   Six thousand one hundred ninety-two survivors and 390 siblings in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and a Neurocognitive Questionnaire. Treatment and demographic predictors were examined, and associations with social attainment (employment, education, and living independently) were evaluated. Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs.
   Results
   Among survivors, 2,589 were diagnosed when AeYA (11 to 21 years old). Adjusted for current age and sex, these survivors, compared with siblings, self-reported higher rates of depression (11.7% v 8.0%, respectively; OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.30) and anxiety (7.4% v 4.4%, respectively; OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.43) and more problems with task efficiency (17.2% v 10.8%, respectively; OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.43), emotional regulation (19.1% v 14.1%, respectively; OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.40), and memory (25.9% v 19.0%, respectively; OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.89). Few differences were noted between survivors diagnosed with leukemia or CNS tumor before 11 years old versus during later adolescence, although those diagnosed with lymphoma or sarcoma during AeYA were at reduced risk for self-reported psychosocial and neurocognitive problems. Unemployment was associated with self-reports of impaired task efficiency (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.28 to 3.77), somatization (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.77 to 2.98), and depression (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.43 to 2.63).
   Conclusion
   We demonstrated that risk for poor functional outcome is not limited to survivors' diagnoses in early childhood. AeYA is a critical period of development, and cancer during this period can impact neurocognitive and emotional function and disrupt vocational attainment.

AB In ultra-rapid categorization studies, population-level reaction time differences in performance are consistently reported. In a previous study, we replicated these findings and also observed consistent gender differences in young adults (18-24 years old). We now tested a group of adolescents (11-16 years old) on the same ultra-rapid categorization tasks. Results indicated that age had a significant impact on categorization performance. Although women outperformed men during adulthood, this effect reversed in adolescence (boys faster than girls). This gender x age interaction for categorizing meaningful (non-)social visual scenes could be caused by gender-specific development processes underlying emotion regulation strategies and/or context sensitivity.

AB Existing randomized controlled trials of family therapy for treatment of bulimia nervosa in adolescence highlight the need for further development of treatments. This article describes the development of multi-family treatment for bulimia nervosa in adolescents aged 13-18. It outlines the theory guiding this development, the areas of need identified by previous studies, and the treatment that has been designed to meet these needs. Particular attention is given to the need to increase communication between family members, strategies to reduce high levels of criticism or hostility, and skills to manage emotion dysregulation and low tolerance for negative emotions. To these ends the program draws on the multi-family treatment for anorexia nervosa, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, and dialectical behavior therapy.

AB Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and family-based treatment (FBT) are two evidence-based interventions that have been applied in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN) in adolescents. While DBT focuses on providing skills for coping with emotion dysregulation that often co-occurs with BN, FBT targets the normalization of eating patterns. The purpose of the current article is to introduce an integration of both treatments to provide a more comprehensive approach that targets the full scope of the disorder. We provide a review of the conceptual similarities and differences between FBT-BN and DBT along with strategies to guide a blended treatment approach. Given the strengths and limitations of either independent treatment, DBT and FBT-BN complement one another and together can address the range of symptoms and behaviors typically seen in adolescent BN.

AB Adolescent bulimia nervosa (BN) remains relatively understudied, and the complex interaction between core eating psychopathology and emotional regulation difficulties provides ongoing challenges for full symptom remission. In an open pilot trial, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of a program integrating family-based treatment (FBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating adolescent BN, without exclusion criteria. Participants were 35 adolescents who underwent partial hospital treatment for BN, and outcomes included measures of core BN pathology and emotional regulation difficulties, as well as parental measures of self-efficacy, completed at intake and discharge. Results indicate significant improvements in overall eating disorder pathology, t(68) = 4.52, p = .002, and in core BN symptoms, including objective binge episodes, t(68) = 2.01, p = .041, and self-induced vomiting, t(68) = 2.90, p = .005. Results also illustrated a significant increase in parental efficacy throughout the course of treatment, t(20) = .081, p = .001, although no global improvement in difficulties in emotion regulation was noted, t(68) = 1.12, p = .285. These preliminary findings support the utility of this integration of FBT and DBT, although raise interesting questions as to the mechanism of symptom remission.

ID FOCUSED THERAPY; DISORDER; CHILDREN
AB A significant proportion of both healthy and treatment-seeking youth report eating for emotional reasons. Emotional eating (EE) is associated with medical and psychological sequelae including overeating and eating disorder symptoms. Youth with EE are thought to have a predisposition toward a high level of emotional sensitivity, with a tendency to experience emotions intensely, and for a long duration. Interventions are needed to address emotion dysregulation associated with EE. Parent-focused interventions that emphasize training parents to respond to emotion dysregulation in their children have the potential to reduce the incidence of EE. This article describes an emotion-focused parent training intervention for youth who engage in EE.

AB Stable tendency to perseverative thoughts such as trait rumination and worry can influence somatic health. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between perseverative thoughts and somatic complaints, and the possible mediating effects of perceived stress, negative and positive affectivity in adolescence. Having an acute or a chronic condition was also assessed to be controlled for and to reveal their effects on symptom reporting. Three hundred and six adolescents from 7th to 12th grade with mean age of 16.33 (SD=1.29) participated in the study. Mediation analysis suggested that impact of trait-like perseverative thoughts on complaints were mediated by perceived stress and negative affectivity. Having an acute condition had also an effect on symptom reporting through increased negative affectivity. Our results highlight that ruminations or worry as stable intrapersonal characteristics are relevant processes in health and can be potential targets in prevention programmes in adolescence.

   CHILDHOOD; PARENTS; SCALES; MODEL
AB Background. Adolescence represents a challenging transitional period where changes in biological, emotional, cognitive and social domains can increase the risk of developing internalised problems including subthreshold depression. Adolescent-parent attachment style, perceived support and family functioning may increase risk for depressive symptoms or may reduce such risk. Adolescent-parent attachment, adolescent-perceived support from parents and family functioning were examined as correlates of depressive symptom presentation within this age group.
   Methods. Participants included a maternal parent and an adolescent (65.5% female) from each family. Adolescents were in Grade 7 (n=175) or Grade 10 (n=31). Data were collected through home interviews. The Self-Report of Family Inventory (SFI), Experiences of Close Relationships Scale (ECR), Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used to assess depression, parental support and attachment.
   Results. Two models were examined: one with adolescent report of depressive symptoms as the outcome and a second with parent report of adolescent internalising symptoms as the outcome. The model predicting adolescent-reported depressive symptoms was significant with older age, higher levels of avoidant attachment, and higher levels of youth-reported dysfunctional family interaction associated with more depressive symptomatology. In the model predicting parent report of adolescent internalising symptoms only higher levels of dysfunctional family interaction, as reported by the parent, were associated with higher levels of internalising symptoms.
   Conclusion. Positive family communication, cohesion and support predictive of a secure parent-adolescent attachment relationship reduced the risk of a depressive symptom outcome. Secure adolescents were able to regulate their emotions, knowing that they could seek out secure base attachment relations within their family and from friends during times of stress, buffering against the development of depressive symptoms.

AB Among an ethnically diverse sample of 803 preadolescent students (ages 9-13 years), the present study examined the associations between students' perceptions of the student-teacher relationship and their achievement goal orientations. Multilevel analyses showed that students who perceived more closeness in the relationship with their teacher reported a stronger endorsement of mastery goals, particularly when they experienced more emotional problems.
   This finding was independent of students' perceptions of peer acceptance. Likewise, perceived relational negativity (conflict and dependency) was associated with a stronger endorsement of performance goals (approach and avoidance). The results were similar for ethnic minority and ethnic majority students, and consistent with an attachment perspective which explains the motivational impact of the student-teacher relationship in terms of the security it provides.

AB This study examined how Israeli students, despite exposure to contextual risk factors, may experience a high ratio of self-reported positive to negative emotions (i.e., positivity ratio). Self-control skills and perceived social support were tested as protective factors, where each was posited to moderate the relation between risk status and positivity ratio. The participants were 460 Israeli students (51% girls) in grades 8-10. Contrary to expectations, students attending a school with high contextual risks did not differ from students attending a school with low contextual risks in their scores on self-control skills, perceived social support, or positivity ratio. However, an exploratory follow-up moderation analysis revealed a significant three-way interaction, indicating that while low self-control skills eliminate the link between social support and positivity ratio for students attending the school defined as at-risk, high self-control protects this link. These results suggest that neither contextual risk in itself nor initial differences in self-control or social support account for differences in students' positivity ratio. Rather, it is the way these factors interact with each other that matters. Study limitations and implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Society for the Study of School Psychology.

AB Adolescence is a critical period of development, in which the increasing social and cognitive demands of independence need to be met by enhanced self-regulatory abilities. The cultivation of mindfulness has been associated with improved self-regulation in adult populations, and it is theorized that one neurodevelopmental mechanism that supports this capacity is the development of the prefrontal cortex. The current study examined the neurodevelopmental mechanisms associated with dispositional mindfulness in adolescence. Using a longitudinal within-persons design, 82 participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments at approximately ages 16 and 19, and also completed self-reported measurements of mindfulness at age 19. It was hypothesized that adolescents who demonstrated greater thinning of frontal cortical regions between the age of 16 and 19 would exhibit higher dispositional mindfulness levels at age 19. Results indicated that, contrary to predictions, adolescents with higher levels of mindfulness demonstrated less thinning in the left anterior insula. By contrast, higher IQ was associated with greater thinning of the right caudal middle frontal and right superior frontal regions. The involvement of insula development in mindfulness is consistent with a direct role for this structure in managing self-regulation, and in doing so concords with recent models of self-referential interoceptive awareness.

AB Developmental theories of borderline personality disorder (BPD) propose that harsh, invalidating parenting of a child with poor self-control and heightened negative emotionality often leads to a coercive cycle of parent-child transactions that increase risk for BPD symptoms such as emotion dysregulation. Although parenting practices and child temperament have previously been linked with BPD, less is known about the prospective influences of caregiver and child characteristics. Using annual longitudinal data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study (n = 2,450), our study examined how reciprocal influences among harsh parenting, self-control, and negative emotionality between ages 5 and 14 predicted the development of BPD symptoms in adolescent girls ages 14 to 17. Consistent with developmental theories, we found that harsh punishment, poor self-control, and negative emotionality predicted BPD symptom severity at age 14. Only worsening self-control between ages 12 and 14, however, predicted growth in BPD symptoms from 14 to 17. Furthermore, the effects of harsh punishment and poor self-control on age 14 BPD symptoms were partially mediated by their earlier reciprocal effects on each other between ages 5 and 14. Our findings underscore the need to address both child and parental contributions to dysfunctional transactions in order to stem the development of BPD symptoms. Moreover, problems with self-regulation in early adolescence may indicate heightened risk for subsequent BPD. Altogether, these results increase our understanding of developmental trajectories associated with BPD symptoms in adolescent girls.

AB Adolescents in disadvantaged communities have high rates of exposure to stress and trauma, which can negatively impact emotion regulation and executive functioning, increasing likelihood of school problems. This pilot study evaluated RAP Club, a 12-session school-based trauma-informed group intervention co-facilitated by a mental health counselor and young adult community member that utilizes evidence-based cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness strategies. Seventh and eighth graders at two urban public schools serving low-income communities were assigned to receive RAP Club (n = 29) or regular school programming (n = 20). RAP Club improved teacher-rated emotion regulation, social and academic competence, classroom behavior, and discipline. Higher program dose predicted improvements in several teacher-rated outcomes. Student self-report outcomes, however, did not vary by study group or dose. Even students with low baseline depression showed improvement in teacher-rated outcomes following program participation, supporting a model of universal program delivery to all students. Findings suggest RAP Club merits further study. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Enmeshment plays a key role in many families' dysfunctional interactions and may be especially detrimental for adolescents. Sixty-four adolescents completed ratings of family enmeshment, perceived distress tolerance, an interpersonal challenge task, and mood ratings before and immediately after the task. Before and during the challenge task, adolescents' respiratory sinus arrhythmia (an indicator of cardiac vagal tone) was recorded. Associations were tested between adolescents' perceptions of family enmeshment and 3 aspects of adolescent emotional dysregulation. Adolescents who perceived higher family enmeshment also demonstrated greater emotional dysregulation in several domains: negative global appraisals of distress tolerance, stronger increase in subjective negative mood from baseline to postchallenge, lower baseline vagal tone, and vagal augmentation during the challenge task. Gender differences also emerged, such that girls reported more negative distress appraisals overall and enmeshed boys showed greater emotional dysregulation across analyses. Findings are discussed in terms of how clinicians may dynamically assess and treat enmeshment and emotional dysregulation in families with male and female adolescents.

AB The prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents is of growing importance. Intervening in children's mental health early in life has been shown to be more effective than trying to resolve these problems when children are older. With respect to prevention activities in community settings, the prevalence of problems should be estimated, and the required level of services should be delivered. The prevalence of children's mental health disorders has been reported for many countries. Preventive intervention has emphasized optimizing the environment. Because parents are the primary influence on their children's development, considerable attention has been placed on the development of parent training to strengthen parenting skills. However, a public-health approach is necessary to confirm that the benefits of parent-training interventions lead to an impact at the societal level. This literature review clarifies that the prevalence of mental health problems is measured at the national level in many countries and that population-level parenting interventions can lower the prevalence of mental health problems among children in the community.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of youth chronic illness moderates the association between trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and psychological functioning in youths. Methods: Data came from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (N = 11,813). Using the 12-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), symptom trajectories were estimated by latent class growth modeling over 3 measurement occasions (when their children were 10-11, 12-13, and 14-15 years). The moderating effect of youth chronic illness on the association between maternal depression and youth psychological functioning at 16-19 years was tested using multiple regression. Three measures of psychological functioning were assessed: anger regulation (Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory), self-concept (Self-Determination Questionnaire), and depressive symptoms (CES-D). Results: Four trajectories (low, decreasing, increasing, high) of maternal depression were identified. The association of maternal depressive symptoms on youth psychological functioning was modified by chronic illness; less favorable trajectories of maternal depression had a more pronounced detrimental association on youths with chronic illness compared to controls. Conclusions: Youths with chronic illness are particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological exposure of maternal depressive symptoms during the transition to adulthood. Family-centered transition of care programs in the medical setting may be beneficial in reducing the association between symptoms of maternal depression and youth psychological functioning.

AB This study investigated the course of and association among changes in autism symptoms, depression symptoms and executive functions (EF) in children with high-functioning autism (HFA). Thirty-four children with HFA and 45 typically developing children (age 9-16) were assessed at baseline and after 2 years. Children with HFA had impaired scores on all measures at both time points. According to parent reports, depressive symptoms decreased over time, while EF improved and autism symptoms were stable. Children's reports did not reveal less depressive symptoms over time. A positive association was found only between changes in autism symptoms and changes in symptoms of depression. A possible implication is that interventions aimed at either autism symptoms or symptoms of depression may improve the other.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent among late adolescents and predicts the onset of suicidal ideation and behavior. Although research has established an association between the behavioral approach system (BAS) and NSSI, less research has explored mechanisms underlying this relationship. The authors examined negative and positive emotion regulation patterns, as well as the BAS-relevant cognitive style of self-criticism, as potential mechanisms through which a hypersensitive BAS might be related to NSSI frequency. Late adolescents (N=177) with high and moderate BAS levels completed measures of self-criticism, positive emotion regulation, brooding, and both lifetime and last-year frequency of NSSI. Results indicated that self-criticism and positive emotion dampening independently mediated the relationship between BAS and last-year frequency of NSSI. Self-criticism also mediated the relationship between BAS and lifetime frequency of NSSI. Results suggest that cognitive and emotion-regulatory styles may help to explain why high BAS individuals are likely to engage in NSSI.

AB Suicide and suicidal behavior are major public health problems, especially among adolescents and young adults. Previous research has established links between parental bonding and suicidality; however, it remains unclear whether parental bonding is associated with suicide ideation, the progression from suicide ideation to suicide attempts, or both. This study examined the relation of parental bonding to suicide ideation and suicide attempts in adolescents from two settings: (1) acute psychiatric care (n=172) and (2) high school (n=426). All participants were administered validated measures of parental bonding, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts, as well as emotion dysregulation, loneliness, and self-worth. In the psychiatric sample, lower parental care significantly differentiated adolescents with a history of suicide attempts from those with suicide ideation only or without histories of suicidality. This pattern remained even after controlling for other known correlates of suicidality (i.e., emotional dysregulation, loneliness, and low self-worth). Similar effects were found in the community sample, although these findings failed to reach statistical significance. In both samples, parental overprotection was not associated with suicide ideation or suicide attempts. Results suggest that parental care may be an important risk factor for youth suicidal behavior and may help differentiate suicide attempters from suicide ideators.

AB BackgroundStudies on adaptive behaviour and ageing in adults with Down syndrome (DS) (without dementia) have typically analysed age-related change in terms of the total item scores on questionnaires. This research extends the literature by investigating whether the age-related changes in adaptive abilities could be differentially attributed to changes in the number or severity (intensity) of behavioural questionnaire items endorsed.
   MethodsThe Adaptive Behaviour Assessment System-II Adult (ABAS-II Adult) was completed by parents and caregivers of 53 adults with DS aged between 16 and 56 years. Twenty adults with DS and their parents/caregivers were a part of a longitudinal study, which provided two time points of data. In addition 33 adults with DS and their parents/caregivers from a cross-sectional study were included. Random effects regression analyses were used to examine the patterns in item scores associated with ageing.
   ResultsIncreasing age was found to be significantly associated with lower adaptive behaviour abilities for all the adaptive behaviour composite scores, expect for the practical composite. These associations were entirely related to fewer ABAS-II Adult items being selected as present for the older participants, as opposed to the scores being attributable to lower item severity.
   ConclusionsThis study provides evidence for a differential pattern of age-related change for various adaptive behaviour skills in terms of range, but not severity. Possible reasons for this pattern will be discussed. Overall, these findings suggest that adults with DS may benefit from additional support in terms of their social and conceptual abilities as they age.

AB This study investigated longitudinal associations between perceived maternal autonomy-supportive parenting and early adolescents' use of three emotion regulation (ER) styles: emotional integration, suppressive regulation, and dysregulation. We tested whether perceived maternal autonomy support predicted changes in ER and whether these ER styles, in turn, related to changes in adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, self-esteem). Participants (N= 311, mean age at Time 1 = 12.04) reported on perceived maternal autonomy support, their ER styles, and adjustment at two moments in time, spanning a one-year interval. Cross-lagged analyses showed that perceived maternal autonomy support predicted increases in emotional integration and decreases in suppressive regulation. By contrast, emotional dysregulation predicted decreases in perceived autonomy-supportive parenting. Further, increases in emotional integration were predictive of increases in self-esteem, and decreases in suppressive regulation were predictive of decreases in depressive symptoms. Together, the results show that early adolescents' perception of their mothers as autonomy-supportive is associated with increases in adaptive ER strategies and subsequent adjustment.

AB The primary aim of the study was to understand the phenomenon of pathological video-gaming by identifying protective factors for its development, and examining the dynamic interplay between protective factors and pathological video-gaming within a framework of change. The study was a 2-year longitudinal study involving 3034 children and adolescents recruited from 6 elementary and 6 secondary schools. Controlling for initial levels of pathological video-gaming, personal strengths and familial factors such as parent-child connectedness, and warm family environment were found to be protective factors for later pathological gaming. Increases in levels of emotional regulation and family environment warmth were related to decreases in pathological video-gaming. Higher initial levels and increases in pathological video-gaming were related to higher levels of later depressive symptoms, controlling for earlier levels of depressive symptoms. The study adds to the growing evidence that pathological video-gaming has potentially serious mental health consequences, in particular, on depression. For health providers who work with pathological video-garners, the findings suggest that developing self-regulatory skills such as emotional regulation, and improving the family environment are useful strategies.

AB The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between psychological control and trait Emotional Intelligence (trait EI), while also testing the mediating role of trait EI in the relationship between psychological control and behaviour problems. A total of 260 adolescents, between 13 and 17 years old, participated in the study. Participants completed the Psychological Control Scale-Youth Self-Report to evaluate their perception of parental psychological control, the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire to measure adolescent's self-evaluation of trait EI, and the Child Behavior CheckList to investigate adolescents' self-evaluation of their behavioural and emotional problems. Results showed that adolescents' perception of parental psychological control negatively predicted trait EI, and that trait EI negatively predicted internalising and externalising problems. Furthermore, structural equation modelling showed that trait EI was a full mediator in the relationship between perceptions of parental psychological control and internalising problems and a partial mediator between paternal psychological control and externalising problems. These results suggest independent additive effects. Identifying a mediating variable not only between psychological control and internalising problems, but also between psychological control and externalising, seems to be worthwhile for new research, as it emphasises the emotional mechanism behind the relationship between psychological and behavioural problems. Our findings represent a timely contribution to the literature in light of recent descriptions of how parental psychological control can affect internalising and externalising problems.

AB Few longitudinal studies have examined the pathways through which family violence leads to dating aggression. In the current study the authors used 3 waves of data obtained from 8th- and 9th-grade adolescents (N=1,965) to examine the hypotheses that the prospective relationship between witnessing family violence and directly experiencing violence and physical dating aggression perpetration is mediated by 3 constructs: (a) normative beliefs about dating aggression (norms), (b) anger dysregulation, and (c) depression. Results from cross-lagged regression models suggest that the relationship between having been hit by an adult and dating aggression is mediated by changes in norms and anger dysregulation, but not depression. No evidence of indirect effects from witnessing family violence to dating aggression was found through any of the proposed mediators. Taken together, the findings suggest that anger dysregulation and normative beliefs are potential targets for dating abuse prevention efforts aimed at youth who have directly experienced violence.

Importantly, the creation of social ties can aid in promoting positive adjustment during university. This study investigated whether involvement in religious activities promotes social ties among university students directly and/or indirectly through emotion regulation. Importantly, involvement in religious activities may promote self-regulatory skills, and the ability to effectively regulate emotions can aid in navigating social interactions. To rule out potentially important confounding variables, spirituality and involvement in non-religious clubs were statistically controlled in all analyses. The participants included 1,132 university students (70.5 % female) from a university in Ontario, Canada who were surveyed each year over a period of 3 years. The results indicated that involvement in religious activities indirectly predicted more social ties over time through emotion regulation. Spirituality did not predict social ties or emotion regulation. Furthermore, non-religious clubs directly predicted more social ties over time. Thus, although involvement in religious and non-religious activities both predicted more social ties in a university setting over time, the mechanism by which these activities promote social ties differed.

AB A study of the associations of maternal, paternal and peer attachment with the course of depression from adolescence to young adulthood. In the Youth and Mental Health study 242 adolescents completed the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version for depressive disorders at age 15 and 20. Attachment was measured with the inventory for parent and peer attachment, separately for mother, father, and peers, at age 15. Multinomial logistic regression, indicated insecure attachment relationships with both parents, but not with peers, and were associated with the course of depression. Less secure attachment to mothers was associated with becoming depressed. Less secure attachment to both parents was associated with becoming well and remaining depressed. These results suggest attachment relationships with parents as potential influences on the course of depression and may provide important framework for clinical work with adolescents and young adults.

AB Given the popularity of social networking sites, it is important to examine the impact of rumination while examining the rich content available, particularly after a stressful interpersonal event. This pilot study examined how individual differences in rumination are related to Facebook use following a breakup. Findings indicate that trait rumination was associated with the tendency to experience maladaptive thoughts while examining an ex's profile, as well as difficulties in adjustment following the breakup. Rumination on Facebook and the importance of Facebook in one's social world mediated the relation between trait rumination and subsequent perceived adjustment. Thus, for high ruminators, placing a high reliance on Facebook and ruminating while on the site may hold particularly negative emotional consequences following a stressor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent research has revealed relationship between cybervictimization and cyberbullying, but the possible role of anger as a mediating factor between cybervictimization and cyberbullying remains an area for further clarification. The purpose of this study was to analyze the direct and indirect relationships among cybervictimization, anger expression styles, and cyberbullying, and to test whether anger expression styles mediates the relationship between cybervictimization and cyberbullying in the context of General Strain Theory (GST). Data for the present study were collected from 687 undergraduate students with a mean age of 22.45 years (SD = 2.42). Participants completed cyberbullying, cybervictimization and anger expression scales. Structural equation modeling was used to test two models: one to examine direct and indirect relationships and one to examine only indirect relationships in which cyberbullying predicted anger-in and anger-out which in turn predicted cyberbullying. Analyses of fit indices showed that both models were adequate fits for the data. The findings provide evidence of direct effects of cybervictimization on cyberbullying and indirect effects of cybervictimization on cyberbullying mediated by anger-in. Specifically, results showed that cybervictimization was positively and directly related to anger-in and anger-out, and indirectly related to cyberbullying through anger-in. Prevention programs in schools can be applied to improve students' emotion regulation and anger control, not only in the context of overt aggression, but also in cyberspace. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Adolescence is a unique period of heightened emotional arousal and still-developing regulatory abilities. Adolescent emotion regulation patterns may be critically involved in adolescents' psychosocial development, but patterns of emotion regulation in youths are not well understood. The current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to elucidate patterns of emotion expression, experience, and emotion-related physiological arousal in adolescents. A sample of 198 adolescents and their primary caregivers participated in an emotionally arousing parent-adolescent conflict interaction. Adolescents' observed emotion expressions, emotion experiences, and heart rate (HR) and caregiver parenting behaviors were assessed during and/or after the interaction. Parents reported on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and youths reported on depressive symptoms. The LPA revealed four emotion regulation profiles: a moderate HR and high expression profile, a suppression profile (with low negative emotion expression and high emotion experience), a low reactive profile, and a high reactive profile. The moderate HR and high expression profile was associated with lower conduct disorder symptoms, the suppression profile was related to lower anxiety symptoms, and the high reactive profile was associated with higher adolescent depressive symptoms. The high reactive profile and moderate HR and high expression profile were associated with more negative/critical parenting behaviors. Findings suggest that profiles of adolescent emotion regulation can be empirically identified and may be significant risk factors for psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Exposure to parental depression and anxiety is known to heighten the risk of internalizing symptoms and disorders in children and adolescents. Ample research has focused on the influence of maternal depression and anxiety, but the contribution of psychopathology in fathers remains unclear. We studied the relationships of perceived maternal and paternal psychopathology with adolescents' depression and anxiety symptoms in a general population sample of 862 adolescent girls (age M = 12.39, SD = 0.79). Assessments included adolescents' self-reports of their own depression and anxiety as well as their reports of maternal and paternal psychopathology. We found that perceived maternal and paternal psychopathology were both related to depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescent girls. A combination of higher maternal and paternal psychopathology was related to even higher levels of depression and anxiety in adolescent girls. Our findings showed that adolescents' perceptions of their parents' psychopathology are significantly related to their own emotional problems.

AB The aims of the present multi-center study were to investigate the extent of mental health problems in adolescents with a hearing loss and cochlear implants (Cls) in comparison to normal hearing (NH) peers and to investigate possible relations between the extent of mental health problems of young Cl users and hearing variables, such as age at implantation, or functional gain of Cl. The survey included 140 adolescents with Cl (mean age = 14.7, SD = 1.5 years) and 140 NH adolescents (mean age = 14.8, SD = 1.4 years), their parents and teachers. Participants were matched by age, gender and social background. Within the Cl group, 35 adolescents were identified as "risk cases" due to possible and manifest additional handicaps, and 11 adolescents were non-classifiable. Mental health problems were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the versions "Self," "Parent," and "Teacher." The Cl group showed significantly more "Peer Problems" than the NH group. When the Cl group was split into a "risk-group" (35 "risk cases" and 11 non-classifiable persons) and a "non-risk group" (n = 94), increased peer problems were perceived in both Cl subgroups by adolescents themselves. However, no further differences between the Cl non-risk group and the NH group were observed in any rater. The Cl risk-group showed significantly more hyperactivity compared to the NH group and more hyperactivity and conduct problems compared to the Cl non-risk group. Cluster analyses confirmed that there were significantly more adolescents with high problems in the Cl risk-group compared to the Cl non-risk group and the NH group. Adolescents with Cl, who were able to understand speech in noise had significantly less difficulties compared to constricted Cl users. Parents, teachers, and clinicians should be aware that Cl users with additionally special needs may have mental health problems. However, peer problems were also experienced by Cl adolescents without additional handicaps.

AB During adolescence, considerable social and biological changes occur that interact with functional brain maturation, some of which are sex-specific. The amygdala is one brain area that has displayed sexual dimorphism, specifically in socio-affective (superficial amygdala [SFA]), stress (centromedial amygdala [CMA]), and learning and memory (basolateral amygdala [BLA]) processing. The amygdala has also been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders which display sex-specific features, most prominently observed during adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study examined the interaction of age and sex on resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of amygdala sub-regions, BLA and SFA, in a sample of healthy adolescents between the ages 10 and 16 years (n = 122, 71 boys). Whole-brain, voxel-wise partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine RSFC of bilateral BLA and SFA seed regions, created using the Eickhoff-Zilles maximum probability maps based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST). Monte Carlo simulation was implemented to correct for multiple comparisons (threshold of 53 contiguous voxels with a z-value >= 2.25). Results indicated that with increasing age, there was a corresponding decrease in RSFC between both amygdala sub-regions and parieto-occipital cortices, with a concurrent increase in RSFC with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Specifically, boys and girls demonstrated increased coupling of mPFC and left and right SFA with age, respectively; however, neither sex showed increased connectivity between mPFC and BLA, which could indicate relative immaturity of fronto-limbic networks that is similar across sex. A dissociation in connectivity between BLA- and SFA-parieto-occipital RSFC emerged, in which girls had weaker negative RSFC between SFA and parieto-occipital regions and boys had weaker negative RSFC of BLA and parieto-occipital regions with increased age, both standing in contrast to adult patterns of amygdala sub-regional RSFC. The present findings suggest relative immaturity of amygdala sub-regional RSFC with parieto-occipital cortices during adolescence, with unique patterns in both sexes that may support memory and socio-affective processing in boys and girls, respectively. Understanding the underlying normative functional architecture of brain networks associated with the amygdala during adolescence may better inform future research of the neural features associated with increased risk for internalizing psychopathology.

AB Previous studies have documented both neuroplasticity-related BDNF VaI(66)Met and emotion regulation-related 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms as genetic variants that contribute to the processing of emotions from faces. More specifically, research has shown the BDNF Met allele and the 5-HTTLPR Short allele to be associated with mechanisms of negative affectivity that relate to susceptibility for psychopathology. We examined visual scanning pathways in response to angry, happy, and neutral faces in relation to BDNF VaI(66)Met and 5-HTTLPR genotyping in 49 children aged 4-7 years. Analyses revealed that variations in the visual processing of facial expressions of anger interacted with BDNF VaI(66)Met genotype, such that children who carried at least one low neuroplasticity Met allele exhibited a vigilance avoidance pattern of visual scanning compared to homozygotes for the high neuroplasticity Val allele. In a separate investigation of eye gaze towards the eye versus mouth regions of neutral faces, we observed that short allele 5-HTTLPR carriers exhibited reduced looking at the eye region compared with those with the higher serotonin uptake Long allele. Together, these findings suggest that genetic mechanisms early in life may influence the establishment of patterns of visual scanning of environmental stressors, which in conjunction with other factors such as negative life events, may lead to psychological difficulties and disorders in the later adolescent and adult years.

AB Using the objectification theory, scholars have theorized the sense of detachment and disregard for the body that results from continued body objectification are believed to put a person at greater risk for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), due to a lack of emotional investment in the body. The goal of the current study was to longitudinally investigate the association between body objectification and NSSI among an early adolescent sample. The overall sample consisted of 120 participants (56 % female) who ranged in age from 11 to 13 years of age (M = 12.34, SD = .48). Participants were followed over the course of a 12-month period, and classified into three groups of interest; adolescents who reported maintaining NSSI behaviour over the course of a year (NSSI Maintain group, n = 20), adolescents who reported stopping the behaviour over the course of a year (NSSI Stop group, n = 40), and a comparison group of adolescents who did not report engaging in NSSI (n = 60). Using a 3 (NSSI Maintain, NSSI Stop, and Comparison) X 2 (Gender) X 2 (Time 1 and Time 2) repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA), results indicated a significant group by time interaction, showing group differences with respect to body shame and body surveillance over time. Specifically, both NSSI groups reported significantly greater body shame and body surveillance over time than the non-NSSI group. Additionally, the NSSI Maintain group reported significantly greater body surveillance at T2 when compared to the NSSI Stop and non-NSSI group. The NSSI Maintain group also reported significantly more emotion dysregulation difficulties and depressive symptoms at T2 when compared to the NSSI Stop and non-NSSI group. The influence of body objectification as a core intrapersonal risk factor related to the maintenance and cessation of NSSI behaviour is discussed, as are clinical implications considering body objectification as an important variable in prevention and treatment efforts.

ID PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES
AB Background: The Ottawa Self-Injury Inventory (OSI) is a self-report measure that offers a comprehensive assessment of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), including measurement of its functions and addictive features. In a preliminary investigation of self injuring college students who completed the OSI, exploratory analysis revealed four function factors (Internal Emotion Regulation, Social Influence, External Emotion Regulation and Sensation Seeking) and a single Addictive Features factor. Rates of NSSI are particularly high in inpatient psychiatry youth. The OSI can assistin both standardizing assessment regarding functions and potential addictive features and aid case formulation leading to informed treatment planning. This report will describe a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the OSI on youth hospitalized in a psychiatric unit in southwestern Ontario.
   Methods: Demographic and self-report data were collected from all youth consecutively admitted to an adolescent in-patient unit who provided consent or assent.
   Results: The mean age of the sample was 15.71 years (SD = 1.5) and 76 (81 %) were female. The CFA proved the same four function factors relevant, as in the previous study on college students (X-2(183) = 231.98, p = .008; X-2/df = 1.27; CFI = .91; RMSEA = .05). The model yielded significant correlations between factors (rs = .44-.90, p < .001). Higher NSSI frequency was related to higher scores on each function factor (rs = .24-.29, p < .05), except the External Emotion Regulation factor (r = .11, p > .05). The factor structure of the Addictive Features function was also confirmed (X-2(14) = 21.96, p > .05; X-2/df = 1.57; CFI = .96; RMSEA = .08). All the items had significant path estimates (. 52 to .80). Cronbach's alpha for the Addictive Features scale was .84 with a mean score of 16.22 (SD = 6.90). Higher Addictive Features scores were related to more frequent NSSI (r = .48, p < .001).
   Conclusions: Results show further support for the OSI as a valid and reliable assessment tool in adolescents, in this case in a clinical setting, where results can inform case conceptualization and treatment planning.

AB Background: Factors affecting non-suicidal self-injury cessation are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify differences between individuals with current and past non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in a large probability sample of university students using quantitative and qualitative methods. Predictors of psychological growth related following NSSI cessation were also examined.
   Method: The sample included 836 students who participated in a larger online study of well-being at eight U.S. colleges and who reported current or past history of repeated NSSI. The average age of respondents used in analysis was 21.3 years. They were 78.3 % female and 21.7 % male and were 70.7 % Caucasian, 1.4 % African American/Black, 5.5 % Hispanic, 7.8 % Asian/Asian American and 14.7 % other. Analyses tested differences in demographics, NSSI characteristics (e.g. lifetime frequency, number of NSSI functions, NSSI disclosure), formal help-seeking, psychosocial factors, and mental health and trauma histories.
   Results: Individuals with current NSSI status were more likely to be female and slightly younger, to report higher NSSI lifetime frequency, more NSSI forms and functions, thinking of themselves as a "self-injurer", and current psychological distress. Individuals with current NSSI status were less likely to report that self-injury interfered with life, that therapy was useful in stopping, perceiving social support, having a sense of meaning in life, access to more emotion regulation strategies, and life satisfaction. Qualitative data suggested that cessation may be attributable to changes in ability to regulate emotion (62.6 %), self-awareness (38.7 %), and important relationships to others (36.0 %). Psychological growth after stopping NSSI was predicted by more severe NSSI (form and perceived NSSI dependence), having talked about NSSI with others and higher numbers of confidantes, perceived life satisfaction, and a history of suicide action.
   Conclusions: These findings add to the still nascent body of literature examining processes related to NSSI cessation. Our results point to the importance of help-seeking and social support, as well as psychosocial processes in stopping NSSI.

AB Although the attachment construct refers to a child's tendency to use an attachment figure both as a safe haven in times of distress as well as a secure base from which to explore, approaches to assessing attachment at older ages have focused on safe haven behavior. We tested modified versions of the Friends and Family Interview and the Security Scale Questionnaire to examine separately the correlates of safe haven and secure base support from parents. The main study (n =107 children, 10-14-year-olds) included both interview and questionnaire assessments of safe haven and secure base support from mothers and fathers. The two methods converged in expected ways, and both showed associations with narrative coherence. Children reported greater safe haven support from mothers and greater secure base support from fathers, suggesting secure base support is a key aspect of father-child attachment. Both mother-child and father-child relationships were related to children's school adjustment and coping.

AB Although attachment representation is considered to be disturbed in traumatized adolescents, it is not known whether this is specific for trauma, as comparative studies with other clinical groups are lacking. Therefore, attachment representation was studied by means of the Adult Attachment Interview in adolescents with Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA) (N=21), clinical depression (N=28) and non-clinical controls (N=28). Coherence of mind and unresolved loss or trauma, as well as the disorganized attachment classification differentiated the CSA group from the clinical depression group and controls, over and above age, IQ, and psychiatric symptomatology. In the current era of sustained criticism on criteria-based classification, this may well carry substantial clinical relevance. If attachment is a general risk or vulnerability factor underlying specific psychopathology, this may guide diagnostic assessment as well as treatment.

AB This study investigated how mothers' attachment was related to their responses to their own and their children's positive events and positive affect (PA). Ninety-seven mothers reported on their attachment and their responses to their own and their 7-12-year-old children's positive events and emotions. Children reported on their mothers' responses to the children's positive events and their attachment security with their mothers. The results indicated that more avoidant mothers reported less intense PA in response to their own and their children's positive events. More avoidant mothers also were less likely to encourage their children to savor positive events (through expressing PA, reflecting on PA or themselves, giving rewards, and affectionate responses). Mothers higher on anxiety reported greater likelihood of dampening (e.g., minimizing the event's importance) their own positive events and reported being more likely to feel discomfort and to reprimand their children for expressing PA. Children's security was predicted by mothers' lower likelihood of encouraging children's dampening and of reprimanding children for PA displays. This study advances the literature on how mothers' attachment is related to the ways in which they regulate their own and their children's PA, which may have implications for children's attachment and developing PA regulation.

AB SYNOPSIS
   Objective. The focus of the current article was on the parenting strategy of using maternal conditional positive regard to promote adolescents' suppression of anxiety to assess whether this strategy is benign or maladaptive. Method. Two studies (N=230) examined mothers' and adolescents' reports of maternal conditional regard, adolescents' motivation, and mothers' contingent self-esteem, general warmth, and neuroticism. Results. Study 1 showed that mothers' self-reported maternal conditional positive regard predicted adolescents' perceptions of mothers' use of maternal conditional positive regard, which then predicted adolescents' introjected (stressful and internally controlling) motivation to suppress anxiety. These effects obtained when controlling for Maternal Conditional Negative Regard. Study 2 showed that mothers' contingent self-esteem predicted mother-reported maternal conditional positive regard and maternal conditional negative regard which, respectively, predicted adolescents' experience of mothers' using maternal conditional positive regard and maternal conditional negative regard. These effects were obtained when controlling for mothers' general warmth and neuroticism. Conclusions. The association of maternal conditional positive regard with mothers' contingent self-esteem and adolescents' introjected motivation suggests that this seemingly benign practice might be a product and a cause of psychological difficulties, and therefore, should be minimized.

AB This study examined elementary school teachers' experiences working with homeless students. Specifically, we focused on the psychosocial impacts of homelessness on students and their teachers. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 teachers who worked at designated public schools for family homeless shelters. A prominent theme that emerged from teachers' accounts was how the instability tied to homelessness affected students' behavioral, social, and emotional adjustment in the classroom (e.g. externalizing problems, difficulty developing peer relationships, and withdrawn behavior). Teachers' own social and emotional competencies (e.g. fostering positive teacher-student relationships, and perspective taking) influenced the manner in which they responded to their students' needs. Findings suggest that critical components may be lacking articulation in the McKinney-Vento Act's Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program such as guidelines for teacher responsibilities, supports for teachers, and an emphasis not only on children's academic but also social and emotional needs.

AB This study tested a 10-year longitudinal model examining the role of adolescent attachment, adult romantic attachment, and emotion regulation strategies on adult symptoms of psychopathology. Fifty individuals completed a measure of attachment security to parents and peers at age 14, measures of romantic attachment and emotion regulation at age 22, and a measure of psychopathology at age 24. Results revealed that attachment insecurity to parents in adolescence was associated with greater symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood, and emotion-focused strategies partially mediated this association. Anxious romantic attachment was also related to psychopathology, an association that was fully mediated by emotion-focused strategies. The long-term mechanism involved in the association between earlier attachment and future adaptation will be discussed.

AB Parental criticism can have positive and negative effects on children's and adolescents' behavior; yet, it is unclear how youth react to, understand and process parental criticism. We proposed that youth would engage three sets of neural processes in response to parental criticism including the following: (i) activating emotional reactions, (ii) regulating those reactions and (iii) social cognitive processing (e.g. understanding the parent's mental state). To examine neural processes associated with both emotional and social processing of parental criticism in personally relevant and ecologically valid social contexts, typically developing youth were scanned while they listened to their mother providing critical, praising and neutral statements. In response to maternal criticism, youth showed increased brain activity in affective networks (e.g. subcortical-limbic regions including lentiform nucleus and posterior insula), but decreased activity in cognitive control networks (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudal anterior cingulate cortex) and social cognitive networks (e.g. temporoparietal junction and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus). These results suggest that youth may respond to maternal criticism with increased emotional reactivity but decreased cognitive control and social cognitive processing. A better understanding of children's responses to parental criticism may provide insights into the ways that parental feedback can be modified to be more helpful to behavior and development in youth.

AB Objectives: To assess the psychometric properties of the German self-reported version of the Kiddy-KINDL that measures Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in 3 to 5 year old kindergarten children. Study design: The population of the study comprised baseline data of a longitudinal study whose main aim is to investigate self-reported health outcomes in young children (N = 317).
   Methods: Missing values, the distribution of data, internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha and Guttman's lambda), and reliability (split half and two weeks test-retest) were analysed. To assess discriminant validity, mean differences were tested splitting the sample regarding socio-emotional competences (VBV 3-6), age and gender. Structural validity was investigated with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).
   Results: Mean HRQoL was 69.79 (SD 16.84). Overall missing values were 8.1%, overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.75 and overall Guttman's lambda was 0.77; for the whole scale Spearman-Brown test for split half reliability resulted in 0.80 and ICC for test-retest in 0.83. Discriminant validity investigation differentiated groups with high and low socio-emotional competence and those children who were 4.5 years or older, compared to the younger ones. Differences between boys and girls were also found. CFA suggested two main dimensions: physical and socio-emotional.
   Conclusion: This preliminary validation of the Kiddy-KINDL in very young children shows satisfactory psychometric properties. However, results of the Cronbach's alpha, Guttman's lambda and the CFA depicted problems, mainly in the psychological dimension. Due to these we recommend to use the Kiddy-KINDL as an instrument with only two dimensions. Further studies in general population samples are needed. (C) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB Although clinical observations suggest that youth with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are unable to down-regulate physiological fear responses in innocuous situations, to date no studies have directly addressed this question. In this report we lay the groundwork for future investigation of the emotion regulation processes of youth with obsessive compulsive (OC) symptoms. Using a non-clinical community sample of school-aged children, we evaluated the association between parent-reported child OC symptoms and children's startle responses to experimental conditions with differing levels of threat. Children with higher OC symptoms evidenced signs of context insensitivity in their startle response and greater subjective distress. Specifically, greater OC symptoms were associated with higher startle magnitude during baseline and safe conditions, but lower startle magnitude during threat. Our findings have important implications for the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation difficulties among children displaying OC symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The present study examines the academic well-being of students with and without special educational needs (SEN) in inclusive classes compared to students from regular classes in which no child with SEN is taught. In addition, the relationships between the school well-being and emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior are analyzed. Method: A total of 1115 students from the 4th and 7th grade (37 % 4th graders, 63 % 7th graders) participated in the survey, 126 of whom had been diagnosed as having SEN. The subscale Well-Being at School taken from the FEESS 3-4 (Rauer & Schuck, 2004) and the SDQ (Goodman, 1997) were used for measurement. Results: Results indicate high reliabilities for the subscale Well-Being in School for students both with and without SEN for both grades 4 and 7. Furthermore, it could be shown that the variance explained for school well-being can be connected to elements on the students' individual level as well as on the class-specific level. Significant predictors of school well-being were sex, behavioral difficulties and strengths as well as the school grade. The SEN status (no SEN vs. SEN) and the class setting (regular vs. inclusive class) did not influence the school well-being significantly.

AB Introduction: Suicidal and self-injurious behaviors in adolescents are a major public health concern. However, the prevalence of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in Spanish outpatient adolescents is unknown.
   Methods: A total of 267 adolescents between 11 and 18 year old were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatric Services, Jimenez Diaz Foundation (Madrid, Spain) from November 1st 2011 to October 31st 2012. All participants were administered the Spanish version of the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Inventory, which is a structured interview that assesses the presence, frequency, and characteristics of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury.
   Results: One-fifth (20.6%) of adolescents reported having had suicidal ideation at least once during their lifetime. Similarly, 2.2% reported suicide plans, 9.4% reported suicide gesture, 4.5% attempted suicide, and 21.7% reported non-suicidal self-injury, at least once during their lifetime. Of the whole sample, 47.6% of adolescents reported at least one of the studied thoughts or behaviors in their lifetime. Among them, 47.2% reported 2 or more of these thoughts or behaviors. Regarding the reported function of each type of thoughts and behaviors examined, most were performed for emotional regulation purposes, except in the case of suicide gestures (performed for the purposes of social reinforcement).
   Conclusions: The high prevalence and high comorbidity of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, together with the known risk of transition among them, underline the need of a systematic and routine assessment of these thoughts and behaviors in adolescents assessed in mental health departments.

AB The multiple-family group intervention is an effective, yet affordable, 8-week treatment that is conducted in a juvenile correctional institution in Alabama with adolescents who sexually offend and their families. Data from 115 incarcerated male adolescents and their male and female caregivers collected at pre-, post-, and 1-year follow-up were used to determine that problem behaviors (internalizing, externalizing) decreased over pre- and posttest and the significant decreases in maladaptive emotion regulation predicted those changes. Adolescent-reported anxiety over abandonment and attachment dependence on parents increased significantly; these changes were predicted by decreases in maladaptive emotion regulation. Linear growth models were also fit over the 3 time points and indicate decreases in adolescent problem behavior and maladaptive emotion regulation.

AB Parent emotion socialization plays an important role in shaping emotional and behavioral development during adolescence. The Tuning in to Teens (TINT) program aims to improve parents' responses to young people's emotions with a focus on teaching emotion coaching. This study examined the efficacy of the TINT program in improving emotion socialization practices in parents and whether this reduced family conflict and youth externalizing difficulties. Schools were randomized into intervention and control conditions and 225 primary caregiving parents and 224 youth took part in the study. Self-report data was collected from parents and youth during the young person's final year of elementary school and again in their first year of secondary school. Multilevel analyses showed significant improvements in parent's impulse control difficulties and emotion socialization, as well as significant reductions in family conflict and youth externalizing difficulties. This study provides support for the TINT program in reducing youth externalizing behavior problems. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multilevel models are increasingly used to analyze hierarchically nested data, being especially appropriate in educational psychology because of the clustering of students within classrooms, classrooms within schools, schools within districts, and so on. The aim of this paper was to illustrate a step by step multilevel modeling of educational data. Data were based on 954 adolescents nested within 46 classrooms. Relationships of daily stress to life satisfaction, socio-emotional problems, and stress of interaction with teacher were analyzed. Results showed that students with high daily stress tend to present lower life satisfaction and more socio-emotional problems. As well, stress of interaction with teacher occurring at the classroom level is positively related to stress at the student level.

The questionnaire was administered to 770 university students. Internal consistency (McDonald's omega = .97; AVE = .54) was satisfactory. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an internal structure of eleven factors (since physical ability and fitness saturated in a single factor). Sex differences and correlations between self-concept factors and satisfaction with life supported criterion validity. Therefore, AUDIM is an appropriate instrument to measure multidimensional self-concept in university students.

AB BackgroundResearch associates maternal stress exposures (especially when occurring late in gestation) with heightened risk of subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in affected offspring. However, as yet, no study has examined the association between prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and affected children's risk of anorexia- or bulimia-type eating disturbances.
   ObjectiveTo study the influences of PNMS on later disordered eating in exposed offspring.
   MethodWe used the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT)-26 to measure eating attitudes and behaviors in 54 thirteen-year olds whose mothers had been exposed, while pregnant with these children, to the 1998 Quebec Ice Storma natural disaster regarded as a model of exposure to severe environmental stress. Mothers' stress was measured shortly after exposure to the storm using established indices of objective and subjective stress.
   ResultsHierarchical multiple linear regression analyses indicated that once variance owing to children's body mass index and sex was accounted for, stress exposures during the third trimester of pregnancy predicted elevated EAT-26 scores in affected childrenperhaps even more so when levels of objective stress were high.
   DiscussionThird trimester exposure to PNMS, especially when objectively severe, seems to be associated with increased eating-disorder-linked manifestations in affected early adolescents. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2015; 48:512-516)

   PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; INFANT TEMPERAMENT
AB Prenatal maternal distress is associated with an at-risk developmental profile, yet there is little fetal evidence of this putative in utero process. Moreover, the biological transmission for these maternal effects remains uncertain. In a study of n=125 pregnant adolescents (ages 14-19), ambulatory assessments of daily negative mood (anger, frustration, irritation, stress), physical activity, blood pressure, heart rate (every 30min over 24hr), and salivary cortisol (six samples) were collected at 13-16, 24-27, 34-37 gestational weeks. Corticotropin-releasing hormone, C-reactive protein, and interleukin 6 from blood draws and 20min assessments of fetal heart rate (FHR) and movement were acquired at the latter two sessions. On average, fetuses showed development in the expected direction (decrease in FHR, increase in SD of FHR and in the correlation of movement and FHR (coupling)). Maternal distress characteristics were associated with variations in the level and trajectory of fetal measures, and results often differed by sex. For males, greater maternal 1st and 2nd session negative mood and 2nd session physical activity were associated with lower overall FHR (p<.01), while 1st session cortisol was associated with a smaller increase in coupling (p<.01), and overall higher levels (p=.05)findings suggesting accelerated development. For females, negative mood, cortisol, and diastolic blood pressure were associated with indications of relatively less advanced and accelerated outcomes. There were no associations between negative mood and biological variables. These data indicate that maternal psychobiological status influences fetal development, with females possibly more variously responsive to different exposures. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background/purpose: It is common that intellectually gifted children (IQ >= 130) are referred to Received 25 January 2015 paediatric or child neuropsychiatry clinics for socio-emotional problems and/or school Received in revised form underachievement or maladjustment. Among them, those displaying developmental 16 March 2015 asynchrony - a heterogeneous developmental pattern reflected in a significant verbal-Accepted 17 March 2015 performance discrepancy (SVPD) on Wechsler's intelligence profile - are thought to be more emotionally and behaviourally impaired than others. Our purpose was to investigate Keywords: this clinical dichotomy using a cognitive psychopathological approach. Anxiety
   Methods: Trait-anxiety and emotional dysregulation were investigated in two groups of Child, Gifted referred gifted children (n = 107 and 136, respectively), a pilot-study of reasoning processes Deficient emotional self-regulation on extensive Piaget-like tasks was also performed in an additional small group (n = 12).
   Results: Compared to those with a homogenous Wechsler profile, children with a SVPD exhibited: 1) a decreased prevalence of social preoccupation-anxiety (11.1% versus 27.4%; p < 0.05); 2) an increased prevalence of emotional dysregulation (58.7% versus 41.3%; p < 0.05); and 3) an increased prevalence of pathological cognitive disharmony on Piaget-like tasks (87.5% versus 0.0%; p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The results support a clinical dichotomy of behaviourally-impaired children with intellectual giftedness, with developmentally asynchronous ones exhibiting more severe psychopathological features. This suggests that developmental asynchrony matters when examining emotional and behavioural problems in gifted children and call for further investigation of this profile.

AB Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has emerged as an indicator of how well the body maintains homeostasis and flexibly responds to environmental demands. Previous research has shown that smoking has both acute and chronic effects on RSA in adults. More recent work has focused on adolescent smokers because the natural decrease in RSA over the lifespan might be hastened by smoking at an early age. The goal of the current study, then, was to examine the acute effects of smoking on RSA and mean heart rate (HR) in a group of adolescent smokers. Participants completed two experimental sessions separated by 6-10 weeks, during which resting electrocardiogram (EKG) data were collected before and after smoking or not smoking a single cigarette ad libitum. Results indicate that smoking significantly decreased resting RSA and increased mean HR. In addition, those who smoked their first cigarette earlier in life (i.e., before age 8 or 10) evidenced a greater decrease in RSA during their smoking session relative to those who tried smoking after age 10. Importantly, these findings are largely consistent with the adult literature and suggest that smoking has acute effects on both RSA and HR in adolescence. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Epidemiological studies have highlighted a strong male bias in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however few studies have examined gender differences in autism symptoms, and available findings are inconsistent. The aim of the present study is to investigate the longitudinal gender differences in developmental profiles of 30 female and 30 male age-matched preschool children with ASD. All the children underwent a comprehensive evaluation at T0 and at T1. Our results have shown no significant interaction between time and gender for predicting autism symptoms, developmental quotient, parental stress, children's adaptive skills and behavior problems. Shedding light on the developmental trajectories in ASD could help clinicians to recognize children with ASD at an earlier age and contribute to the development of appropriate treatments.

AB Discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem have been linked with internalizing problems among mainly adolescents and adults. Longitudinal research on this association in children is lacking. This study examined the longitudinal link between self-esteem discrepancies and the development of internalizing problems in children. It furthermore examined the possible mediating role of self-esteem discrepancies in the longitudinal link between experiences of peer victimization and internalizing problems development. Children (N = 330, M (age) = 11.2 year; 52.5 % female) were followed over grades five (age 11 years) and six (age 12 years). Self-report measures were used annually to test for victimization and internalizing problems. Implicit self-esteem was assessed using an implicit association test, while explicit self-esteem was assessed via self-reports. Self-esteem discrepancies represented the difference between implicit and explicit self-esteem. Results showed that victimization was associated with increases in damaged self-esteem (higher levels of implicit than explicit self-esteem. Additionally, damaged self-esteem at age 11 years predicted an increase in internalizing problems in children over ages 11 to 12 years. Furthermore, damaged self-esteem mediated the relationship between age 11 years victimization and the development of internalizing problems. No impact of fragile self-esteem (lower levels of implicit than explicit self-esteem) on internalizing problems was found. The results thus underscore that, as found in adolescent and adult samples, damaged self-esteem is a predictor of increases in childhood internalizing problems. Moreover, damaged self-esteem might explain why children who are victimized develop internalizing problems. Implications are discussed.

DE Emotional problem; Behavioral problem; Disorders of sex development
   (DSD); Untreated; Indonesia
AB Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate emotional and behavioral problems among Indonesian patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) who recently came under clinical management. As diagnostic procedures and treatment had been delayed, patients progressively developed ambiguous bodies, difficult to conceal from outsiders.
   Method: We compared 118 Indonesian patients with DSD aged 6-41 years (60 children, 24 adolescents, 34 adults) and 118 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, and residential settings. We used the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), Youth Self-Report (YSR), and Adult Self-Report (ASR) to examine differences between patient and control groups as well as differences within patients groups.
   Results: On the CBCL, parents of young children with DSD reported significantly more emotional and behavioral problems than parents of matched control. Parents of daughters with CAH reported that their daughters withdrew themselves from social interactions. On the ASR, adults with DSD reported significantly more internalizing problems than controls, particularly anxiety and depression. No other differences in emotional functioning were found across different diagnostic groups.
   Conclusions: Indonesian patients with DSD who were untreated for most of their lives suffered more emotional and behavioral problems than matched controls. Differences and similarities between our findings and observations in patients from Western countries will be discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Family skill training programs have been recognized as effective strategies for preventing substance use. However, they have been evaluated mainly in high-income countries. Families in developing countries also face difficulties; therefore, it is important to explore the fit of existing programs in this context. The present study explores parents' perceptions and beliefs about changes following participation in the Strengthening Families Program 10-14, which was implemented in Panama by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Thirty parents who had taken part in the program between 2010 and 2011 were interviewed. Thematic analysis was conducted taking a participant-driven inductive stand. An exploration of parents' narratives suggested that, after the program, they observed changes in themselves as parents, in their children, in the interaction between the two of them, and in their functioning as a couple. Perceived changes centered on communication, limits, obedience, relationship roles, emotional regulation, and social development. For example, parents reported being able to control their emotions in a healthier manner, reducing the use of shouting and setting limits in a more effective way. All these factors have been recognized in previous research as strategies for preventing substance use. It is important to assess participants' perceptions of programs brought from elsewhere before dissemination efforts can take place. Parents interviewed for this study appeared to hold positive views about this program. This methodology is discussed as a means of evaluating evidence-based interventions in different cultural settings.

AB Experiments performed primarily with adults show that self-distancing facilitates adaptive self-reflection. However, no research has investigated whether adolescents spontaneously engage in this process or whether doing so is linked to adaptive outcomes. In this study, 226 African American adolescents, aged 11-20, reflected on an anger-related interpersonal experience. As expected, spontaneous self-distancing during reflection predicted lower levels of emotional reactivity by leading adolescents to reconstrue (rather than recount) their experience and blame their partner less. Moreover, the inverse relation between self-distancing and emotional reactivity strengthened with age. These findings highlight the role that self-distancing plays in fostering adaptive self-reflection in adolescence, and begin to elucidate the role that development plays in enhancing the benefits of engaging in this process.

AB Objectives: Children with hearing loss are at risk of developing psychopathology, which has detrimental consequences for academic and psychosocial functioning later in life. Yet, the causes of the extensive variability in outcomes are not fully understood. Therefore, the authors wanted to objectify symptoms of psychopathology in children with cochlear implants or hearing aids, and in normally hearing peers, and to identify various risk and protective factors.
   Design: The large sample (mean age = 11.8 years) included three subgroups with comparable age, gender, socioeconomic status, and nonverbal intelligence: 57 with cochlear implants, 75 with conventional hearing aids, and 129 children who were normally hearing. Psychopathology was assessed by means of self- and parent-report measures.
   Results: Children with cochlear implants showed similar levels of symptoms of psychopathology when compared with their normally hearing peers, but children with hearing aids had significantly higher levels of psychopathological symptoms, while their hearing losses were approximately 43 dB lower than those of children with implants. Type of device was related with internalizing symptoms but not with externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, lower age and sufficient language and communication skills predicted less psychopathological symptoms.
   Conclusions: Children who are deaf or profoundly hearing impaired and have cochlear implants have lower levels of psychopathological symptoms than children with moderate or severe hearing loss who have hearing aids. Most likely, it is not the type of hearing device but rather the intensity of the rehabilitation program that can account for this difference. This outcome has major consequences for the next generation of children with hearing loss because children with profound hearing impairment still have the potential to have levels of psychopathology that are comparable to children who are normally hearing.

Samples of 150 adolescents (75 males and 75 females) in the age range of 16-18 years, studying in 11th and 12th standard were selected from four English medium schools of Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. Global Adjustment Scale developed by Psy-Com Services (1994) was used for measuring emotional adjustment among the selected sample of adolescent boys and girls. A 2*2*2 analysis of variance with unequal replicates was carried out to see the independent and interactive effect of gender, family size and birth order on emotional adjustment of adolescents. Results revealed that gender has established significant effect on emotional adjustment of adolescent with boys having significantly better emotional adjustment as compared to girls. Furthermore, findings also reported that family size and birth order does not seem to play its significant role on emotional adjustment of adolescents in Himachal Pradesh.

AB The present study is informed by the theory of allostatic load to examine how multiple stress responsive biomarkers are related to mental health outcomes. Data are from the TRAILS study, a large prospective population study of 715 Dutch adolescents (50.9 % girls), assessed at 16.3 and 19.1 years. Reactivity measures of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) biomarkers (heart rate, HR; respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA; and pre-ejection period, PEP) to a social stress task were used to predict concurrent and longitudinal changes in internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed relatively few single effects for each biomarker with the exception that high HR reactivity predicted concurrent internalizing problems in boys. More interestingly, interactions were found between HPA-axis reactivity and sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity. Boys with high HPA reactivity and low RSA reactivity had the largest increases in internalizing problems from 16 to 19 years. Youth with low HPA reactivity along with increased ANS activation characterized by both decreases in RSA and decreases in PEP had the most concurrent externalizing problems, consistent with broad theories of hypo-arousal. Youth with high HPA reactivity along with increases in RSA but decreases in PEP also had elevated concurrent externalizing problems, which increased over time, especially within boys. This profile illustrates the utility of examining the parasympathetic and sympathetic components of the ANS which can act in opposition to one another to achieve, overall, stress responsivity. The framework of allostasis and allostatic load is supported in that examination of multiple biomarkers working together in concert was of value in understanding mental health problems concurrently and longitudinally. Findings argue against an additive panel of risk and instead illustrate the dynamic interplay of stress physiology systems.

AB BackgroundChildren with externalising problems are at risk of developing internalising problems as they grow older. The pathways underlying this developmental association remain to be elucidated. We tested two processes that could explain why some children with externalising problems develop internalising symptoms in preadolescence: a mediation model whereby the association between early externalising and later new internalising symptoms is explained by negative experiences; and a genetic model, whereby genes influence both problems.
   MethodsWe used data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Study, a 1994-1995 birth cohort of 2,232 twins born in England and Wales. We assessed externalising and internalising problems using combined mothers' and teachers' ratings at age 5 and 12. We measured bullying victimisation, maternal dissatisfaction and academic difficulties between age 7 and 10 and used linear regression analyses to test the effects of these negative experiences on the association between early externalising and later internalising problems. We employed a Cholesky decomposition to examine the genetic influences on the association.
   ResultsChildren with externalising problems at age 5 showed increased rates of new internalising problems at age 12 (r=.24, p<.001). Negative experiences accounted for some of the association between early externalising and later internalising problems. Behavioural-genetic analyses indicated that genes influencing early externalising problems also affected later internalising problems.
   ConclusionsOur findings highlight the role of genetic influences in explaining why some children with externalising problems develop internalising symptoms in preadolescence. Negative experiences also contribute to the association, possibly through gene-environment interplay. Mental health professionals should monitor the development of internalising symptoms in young children with externalising problems.

AB Neuroimaging studies using the social-exclusion paradigm Cyberball indicate increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right insula activity as a function of exclusion. However, comparatively less work has been done on how social status factors may moderate this finding. This study used the Cyberball paradigm with 85 (45 females) socio-economically diverse participants from a larger longitudinal sample. We tested whether neighborhood quality during adolescence would predict subsequent neural responding to social exclusion in young adulthood. Given previous behavioral studies indicating greater social vigilance and negative evaluation as a function of lower status, we expected that lower adolescent neighborhood quality would predict greater dACC activity during exclusion at young adulthood. Our findings indicate that young adults who lived in low-quality neighborhoods in adolescence showed greater dACC activity to social exclusion than those who lived in higher quality neighborhoods. Lower neighborhood quality also predicted greater prefrontal activation in the superior frontal gyrus, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and the middle frontal gyrus, possibly indicating greater regulatory effort. Finally, this effect was not driven by subsequent ratings of distress during exclusion. In sum, adolescent neighborhood quality appears to potentiate neural responses to social exclusion in young adulthood, effects that are independent of felt distress.

AB Background: Studies on child behavioral problems from low and middle income countries are scarce, even more so in Nepal. This paper explores parents', family members' and teachers' perceptions of child behavioral problems, strategies used and recommendations to deal with this problem.
   Method: In this study, 72 free list interviews and 30 Key Informant Interviews (KII) were conducted with community members of Chitwan district in Nepal.
   Result: The result suggest that addictive behavior, not paying attention to studies, getting angry over small issues, fighting back, disobedience, and stealing were the most commonly identified behavioral related problems of children, with these problems seen as interrelated and interdependent. Results indicate that community members view the family, community and school environments as being the causes of child behavioral problems, with serious impacts upon children's personal growth, family harmony and social cohesion. The strategies reported by parents and teachers to manage child behavioral problems were talking, listening, consoling, advising and physical punishment (used as a last resort).
   Conclusions: As perceived by children and other community dwellers, children in rural Nepalese communities have several behavioral related problems. The findings suggest that multi-level community-based interventions targeting peers, parents, teachers and community leaders could be a feasible approach to address the identified problems.

AB Background: Older youth in out-of-home care often live in restrictive settings and face psychiatric issues without sufficient family support. This paper reports on the development and piloting of a manualized treatment foster care program designed to step down older youth with high psychiatric needs from residential programs to treatment foster care homes.
   Methods: A team of researchers and agency partners set out to develop a treatment foster care model for older youth based on Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC). After matching youth by mental health condition and determining for whom randomization would be allowed, 14 youth were randomized to treatment as usual or a treatment foster home intervention. Stakeholders were interviewed qualitatively at multiple time points. Quantitative measures assessed mental health symptoms, days in locked facilities, employment and educational outcomes.
   Results: Development efforts led to substantial variations from the MTFC model and a new model, Treatment Foster Care for Older Youth was piloted. Feasibility monitoring suggested that it was difficult, but possible to recruit and randomize youth from and out of residential homes and that foster parents could be recruited to serve them. Qualitative data pointed to some qualified clinical successes. Stakeholders viewed two team roles - that of psychiatric nurse and skills coaches - very highly. However, results also suggested that foster parents and some staff did not tolerate the intervention well and struggled to address the emotion dysregulation issues of the young people they served. Quantitative data demonstrated that the intervention was not keeping youth out of locked facilities.
   Conclusions: The intervention needed further refinement prior to a broader trial. Intervention development work continued until components were developed to help address emotion regulation problems among fostered youth. Psychiatric nurses and skills coaches who work with youth in community settings hold promise as important supports for older youth with psychiatric needs.

AB Psychosocial stress, including stress resulting from racial discrimination (RD), has been associated with elevated depressive symptoms. However, individuals vary in their reactivity to stress, with some variability resulting from genetic differences. Specifically, genetic variation within the linked promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is related to heightened reactivity to emotional environmental cues. Likewise, variations within this region may interact with stressful life events (e.g., discrimination) to influence depressive symptoms, but this has not been empirically examined in prior studies. The objective of this study was to examine whether variation in the 5-HTTLPR gene interacts with RD to predict depressive symptoms among a sample of African American adolescent females. Participants were 304 African American adolescent females enrolled in a sexually transmitted disease prevention trial. Participants completed a baseline survey assessing psychosocial factors including RD (low vs. high) and depressive symptomatology (low vs. high) and provided a saliva sample for genotyping the risk polymorphism 5-HTTLPR (s allele present vs. not present). In a logistic regression model adjusting for psychosocial correlates of depressive symptoms, an interaction between RD and 5-HTTLPR group was significantly associated with depressive symptomatology (AOR = 3.79, 95% Cl: 1.20-11.98, p = 0.02). Follow-up tests found that high RD was significantly associated with greater odds of high depressive symptoms only for participants with the s allele. RD and 5-HTTLPR status interact to differentially impact depressive symptoms among African American adolescent females. Efforts to decrease depression among minority youth should include interventions which address RD and strengthen factors (e.g., coping, emotion regulation, building support systems) which protect youth from the psychological costs of discrimination.

AB The literature reports behavioral and socio-emotional problems in children born preterm that persist throughout adolescence and early adulthood. However, no study has simultaneously investigated emotion, attention, and effortful control. In the present study, we compared these abilities between children born very preterm (<29 weeks of gestation) and full-term children at 24 months of age by parental questionnaire and experimental design. Results on the questionnaire showed that very preterm children were rated by parents as having a higher level of negative affect and lower sustained attention than full-term children. Results on the experimental tasks revealed a distinct attention pattern between the two groups: The full-term children showed a peak of attention in the second trial while preterm children exhibited an unchanged level of attention throughout the task. The preterm children also exhibited greater difficulties in maintaining inhibitory control compared with full-term children. Taken together, the results observed in very preterm children clearly showed difficulties in key abilities which allow a voluntary self-regulation behavior and consequently, they should be considered to improve early intervention strategies.

AB Consistent results have shown a relationship between the psychological world of children and their perceived parental bonding or family attachment style, but to date there is no single measure covering both styles. The authors designed a statement matrix with 116 items for this purpose and compared it with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) in a study with 718 university students. After exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, five factors (scales) namely, Paternal/Maternal Encouragement (5 items each), Paternal/Maternal Abuse (5 items each), Paternal/Maternal Freedom Release (5 items each), General Attachment (5 items), and Paternal/Maternal Dominance (4 items each) were defined to form a Family Relationship Questionnaire (FRQ). The internal alphas of the factors ranged from .64 to .83, and their congruency coefficients were .93 to .98 in samples regarding father and mother. Women scored significantly higher on FRQ General Attachment and Maternal Encouragement and lower on Paternal Abuse than men did; only children scored significantly higher on Paternal and Maternal Encouragements than children with siblings did. Women also scored significantly higher on PBI Paternal Autonomy Denial; only children scored significantly higher on Paternal and Maternal Cares and Maternal Autonomy Denial. All intercorrelations between FRQ scales were low to medium, and some correlations between FRQ and PBI scales were medium to high. This study demonstrates that the FRQ has a structure of five factors with satisfactory discriminant and convergent validities, which might help to characterize family relationships in healthy and clinical populations.

AB Common causes of mental disorders are revealed by transdiagnostic perspectives. In this context, based on the study of Epkins and Heckler, the present study investigates common risk factors in depressive and anxiety symptomatics of children and adolescents. In a systematic literature search between 2012 and 2014, 35 studies were identified which demonstrated 44 common risk factors in internalising symptomatics in childhood and adolescence. Female gender, the onset of puberty, compliance with chronic illness, increased stress experience of children and mothers, negative parenting, misuse or rejective experiences in peers are evident factors in the developmental psychopathology of depression and anxiety disorders in childhood or adolescence. These common risk factors suggest a similar treatment of these diseases.

AB Objective:
   The purpose of this study was to examine the moderating influence of parental monitoring (e.g., unsupervised time with opposite sex peers) and adolescent emotional competence on sexual behaviors, among a sample of at-risk early adolescents.
   Methods:
   This study included 376 seventh-grade adolescents (age, 12-14 years) with behavioral or emotional difficulties. Questionnaires were completed on private laptop computers and assessed adolescent Emotional Competence (including Regulation and Negativity/Lability), Unsupervised Time, and a range of Sexual Behaviors. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the independent and combined influence of Emotional Competency and Unsupervised Time on adolescent report of Sexual Behaviors. Analyses were stratified by gender to account for the notable gender differences in the targeted moderators and outcome variables.
   Results:
   Findings indicated that more unsupervised time was a risk factor for all youth but was influenced by an adolescent's ability to regulate their emotions. Specifically, for males and females, poorer Emotion Regulation was associated with having engaged in a greater variety of Sexual Behaviors. However, lower Negativity/Lability and >1x per week Unsupervised Time were associated with a higher number of sexual behaviors among females only.
   Conclusions:
   Based on the findings of this study, a lack of parental supervision seems to be particularly problematic for both male and female adolescents with poor emotion regulation abilities. It may be important to impact both emotion regulation abilities and increase parental knowledge and skills associated with effective monitoring to reduce risk-taking for these youth.

AB In this study, we assessed whether an intervention designed to improve children's sibling relationships, the More Fun with Sisters and Brothers program (MFWSB), may also help parents manage their emotions more effectively. Families with at least 2 children between the ages of 4 and 8 years were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 50) or wait-list control (n = 34) group. Parents completed pre- and posttest questionnaires on sibling warmth and agonism, their emotion regulation during sibling conflict, and their global emotion regulation styles. Program participation had a direct effect on 3 of the 4 emotion regulation outcomes for mothers. Mothers in the intervention versus control group reported lower levels of dysregulation and suppression and higher levels of reappraisal at posttest, controlling for pretest regulation scores. Additionally, path models examining posttest responses showed that participation in MFWSB led to lower levels of maternal and paternal negative reactivity in the sibling context via lower levels of sibling agonism, controlling for pretest levels of negative reactivity. Alternate path models, with parents' emotion regulation as mechanisms linking MFWSB and sibling relationship quality, were tested but not supported. Results highlight the value of a sibling-focused intervention for promoting parents' abilities to regulate their emotions.

AB Although self-harm has been observed among patients with eating disorders, the effects of such tendencies on treatment outcomes are unclear. The current study employed structural equation modeling to (a) evaluate the relationship between self-harm and changes in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness in a large sample of patients (n = 2061) who underwent inpatient treatment, and (b) to examine whether the relationship between self-harm and changes in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness during inpatient treatment remains significant when controlling for change in negative affect during treatment. Results revealed that patients with a history of self-harm reported significantly less reduction in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness following treatment. Patients experiencing less change in negative affect also reported significantly less reduction in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness after discharge from treatment. However, the association between history of self-harm and reduction in body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness after treatment became non-significant when controlling for change in negative affect. This pattern of findings was also replicated among patients with a primary diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (n = 845), bulimia nervosa (n = 565), and eating disorder not otherwise specified (n = 651). The implications of these findings for delineating the specific role of self-harm in the nature and treatment of eating disorders are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Earlier use of tobacco in adolescence is associated with numerous adverse outcomes later in life. Although a number of studies have linked individual differences in affective functioning to adolescent smoking, these have relied primarily on self-report measures, and the contribution of different dimensions of affect to the onset of tobacco use during this period remains unclear. The current study examined these issues in a sample of 180 adolescents recruited from an ongoing prospective, longitudinal study examining emotional development. At approximately age 12, participants completed a questionnaire measure of affective temperament and took part in a family interaction task that was coded observationally to provide measures of dysphoric, aggressive, and positive behaviors. At 2 subsequent assessments, which took place approximately 2.5 years and 4 years after the initial assessment, participants completed a questionnaire measure of substance use. In total, 70 participants initiated smoking between the ages of 12 and 17. An earlier onset of smoking was predicted by more aggressive and less positive observed behavior during the interaction task, as well as lower levels of self-reported temperamental Effortful Control. There were no associations between dysphoric behaviors, or temperamental measures of negative affectivity or surgency and the onset of smoking. The findings add to a small body of literature demonstrating that behavioral components of affect can prospectively predict substance use in adolescence and suggest that different dimensions of affect show unique relationships with early substance use.

AB Introduction: Little is known about the neural correlates of mood states and the specific physiological changes associated with their valence and duration, especially in young people. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging is particularly well-suited to study sustained cerebral states in young people, due to its robustness to low-frequency drift, excellent interscan reliability, and noninvasiveness. Yet, it has so far been underutilized for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying mood states in youth. Methods: In this exploratory study, 21 healthy adolescents aged 16 to 18 took part in a mood induction experiment. Neutral, sad, and happy mood states were induced using film clips and explicit instructions. An ASL scan was obtained following presentation of each film clip. Results: Mood induction led to robust changes in self-reported mood ratings. Compared to neutral, sad mood was associated with increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the left middle frontal gyrus and anterior prefrontal cortex, and decreased rCBF in the right middle frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. A decrease in self-reported mood from neutral to sad condition was associated with increased rCBF in the precuneus. Happy mood was associated with increased rCBF in medial frontal and cingulate gyri, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum, and decreased rCBF in the inferior parietal lobule. The level of current self-reported depressive symptoms was negatively associated with rCBF change in the cerebellum and lingual gyrus following both sad and happy mood inductions. Conclusions: Arterial spin labeling is sensitive to experimentally induced mood changes in healthy young people. The effects of happy mood on rCBF patterns were generally stronger than the effects of sad mood.

AB Both positive affect and positive close relationships contribute significantly to overall well-being. This review examines the literature assessing associations between positive affect and positive indices within close relationships across the life span. Specifically, the reviewed research includes parent-child relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships in relation to a variety of positive emotions and happiness more generally. This review also highlights several processes that may serve as partial mechanisms linking positive close relationships and positive affect including the interpersonal regulation and coregulation of positive emotion and the biological processes involved in experiences of positive affect and close relationships. Throughout the review, evidence of bidirectional, reciprocal associations between positive affect and positive close relationships is emphasized. Based on the current state of the literature, future directions for research in this area are considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB When measuring attachment security, considering the developmental period of interest is imperative when deciding which measure of attachment to use. In the current review, we note a lack of fit between the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) - which is widely regarded as the gold standard for assessing attachment in adolescence - and the stage-salient experiences of adolescence. First, we explore how some of these normative experiences complicate assessment of attachment in adolescence. Second, we review the tenets of the AAI and detail its use with teenagers. Third, we investigate attachment in the context of multiple key developmental tasks of adolescence, including maintaining open communication, self-concept and identity formation, deidealization of parents, autonomy development, the shift of attachment behavior toward peers, and advances in executive functioning through development of the prefrontal cortex. After noting incongruences between those tasks and the AAI, additional weaknesses to using the AM in adolescence are considered, including: (1) the "generalized state of mind," (2) reliance on retrospectively reporting childhood experiences with parents, and (3) the apparent abundance of dismissing individuals. Considering the presented evidence, we resolve that the AAI - although a well-established measure of adult attachment - is not a good fit to the developmental stage of adolescence and thus, the development of other assessments of parent adolescent attachment is needed. We conclude by making suggestions for future assessments of parent-child attachment in adolescence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Despite findings of an association between adolescent psychopathology and perceived parental criticism, the relation between adolescent borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms and perceived parental criticism has not been examined. Given the centrality of interpersonal sensitivity to BPD (relative to other forms of psychopathology), we hypothesized that adolescent BPD symptoms would be uniquely related to perceived care-giver criticism, above and beyond other forms of psychopathology and general emotion dysregulation. Adolescents (N = 109) in a residential psychiatric treatment facility completed self-report measures of BPD symptoms, perceived caregiver criticism, emotion dysregulation, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Results revealed a unique relation of adolescent BPD symptoms to perceived caregiver criticism, above and beyond age, gender, and other forms of psychopathology. Findings suggest that adolescent BPD symptoms may have unique relevance for adolescents' perceptions of caregivers' attitudes and behaviors, increasing the likelihood of negative perceptions.

AB Gender dysphoria (GD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are associated. In 49 GD children (40 natal males), we examined ASD risk factors (i.e., birth weight, parental age, sibling sex ratio) in relation to autistic traits. Data were gathered on autistic traits, birth weight, parents' ages at birth, sibling sex ratio, gender nonconformity, age, maternal depression, general behavioral and emotional problems, and IQ. High birth weight was associated with both high gender nonconformity and autistic traits among GD children. Developmental processes associated with high birth weight are, therefore, likely to underlie the GD-ASD link either directly or indirectly. The present study is the first to provide quantitative data bearing on possible mechanisms that lead GD and ASD to co-occur.

AB To improve understanding of the development of self-injury, the current study was designed to determine the role that rejecting caregivers may have in conferring risk through development of maladaptive schemas, rumination, and specific motives for various self-destructive behaviors. Data were collected from undergraduates endorsing a history of self-injury who were raised by both parents (n = 228). The proposed model hypothesizing parental rejection influencing dual pathways of interpersonal and intrapersonal causes and motivations for self-injury was supported. Perceptions of greater parental rejection were associated with higher levels of both intra and interpersonal maladaptive schemas which, in turn, influenced corresponding intra and interpersonal motivations for self injury. Further, we found support for the expectation that the intrapersonal pathway was associated with greater depressive rumination and greater severity, recency, and variety of self-injury. Results are consistent with developmental models of dysfunctional caregiver relationships which disrupt the formation of healthy self views and adaptive emotional regulation capacities.

AB The incidence of major depression increases markedly during adolescence and early adulthood. There is therefore an increased need for effective emotion regulation (ER) capacities during this period. The present study explored the relative benefits of dispositional mindfulness compared to other commonly researched ER strategies, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression, in a sample of youth with major depression presenting to a clinical service. Results demonstrated that mindfulness is distinct from these other ER strategies and is associated with lower cross-sectional levels of depression, anxiety, rumination and dysfunctional attitudes, and improved quality of life. Greater dispositional mindfulness also predicted greater recovery from these symptoms. It was concluded that a greater tendency to use mindfulness as an ER strategy is associated with positive mental health outcomes and better quality of life.

AB According to the hedonic perspective of Positive Psychology and based on children's literature, the aim of the present study is twofold: to investigate the factors which could elicit a sense of wellbeing in children; to assess the impact of personal factors (non-verbal intelligence, positive/negative emotions and regulation of positive/negative emotions) on children's satisfaction in life. The participants were 132 Italian children between the ages of 8 and 11. Content analysis and quantitative analysis were conducted. Analysis of word associations revealed that the term wellbeing was associated with family, school, friendship, sports, the emotion of happiness, enjoyment, company, relaxation and feeling loved and protected. Analysis of specific typical associations revealed that females were more likely to describe wellbeing in socio-emotional terms (love/feeling safe) and boys in terms of play. Furthermore, the regression analyses showed that intensity of felt emotions had an impact on life satisfaction, while capacity to regulate emotions and non-verbal intelligence did not. It also pointed out the gender differences in subjective wellbeing: in boys the intensity of positive emotions triggered satisfaction with self; while in girls, the level of life satisfaction was explained both by high intensity of positive emotions and by low intensity of negative emotions. The results are discussed in order to highlight the importance of measuring and monitoring children's life satisfaction to foster optimal conditions of life and to prevent maladaptive adjustment.

AB Traumatic brain injury is a common cause of acquired disability in childhood. While much is known about cognitive sequelae of brain trauma, gender-specific social-emotional problems in children with mild traumatic brain injury is far less understood. The aims of the study were to investigate gender differences in social-emotional behavior before and after mild traumatic brain injury. Thirty-five 3- to 65-month-old children with mild traumatic brain injury and 70 controls were assessed with Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Social-Emotional. Nine months later, 27 of 35 patients and 54 of 70 controls were reassessed. We found that before injury, boys had more self-regulation and autonomy difficulties and girls had problems with adaptive functioning. Nine months after injury, boys continued to struggle with self-regulation and autonomy and new difficulties with interaction had emerged, whereas in girls, problems in interaction had evolved. Even mild traumatic brain injury in early childhood disrupts normal social-emotional development having especially devastating influence on interaction skills.

AB The study investigated the relationship among physical abuse, positive psychological factors including emotional competence and social problem-solving, and suicidal ideation among adolescents in China. The possible moderating effects of emotional competence and social problem-solving in the association between physical abuse and adolescent suicidal ideation were also studied. A cross-sectional survey employing convenience sampling was conducted and self-administered questionnaires were collected from 527 adolescents with mean age of 14 years from the schools in Shanghai. Results showed that physical abuse was significantly and positively related to suicidal ideation in both male and female adolescents. Emotional competence was not found to be significantly associated with adolescent suicidal ideation, but rational problem-solving, a sub-scale of social problem-solving, was shown to be significantly and negatively associated with suicidal ideation for males, but not for females. However, emotional competence and rational problem-solving were shown to be a significant and a marginally significant moderator in the relationship between physical abuse and suicidal ideation in females respectively, but not in males. High rational problem-solving buffered the negative impact of physical abuse on suicidal ideation for females. Interestingly, females with higher empathy and who reported being physically abused by their parents have higher suicidal ideation. Findings are discussed and implications are stated. It is suggested to change the attitudes of parents on the concept of physical abuse, guide them on appropriate attitudes, knowledge and skills in parenting, and enhance adolescents' skills in rational problem-solving.

AB First-generation youth experience significant levels of intercultural contact through the educational system which may result in acculturative stress and distress that impedes acculturating youth's development and requires further understanding of the factors that contribute to their resilience. The current study examines (N = 56) psychological and social well-being in relation to emotion regulation in the context of acculturation for youth. Results indicate that positive relationships with others, purpose in life, and environmental mastery relate to higher levels of emotion regulation. Moreover, youth attempting to maintain high levels of both cultures reported lower levels of emotion regulation indicating a conditional relationship with acculturation.

AB The present study uses longitudinal data to investigate whether differences in exposure to community violence discriminate among serious juvenile offenders in terms of mental health symptomatology for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and hostility. Group-based modeling and moderation analyses are used to assess the influence of exposure to violence on mental health outcomes. The results demonstrate a moderating effect of psychosocial maturity and social support between exposure to community violence and adverse mental health consequences for youth on the stable low exposure trajectory. In addition, youth who experience stable high exposure to violence consistently suffer worse outcomes. The study contributes to the development of empirically derived profiles of serious youth offenders. While all of the youth in this study may face the stigma of being labeled as dangerous, some (particularly those on the chronic exposure trajectory) might find themselves in a situation where their psychological status exacerbates an already tenuous situation: reentry. Therefore, reentry services should better target the specific needs of this returning subgroup of serious youth offenders.

AB In the past two decades, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) an index of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)-mediated cardiac control - has emerged as a reliable peripheral biomarker of emotion regulation (ER). Reduced RSA and excessive RSA reactivity (i.e., withdrawal) to emotional challenge are observed consistently among individuals with poor ER capabilities, including those with various forms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and those with specific psychopathological syndromes, including anxiety, phobias, attention problems, autism, callousness, conduct disorder, depression, non-suicidal self-injury, panic disorder, and trait hostility. Emerging evidence suggests that low RSA and excessive RSA reactivity index poor ER because they are downstream peripheral markers of prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. Poorly modulated inhibitory efferent pathways from the medial PFC to the PNS result in reduced RSA and excessive RSA reactivity. According to this perspective, RSA is a non-invasive proxy for poor executive control over behavior, which characterizes most forms of psychopathology.

AB Emotion regulation has an important role in child development and psychopathology. Reappraisal as cognitive regulation technique can be used effectively by children. Moreover, an ERP component known to reflect emotional processing called late positive potential (LPP) can be modulated by children using reappraisal and this modulation is also related to children's emotional adjustment. The present study seeks to elucidate the neural generators of such LPP effects. To this end, children aged 8-14 years reappraised emotional faces, while neural activity in an LPP time window was estimated using magnetoencephalography-based source localization. Additionally, neural activity was correlated with two indexes of emotional adjustment and age. Reappraisal reduced activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during down-regulation and enhanced activity in the right parietal cortex during upregulation. Activity in the visual cortex decreased with increasing age, more adaptive emotion regulation and less anxiety. Results demonstrate that reappraisal changed activity within a frontoparietal network in children. Decreasing activity in the visual cortex with increasing age is suggested to reflect neural maturation. A similar decrease with adaptive emotion regulation and less anxiety implies that better emotional adjustment may be associated with an advance in neural maturation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Social anxiety disorder represents a debilitating condition that has large adverse effects on the quality of social connections, educational achievement and wellbeing. Age-of-onset data suggests that early adolescence is a developmentally sensitive juncture for the onset of social anxiety. In this review, we highlight the potential of using a developmental cognitive neuroscience approach to understand (i) why there are normative increases in social worries in adolescence and (ii) how adolescence-associated changes may 'bring out' neuro-cognitive risk factors for social anxiety in a subset of individuals during this developmental period. We also speculate on how changes that occur in learning and plasticity may allow for optimal acquisition of more adaptive neurocognitive strategies through external interventions. Hence, for the minority of individuals who require external interventions to target their social fears, this enhanced flexibility could result in more powerful and longer-lasting therapeutic effects. We will review two novel interventions that target information-processing biases and their neural substrates via cognitive training and visual feedback of neural activity measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging.

AB The current study examined associations between adolescent respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during an angry event discussion task and adolescents' emotion regulation and adjustment. Data were collected from 206 adolescents (10-18 years of age, M age = 13.37). Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration data were collected from adolescents, and RSA values and respiration rates were computed. Adolescents reported on their own emotion regulation, prosocial behavior, and aggressive behavior. Multilevel latent growth modeling was employed to capture RSA responses across time (i.e., linear and quadratic changes; time course approach), and adolescent emotion regulation and adjustment variables were included in the model to test their links to RSA responses. Results indicated that high RSA baseline was associated with more adolescent prosocial behavior. A pattern of initial RSA decreases (RSA suppression) in response to angry event recall and subsequent RSA increases (RSA rebound) were related to better anger and sadness regulation and more prosocial behavior. However, RSA was not significantly linked to adolescent aggressive behavior. We also compared the time course approach with the conventional linear approach and found that the time course approach provided more meaningful and rich information. The implications of adaptive RSA change patterns are discussed.

AB Aims. Because no epidemiological study has been conducted of children's mental health problems in Kosova, which experienced a traumatic war in 1998-99, we conducted the first national epidemiological survey of children's mental health ever undertaken in Kosova.
   Methods. Participants were 1374 Kosovar children ages 6-18 recruited through schools (60% from urban areas). Parent-reported behavioural and emotional problems were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL/6-18). Kosovar findings were compared with findings from five other Central and Eastern European societies (Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Serbia and Croatia), plus the US.
   Results. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that the CBCL 8-syndrome model manifested good fit to the Kosovar data. Mean item ratings and Cronbach's alphas were very similar to those of the other six societies. Kosova's mean Total Problems score fell in the middle of the range of the seven societies compared. CBCL scores were higher for adolescents (12-18), urban children, and those whose parents had limited education compared with younger (6-11), rural, and more socially advantaged children.
   Conclusions. Strong consistency was found between Kosovar findings and those for neighbouring countries with respect to CFA results, mean item ratings, alphas and problem score levels. Results of this epidemiological survey highlight the utility of the CBCL for identifying Kosovar Albanian children with mental health service needs.

AB Purpose: Mental disorders are among the largest contributors to the global burden of disease. Since the cessation of the Sierra Leonean civil war in 2002, there have been few mental health resources available for war-affected youth. Co-occurring psychological problems are commonly reported by youth in the post-conflict setting, suggesting a need for evidence-based interventions that cater to comorbid psychological difficulties. This feasibility study outlines the implementation and evaluation of a mixed-methods approach for developing and piloting a culturally grounded group mental health treatmentdthe Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI)-for war-affected Sierra Leonean youth.
   Methods: Participating youth (N = 32; 50% female; ages, 15-24 years) were allocated to one of four gender-and age-stratified groups, facilitated by gender-matched Sierra Leonean interventionists. The intervention comprised adapted cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to address issues pertinent to war-affected youth. Analyses comprised assessments of reliable symptom change, mental health, functional adaptation, and interventionist fidelity outcomes.
   Results: The YRI was found to be acceptable, feasible and associated with reliable changes in internalizing and externalizing symptoms and improvements in functional impairments and emotion regulation (mean effect size, d = .64).
   Conclusions: Youth struggling with the mental health consequences of past trauma due to war merit special attention. The YRI presents a feasible and acceptable intervention for use in this low resource setting. A randomized controlled trial is planned to further test intervention effectiveness and scalability.

AB Qualitative interviews with 12 Mexican-American adolescent boys and two adult professionals contributed to understanding positive outcomes and resilience using a grounded theory approach. This study provides a cultural and contextual understanding of what it means to grow up well and the processes involved for the current population of Mexican males growing up in the US, who are at greater risk for poor outcomes compared to girls and other ethnic groups. First, the boys provided a definition of positive outcomes, which broadly involved becoming a good family provider. They saw themselves being able to provide by graduating from high school, going to college, and getting a good job. Next, the participants identified several aspects of the resilience processes that helped them to achieve. Support from family and friends were important to the boys because they provided direct help in reaching goals, they were indirect role models, and they could talk about problems. Finally, the boys also displayed individual attributes that were important to resilience and were related to being successful in school and getting a good job. Three individual attribute emerged: emotion regulation, confidence, and adaptability.

AB Objective To investigate whether adolescents who were born extremely preterm (< 26 weeks gestation), very preterm (< 32 weeks gestation), or with very low birth weight (< 1500 g) are more often bullied, and whether this contributes to higher emotional problem scores.
   Study design We used 2 whole population samples: the German Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS) (287 very preterm/very low birth weight and 293 term comparison children) and the UK EPICure Study (183 extremely preterm and 102 term comparison children). Peer bullying was assessed by parent report in both cohorts at school years 2 and 6/7. The primary outcome was emotional problems in year 6/7. The effects of prematurity and bullying on emotional problems were investigated with regression analysis and controlled for sex, socioeconomic status, disability, and preexisting emotional problems.
   Results Preterm-born children were more often bullied in both cohorts than term comparisons (BLS: relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07-1.50; EPICure: relative risk, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.19-2.41). Both preterm birth and being bullied predicted emotional problems, but after controlling for confounders, only being bullied at both ages remained a significant predictor of emotional problem scores in both cohorts (BLS: B, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.28-1.27; P<.01; EPICure: B, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.79-2.30; P<.001). In the EPICure sample, being born preterm and being bullied at just a single time point also predicted emotional problems.
   Conclusion Preterm-born children are more vulnerable to being bullied by peers. Those children who experience bullying over years are more likely to develop emotional problems. Health professionals should routinely ask about peer relationships.

AB Adolescent mental health has become a public concern, and it is necessary to know how problem behaviors affect academic achievement. The current study surveyed 12,672 adolescents in eastern China, and results indicated clinical cut-offs on each problem behavior. We then examined how internalizing problems lead to negative academic results. Findings suggest Attention problems are a key factor. Anxiety/depression and somatic complaints have no direct effect on academic performance but are mediated by attention problems. This study can serve practice of schooling and parenting, and provide basis for developing clinical intervention strategy in China.

AB With China's rapidly developing economy and increasing urbanization, many adults from rural areas migrate to urban areas for better paid jobs. A side effect of this migration is that parents frequently leave their children behind (left-behind children). This research investigated left-behind children's and non-left-behind children's psychological, behavioral, and educational functioning. Survey participants included 1,708 adolescents (54.8% female; mean age=15.03 +/- 1.93 years) from rural areas in Central China. Additionally, 32 left-behind children and 32 head teachers were interviewed. Data indicated that in comparison to non-left-behind children, left-behind children were at a disadvantage in regard to emotional adjustment (i.e. lower life satisfaction, lower self-esteem, and higher depression), but fared better in educational adjustment (greater school engagement). Mitigating factors which positively influenced outcomes of certain subgroups of left-behind children included the presence of one parent, increased parental contact, and shorter length of time since parental migration. Information gathered from interviews with LBC also indicated adverse effects of parent absence on children's development. Teachers identified education measures and support offered to left-behind children and reported difficulties in communicating with parents. Based on this study's findings, and considering the perspective of educators, implications for school-based interventions are explored.

AB According to recent meta-analyses, adolescents across different countries and cultures do not get the recommended amount of sleep. Extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, and use of electronic devices in the evening delay bedtime in adolescents. Early school start times also shorten the time for sleep. Insufficient sleep in adolescents has been associated with weakened emotional-behavioral regulation and poor academic achievement. Multicomponent intervention programs have been developed on the basis of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia to improve sleep in youth.

AB The negative effects and the continuation of cyberbullying seem to depend on the coping strategies the victims use. To assess their coping strategies, self-report questionnaires (SRQs) are used. However, these SRQs are often subject to several shortcomings: the (single and topological) categorizations used in SRQs do not always adequately differentiate among various coping responses, in addition the strategies of general SRQs fail to accurately measure coping with cyberbullying. This study is therefore aimed to develop a SRQ that specifically measures coping with cyberbullying (i.e., Cyberbullying Coping Questionnaire; CCQ) and to discover whether other, not single and topological, categorizations of coping strategies can be found. Based on previous SRQs used in the (cyber) bullying (i.e., traditional and cyberbullying) literature (i.e., 49 studies were found with three different SRQs measuring coping with traditional bullying, cyberbullying or (cyber) bullying) items and categorizations were selected, compared and merged into a new questionnaire. In compliance with recommendations from the classical test-theory, a principal component analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis were done, and a final model was constructed. Seventeen items loaded onto four different coping categorizations: mental-, passive-, social-, and confrontational-coping. The CCQ appeared to have good internal consistency, acceptable test-retest reliability, good discriminant validity and the development of the CCQ fulfilled many of the recommendations from classical test-theory. The CCQ omits working in single and topological categorizations and measures cognitive, behavioral, approach and avoidance strategies.

AB Adolescents' beliefs about family obligation often reflect cultural variations in their family context, and thus are important for understanding development among diverse youth. In this study, we test hypotheses about the role of family obligation values in risk behavior and mental health in a sample of 194 low-income adolescent girls (mean age = 15.2; 58 % Latina, 28 % African-American/Black). We hypothesized that family obligation values can be both a protective and vulnerability factor, depending on the type of outcome and the presence of other risk factors. Across the sample, higher family obligation values tended to occur with indicators of positive family functioning (e.g., more frequent communication, less maternal hostility) based on mother and adolescent reports. As hypothesized, family obligation values moderated the relationship between established risk factors and adjustment in distinct ways, such that high family obligation values decreased risk in some domains (i.e., a protective factor) but increased risk in other domains (i.e., a vulnerability factor). Specifically, high family obligation values diminished the relationship between peer norms for risky behavior (sex and substance use) and individual engagement in those behaviors. At the same time, high family obligation values magnified the relationship between exposure to negative life events and poor mental health (PTSD and depressive symptoms). The results suggest that family obligation is an important but complex aspect of development among diverse adolescent girls.

AB School climate is a complex and multifaceted construct, and there are varying perspectives regarding the precise factors that comprise this construct. The two aims of this study were to examine the empirical structure of an existing school climate measure and to test the relations between specific school climate factors and emotional problems, conduct problems, and peer victimization (i.e., bullying). Using a sample of 2,108 middle school grade students (grades 6-8) from ten schools randomly split into two analytic samples, three factors (Authoritative Structure, Student Order, and Student Support) emerged in exploratory factor analyses and were cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis. Using the combined sample, student perceptions of classroom orderliness and the authoritative actions of teachers and school staff were each uniquely and inversely related to emotional and conduct problems as well as victimization. Potential theoretical and clinical implications for school-based interventions targeting school climate and related outcomes in middle school are discussed.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine relationships between child eating self-regulation, child non-eating self-regulation, and child BMIz in a low-income sample of Hispanic families with preschoolers. The eating in the absence of hunger task as well as parent-report of child satiety responsiveness and food responsiveness were used to assess child eating self-regulation. Two laboratory tasks assessing executive functioning, a parent questionnaire assessing child effortful control (a temperament dimension related to executive functioning), and the delay of gratification and gift delay tasks assessing child emotion regulation were used to assess child non-eating self-regulation. Bivariate correlations were run among all variables in the study. Hierarchical linear regression analyses assessed: (1) child eating selfregulation associations with the demographic, executive functioning, effortful control, and emotion regulation measures; and (2) child BMI z-score associations with executive functioning, effortful control, emotion regulation measures, and eating self-regulation measures. Within child eating self-regulation, only the two parent-report measures were related. Low to moderate positive correlations were found between measures of executive functioning, effortful control, and emotion regulation. Only three relationships were found between child eating self-regulation and other forms of child self-regulation: eating in the absence of hunger was positively associated with delay of gratification, and poor regulation on the gift delay task was associated positively with maternal reports of food responsiveness and negatively with parent-reports of satiety responsiveness. Regression analyses showed that child eating selfregulation was associated with child BMIz but other forms of child self-regulation were not. Implications for understanding the role of self-regulation in the development of child obesity are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. Active parental involvement, parental support in the diabetes management and family functioning are associated with optimal diabetes management and glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to assess parental satisfaction with participation in the group and their perceptions of the impact of the intervention on living and coping with childrens T1D.
   Methods. A sample of 34 parents of children with T1D participated in this trend study. The participants' experience and satisfaction with support group was measured by a self-evaluation questionnaire, designed for the purpose of the present study.
   Results. Quantitative data show that parents were overall satisfied with almost all measured items of the evaluation questionnaire (wellbeing in the group, feeling secure, experiencing new things, being able to talk and feeling being heard) during the 4-year period. However, parents from the second and third season, on average, found that the support group has better fulfilled their expectations than the parents from the first season (p = 0,010). The qualitative analysis of the participants' responses to the open-ended questions was underpinned by four themes: support when confronting the diagnosis, transformation of the family dynamics, me as a parent, exchange of experience and good practice and facing the world outside the family.
   Discussion. The presented parent support group showed to be a promising supportive, therapeutic and psychoeducative space where parents could strengthen their role in the upbringing of their child with T1D.

AB Perceived ethnic discrimination (PED) is associated with increased engagement in risky behaviors in ethnic minority emerging adults. Risky behaviors may reflect efforts to cope with emotional distress like depression or anxiety resulting from PED, particularly for individuals with poor emotion regulation skills. We hypothesized that the association between FED and risky behaviors would be particularly strong for emerging adults with tendencies for angry rumination. We further hypothesized that increased depressive and anxious symptoms would mediate the effect of the PED-rumination interaction on risky behaviors. In this survey study, 155 ethnic minority college students completed measures of PED, depressive and anxiety symptoms, trait angry rumination, and risky behaviors. Analyses revealed that angry rumination moderated the association between FED and greater risky behaviors. Depressive and anxiety symptoms did not mediate this effect. Although cross-sectional, these findings suggest that individuals with poor coping skills may be especially likely to respond to stressors such as PED by engaging in risky behaviors. Implications include using rumination-focused interventions in order to prevent engagement in risky behaviors in ethnic minority emerging adults. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Psychopathy is a clinical condition characterized by a failure in normal social interaction and morality. Recent studies have begun to reveal brain structural abnormalities associated with psychopathic tendencies in children. However, little is known about whether variations in brain morphology are linked to the developmental trajectory of psychopathic traits over time. In this study, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data from 108 14-year-old adolescents with no history of substance abuse (54 males and 54 females) were examined to detect cortical thickness variations associated with psychopathic traits and individual rates of change in psychopathic traits from ages 9 to 18. We found cortical thickness abnormalities to correlate with psychopathic traits both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Specifically, at age 14, higher psychopathic scores were correlated with thinner cortex in the middle frontal gyrus, particularly in females, and thicker cortex in the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus, particularly in males. Longitudinally, individual rates of change in psychopathic tendency over time were correlated with thicker cortex in the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus, particularly in males. Findings suggest that abnormal cortical thickness may reflect a delay in brain maturation, resulting in disturbances in frontal and temporal functioning such as impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and emotional dysregulation in adolescents. Thus, findings provide initial evidence supporting that abnormal cortical thickness may serve as a biomarker for the development of psychopathic propensity in adolescents.

ID BETRAYAL
AB In the growing research literature on nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality (SA), there are many questions still unresolved about the role played by exposure to traumatic stressors (including but not limited to childhood maltreatment) and posttraumatic disorders (including dissociative features and disorders). In this special issue of the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation, a review article and 4 empirical studies attempt to provide additional insight into the relationship of traumatization and dissociation to NSSI and SA. The review article describes similarities and differences in the relationships that have been empirically documented between trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress or dissociative symptoms with NSSI versus SA and highlights the need for research to identify and test integrative clinical constructs, such as emotion dysregulation, in order to develop systematic risk, assessment, and intervention models. The empirical reports provide illustrative examples of conceptually and clinically integrated research on traumatic stress, dissociation, and NSSI and SA. Their findings offer a more nuanced picture of the potential role of different forms and degrees of dissociation in SA and NSSI and suggest that dissociation and emotion dysregulation may play a mediating role linking childhood maltreatment and adult or adolescent NSSI. In this introduction, we briefly summarize key points from the special issue articles and point out directions that their findings suggest for future research, including incorporating multiple predictors in studies of NSSI and SA, utilizing longitudinal studies to assess the etiology and course of NSSI and SA, and sampling diverse populations.

AB To date, scholars have established associations among nonsuicidal self-injury and sexual abuse, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and dissociation. However, leading theoretical models of the mechanisms underlying the association between trauma and negative outcomes suggest a more parsimonious explanation in that deficits in emotion regulation may underlie these various risk factors for self-injury. This study examined whether sexual abuse was differentially associated with nonsuicidal self-injury over and above other forms of traumatic experiences and whether the association between sexual abuse and self-injury was statistically mediated by emotion dysregulation and dissociation. Participants included 525 youth (392 boys, 133 girls) recruited from the U.S. juvenile justice system who completed measures of self-reported trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, dissociation, and emotion dysregulation. Results of a hierarchical regression demonstrated that sexual abuse predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms and self-injury over and above other forms of traumatic experiences. Results of bootstrapped mediation analyses indicated that emotion dysregulation and dissociation in combination were implicated in self-injury among youth. The results suggest that youth in the juvenile justice system who experience sexual abuse may be at risk for higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms and that self-injury may be particularly salient for youth who experience sexual abuse. Furthermore, the results shed light on the role that dissociation and emotion dysregulation play in the relation between sexual abuse and self-injury, suggesting that a larger framework of self-regulation may have both empirical and clinical utility in helping to understand the underlying processes at play in these associations.

AB Background: The use of neuropsychiatric Patient Centred Outcome Measures (PCOMs) in routine child mental health and paediatric services is very time consuming and often requires multiple scales being completed as no single scale covers all areas of psychopathology. The use of a web-based programme can overcome these problems and contribute to improved use of PCOMs in clinical practice. We aim to develop a web-based scale (using HealthTracker (TM)) to screen and identify young people with significant neuropsychiatric symptoms to enable early intervention.
   Methods: Qualitative development of the Profile of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (PONS) and quantitative evaluation of the psychometric properties of the PONS scale (parent version). Parents of 929 from the general population and 147 with neuropsychiatric disorders (5-18 years old) completed the PONS online. In addition, those children with neuropsychiatric disorders were assessed for the presence of current and lifetime psychiatric disorders using the Development and Well- Being Assessment (DAWBA).
   Results: The PONS scale (parent version) consists of 30 symptom domains rated on a 7-point scale for both frequency and impairment. We found an intra-class correlation coefficient for single measures was 0.44 (0.42-0.46 95 % CI, F = 22.84, p = 0.0001) and for average measures was 0.96 (0.95-0.96 95 % CI, F = 22.84, p = 0.0001). The factor analysis showed a 4-factor model: Neurodevelopmental Disability; Behavioural and Emotional Dysregulation; Psychoses and Personality Dysfunction; and Anxiety and Depression. The receiver operating characteristic area for the 4-factors was 0.96 (SE = 0.006; 0.95-0.97 95 % CI).
   Conclusions: The PONS scale (parent version) is a web-based PCOM on the HealthTracker (TM) system that is a rapid, engaging measure that has excellent reliability and validity. The system allows for automated scoring and immediate feedback of statistical cut-off points and assists clinicians with diagnostic decision-making and optimises use of clinician time.

AB Background: In recent decades, researchers and clinicians have sought to determine how to improve the quality of life (QOL) of women with breast cancer. Previous research has shown that many women have particular behavioral coping styles, which are important determinants of QOL. As behavior is closely associated with cognition, these patients may also have particular cognitive coping styles. However, the cognitive coping characteristics and their effects on QOL in women with breast cancer remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to characterize cognitive coping styles among women with breast cancer and explore the effects of cognitive emotion regulation strategies on QOL.
   Methods: The Chinese version of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was used to assess cognitive coping strategies in 665 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and 662 healthy women. QOL of patients was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer Scale. Independent-samples t-tests were performed to investigate group differences in reporting of cognitive coping strategies. Multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the effects of cognitive coping strategies on QOL in patients after controlling for sociodemographic and medical variables.
   Results: Compared with control subjects, patients reported less frequent use of self-blame, rumination, positive refocusing, refocusing on planning, positive reappraisal, and blaming others, and more frequent use of acceptance and catastrophizing (all p < 0.01). The three strongest predictors of group membership were catastrophizing (B = -0.35), acceptance (B = -0.29), and positive reappraisal (B = 0.23). All nine coping strategies were significantly correlated with QOL in patients (all p < 0.05). After controlling for sociodemographic and medical variables, self-blame, rumination, and catastrophizing negatively affected QOL (all p < 0.05), whereas acceptance and positive reappraisal had positive effects (all p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Compared with healthy women, women newly diagnosed with breast cancer use catastrophizing and acceptance more frequently, and positive reappraisal, self-blame, rumination, positive refocusing, refocusing on planning, and blaming others less frequently. Catastrophizing, rumination, and self-blame may be not conducive to QOL of women with breast cancer and acceptance and positive reappraisal may be useful.

AB Interest in youths' experience of the various forms of bullying has grown due to the numerous social-emotional correlates associated with bullying. Only recently has there been consideration of the school context in light of these associations. The current study examined the overlap in four different forms of bullying that youth commonly experience (i.e., verbal, relational, physical, electronic), with the aim of understanding their association with social-emotional correlates (i.e., internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, retaliatory attitudes) and exploring associations with school contextual factors such as supervision, school physical disorder, and behavioral expectations. Self-report data on the forms of peer bullying were collected from 24,620 adolescents (Grades 9-12; M age=15.98, SD age=1.32) enrolled in 52 high schools. Latent class analyses indicated significant overlap in the different forms of bullying victimization, with youth experiencing multiple forms of bullying reporting the greatest risk for social-emotional problems. A series of two-level hierarchical linear models revealed that indicators of school physical disorder and a lack of positive behavioral expectations were associated with increased risk for multiple forms of bullying. Several gender and age differences were also observed in relation to the patterns of bullying experienced. These findings extend prior research by emphasizing a potential link between the overlap in different forms of bullying and school contextual factors, even after controlling for individual-level risk factors.

AB This study examined the early childhood precursors and adolescent outcomes associated with grade school peer rejection and victimization among children oversampled for aggressive-disruptive behaviors. A central goal was to better understand the common and unique developmental correlates associated with these two types of peer adversity. There were 754 participants (46% African American, 50% European American, 4% other; 58% male; average age=5.65 at kindergarten entry) followed into seventh grade. Six waves of data were included in structural models focused on three developmental periods. Parents and teachers rated aggressive behavior, emotion dysregulation, and internalizing problems in kindergarten and Grade 1 (Waves 1-2); peer sociometric nominations tracked "least liked" and victimization in Grades 2, 3, and 4 (Waves 3-5); and youth reported on social problems, depressed mood, school adjustment difficulties, and delinquent activities in early adolescence (Grade 7, Wave 6). Structural models revealed that early aggression and emotion dysregulation (but not internalizing behavior) made unique contributions to grade school peer rejection; only emotion dysregulation made unique contributions to grade school victimization. Early internalizing problems and grade school victimization uniquely predicted adolescent social problems and depressed mood. Early aggression and grade school peer rejection uniquely predicted adolescent school adjustment difficulties and delinquent activities. Aggression and emotion dysregulation at school entry increased risk for peer rejection and victimization, and these two types of peer adversity had distinct as well as shared risk and adjustment correlates. Results suggest that the emotional functioning and peer experiences of aggressive-disruptive children deserve further attention in developmental and clinical research.

AB Although associations between peer victimization in childhood and later psychopathology are well documented, surprisingly little research directly examines pathways accounting for these enduring effects. The present study addresses this issue by examining whether maladaptive responses to peer aggression (less effortful engagement coping and more involuntary responses) mediate associations between peer victimization and later depressive symptoms. Data were collected on 636 children (338 girls, 298 boys; M=8.94 years, SD=.37) for three consecutive years beginning in 3rd grade. Findings supported the proposition that peer victimization predicts lower levels of effortful engagement coping and higher levels of involuntary engagement and disengagement responses to stress. Moreover, these responses to stress helped to explain the link between 3rd-grade peer victimization and 5th-grade depressive symptoms. No sex differences in these linkages emerged. These findings build on prior theory and research by providing a more nuanced understanding of how and why peer victimization serves as an early risk factor for depressive symptoms.

AB ALTHOUGH THERE IS A vast amount of literature on emotion regulation strategies, few studies have examined the direct relation between parents' and children's emotion regulation strategies. Those studies, however, are mainly laboratory based. Little attention has been paid to parents' and children's emotion regulation strategies in a naturalistic context. In drawing upon a cultural-historical perspective, this study investigates how parents' and children's emotion regulation strategies are related in everyday family life. A total of 61 hours of video data were collected from four families in Australia. New context-specific emotion regulation strategies and five emotionally situated zones were found. Similarities in emotion regulation strategies used by parents and children were also found. It is argued that children's acquisition of emotion regulation strategies has its origin in parents' everyday use of their own emotion regulation strategies. This study contributes to our understandings of children's development of emotion regulation in the naturalistic contexts of family life. Pedagogical suggestions and future research directions are provided.

AB The current study examined the association between quantity, variety, and configuration,of developmental assets with risk behaviors (tobacco and alcohol use) and developing emotional problems (depressive feelings and suicidal thoughts). A sample of 12,040 high school students completed surveys investigating youth health and risk behaviors, and developmental assets. Independent one-step logistic regression analyses showed that adolescents reporting a higher quantity of assets, and possessing them in multiple domains, tended to have a lower likelihood of experiencing behavioral and emotional problems. The negative association between developmental assets and negative outcomes was more consistent when quantity and variety were taken into account simultaneously, thus supporting the configuration protective model. A sufficient amount of strengths, in an adequate number of different domains, seems to provide the strongest protection against negative developmental outcomes. The research and clinical implications of findings are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   analyses; Exploratory factor analyses; Nursing students; Thailand
ID STRESS; DEPRESSION; NURSES
AB Background: Rumination is one of the risk factors for mental health problems among nursing students. Rumination refers to repetitive thoughts focusing on negative emotions. There is a need to use an appropriate instrument to detect rumination to prevent the development of emotional problems. The ruminative response scale (RRS) is an instrument widely used to assess rumination levels in adult populations. It is inconclusive if the scale can be used for younger people like nursing students.
   Objectives: This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the 10-item ruminative response scale (RRS-10) in undergraduate nursing students.
   Design: A cross-sectional research design was used.
   Settings: This study was undertaken at one of the universities in Thailand.
   Participants: A sample of 747 undergraduate nursing students was recruited.
   Method: Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire, containing the 10-item RRS and Thoughts, Feelings and Experiences Questionnaire, and personal information. Exploratory/confirmatory factor analyses and correlational analyses were performed to test the construct and concurrent validity of the RRS respectively. Cronbach's alphas were used as parameters for the internal consistency reliability.
   Results: The RRS-10 had two distinct factors: brooding (moody pondering) and reflection (analysing depression-relating situations). Adequate model fit indices were obtained and significant factor loadings were observed, indicating acceptable construct validity. These two factors had significant correlations with emotional distress, depression, anxiety, and hopelessness, supporting concurrent validity of the scale. Cronbach's alphas were 0.71 and 0.73 for the brooding and reflection factors respectively, suggesting good reliability.
   Conclusion and recommendation: The RRS-10 demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties. Therefore, it can be used to assess rumination response style among undergraduate nursing students in Thailand. Future research can test the scale on nursing students or youths in other countries.

The first cohort participated in the Making Choices (MC) program, a second cohort participated in the Making Choices Plus (MC+) program, and a third (lagged) cohort received the standard health education curriculum. Pretest to posttest changes suggest both programs were associated with reduced levels of aggression and improved SIP skills. Gender-moderating effects were observedboys displayed significant reductions in aggressive behavior and significant increases in positive social goals, whereas girls' aggressive behaviors and social goals showed no significant changes.

AB The current study examines 3 alternative conceptual models of the directional associations between parent involvement in schooling (homework assistance, home-school conferencing, school-based support) and child adjustment (academic and social competence, aggressive behaviors). The parent socialization model tests the hypothesis that parent involvement contributes to prospective child adjustment. The child adjustment model examines the proposition that children's adjustment affects prospective parent involvement in schooling. The transactional model tests the hypothesis that parent involvement and child adjustment are reciprocally related over time. These models are tested with a large sample of low-income, racially/ethnically diverse children and their parents who were assessed in the fall and spring of children's 3rd and 4th grades. Overall, consistent support for the child adjustment hypothesis was found. When children were struggling academically, socially, and behaviorally, their parents showed higher prospective levels of homework assistance and home-school conferencing but lower levels of school-based support. Economic hardship also contributed to variation in levels of parent involvement and child adjustment, with child adjustment mediating the effects of economic hardship on parent involvement.

AB Proactive and reactive functions of aggression are thought to manifest through different familial and emotional processes, even though they often co-occur. We investigated direct and indirect pathways through which maternal criticism and emotion regulation (ER) difficulties relate to reactive and proactive aggression in adolescence. Further, we examined how maternal criticism and emotion dysregulation interrelate, both concurrently and over time. Participants were 482 Dutch adolescents (M = 15.03, SD = 0.45, 57% boys) who self-reported on their ER difficulties, perceived maternal criticism, and reactive/proactive aggression. Cross-lagged panel modeling across four annual measurements revealed direct bidirectional links over time between maternal criticism and emotion dysregulation. Positive links over time from maternal criticism to proactive (but not reactive) aggression were also present. Emotion dysregulation and proactive aggression were linked only indirectly via maternal criticism. Gender did not significantly moderate these links. By revealing differential developmental pathways involving adolescents' ER and maternal criticism, the present study offers support for the dual function model of aggression.

AB School bullying continues to be a serious problem around the world. Thus, it seems crucial to clearly identify the risk factors associated with being a victim or a bully. The current study focused in particular on the role that age and socio-economic differences between classmates could play on bullying. Logistic and multilevel analyses were conducted using data from 53,316 5th and 9th grade students from a representative sample of public and private Colombian schools. Higher age and better family socio-economic conditions than classmates were risk factors associated with being a bully, while younger age and poorer socio-economic conditions than classmates were associated with being a victim of bullying. Coming from authoritarian families or violent neighborhoods, and supporting beliefs legitimizing aggression, were also associated with bullying and victimization. Empathy was negatively associated with being a bully, and in some cases positively associated with being a victim. The results highlight the need to take into account possible sources of power imbalances, such as age and socio-economic differences among classmates, when seeking to prevent bullying. In particular, interventions focused on peer group dynamics might contribute to avoid power imbalances or to prevent power imbalances from becoming power abuse. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objective: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been found to play a role in the development of clinical complications. Hence, it is crucial to understand why some patients do well in terms of PROs and others do not and to identify these groups of patients. Sense of coherence (SOC), capturing a person's outlook on life, is associated with PROs in adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, we (1) examine how SOC develops in young people with CHD, (2) identify subgroups of SOC development, and (3) characterize subgroups in terms of demographic and clinical variables and PROs. Method: In this 4-wave longitudinal study, 429 adolescents with CHD (53.4% boys; median age = 16.3 years) completed assessments of SOC (SOC-13). PROs included quality of life (linear analog scale), loneliness (UCLA-8), depression (CES-D), and perceived health (PedsQL). Latent class growth analysis was used to identify clinically meaningful subgroups of SOC development. Results: Patients with CHD had a moderate SOC that slightly decreased over the first 18 months. Four subgroups of SOC development emerged: Consistently High (27%), Intermediate Stable (41%), Intermediate Decreasing (25%), and Chronically Low (7%). Subgroups differed in terms of sex and PROs, but not in terms of age, disease complexity, primary diagnosis, or surgical history. Conclusion: Patients with a strong and stable SOC over time showed a better adaptation than patients with a lower and/or decreasing SOC. Our results can guide the identification of patients at risk for adverse health outcomes and the development of interventions to enhance optimal living in patients with CHD.

AB The current study was the first to investigate the convergent validity of the Risk-Sophistication-Treatment Inventory-Abbreviated (RSTI-A; Salekin, 2012). Adolescent offenders (N = 63) were administered the RSTI-A and completed the RSTI-Self-Report (RSTI-SR; Iselin & Salekin, 2008) and measures related to violence, criminality, psychopathy, and psychosocial and emotional adjustment. The Risk for Offending, Autonomy, Criminal Sophistication, and Motivation to Change subscales were related to corresponding RSTI-SR scales. The incremental validity of RSTI-A Violent and Aggressive Tendencies and Planned and Extensive Criminality subscales to assess independent measures of aggression and delinquency above traditional adult-court transfer criteria and other risk measures was also supported. These findings provide initial evidence suggesting that the RSTI-A can be used as a research tool to assess multiple aspects of risk salient to disposition and transfer decision making, as well as recidivism and long-term offending patterns. However, further research is needed, as the measure is in the early phases of its development.

TI Forms of non-suicidal self-injury as a function of trait aggression
SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ADOLESCENTS; BEHAVIOR; RISK; HARM
AB To date, the considerable body of research on predictors of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has conceptualized NSSI as a unitary construct despite the fact that NSSI can exist in many forms (e.g., hitting, cutting, burning). The goal of the present study is to examine differential prediction of forms of NSSI. Specifically, we examined trait aggression as a predictor of more aggressive forms of NSSI (i.e., hitting). We hypothesized that higher trait aggression would differentiate those who engaged in hitting forms of NSSI from those who did not, whereas other factors (i.e., emotion regulation and trait anger) would serve as a non-specific predictor of NSSI. We also hypothesized that higher trait aggression would be related to lifetime frequency of hitting NSSI, but not other forms of NSSI, whereas emotion regulation and anger would act as predictors of other forms of NSSI. To test these hypotheses, a large sample of young adults completed measures of trait aggression, trait anger, emotion regulation, and NSSI behaviors. Results were generally in line with our hypotheses. Higher levels of trait aggression differentiated those who engaged in hitting NSSI from those who did not and was also associated with greater frequency of hitting NSSI. These results imply that different factors predict different forms of NSSI and that NSSI may be best examined as a multi-faceted construct. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundAnxiety control beliefs have emerged as a trans-diagnostic risk factor for anxiety disorders and a potential mechanism of change in cognitive and behavioral therapies. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between anxiety control beliefs and anxiety disorder symptoms following exposure to hurricanes in youth and test a developmental hypothesis about those associations.
   MethodsA large school-based sample of (N=1048) children and adolescents with a history of exposure to natural disaster were assessed with the short form of the Anxiety Control Questionnaire for Children (ACQ-C), symptom measures (PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder symptoms) and level of disaster exposure. Developmental differences in the association between ACQ-C scores and symptoms were tested, as well as the ACQ-C's ability to assess symptoms beyond level of exposure.
   ResultsACQ-C scores were associated with symptoms beyond level of exposure, but age moderated the strength of the association. Modeling the interaction suggested that the ACQ-C short had incremental validity beyond hurricane exposure in youth over 12 years.
   ConclusionsFindings extend previous work to a novel population of youth and add to the developmental understanding of the role of anxiety control beliefs in anxiety regulation. Age differences in the linkages between anxiety control and symptoms is consistent with a developmental model where low perceived control exhibited by younger children may be less indicative of problems with anxiety but may instead be related to normal cognitive development.

AB BackgroundLanguage impairments are associated with an increased likelihood of emotional difficulties later in childhood or adolescence, but little is known about the impact of LI on the growth of emotional problems.
   AimsTo examine the link between early language status (language impaired (LI), typical language (TL)) and the pattern and predictors of growth in emotional difficulties from school entry to the start of high school in a large cohort of Australian children.
   Methods & ProceduresUnconditional latent growth curves of emotional difficulties were modelled across four waves (ages 4-5, 6-7, 8-9 and 10-11) using data from 1627 boys (280 LI, 1347 TL) and 1609 girls (159 LI, 1450 TL). Conditional latent growth curves estimated the main effects of LI on the severity and slope of growth in emotional problems. Simultaneous multiple regression tested the interaction between language status and the other predictors of the development of emotional symptoms.
   Outcomes & ResultsLI predicted a significant persistent elevation in severity of emotional difficulties across childhood among boys (d = 0.33-0.57) and girls (d = 0.25-0.39) but was not associated with their growth. LI moderated the association between hostile parenting and the severity of emotional symptoms for boys and the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) and temperamental sociability on the linear and quadratic growth of emotional problems for girls but had no impact on the influence of other predictors.
   Conclusions & ImplicationsThere is no effect of LI on the characteristic rate and shape of growth in emotional symptoms across childhood although LI children maintain elevated severities of emotional difficulties. The associations between child reactivity, peer problems, prosocial behaviours, maternal distress and parental warmth and the development of emotional difficulties were the same for LI and TL children. LI enhanced the influence of hostile parenting on a higher severity of emotional symptoms for boys and of lower SES on a faster rate of development of emotional symptoms for girls. LI offset the usual protective effect of higher sociability and the usual vulnerability of higher social avoidance to a faster increase in emotional symptoms with age.

AB To investigate the differential emergence of antisocial behaviors and mood dysregulation among children with externalizing problems, the present study prospectively followed 317 high-risk children with early externalizing problems from school entry (ages 5-7) to late adolescence (ages 17-19). Latent class analysis conducted on their conduct and mood symptoms in late adolescence revealed three distinct patterns of symptoms, characterized by: 1) criminal offenses, conduct disorder symptoms, and elevated anger ("conduct problems"), 2) elevated anger, dysphoric mood, and suicidal ideation ("mood dysregulation"), and 3) low levels of severe conduct and mood symptoms. A diathesis-stress model predicting the first two outcomes was tested. Elevated overt aggression at school entry uniquely predicted conduct problems in late adolescence, whereas elevated emotion dysregulation at school entry uniquely predicted mood dysregulation in late adolescence. Experiences of low parental warmth and peer rejection in middle childhood moderated the link between early emotion dysregulation and later mood dysregulation but did not moderate the link between early overt aggression and later conduct problems. Thus, among children with early externalizing behavior problems, increased risk for later antisocial behavior or mood dysfunction may be identifiable in early childhood based on levels of overt aggression and emotion dysregulation. For children with early emotion dysregulation, however, increased risk for mood dysregulation characterized by anger, dysphoric mood, and suicidality - possibly indicative of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder - emerges only in the presence of low parental warmth and/or peer rejection during middle childhood.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine the role of father involvement on infant distress among children born to teen mothers, particularly those who are depressed. 119 teen mothers (< 20 years) and their infants (< 6 months) enrolled in a quasi-experimental trial of a comprehensive pediatric primary care program. Data were drawn from mother-reported questionnaires administered at baseline, before participation in the intervention or comparison conditions. 29 % of teen mothers screened positive for depression. Mothers reported that 78 % of fathers were engaged with their children, typically seeing them a few times per month, and 71 % took financial responsibility for their children. In a multiple linear regression, father responsibility predicted lower infant distress, maternal depression predicted higher infant distress, and there was a significant interaction in which father engagement buffered the effect of maternal depression on infant distress. Fathers may be a protective resource for children born to teen mothers, even as early as the first 6 months of life, potentially mitigating the heightened risk associated with maternal depression in the postpartum period.

AB Research examining nonpharmacological interventions for adults diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has expanded in recent years and provides patients with more treatment options. Mindfulness-based training is an example of an intervention that is gaining promising preliminary empirical support and is increasingly administered in clinical settings. The aim of this review is to provide a rationale for the application of mindfulness to individuals diagnosed with ADHD, describe the current state of the empirical basis for mindfulness training in ADHD, and summarize a treatment approach specific to adults diagnosed with ADHD: the Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) for ADHD Program. Two case study examples are provided to demonstrate relevant clinical issues for practitioners interested in this approach. Directions for future research, including mindfulness meditation as a standalone treatment and as a complementary approach to cognitive-behavioral therapy, are provided.

AB Purpose: To examine the changes in mental health difficulties in early adolescence between 2009 and 2014 in England.
   Methods: Analysis reports on data from two cross-sectional samples of adolescents (aged 11-13 years) collected 5 years apart in 2009 and 2014 in secondary schools across England. Samples were matched using propensity scoring, resulting in a total pooled sample of 3,366 adolescents. Mental health difficulties were reported by participants using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
   Results: Overall, there were similar levels of mental health difficulties experienced by adolescents in 2009 and 2014. Notable exceptions were a significant increase in emotional problems in girls and a decrease in total difficulties in boys in 2014 compared to 2009.
   Conclusions: The increased prevalence of emotional problems in girls mirrors a trend found in other similar studies, and the results are discussed in the context of recent economic and societal changes. The small decrease in total difficulties in boys, although promising, clearly warrants further research. (c) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This paper assessed the associations between sports participation and the development of psychological strengths and difficulties during childhood.
   Design: Two-year follow up study of a sample of 4042 Australian children who were followed from age 8 years to 10 years.
   Methods: Parents reported children's participation in organised sports, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Univariate general linear models were used to examine the association between changes in sports participation and psychological strengths and difficulties at 10 years, adjusting for psychological strengths and difficulties at age 8.
   Results: Children who maintained participation in sport had lower rates of parent-reported psychological difficulties at 10 years compared with children who dropped out of sport. Less internalising problems were also reported for children who participated in organised sports compared to children who dropped out of sports and children who did not participate in sports. These relationships did not differ by BMI, socioeconomic status, or parental education.
   Conclusions: Greater psychological difficulties are experienced by children who drop out of sports, and greater social and emotional problems are experienced by children who drop out of sports and who do not participate in organised sports. Due consideration should be given to the quality and implementation of sporting programs to ensure that they provide benefits to mental health. Due consideration should also be given to the potential psychological difficulties being experienced by children who drop out of organised sports as a higher level of psychological difficulties may be experienced prior to or subsequent to dropout (C) 2014 Sports Medicine Australia.

AB Objective: The objectives of this study were to model growth in anxiety and depressive symptoms from late school age through young adulthood in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and controls with developmental delay (DD), and to assess relationships among internalizing growth patterns, participant characteristics, baseline predictors, and distal outcomes.
   Method: Data were collected between ages 6 and 24 years in 165 participants (n = 109 with ASD; n = 56 with non-spectrum DD), most of whom received diagnostic evaluations in both childhood and early adulthood. Questionnaires were collected approximately every 3 to 6 months between ages 9 and 24 years. Parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Adult Behavior Checklist (ABCL), and Developmental Behaviour Checklist anxiety-and depression-related subscale distributions were modeled with mixed-effects Poisson models, covarying diagnosis, age, verbal IQ (VIQ), gender, and significant 2- and 3-way interactions.
   Results: Anxiety was positively associated with VIQ, and controlling for VIQ, both anxiety and depressive symptoms were greater in ASD than non-spectrum participants. Female gender predicted greater increases over time in anxiety and depressive symptoms for both diagnostic groups. Lower maternal education was associated with increasing internalizing symptoms in a subset of less verbal individuals with ASD. In exploratory post hoc analyses, internalizing symptoms were associated with poorer emotional regulation in school age, and with lower life satisfaction and greater social difficulties in early adulthood.
   Conclusion: Findings support previous claims that individuals with ASD are at particular risk for affect- and anxiety-specific problems. Although symptom levels in females increase at a faster rate throughout adolescence, males with ASD appear to have elevated levels of depressive symptoms in school age that are maintained into young adulthood.

AB Background: Mental health and psychosocial factors seem to influence the educational aspirations of adolescents, which are also known to be related to educational skills and sociodemographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and socioeconomic status. Previously, the relationship between educational aspirations and mental health, psychosocial factors, and educational and sociocultural conditions has not been investigated in Arctic adolescents.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the influence of mental health, psychosocial factors, and educational skills on educational aspirations among multiethnic adolescents in an Arctic sociocultural context.
   Method: The Norwegian Arctic Adolescent Health Study, which was conducted from 2003 to 2005, is a cross-sectional school-based survey. Individuals from the total population of 5877 tenth graders between the ages of 15 and 16 years were invited to participate in the study. Of this group, 4881 participated (response rate, 83%), 50.1% were female, and 10% were indigenous Sami.
   Results: Educational skills as measured by higher average mark were associated with higher aspirations; lower average mark was associated with lower aspirations. Weaker peer support and stronger parental involvement influenced aspirations in individuals with both higher and lower aspirations. Adolescents with lower rates of hyperactivity and inattention problems reported higher aspirations, whereas adolescents with emotional problems showed a greater inclination toward intermediate aspirations. In addition, males and Sami adolescents showed lower aspirations and were more likely to be located in more remote and northern areas.
   Conclusions: This study confirmed earlier findings that educational skills have a strong influence on educational aspirations. However, mental health as well as social, familial, and residential contexts must be addressed to foster adolescents' educational aspirations. Negative peer support for master's and vocational degrees should be addressed by families and schools. Gender, ethnicity, and religious affiliation had limited effects on the educational aspirations of the students in this study.

AB Studies regarding the relationship between attachment and psychopathology during adolescence have been performed separately for clinical and nonclinical adolescents and have used different assessment measures, which together might produce a methodological bias that increases the association between attachment and psychopathology. With the aim of avoiding this bias, the present study used identical measures to explore the relationship between attachment styles and internalizing or externalizing symptoms in clinical and nonclinical samples of adolescents. The sample consisted of 258 adolescents, 129 clinical and 129 nonclinical, aged between 14 and 18 years. The adolescents in each sample were matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Attachment was assessed using the CaMir Q-sort, and psychopathological symptoms were assessed by means of the Youth Self Report (YSR). The relationships between attachment and psychopathology were similar for clinical and nonclinical adolescents. A preoccupied attachment style predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms, somatic complaints, anxious-fearful behavior, verbal aggression, attention-seeking behavior, and thinking problems. Compared to previous studies, this research has made it possible to identify broader, stronger, and more specific associations between preoccupied attachment style and psychopathological symptoms in adolescents.

AB An observational measure of anger regulation in middle childhood was developed that facilitated the in situ assessment of five maladaptive regulation strategies in response to an anger-eliciting task. 599 children aged 6-10 years (M = 8.12, SD = 0.92) participated in the study. Construct validity of the measure was examined through correlations with parent- and self-reports of anger regulation and anger reactivity. Criterion validity was established through links with teacher-rated aggression and social rejection measured by parent-, teacher-, and self-reports. The observational measure correlated significantly with parent- and self-reports of anger reactivity, whereas it was unrelated to parent- and self-reports of anger regulation. It also made a unique contribution to predicting aggression and social rejection.

AB Background: Recent research has demonstrated that deficits in basic, self-regulatory processes, or executive function (EF), may be related to symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) already during the preschool period. As the majority of studies investigating these relations in young children have been based primarily on clinically administered tests, it is not clear how early symptoms of ADHD may be related to observations of EF in an everyday context. The preschool version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-P) was developed to provide information about EF through observable, behavioral manifestations of self-regulation, and is the most commonly used rating scale for EF assessment in children.
   Methods: Relations between symptoms of ADHD reported in the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interview (PAPA), and EF as measured by the BRIEF-P (parent form), were investigated in a large, nonreferred sample of preschool children (37-47 months, n = 1134) recruited from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The inventory's discriminative ability was examined in a subsample consisting of children who met the diagnostic criteria for either ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or anxiety disorder, and typically developing controls (n = 308). The four groups were also compared with regard to patterns of EF difficulties reported in the BRIEF-P.
   Results: Of the five BRIEF-P subscales, Inhibit and Working Memory were the two most closely related to ADHD symptoms, together explaining 38.5% of the variance in PAPA symptom ratings. Based on their scores on the Inhibit and Working Memory subscales (combined), 86.4% of the children in the ADHD and TD groups were correctly classified. ADHD symptoms were associated with more severe difficulties across EF domains, and a different EF profile in comparison to children with other symptoms (anxiety, ODD) and to typically developing controls.
   Conclusions: Early symptoms of ADHD were linked to parent-reported difficulties primarily within inhibition and working memory, suggesting that deficiencies within these two EF domains characterize early forms of ADHD. Our findings support the clinical utility of the BRIEF-P as a measure of EF in young preschool children with symptoms of ADHD.

ID DUAL PROCESS MODEL; GRIEF; COHERENCE
AB In an age of rising impact of online communication in social network sites (SNS), emotional interaction is neither limited nor restricted by time or space. Bereavement extends to the anonymity of cyberspace. What role does virtual interaction play in SNS in dealing with the basic human emotion of grief caused by the loss of a beloved person? The analysis laid out in this article provides answers in light of an interdisciplinary perspective on online bereavement. Relevant lines of research are scrutinized. After laying out the theoretical spectrum for the study, hypotheses based on a prior in-depth qualitative content analysis of 179 postings in three different German online bereavement platforms are proposed and scrutinized in a quantitative content analysis (2127 postings from 318 users). Emotion regulation patterns in SNS and similarities as well as differences in online bereavement of children, adolescents and adults are revealed. Large-scale quantitative findings into central motives, patterns, and restorative effects of online shared bereavement in regulating distress, fostering personal empowerment, and engendering meaning are presented. The article closes with implications for further analysis in memorialization practices.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents is a major public health concern. The first goal of our study was to describe the characteristics and functions of NSSI and NSSI thoughts in an adolescent outpatient sample. The second goal was to examine which clinical factors discriminate between these two groups of patients. A group of 267 subjects was recruited from the Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatric Services, Jimenez Diaz Foundation (Madrid, Spain) from November 2011 to October 2012. All participants were administered the Spanish version of the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI). A total of 21.7% of patients reported having engaged in NSSI at least once in their lifetime. The most strongly endorsed function for NSSI was automatic negative reinforcement. In comparison with patients in the NSSI Thoughts group and the control group, patients in the NSSI group scored higher in Internalization of Anger and in all the scales comprising the Children's Depression Inventory. Our findings on the prevalence and functions of NSSI are consistent with the literature. NSSI was mainly performed for emotion regulation purposes; specifically, NSSI seems to be used to cope with anger and depression. In addition, internalization of anger might play a significant role in the maintenance of this behavior.

AB Body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs; e.g., hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting) can cause significant physical and psychological distress. However, data examining BFRBs in non-clinical youth is limited. This study examined parent-reports of the incidence and clinical correlates of BFRBs in 315 Salvadorian children (4-17 years). Forty-six percent had at least one BFRB; nail biting was commonly reported (34.6%), followed by skin picking (24.8%), and hair pulling (10.5%). Of those endorsing BFRBs, 13.7% reported elevated distress and/or interference due to these behaviors, including approximately one-third of skin pickers and hair pullers (8.3% and 2.9% of the total sample) and one-fifth of nail biters (7.3% of the total sample). Skin pickers and hair pullers, but not nail biters, had higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, poorer adaptive functioning, and more difficulties with inattention, compared to those who reported no BFRBs. Skin picking symptom severity was positively correlated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Nail biting symptom severity was associated with increased internalizing symptoms, while severity of hair pulling was not significantly associated with behavioral and emotional functioning. These data suggest that BFRBs are commonplace and may be associated with behavioral and emotional functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study tested the mediating role of perceived academic competence and anxiety symptoms in the relationship between attachment security to the mother at the end of elementary school and achievement goal orientations (AGO) in the first year of middle school. The sample included 627 French-speaking youths (46% boys) in the province of Quebec, Canada. Results revealed two association patterns between attachment security and AGO. The first indicated a mediating effect whereby perceived academic competence mediated the relationship between attachment security to the mother and mastery goal orientation. The second indicated a sequential effect whereby attachment security predicted fewer anxiety symptoms, which in turn predicted the adoption of performance-approach and -avoidance goals. Results supported the hypothesized relationship between attachment security to mother and AGO, suggesting that goal orientations are partly explained by students' motivational and emotional characteristics. Results are discussed in relation to theoretical perspectives on attachment and achievement goals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   LABILITY; MODEL; BOYS
AB Introduction. - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents. It is characterized by age-inappropriate inattention/impulsiveness and/or hyperactivity symptoms. ADHD shows a high comorbidity with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), a disorder that features symptoms of emotional lability. Due to this comorbidity, emotional lability was long considered a secondary consequence of ADHD, which could arise under the influence of environmental factors such as inefficient parenting practices, as part of an ODD diagnosis. In this model of heterotypic continuity, emotional lability was considered not to play any causal role regarding ADHD symptomatology.
   Literature findings. - As opposed to this view, it is now well established that a large number of children with ADHD and without any comorbid disorder exhibit symptoms of emotional lability. Furthermore, recent studies have found that negative emotionality accounts for significant unique variance in ADHD symptom severity, along with motor-perceptual and executive function deficits. Barkley proposed that ADHD is characterized by deficits of executive functions, and that a deficiency in the executive control of emotions is a necessary component of ADHD. According to this theory, the extent to which an individual with ADHD displays a deficiency in behavioral inhibition is the extent to which he or she will automatically display an equivalent degree of deficiency in emotional inhibition. However, not all children with ADHD exhibit symptoms of emotional lability, and studies have found that the association between emotional lability and ADHD was not mediated by executive function or motivational deficits. Task-based and resting state neuroimaging studies have disclosed an altered effective connectivity between regions dedicated to emotional regulation in children with ADHD when compared to typically developing children, notably between the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus and the ventral striatum. Morphological alterations of the amygdala have also been reported in previous structural studies in children with ADHD.
   Discussion. - Emotional lability can result from different neurobiological mechanisms. In particular, bottom-up and top-down processes can be opposed. Bottom-up related emotional dysregulation involves an increased emotional reactivity, and is thought to be linked to the automatic evaluative activity of the amygdala. Top-down mechanisms are associated with the regulation of such activity, and rely on a prefrontal network including the lateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Since various neuropsychological impairments and alterations in multiple brain networks have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD, contemporary models emphasize its neuropsychological heterogeneity. It is therefore likely that some but not all children with ADHD will exhibit neurobiological alterations in circuits dedicated to emotional regulation, possibly at different levels. Future research will have to identify the different causal pathways and to decide whether emotional lability represents a criterion to subtype ADHD diagnoses.
   Conclusion. - Emotional dysregulation is now known to play a causal role regarding ADHD symptomatology. Along with executive functioning, reaction time variability and potentially delay aversion, emotional dysregulation should therefore be included in future theoretical models of ADHD, as well as in clinical practice when identifying the major impairments in this diagnostic group and when deciding therapeutic strategies.

AB Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face substantial challenges accomplishing basic tasks associated with daily living, which are exacerbated by their broad and pervasive difficulties with social interactions. These challenges put people with ASD at increased risk for psychophysiological distress, which likely factors heavily into social functioning for adults with ASD, as suggested by a growing literature on stress in children that indicates that children with ASD have differential responses to stress than healthy children. We hypothesized that adults with ASD and without intellectual disability (n=38) would experience more stress than healthy volunteers (n=37) and that there would be an inverse relationship between stress and social functioning in individuals with ASD. Baseline, semi-structured interview data from a randomized controlled trial of two treatments for adults with ASD were used to assess differences in stress between adults with ASD and healthy volunteers and to assess the relationship between stress response and social functioning in adults with ASD. Findings indicate that adults with ASD experience greater perceived and interviewer-observed stress than healthy volunteers and that stress is significantly related to social functioning in adults with ASD. These findings highlight the role of stress in adult functioning and outcomes and suggest the need to develop and assess treatments designed to target stress and coping in adults with ASD.

AB Several theories propose a relationship between deficits in autonomy and relatedness and the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Empirical work supports relationships between maternal BPD and adolescent symptomatology, as well as between maternal autonomy and relatedness and adolescent symptomatology. However, no study has examined how individuals with BPD differ from normative comparisons on autonomy and relatedness, or whether mothers' BPD mediates the relationship between their autonomy and relatedness and their adolescents' symptomatology. We sampled 28 mothers with BPD and their adolescents aged 14-17 years, as well as 28 normative comparisons matched on demographic variables. We assessed BPD as a categorical diagnosis and along a continuum of self-reported borderline features. In a videotaped problem-solving interaction, controlling for current major depressive disorder, mothers with BPD were less likely to promote and more likely to inhibit relatedness, and they were marginally more likely to inhibit but equally likely to promote autonomy with their adolescents. Mothers' total borderline features mediated the relationship between mothers' promotion of autonomy plus relatedness and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms (anxious depression, withdrawn depression, somatic problems, rule breaking, and aggression) and adolescent borderline features (affective instability and self-harm). Mothers' total borderline features also mediated the relationship between mothers' inhibition of autonomy plus relatedness and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms (anxious depression, withdrawn depression, somatic problems, and aggression but not rule breaking) and adolescent borderline features (affective instability and self-harm). We discuss findings in terms of light shed on BPD and the effect of maternal BPD on adolescent development.

AB This study tested Gross's process model of emotion regulation in a Chinese adolescent sample. It hypothesized that emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) would predict adolescents' perception of school connectedness and depressive symptoms. It also posited that school connectedness may be a possible mediator between emotion regulation and depressive symptoms. Participants were 504 adolescents aged 16-18 from two Chinese public upper secondary schools. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that reappraisal and suppression significantly associated with school connectedness and depressive symptoms, and school connectedness mediated the link between emotion regulation and depressive symptoms, even when the general emotion experiences were controlled. Although boys unexpectedly reported higher level depressive symptoms, the hypothesized model was invariant across gender except for the link between suppression and depressive symptoms. These findings demonstrate that it is meaningful to involve both emotion regulation processes and school connectedness in explaining adolescent depressive symptoms.

AB The current study explored the role of parents' negative and positive affect in adolescent respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) reactivity during a parent-adolescent conflict discussion task and the moderating effects of adolescent sex and age. Questionnaire data were collected from 206 adolescents (10-18 years of age; M = 13.37 years) and their primary caregivers (83.3% biological mothers). Electrocardiogram and respiration data were collected from adolescents, and RSA variables were computed. Parent affect was coded during the conflict discussion task. Multilevel modeling was used to distinguish the between-and within-individual effects of parent affect on adolescent RSA. Results indicated that observed within-parent-teen dyad anger was negatively associated with adolescent RSA, controlling for previous-minute RSA level, particularly among adolescents 13 years and older. In addition, observed between-dyad positive affect was positively linked to RSA for both boys and girls when previous-minute RSA level was controlled. Within-dyad positive affect was positively related to girl's RSA only. These findings suggest that expressions of positive affect may be related to better vagal regulation (RSA increases), whereas expressions of anger may be related to poor vagal regulation (RSA decreases) during social engagement.

   CHILDREN; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS
AB Objective: Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic multisystem disorder with various medical, cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric problems. PWS is caused by the lack of expression of paternal genes on chromosome 15q2-q13 due to a deletion (70-75%), uniparental disomy (25-30%) or imprinting center defect (<5%). The common PWS behavioral and psychiatric characteristics are very typical in all ethnicities and were reported worldwide. Still, each individual has a specific profile of these common traits and the severity of his or her symptoms varies over time. Behavioral problems are the most important factor affecting the quality of life of both the individuals and their families. There is a need for a standardized tool to assess the specific behavioral profile of each individual and its present severity, in order to enable physicians to tailor the specific treatment needed and assist in a more accurate clinical follow up. To the best of our knowledge no such a tool has been standardized and published. We developed, based on the literature (mainly Forster and Gourash's paradigm) and our clinical experience, a 37 item disease specific questionnaire, the "PWS Behavioral Questionnaire" (PWSBQ) for assessing behavior in PWS patients. The purpose of the present study was to validate this tool in the entire adolescent and adult PWS population in Israel.
   Methods: The PWSBQ focuses on five major domains abnormal emotional regulation, food-seeking related behavior, lack of flexibility, oppositional behavior and interpersonal problems and lastly body related behaviors.
   Caregivers of all Hebrew speaking individuals with PWS over the age of 12 years attending the Israeli national multidisciplinary PWS clinic were recruited. Of the 54 eligible individuals, 53 participated. They were interviewed with the PWSBQ and in addition filled the "Hyperphagia Questionnaire" and the "Child Behavioral Checklist" (CBCL).
   After verifying the questionnaire's content validity, all items on the PWSBQ were analyzed for internal reliability by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity was evaluated by correlation testing with regard to the Hypeiphagia Questionnaire and CBCL. In order to assess the questionnaire's interpretability, the correlation between the PWSBQ and the "Clinical Global Impression" (CGI) scores was evaluated.
   Results: The PWSBQ total score was positively correlated with both the CBCL total score and the CGI score (0.662 and 0.549, p < 0.001 respectively). Of the five domains, four had acceptable internal reliability (excluding the body related behaviors domain, which was thus removed from the total score). Criterion validity was established for the four domains remaining in the statistical analysis (abnormal emotional regulation, food seeking related behavior, lack of flexibility and oppositional behavior and interpersonal problems).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the PWSBQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of current behavioral problems among individuals with PWS. Although further research is needed in order to verify PWSBQ's ability to identify changes in the behavioral status of a given individual, it can now be used both in research and in a clinical setting, enabling the physician to plan the most suitable treatment based on the current behavioral status.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that the effect of body dissatisfaction on disordered eating behavior is mediated through self-esteem and depression. If the effect of body dissatisfaction on disordered eating can be explained by self-esteem and depression, treatment may benefit from focusing more on self-esteem and depression than body dissatisfaction. We also hypothesized body image importance to be associated with lower self-esteem, stronger symptoms of depression, and more disordered eating. The results showed that the effect of body dissatisfaction on disorder eating was completely mediated, whereas the effect of body image importance was partly mediated. Both self-esteem and depression were significant mediators. Body image importance and self-esteem had a direct effect on restrained eating and compensatory behavior. Depression had a direct effect on binge eating. This effect was significantly stronger among women. Depression also had a direct effect on restrained eating. This effect was positive among women, but negative among men. The results support emotion regulation and cognitive behavioral theories of eating disorders, indicating that self-esteem and depression are the most proximal factors, whereas the effect of body dissatisfaction is indirect. The results point out the importance of distinguishing between different symptoms of bulimia. Depression may cause binge eating, but compensatory behavior depends on self-esteem and body image importance. The results suggest that women may turn to both binge eating and restrained eating to escape awareness of negative emotions, whereas men focus on eating to a lesser extent than women. Existing treatment focuses on eating behavior first and mechanisms such as self-esteem and depression second. The results from this study suggest that an earlier focus on self-esteem and depression may be warranted in the treatment of disordered eating. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated informant agreement on emotional and behavior problems and social skills in youth with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability using meta-analytic methods. Forty-nine studies were included, consisting of 107 effect sizes. The mean weighted effect size across all raters and all behaviors was .36, reflecting moderate agreement. Consistent with meta-analyses in typically developing youth, pairs of similar informants (e.g., parent-parent) demonstrated higher agreement compared to pairs of different raters (e.g., parent-teacher). With all rater pairs combined, agreement was significantly higher for externalizing problems ( = .42) than either internalizing problems ( = .35) or social skills ( = .30). Several factors appear to moderate the level of agreement among informants, including the youth's diagnosis, age, and IQ.

DE adolescents; behavioural; evidence based; inpatient; TEIQue-ASF; yoga
AB Accessible summary This study examined if adolescents on a residential behavioural health unit would participate in a yoga intervention. Yoga has been used as a mind-body practice for more than 2000 years; however, studies are limited regarding its effects on adolescents with mental illness on an inpatient unit. Yoga was added, twice weekly, to the program schedule. Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Adolescent Short Form (TEIQue-ASF) scores were measured over 8 weeks. Additional measures included daily numbers of quiet times, time outs, and point card scores. Twenty-two adolescents completed the study. The TEIQue-ASF assessment was able to detect changes in total scores over 8 weeks. Increased yoga participation was related to higher values of the TEIQue-ASF subdomain of sociability, increase in weekly point card totals, a decrease in behavioural time outs, and a decrease in combined behavioural interventions at various time points throughout the programme. This study was relevant because it was conducted on an adolescent inpatient unit. It provides support that yoga, as part of a residential programme, is a feasible intervention for adolescents with mental illness. Changes in the various measures cannot be directly linked to yoga because of lack of a comparison group. Additional studies with a larger sample, and randomization, are needed to evaluate the potential benefits of yoga and to determine if changes to the TEIQue-ASF can be attributed to yoga or other behavioural-based interventions.
   Abstract Little is known about how yoga will impact behavioural health outcomes for adolescents with mental illness in an inpatient setting. This study examined if adolescents on a residential behavioural health unit would participate in a yoga intervention to address emotional regulation. A single cohort study design was used. Yoga was added to the programme schedule twice weekly. Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Adolescent Short Form (TEIQue-ASF) scores and additional behavioural measures were tracked over 8 weeks. Adolescents participated in yoga, with a higher participation rate for girls compared with boys. The TEIQue-ASF assessment detected changes in total score over 8 weeks. Increased yoga participation was related to higher values of the TEIQue-ASF subdomain of sociability, increase in weekly point card totals, and a decrease in combined behavioural interventions at various time points throughout the programme. This study was relevant because it was conducted on an adolescent inpatient unit. Further studies are needed to determine if changes can be attributed to yoga or other behavioural-based interventions. If supported by further studies, yoga has the potential to be a complimentary therapy that can be integrated into the multidisciplinary treatment approach for mental health patients.

AB Risk for suicide among adolescents remains a serious public health concern. Despite the relevance of individual differences in affective experience to clinically relevant problems generally, and risk for suicide more specifically, relatively little work has evaluated affect intensity in relation to adolescent risk for suicide. To address this notable gap in the literature, the current study evaluated the unique associations between dimensions of affect intensity and risk for suicide in a sample of 165 treatment-seeking adolescents ages 13-17 years. As predicted, low positive affectivity and high negative affect intensity accounted for unique variance in adolescent suicide risk. Findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical and applied implications of both positive and negative affect intensity in the context of adolescent risk for suicide.

AB The aim of the current paper was to review the most recent advances in the developmental aspects of borderline personality disorder BPD) over the last 3 years to highlight the most significant trends in the field. In so doing, we identify and discuss two exciting new trends: a) an emphasis on the biological basis of adolescent BPD and b) empirical evidence in support of long-held theories of the development of BPD. Together, these trends suggest that for the first time, empirical findings are beginning to emerge in support of complex and reciprocal biology x environment interactions over time in the development of BPD. We discuss the emerging literature and highlight the translational impact of this work for the assessment and intervention of adolescent BPD.

AB This article summarizes Carroll (Cal) Izard's contributions to theory and research on emotion competence and an emotion-centered preventive intervention program. Cal's contributions to emotion competence research began with some of the earliest studies of whether or not recognition and labeling of emotions relate to social and behavioral functioning. He also theorized about the adaptive use of discrete emotions, a construct Cal termed emotion utilization. He translated theory and research on emotions into seven principles for emotion-based prevention and intervention, and he applied these principles to a preventive intervention, the Emotions Course. The Emotions Course has been shown to promote emotion competence and reduce problem behaviors. The article concludes with recommendations to deepen the research base on emotion competence.

AB Epidemiological studies have shown that early life adverse events have long-term effects on the susceptibility to subsequent stress exposure in adolescence, but the precise mechanism is unclear. In the present study, mice on postnatal day 21-28 were randomly assigned to either a group or isolated cages for 8 weeks. The socially isolated (SI) mice exhibited a higher level of spontaneous locomotor activity, a longer duration of immobility in the forced swimming test (FST), significantly less prepulse inhibition (PPI) and an increase in aggressive (but not attack) behavior. However, acute stress markedly exacerbated the attack counts of the SI mice but did not affect the group housing (GH) mice. SI mice exhibited higher synaptosomal NR2A and NR2B levels in the hippocampus as compared to the GH mice. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices showed that the SI mice exhibited a higher input-output relationship of NMDAR-EPSCs as compared to the GH mice. Application of the NR2B-specific antagonist ifenprodil produced a greater attenuating effect on NMDAR-EPSCs in slices from the SI mice. NMDAR EPSCs recorded from the SI mice had a slower deactivation kinetic. MK-801, CPP and ifenprodil, the NMDA antagonists, reversed acute stress-induced exaggeration of aggressive and depressive behaviors. Furthermore, acute stress-induced exacerbation of attack behavior in the SI mice was abolished after the knockdown of NR2B expression. These results suggest that social isolation-induced increased expression of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus involves stress exacerbation of aggressive behaviors. Amelioration of aggressive behaviors by NMDA antagonists may open a new avenue for the treatment of psychopathologies that involve outbursts of emotional aggression in neglected children.

AB Mental health outcomes vary among maltreated youth, and the factors that impact variance need further investigation. The current study examined how maltreatment characteristics (age at onset, cumulative perpetrators, and cumulative types) and difficulties with emotion regulation (ER) predicted trauma-relevant symptoms among a community-recruited sample of female adolescents with histories of exposure to violence (N = 115; M(SD) (age) = 15.96 (1.56) years). To predict each trauma-relevant symptom (i.e. anger, anxiety, depression, dissociation, and posttraumatic stress (PTS)), a hierarchical two-step regression was conducted. For Step 1, maltreatment characteristics, taken together, predicted variance in four of five symptoms: anger, anxiety, dissociation, and posttraumatic stress (PTS). Above and beyond variance accounted for by maltreatment characteristics, age at onset predicted variance in anger, anxiety, and PTS symptoms. For Step 2, ER difficulties predicted variance in all symptoms. Findings highlight the need for further research about how maltreatment histories impact subsequent mental health. Results also suggest that ER difficulties should be increasingly considered in models of posttraumatic distress among maltreated youth.

AB Distinct behaviors such as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and firesetting may represent functionally equivalent attempts to regulate difficult affective/cognitive or social experiences during adolescence. This study examined possible mechanisms leading to NSSI, as opposed to firesetting, as well as co-occurrence of these behaviors. Participants aged 12-18 years (N = 2,356; 67.5 % female) completed self-report questionnaires measuring NSSI and firesetting, as well as socio-demographic and psychosocial factors including personality traits related to impulsivity and anxiety, negative life events, emotion regulation, and coping. The findings indicated the presence of general risk factors (e.g., negative life events and poor coping) that increase the likelihood that adolescents will engage in any of a range of maladaptive behaviors. The probability of at-risk adolescents engaging in NSSI was increased by psychological states (i.e., rumination and poor self-esteem), whereas socio-demographic and personality traits were associated with firesetting. Implications for prevention and early intervention initiatives are discussed.

AB Children with high levels of aggressive behavior create a major management problem in school settings and interfere with the learning environment of their classmates. We report results from a group-randomized trial of a program aimed at preventing aggressive behaviors. The purpose of the current study, therefore, was to determine the extent to which an indicated prevention program, Coping Power Program, is capable of reducing behavioral problems and improving pro-social behavior when delivered as a universal classroom-based prevention intervention. Nine classes (five first grade and four second grade) were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Findings showed a significant reduction in overall problematic behaviors and in inattention-hyperactivity problems for the intervention classes compared to the control classes. Students who received Coping Power Program intervention also showed more pro-social behaviors at postintervention. The implications of these findings for the implementation of strategies aimed at preventing aggressive behavior in school settings are discussed.

AB Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment that was originally developed for chronically suicidal adults. Since the publication of the original treatment manual, DBT has been reconceptualized as a treatment that is broadly applicable for individuals who have difficulties regulating emotion. As such, the treatment can be applied transdiagnostically. Based on the flexibility and adaptability of the treatment, several adaptations have been made to the original protocol. Considerable empirical evidence now supports the use of DBT adapted for eating disorders, substance use disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Moreover, developmentally appropriate adaptations have made the treatment applicable to youth samples. The current paper is geared toward practitioners and describes the various ways in which DBT has been modified for use with various populations and age ranges.

AB An increase in eating disorders and their diversity has been observed over recent decades. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge on the stage that precedes the onset of eating disorders, in which educative programs can prevent successfully these disorders. The present work attempts to describe the relationship between the risk of suffering an eating disorder and certain psychopathological dimensions, and to determine which of these factors contributes to putting the adolescents in a situation where they are at risk of suffering the disorder. A total of 404 students residing in Barcelona, Spain, and aged between 12 and 20 years, were studied. The students were given the Eating Attitudes Test and the Revised Symptom Checklist 90, plus a questionnaire on demographic and family details. A 25.2% risk of eating disorders was detected. This was significantly greater in girls between 12 and 15 years of age, although a high presence of eating disorders risk was detected in males compared to previous studies. It was observed that the group of adolescents at risk of eating disorders has significantly higher levels in all the psychopathological dimensions, mainly phobic anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity and somatisation.

AB This study aimed to investigate the relations of adolescent sexual experiences (particularly early initiation) to a spectrum of emotional/behavioral problems and to probe possible gender difference in such relationships. The 10th (N = 8,842) and 12th (N = 10,083) grade students, aged 16-19 years, participating in national surveys in 2005 and 2006 in Taiwan were included for this study. A self-administered web-based questionnaire was designed to collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual experience, substance use, and the Youth Self-Report Form. For the sexually experienced adolescents, their sexual initiation was classified as early initiation (< 16 years) or non-early initiation (16-19 years). Gender-specific multivariate response profile regression was used to examine the relationship between sexual experience and the behavioral syndromes. Externalizing problems, including Rule-breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior, were strongly associated with sexual initiation in adolescence; the magnitude of the association increased for earlier sexual initiation, especially for females. As to internalizing problems, the connection was rather heterogeneous. The scores on some syndromes, such as Somatic Complaints and Anxious/Depressed, were higher only for females with early or non-early sexual initiation whereas the score on Withdrawn, along with Social Problems that is neither internalizing nor externalizing, was lower for the sexually experienced adolescents than for the sexually inexperienced ones. We concluded that earlier sexual initiation was associated with a wider range of behavioral problems in adolescents for both genders, yet the increased risk with emotional problems was predominately found in females.

AB A gap exists in the literature regarding aggression in autism spectrum disorders and how this behavior compares to other groups. In this multisite study, the Children's Scale for Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive and the Aggression subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist were rated for 414 children with autism spectrum disorder (autistic disorder, 69%; pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, 24%; Asperger's disorder, 7%) and 243 clinic-referred children without autism spectrum disorder, aged 1-21 years (mean age about 7 years). Participants were not selected for aggressive behavior. Relative to the comparison group, children with autism spectrum disorder were reported to have less aggression and were more likely to be rated as reactive rather than proactive. Among all subjects, sex was not associated with aggression; higher IQ/adaptive behavior and older age were associated with more sophisticated types of aggression, while lower scores on IQ, adaptive behavior, and communication measures were associated with more physical aggression. The interaction between demographic variables and diagnosis was significant only for age: younger but not older children with autism spectrum disorder showed less aggression than clinic-referred controls.

AB This work had two objectives. First, to identify different profiles of emotional intelligence (El), and second, to verify the existence of significant statistical differences between the profiles identified in relation to social behavior. The participants were 1071 Spanish adolescents (50.2% girls), ranging in age from 14 to 17 years, who completed the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) and the Socialization Battery BAS-3. Cluster analysis identified four El profiles: a group of adolescents with a low El profile, a group with high scores in perception, a group with predominantly high emotional regulation, and a group of adolescents with high El. The results also indicated statistically significant differences in the profiles in most of social behaviors. The students from the groups with high general El scores and high scores in emotional regulation also show higher scores in several positive social behaviors. Findings are discussed in terms of their practical implications for Spanish adolescents.

AB IMPORTANCE Psychiatric disorders in youth characterized by behavioral and emotional dysregulation are often comorbid and difficult to distinguish. An alternative approach to conceptualizing these disorders is to move toward a diagnostic system based on underlying pathophysiologic processes that may cut across conventionally defined diagnoses. Neuroimaging techniques have potentials for the identification of these processes.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether diffusion imaging, a neuroimaging technique examining white matter (WM) structure, can identify neural correlates of emotional dysregulation in a sample of youth with different psychiatric disorders characterized by behavioral and emotional dysregulation.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using global probabilistic tractography, we examined relationships between WM structure in key tracts in emotional regulation circuitry (ie, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and forceps minor) and (1) broader diagnostic categories of behavioral and emotional dysregulation disorders (DDs) and (2) symptom dimensions cutting across conventional diagnoses in 120 youth with behavioral and/or emotional DDs, a referred sample of the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAM) study. Thirty age- and sex-matched typically developing youth (control participants) were included. Multivariate multiple regression models were used. The study was conducted from July 1, 2010, to February 28, 2014.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fractional anisotropy as well as axial and radial diffusivity were estimated and imported into a well-established statistical package. We hypothesized that (1) youth with emotional DDs and those with both behavioral and emotional DDs would show significantly lower fractional anisotropy compared with youth with behavioral DDs in these WM tracts and (2) that there would be significant inverse relationships between dimensional measures of affective symptom severity and fractional anisotropy in these tracts across all participants.
   RESULTS Multivariate multiple regression analyses revealed decreased fractional anisotropy and decreased axial diffusivity within the uncinate fasciculus in youth with emotional DDs vs those with behavioral DDs, those with both DDs, and the controls (F-6,F-160 = 2.4; P = .032; all pairwise comparisons, P < .002). In the same model, greater severity of manic symptomswas positively associated with higher fractional anisotropy across all affected youth (F-3,F-85 = 2.8; P = .044).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that abnormal uncinate fasciculus and cingulum WM structure may underlie emotional, but not behavioral, dysregulation in pediatric psychiatric disorders and that a different neural mechanism may exist for comorbid emotional and behavioral DDs.

AB Depression is frequently considered a disorder of impaired affect regulation with deficits across both positive and negative affective systems. However, where deficits in emotion regulation occur in youth, specifically regarding regulation of positive emotions, is relatively unknown. The current study tested whether deficits in broad (felt and expressed) and specific (up-regulation and maintenance) positive emotion processes are associated with youth depressive symptoms. Adolescents (n = 134; 65 girls) in grades 7 to 9 completed a self-report measure of depressive symptoms prior to participating in two parent-child interactions tasks, a rewarding trivia task and a problem-solving conflict task. During the interaction tasks, adolescent's overall self-reported experience and observed expression of positive affect (PA) was examined. Following the reward task, youth's ability to up-regulate PA (PA response) and maintain PA while buffering against NA (PA persistence) was explored observationally. Results suggested that reduced experience and expression of PA was associated with depression symptoms, but only in a context that elicited negative emotions. No association was found between PA response and depression symptoms; however, shorter PA persistence was associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Youth higher in depressive symptoms appear able to respond similarly to rewarding events, but fail to maintain PA and ward off NA when transitioning from a positive to negative task.

AB This study examined the influence of physical activity on the trajectory of depression from adolescence through emerging adulthood (EA). Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves I to IV), latent growth curve modeling was performed to assess how physical activity and gender influenced depression across adolescence and EA. Higher levels of physical activity in mid-adolescence were associated with lower levels of depression during mid-adolescence and slower inclines and declines in depression over time. Boys had lower levels of depression in mid-adolescence and slower inclines and declines in depression over time compared to girls. Findings provide evidence that current theories on understanding depression and mental health prevention programs may be enhanced by the inclusion of physical activity.

AB Background: There is a burgeoning and varied literature examining the associations between parental factors and depression or anxiety disorders in children. However, there is hitherto no systematic review of this complex literature with a focus on the 5-11 years age range, when there is a steep increase in onset of these disorders. Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the evidence in prevention, a focus on modifiable factors is required.
   Methods: Employing the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of parental factors associated with anxiety, depression, and internalizing problems in children which parents can potentially modify.
   Results: We identified 141 articles altogether, with 53 examining anxiety, 50 examining depression, and 70 examining internalizing outcomes. Stouffer's method of combining p-values was used to determine whether associations between variables were reliable, and meta-analyses were conducted with a subset of eligible studies to estimate the mean effect sizes of associations between each parental factor and outcome. Limitations: Limitations include sacrificing micro-level detail for a macro-level synthesis of the literature, the lack of generalizability across cultures, and the inability to conduct a meta-analysis on all included studies.
   Conclusions: Parental factors with a sound evidence base indicating increased risk for both depression and internalizing problems include more inter-parental conflict and aversiveness; and for internalizing outcomes additionally, they include less warmth and more abusive parenting and over-involvement. No sound evidence linking any parental factor with anxiety outcomes was found. (C) 2015 Elsevier By, All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveThis study examined the relation between identity disturbance and emotion dysregulation in a cross-diagnostic sample. We assessed whether these constructs are related and relevant beyond borderline personality disorder (BPD).
   MethodWe recruited 127 participants who completed measures assessing identity disturbance, emotion dysregulation, anxiety, and depression. The sample included primarily depressed adults meeting criteria for multiple diagnoses as well as psychiatrically healthy participants.
   ResultsIdentity disturbance was significantly higher among psychiatric participants with and without BPD compared to healthy controls. Emotion dysregulation was a significant predictor of identity disturbance, even when controlling for BPD diagnosis, depression, and anxiety. In particular, clarity in emotional situations and problems using emotion regulation strategies were most closely related to identity disturbance.
   ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that future research should examine identity disturbance and its relation with emotion regulation transdiagnostically. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objective: To describe behavior problems in extremely low birth weight (ELBW, < 1000 g) adolescents born 1992 through 1995 based on parent ratings and adolescent self-ratings at age 14 years and to examine changes in parent ratings from ages 8-14. Method: Parent ratings of behavior problems and adolescent self-ratings were obtained for 169 ELBW adolescents (mean birth weight 815 g, gestational age 26 wk) and 115 normal birth weight (NBW) controls at 14 years. Parent ratings of behavior at age 8 years were also available. Behavior outcomes were assessed using symptom severity scores and rates of scores above DSM-IV symptom cutoffs for clinical disorder. Results: The ELBW group had higher symptom severity scores on parent ratings at age 14 years than NBW controls for inattentive attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and social problems (all p's < .01). Rates of parent ratings meeting DSM-IV symptom criteria for inattentive ADHD were also higher for the ELBW group (12% vs 1%, p < .01). In contrast, the ELBW group had lower symptom severity scores on self-ratings than controls for several scales. Group differences in parent ratings decreased over time for ADHD, especially among females, but were stable for anxiety and social problems. Conclusions: Extremely low birth weight adolescents continue to have behavior problems similar to those evident at a younger age, but these problems are not evident in behavioral self-ratings. The findings suggest that parent ratings provide contrasting perspectives on behavior problems in ELBW youth and support the need to identify and treat these problems early in childhood.

AB Early-life trauma is one of the strongest risk factors for later emotional psychopathology. Although research in adults highlights that childhood trauma predicts deficits in emotion regulation that persist decades later, it is unknown whether neural and behavioral changes that may precipitate illness are evident during formative, developmental years. This study examined whether automatic regulation of emotional conflict is perturbed in a high-risk urban sample of trauma-exposed children and adolescents. A total of 14 trauma-exposed and 16 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched comparison youth underwent functional MRI while performing an emotional conflict task that involved categorizing facial affect while ignoring an overlying emotion word. Engagement of the conflict regulation system was evaluated at neural and behavioral levels. Results showed that trauma-exposed youth failed to dampen dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and engage amygdala-pregenual cingulate inhibitory circuitry during the regulation of emotional conflict, and were less able to regulate emotional conflict. In addition, trauma-exposed youth showed greater conflict-related amygdala reactivity that was associated with diminished levels of trait reward sensitivity. These data point to a trauma-related deficit in automatic regulation of emotional processing, and increase in sensitivity to emotional conflict in neural systems implicated in threat detection. Aberrant amygdala response to emotional conflict was related to diminished reward sensitivity that is emerging as a critical stress-susceptibility trait that may contribute to the emergence of mental illness during adolescence. These results suggest that deficits in conflict regulation for emotional material may underlie heightened risk for psychopathology in individuals that endure early-life trauma.

AB Introduction: Obesity has become a public health problem worldwide. Associated with this, bariatric surgeries have progressively increased, given its effectiveness in weight loss in the short term. However, it has been found a high percentage of weight reganancia from third year post surgery, and there are few follow-up studies of these patients.
   Objectives: To describe variables that promote and hinder weight loss, from the perspective of adults who have undergone bariatric surgery.
   Methods: A qualitative descriptive approach based on Grounded Theory was used. In-depth interviews were conducted and data were analized using open coding. The sample consisted of 11 adults, 8 women and 3 males, who carried on surgery in private clinics.
   Results: Five categories of analysis were generated: (1) variables that promote weight loss after bariatric surgery (2) variables that hinder weight loss after surgery, (3) evaluation of bariatric surgery results, (4) problematization of obesity and, (5) relationship with food.
   Discussion: The main findings indicate that failure or success in weight loss after surgery is associated with the possibility of having a network of social and emotional support, as well as the ability to understand and modify the role of food as emotional regulation mechanism.

AB Objective Pediatric health care and research focus mostly on single morbidities, although the single-disease framework has been challenged. The main objective was to estimate associations between childhood mental disorders and physical diseases.
   Methods This study is based on weighted data (n = 6482) from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (age, 13-18 years). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition lifetime mental disorders were assessed using the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, complemented by parent report. Lifetime medical conditions and doctor-diagnosed diseases were assessed by adolescent self-report.
   Results Of 6469 participants, 2137 (35.33%) reported at least one mental disorder and one physical disease. The most substantial associations included those between affective disorders and diseases of the digestive system (odds ratio [OR] = 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.28-5.24), anxiety disorders and arthritis (OR = 2.27, CI = 1.34-3.85), anxiety disorders and heart diseases (OR = 2.41, CI = 1.56-3.73), anxiety disorders and diseases of the digestive system (OR = 2.18, CI = 1.35-3.53), and eating disorders and epilepsy/seizures (OR = 5.45, CI = 1.57-18.87). Sociodemographic factors did not account for the association between mental disorders and physical diseases.
   Conclusions Findings suggest that mental disorders and physical diseases often co-occur in childhood. This association is a major public health challenge, and the child health system needs additional strategies in patient-centered care, research, medical education, health policy, and economics to develop well-coordinated interdisciplinary approaches linking mental and physical care in children.

AB Neuroimaging research has demonstrated a range of structural deficits in adults with psychopathy, but little is known about structural correlates of psychopathic tendencies in adolescents. Here we examined structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRl) data obtained from 14-year-old adolescents (n=108) using tensor-based morphometry (TOM) to isolate global and localized differences in brain tissue volumes associated with psychopathic traits in this otherwise healthy developmental population. We found that greater levels of psychopathic traits were correlated with increased brain tissue volumes in the left putamen, left ansa peduncularis, right superiomedial prefrontal cortex, left inferior frontal cortex, right orbitofrontal cortex, and right medial temporal regions and reduced brain tissues volumes in the right middle frontal cortex, left superior parietal lobule, and left inferior parietal lobule. Post hoc analyses of parcellatecl regional volumes also showed putamen enlargements to correlate with increased psychopathic traits. Consistent with earlier studies, findings suggest poor decision-making and emotional dysregulation associated with psychopathy may be due, in part, to structural anomalies in Frontal and temporal regions whereas striatal structural variations may contribute to sensation-seeking and reward-driven behavior in psychopathic individuals. Future studies will help clarify how disturbances in brain maturational processes might lead to the developmental trajectory from psychopathic tendencies in adolescents to adult psychopathy.

DT Review
DE Gene; Emotion regulation; Adolescents; Children; 5-HTTLPR polymorphism
AB Previous evidence suggests that emotion dysregulation may have different biological correlates between adults and children/adolescents. Although the role of genetic factors has been extensively studied in adult-onset emotion dysregulation, the genetic basis for pediatriconset emotion dysregulation remains elusive. The current review article presents a summary of previous studies that have suggested a few genetic variants associated with pediatric emotion dysregulation. Among these candidate loci, many prior studies have been focused on serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism 5-HTTLPR. Certain alleles of the 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism have been found to be associated with traits associated with emotion dysregulation, such as aggression, affect reactivity, and insecure attachment. Additionally, genetic variants involving dopamine and neurophysiological biomarkers like the COMT Val158Met (rs460) and dopamine receptor D2/ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing one polymorphisms may play a role in emotion dysregulation. Inconsistent findings have been noted, possibly due to the heterogeneity in study designs and characteristics of different populations. Further research on the role of genetic predetermination of emotion dysregulation in children and adolescents is warranted.

The present study examined the incremental validity of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003), which measures cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, over and above the Big Five personality factors. It also extended the evidence for the measure's criterion validity to yet unexamined criteria. A university student sample (N = 203) completed the ERQ, a measure of the Big Five, and relevant cognitive and emotion-laden criteria. Cognitive reappraisal predicted positive affect beyond personality, as well as experiential flexibility and constructive self-assertion beyond personality and affect. Expressive suppression explained incremental variance in negative affect beyond personality and in experiential flexibility beyond personality and general affect. No incremental effects were found for worry, social anxiety, rumination, reflection, and preventing negative emotions. Implications for the construct validity and utility of the ERQ are discussed.

AB Improved neuroscientific understanding of high-risk behaviors such as alcohol binging, drug use, and unsafe sex will lead to therapeutic advances for high-risk groups. High-risk behavior often occurs in an emotionally-charged context, and behavioral inhibition and emotion regulation play important roles in risk-related decision making. High impulsivity is an important potential contributor to high-risk behavior tendencies. We explored the relationships between high-risk behavior tendencies, impulsivity, and fMRI brain activations in an emotional Go/NoGo task. This task presented emotional distractor pictures (aversive vs. neutral) simultaneously with Go/NoGo stimuli (square vs. circle) that required a button press or withholding of the press, respectively. Participants' risk behavior tendencies were assessed with the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events (CARE) scale. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale 11 (BIS) was used to assess participant impulsivity. Individuals with higher CARE risk scores exhibited reduced activation related to response inhibition (NoGo Go) in right orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These regions did not show a significant relationship with impulsivity scores. Conversely, more impulsive individuals showed reduced emotionrelated activity (aversive neutral distractors) in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, and right posterior OFC. There were distinct neural correlates of high-risk behavior tendency and impulsivity in terms of brain activity in the emotional Go/NoGo task. This dissociation supports the conception of high-risk behavior tendency as a distinct construct from that of impulsivity. Our results suggest that treatment for high-risk behavior may be more effective with a nuanced approach that does not conflate high impulsivity necessarily with high-risk behavior tendencies.

AB Introduction. The rate of comorbidity between language disorders and behavioural, emotional and social problems is high.
   Aim. To review the literature on the social and emotional difficulties of children with specific language impairment from a developmental perspective.
   Development. In early childhood, findings concerning this kind of difficulties in children with delayed language development are not conclusive. Yet, as of the period of preschool education, research points to a greater occurrence of difficulties in the social and emotional area. The longitudinal studies that have made it possible to determine the psychosocial adjustment of teenagers suggest a greater risk of presenting experiences involving victimisation and bullying or of developing anxiety and depression in the long term, although some studies offer a more promising scenario.
   Conclusions. Disorders involving comprehension and the pragmatic component of language are an important predictor in the manifestation of socio-emotional alterations. In mixed comprehension-expression disorders, general difficulty in processing could at least partially account for this association. In turn, these limitations in the development of social cognition are likely to help explain, at least up to a point, the difficulties experienced by persons with pragmatic disorders, although the research conducted to date is not consistent in this sense.

AB Introduction. The difficulties that patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have when it comes to emotional regulation have aroused a great deal of interest in recent years and there is a line of research working on the identification of the neurophysiological correlates.
   Aims. To analyse measures of emotional functioning and their correlation with the P300 component in a sample of children with ADHD with and without treatment.
   Patients and methods. The sample was made up of 71 children with ADHD, almost half of whom were taking some form of medication. The auditory potential P300 was analysed. The parents filled in a scale to assess executive behaviour at home, the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), which the emotional self-regulation index and the emotional expression scale were taken from.
   Results. Significant correlations were found between the amplitude of the P300 and the emotional self-regulation index from the version of the BRIEF for preschoolers, and a relation was observed between P300 latency and the severity of the symptoms.
   Conclusions. The results highlight the usefulness of evoked potentials for the study of executive correlates and associated conditions in the day-to-day functioning of children with ADHD.

AB Mechanisms that account for treatment effects are poorly understood. The current study examined processes that may underlie treatment outcomes of an attachment-based intervention (Connect) for parents of pre-teens and teens with serious behavior problems. Parents (N =540) in a non-randomized trial reported on their teen's functioning prior to and following treatment. Results confirmed significant decreases in parents' reports of teens' externalizing and internalizing symptoms, replicating prior evaluations of this program. Reductions in parents' reports of teen attachment avoidance were associated with decreases in externalizing symptoms, while reductions in parents' reports of teen attachment anxiety were associated with decreases in internalizing symptoms. Parents' reports of improved teen affect regulation were also associated with decreases in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results were comparable across gender and for parents of teens with pre-treatment externalizing symptoms in the clinical versus sub-clinical range. A model of therapeutic change in attachment-based parenting programs is discussed.

AB Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT) is a manualized family-based intervention designed for working with depressed adolescents, including those at risk for suicide, and their families. It is an empirically informed and supported treatment. ABFT has its theoretical underpinnings in attachment theory and clinical roots in structural family therapy and emotion focused therapies. ABFT relies on a transactional model that aims to transform the quality of adolescent-parent attachment, as a means of providing the adolescent with a more secure relationship that can support them during challenging times generally, and the crises related to suicidal thinking and behavior, specifically. This article reviews: (1) the theoretical foundations of ABFT (attachment theory, models of emotional development); (2) the ABFT clinical model, including training and supervision factors; and (3) empirical support.

AB Evidence that sleep influences social and cognitive adaptation for school-age children and adolescents is accumulating rapidly, but less research focuses on the role of sleep for adaptive functioning during early childhood. We addressed these questions using actigraphy to assess sleep duration, sleep quality, and variability in sleep schedules in relation to a range of social/emotional and cognitive measures, including receptive vocabulary, emotion understanding, peer acceptance, social skills, social engagement, and temperament. Children in a convenience sample (N = 62, 40 boys, mean age = 4.15 yrs, 67% European American) wore actigraphs for 4-7 days, with sleep and wake states determined using Sadeh's scoring algorithm. Older children spent less time in bed at night and ethnic minority children (mostly African Americans) slept less at night and had lower sleep efficiency than did European American ethnic status children. Bivariate relations (controlling for sex, age, and ethnicity) between sleep variables and child adaptation scores showed that sleep duration was positively associated with peer acceptance, social skills, social engagement, receptive vocabulary, and understanding of the causes of emotions. Fewer variables were associated with nighttime sleep quality and variability and these tended to be related to outcome variables suggestive of behavioral and emotional regulation. Results suggest that sleep parameters are broadly implicated in the adjustment of preschool age children.

AB The emergence of attachment-based treatments (ABTs) for adolescents highlights the need to more clearly define and evaluate these treatments in the context of other attachment based treatments for young children and adults. We propose a general framework for defining and evaluating ABTs that describes the cyclical processes that are required to maintain a secure attachment bond. This secure cycle incorporates three components: (1) the child or adult's IWM of the caregiver; (2) emotionally attuned communication; and (3) the caregiver's IWM of the child or adult. We briefly review Bowlby, Ainsworth, and Main's contributions to defining the components of the secure cycle and discuss how this framework can be adapted for understanding the process of change in ABTs. For clinicians working with adolescents, our model can be used to identify how deviations from the secure cycle (attachment injuries, empathic failures and mistuned communication) contribute to family distress and psychopathology. The secure cycle also provides a way of describing the ABT elements that have been used to revise IWMs or improve emotionally attuned communication. For researchers, our model provides a guide for conceptualizing and measuring change in attachment constructs and how change in one component of the interpersonal cycle should generalize to other components.

AB The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). The RDoC is an initiative to improve classification of mental health concerns by promoting research on the brain mechanisms underlying these concerns, with the ultimate goal of developing interventions that target these brain mechanisms. A key focus of RDoC involves opening new lines of research examining patients' responses on biological measures. The RDoC presents unique challenges to mental health professionals who work with children and adolescents. Indeed, mental health professionals rarely integrate biological measures into clinical assessments. Thus, RDoC's ability to improve patient care rests, in part, on the development of strategies for implementing biological measures within mental health assessments. Further, mental health professionals already carry out comprehensive assessments that frequently yield inconsistent findings. These inconsistencies have historically posed challenges to interpreting research findings as well as assessment outcomes in practice settings. In this introductory article, we review key issues that informed the development of a special issue of articles demonstrating methods for implementing low-cost measures of physiological functioning in clinical child and adolescent assessments. We also outline a conceptual framework, informed by theoretical work on using and interpreting multiple informants' clinical reports (De Los Reyes, Thomas, Goodman, & Kundey, 2013), to guide hypothesis testing when using physiological measures within clinical child and adolescent assessments. This special issue and the conceptual model described in this article may open up new lines of research testing paradigms for implementing clinically feasible physiological measures in clinical child and adolescent assessments.

   THEORY
AB Vagal tone is a measure of cardiovascular function that facilitates adaptive responses to environmental challenge. Low vagal tone is associated with poor emotional and attentional regulation in children and has been conceptualized as a marker of sensitivity to stress. We investigated whether the associations of a wide range of psychosocial stressors with internalizing and externalizing psychopathology were magnified in adolescents with low vagal tone. Resting heart period data were collected from a diverse community sample of adolescents (ages 13-17; N=168). Adolescents completed measures assessing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and exposure to stressors occurring in family, peer, and community contexts. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was calculated from the interbeat interval time series. We estimated interactions between RSA and stress exposure in predicting internalizing and externalizing symptoms and evaluated whether interactions differed by gender. Exposure to psychosocial stressors was associated strongly with psychopathology. RSA was unrelated to internalizing or externalizing problems. Significant interactions were observed between RSA and child abuse, community violence, peer victimization, and traumatic events in predicting internalizing but not externalizing symptoms. Stressors were positively associated with internalizing symptoms in adolescents with low RSA but not in those with high RSA. Similar patterns were observed for anxiety and depression. These interactions were more consistently observed for male than female individuals. Low vagal tone is associated with internalizing psychopathology in adolescents exposed to high levels of stressors. Measurement of vagal tone in clinical settings might provide useful information about sensitivity to stress in child and adolescent clients.

AB The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). RDoC is a framework that facilitates the dimensional assessment and classification of processes relevant to mental health (e.g., affect, regulation, cognition, social affiliation), as reflected in measurements across multiple units of analysis (e.g., physiology, circuitry, genes, self-reports). A key focus of RDoC involves opening new lines of research examining patients' responses on biological measures, with the key goal of developing new therapeutic techniques that effectively target mechanisms of mental disorders. Yet applied researchers and practitioners rarely use biological measures within mental health assessments, which may present challenges in translating RDoC-guided research into improvements in patient care. Thus, if RDoC is to result in research that yields clinical tools that reduce the burden of mental illness and improve public health, we ought to develop strategies for effectively implementing biological measures in the context of clinical assessments. In this special issue, we sought to provide an initial step in this direction by assembling a collection of articles from leading research teams carrying out pioneering work on implementing multimodal assessments (biological, subjective, behavioral) of affective processes in applied settings. In this commentary, we expand upon the work presented in this special issue by making a series of suggestions for how to most parsimoniously conduct multimodal assessments of affective processes in applied research and clinical settings. We hope that this approach will facilitate translations of the RDoC framework into applied research and clinic settings.

AB A surprising omission of much research on bullying is the role of retaliation, a common response to bullying that predicts increased victimization. Retaliation appears to be a ubiquitous feature of human society and may be used to justify bullying. Yet bullying evaluations rarely measure whether programs have reduced retaliation. This paper examines the utility of multiple theoretical frames for understanding the implications of retaliation for bullying prevention. It summarizes evolutionary, cultural, and developmental affordances, and presents a recursive model of bystander friend reciprocity. The authors argue that adolescents influence retaliation in their friends by contributing to emotion regulation, advising responses to bullying, and by serving as mediators or proxy retaliators. The help they give friends is posited to engender powerful feelings of pride and other identity-relevant feelings that encourage future assistance, and elicit reciprocal feelings of obligation and influence. Implications of the model for prevention efforts are detailed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the current study, the cross-cultural generalizability of theories about different variants of psychopathy was tested in 125 detained male adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 years old. Participants were recruited from two juvenile detention facilities in Romania situated in two different regions of the country. The results of the current study suggest that detained adolescents with high rates of callous-unemotional (CU) traits and high levels of anxiety/depression scored higher on measures of impulsivity, aggression and adjustment associated with emotional dysregulation than groups high on CU traits only or groups low on both CU and anxiety/depression. Also, the only measure in which the group high on CU traits but low on anxiety differed from those low on both dimensions was in showing higher levels of proactive relational aggression. The implications of these findings for the cross-cultural generalizability of theories of primary and secondary psychopathy and for the designating groups of detained adolescents with significant mental health needs are discussed.

AB Introduction: Although diabetes may not be associated with psychopathology, it may be associated with less severe disturbances in psychosocial functioning. Emotional problems in relation to type 1 diabetes are usually analysed as symptoms of psychiatric conditions but not as states of mood. The aim was to compare profiles of mood states in adult patients with childhood-onset and adulthood- onset type 1 diabetes mellitus and to outline possible gender-specific differences.
   Subjects and methods: A total of 214 adult type 1 diabetic patients were randomly selected from the Lithuanian Diabetes Registry. The mood states were compared in 105 (42 men and 63 women) patients with type 1 diabetes diagnosed during 0-18 years of life and in 109 (61 men and 48 women) diagnosed in adulthood. The scores of tensionanxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigouractivity, fatigue-inertia and confusion-bewilderment were evaluated using the Profile of Mood States.
   Results: Depression-dejection was higher in adulthoodonset diabetic women than in childhood-onset (p=0.005) diabetic patients. In childhood-onset diabetic patients depression-dejection (p=0.046) and confusion-bewilderment (p=0.033) were higher in women than in men. Adulthood-onset women with diabetes had higher tension- anxiety (p=0.027), depression-dejection (p=0.001), and confusion-bewilderment (p=0.004) scores than men. Multiple logistic analyses showed that adulthood-onset period of type 1 diabetes is associated with higher levels of depression-dejection [ OR=1.1; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.01-1.19, p=0.025], longer diabetes duration (OR=2.00; 95% CI 1.27-2.03, p=0.012), higher HbA(1c) level OR=1.15; 95% CI 1.02-1.3, p=0.023), and female gender (OR=2.51; 95% CI 1.29-2.90, p=0.021).
   Conclusions: Profile of mood states in adult women with type 1 diabetes is worse than in men. Adulthood-onset type 1 diabetic women have higher depression-dejection than do childhood-onset diabetic patients. Adulthoodonset period of type 1 diabetes is associated with higher levels of depression-dejection, longer diabetes duration and female gender.

AB There is a growing interest in the study of psychopathic traits from an evolutionary framework; however, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews regarding this issue. To address this gap in the literature, the current paper examines the evolutionary roots of psychopathy by reviewing previous research on this topic. Specifically, the potentially adaptive role of psychopathic traits during human evolution through the lifespan is highlighted. Key areas covered include the evolution of the brain ("old brain, new brain" and the emotion-logic lag), emotion regulation, aggression and its potential adaptive function, and emotions specific to psychopathy including anger and shame/dishonor. This paper (mainly in the light of the Adaptive Calibration Model) discusses how psychopathic features can be seen as a useful heritage, especially for people who have grown in harsh psychosocial backgrounds. The implications of an evolutionary approach for the comprehension and treatment of children, youth, and adults with psychopathic traits are suggested, along with directions for future research.

AB A conceptual model was used to investigate how demographic characteristics, perceived fire stress, aspects of the recovery environment (life stressors since the disaster, social support), mental health, and coping influences parent and youth reports of family functioning and posttraumatic growth (PTG) following multiple wildfires. Participants included 50 parent-youth dyads (M = 14.5 years) who had been evacuated because of the fire, many of whom had homes that were damaged (60%) or destroyed (30%). For youth, younger age, being female, greater fire stress, more life stressors, and those using more positive reappraisal coping reported greater PTG. For parents, family type and perceived fire stress were positively related to PTG, and positive reappraisal approached significance. For family functioning, only the youth model was significant. Younger age and more life stressors were negatively related, and positive reappraisal coping was positively related, to family functioning. Overall, the results support the important role of positive reappraisal in postdisaster outcomes.

AB Clinically relevant identity disturbance, rather than more normative identity confusion, is a construct that has received limited empirical attention. This relative lack of empirical research is surprising, given that identity disturbance is a criterion for BPD, among the proposed features of all DSM-5 personality disorders, and may also be relevant for many other psychiatric diagnoses. The nomenclature used to describe identity-related constructs is currently unstandardized and many theorists have described overlapping concepts. Thus, there is a need to operationalize identity problems and improve measurement of this important construct. In this article we report the results of two studies that establish the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Self-Concept and Identity Measure (SCIM). The SCIM is a brief, self-report scale designed to assess dimensions of identity (healthy and disturbed) among adults. Participants were recruited through a psychology department subject pool (Study 1; n = 536) and also through Amazon's Mechanical Turk Website (Study 2; n = 470). An exploratory factor analysis of Study 1 data revealed a 3-factor structure. A confirmatory factor analysis validated the 3-factor structure in the community sample recruited for Study 2. Results indicate that the SCIM is correlated with emotion dysregulation, Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and other measures of psychopathology. Scores on the SCIM yielded high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89), test-retest reliability (alpha = 0.93, r = 0.88; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88), and adequate construct validity. The SCIM appears to produce valid and reliable test scores, with promising applications for clinical research and practice.

AB Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) has been shown to be an important vulnerability factor for a variety of emotional problems. Recently, the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) was developed as a content-independent measure of RNT in adults, which allows research into this process from a transdiagnostic perspective. The current study describes the construction of a child-appropriate version of the instrument and provides initial evidence for its reliability and validity. Both a one-factor model and a three-factor higher-order model were found to adequately fit with the data but the more parsimonious one-factor model was retained for further analyses. The unidimensional PTQ-C scale showed excellent internal consistency and its validity was supported by substantial correlations with other measures of repetitive thinking as well as with symptom levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, as expected, regression analyses suggested that the PTQ-C scale captures the general repetitive negative thinking associated with anxiety and depression, whereas measures of worry and brooding tap additional content-related aspects of these symptom dimensions.

AB Growing evidence indicates that normative pubertal maturation is associated with increased threat reactivity, and this developmental shift has been implicated in the increased rates of adolescent affective disorders. However, the neural mechanisms involved in this pubertal increase in threat reactivity remain unknown. Research in adults indicates that testosterone transiently decreases amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) coupling. Consequently, we hypothesized that increased pubertal testosterone disrupts amygdala-OFC coupling, which may contribute to developmental increases in threat reactivity in some adolescents. Hypotheses were tested in a longitudinal study by examining the impact of testosterone on functional connectivity. Findings were consistent with hypotheses and advance our understanding of normative pubertal changes in neural systems instantiating affect/motivation. Finally, potential novel insights into the neurodevelopmental pathways that may contribute to adolescent vulnerability to behavioral and emotional problems are discussed.

AB This meta-analysis evaluated the effects of the expressive writing intervention (EW; Pennebaker & Beall, 1986) among adolescents. Twenty-one independent studies that assessed the efficacy of expressive writing on youth samples aged 10-18 years were collected and analyzed. Results indicated an overall mean g-effect size that was positive in direction but relatively small (0.127), as well as significant g-effect sizes ranging from 0.107 to 0.246 for the outcome domains of Emotional Distress, Problem Behavior, Social Adjustment, and School Participation. Few significant effects were found within specific outcome domains for putative moderator variables that included characteristics of the participants, intervention instructions, or research design. Studies involving adolescents with high levels of emotional problems at baseline reported larger effects on school performance. Studies that implemented a higher dosage intervention (i.e., greater number and, to some extent, greater spacing of sessions) reported larger effects on somatic complaints. Overall, the findings suggest that expressive writing tends to produce small yet significant improvements on adolescents' well-being. The findings highlight the importance of modifying the traditional expressive writing protocol to enhance its efficacy and reduce potential detrimental effects. At this stage of research the evidence on expressive writing as a viable intervention for adolescents is promising but not decisive. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and often debilitating psychiatric disorder that begins during adolescence. Core features of BPD are affective dysregulation, dysfunctional self-concepts, and difficulties in social interactive domains. A widely accepted marker for severe emotion dysregulation in adult BPD is decreased pain sensitivity. Until now it is unclear whether this characteristic feature of BPD is already present during adolescence. Thus, this study aims to investigate pain sensitivity in adolescent patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for BPD. 20 female adolescent patients with BPD (mean age 16.4 years) and 20 healthy age-matched control participants were investigated. Detection and pain thresholds for thermal stimuli were assessed on both hands. Furthermore, self-rating instruments were used to assess overall psychopathology, dissociation, and depression. We found significantly higher pain thresholds in patients with BPD than in healthy controls. Patients with BPD had higher intensities of depression, overall psychopathology, and dissociative symptoms, but there was no correlation between pain sensitivity and any of these measures of psychopathology. These findings are in line with previous findings in adult BPD patients concerning lower pain sensitivity as compared to healthy controls. This provides support for the idea that disturbed pain processing is not only a consequence of chronic BPD but is already present in early stages of BPD.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot randomized trial of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) versus psychosocial treatment as usual (TAU) for adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BP).
   Methods: We recruited participants 12-18 years of age with a primary BP diagnosis (I, II, or operationalized not otherwise specified [NOS] criteria) from a pediatric specialty clinic. Eligible patients were assigned using a 2:1 randomization structure to either DBT (n=14) or psychosocial TAU (n=6). All patients received medication management from a study-affiliated psychiatrist. DBT included 36 sessions (18 individual, 18 family skills training) over 1 year. TAU was an eclectic psychotherapy approach consisting of psychoeducational, supportive, and cognitive behavioral techniques. An independent evaluator, blind to treatment condition, assessed outcomes including affective symptoms, suicidal ideation and behavior, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, and emotional dysregulation, quarterly over 1 year.
   Results: Adolescents receiving DBT attended significantly more therapy sessions over 1 year than did adolescents receiving TAU, possibly reflecting greater engagement and retention; both treatments were rated as highly acceptable by adolescents and parents. As compared with adolescents receiving TAU, adolescents receiving DBT demonstrated significantly less severe depressive symptoms over follow-up, and were nearly three times more likely to demonstrate improvement in suicidal ideation. Models indicate a large effect size, for more weeks being euthymic, over follow-up among adolescents receiving DBT. Although there were no between-group differences in manic symptoms or emotional dysregulation with treatment, adolescents receiving DBT, but not those receiving TAU, evidenced improvement from pre- to posttreatment in both manic symptoms and emotional dysregulation.
   Conclusions: DBT may offer promise as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation for adolescents with BP. The DBT focus on commitment to treatment may be important for the treatment of early-onset BP. Larger controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of this approach, examine impact on suicidal behavior, and demonstrate cost effectiveness.

AB The aim of the present study was to find relevant coping factors for the development of psychological intervention programs for young people with Type 1 (T1) diabetes. A wide range of coping techniques was studied, including cognitive coping, behavioral coping and goal adjustment coping. A total of 78 young people with T1 diabetes participated. They were contacted through a social networking website, several Internet sites, and flyers. A wide range of coping techniques appeared to be related to depressive symptoms. Especially the cognitive coping strategies self-blame, rumination, refocus positive, and other-blame, together with goal adjustment coping, were of importance. A large proportion of the variance of depressive symptoms could be explained (65 %). These findings suggest that these specific coping strategies should be part of coping skills trainings for young people with T1 diabetes.

AB Using a multistudy approach, we examined the utility of the Impairment Rating Scale (IRS; Fabiano et al., 2006) as a screening tool for detecting kindergarten children who are at risk for social, emotional, academic, and behavioral problems. In Study 1 (N = 568), we evaluated the concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and diagnostic efficiency of the parent and teacher IRS test score inferences in relation to scores from the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004). In Study 2 (N = 242), we addressed limitations in Study 1 and evaluated the concurrent validity, discriminant validity, and diagnostic efficiency of the parent and teacher IRS test score inferences in relation to scores from BASC-2 Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS; Kamphaus & Reynolds, 2007), quarterly grades, kindergarten reading competency tests, and daily behavior outcomes on a classwide discipline system. Results indicate moderate to strong concurrent and diagnostic validity utility for the teacher IRS test score inferences and low to moderate concurrent and diagnostic validity utility for the parent IRS test score inferences. IRS scores of 3 or 4 may represent appropriate cutpoints for determining risk status in kindergarten youth depending on school districts' intended use of the tool for screening. Implications for future research and practice in universal school-based screening are discussed.

AB A growing number of evidence-based youth prevention programs are available, but challenges related to dissemination and implementation limit their reach and impact. The current review identifies common elements across evidence-based prevention programs focused on the promotion of health-related outcomes in adolescents. We reviewed and coded descriptions of the programs for common practice and instructional elements. Problem-solving emerged as the most common practice element, followed by communication skills, and insight building. Psychoeducation, modeling, and role play emerged as the most common instructional elements. In light of significant comorbidity in poor outcomes for youth, and corresponding overlap in their underlying skills deficits, we propose that synthesizing the prevention literature using a common elements approach has the potential to yield novel information and inform prevention programming to minimize burden and maximize reach and impact for youth.

AB Background: Problem drinking in college is a longstanding problem with potentially severe consequences. More recently, problem drinking has been linked to emotion regulation difficulties. However, these results are mixed and emphasize the need to examine moderating variables that may strengthen the problem drinking/emotion regulation relationship. Two such variables are child/adolescent sexual abuse (CASA) and drinking refusal self-efficacy (DRSE). Objectives: The current study hypothesized that the relations between emotion regulation difficulties and problem drinking would be most salient for college students with increased CASA exposure and decreased DRSE. Secondary analyses examined the hypothesis taking into consideration cumulative child/adolescent trauma exposure. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 200) completed a large survey battery for course credit. Results: Three-way interactions across the CASA and cumulative trauma models were significant and in a similar direction. Results indicated that for students without trauma exposure, problem drinking was the greatest for those with decreased DRSE and increased emotion regulation difficulties. As trauma exposure increased, problem drinking was the greatest for those with decreased DRSE and decreased emotion regulation difficulties (or superior perceived regulatory abilities). Conclusion: Discussion highlights the importance of considering DRSE and the possibility of reduced insight in trauma-exposed students, who may perceive alcohol use as an adaptive regulatory strategy.

AB Youth with learning disabilities (LDs) have information processing challenges that place them at increased risk for emotion dysregulation and often rely on coping strategies that emphasize avoidance of challenging emotions, experiences or tasks. Integra mindfulness martial arts (MMA) was developed to address and help participants cope with these challenges and increase self-awareness and present-focus. The present exploratory qualitative study includes results from a post-treatment questionnaire completed by 29 youth aged 12-17 and 17 parents, and in-depth interviews with 7 youth who participated in MMA and 5 parents. (1) Youth goals for MMA; (2) perceptions of program components and delivery; (3) outcomes associated with participation; and (4) challenging/negative aspects of the program were explored. Thematic analysis of interviews suggested that the development of mastery and pride was a common motivating factor for entering treatment. The mindfulness component of MMA was identified as helpful in promoting a sense of calm, tolerance and acceptance of distress, and self-understanding in youth. This research provides preliminary support for the Integra MMA program from the perspective of participants. Future research directions and clinical implications for treatment of youth with LDs are discussed.

AB Perceived parental stress has been consistently shown to negatively impact child functioning and ability to cope with stressful situations. Utilizing data from the parenting our children to excellence program, the current study examined the relationships among perceived parenting stress, coping competence, and school readiness in a sample of African American and Caucasian parents of preschool children (age 3-6) considered at high risk for child physical abuse. We hypothesized that child competence would mediate the relation between perceived parental stress and children's school readiness. We tested a longitudinal latent variable model and found that parent-reported (but not teacher-reported) child competence mediated the relation between perceived parental stress and school readiness, controlling for family income, parent's education level, and child's sex. These results suggest that parents' perceived stress plays a role in both how they view their children's competence and how children perform academically.

AB Two forms of music reception (attentive-analytical and emotional listening) can be differentiated to understand and explain how individuals adapt to stress through regulating their emotions (accommodative coping and rumination). We asked whether (1) more reflective and complex music reception (i.e., attentive-analytical listening) would be related to accommodative coping and (2) emotional listening would be related to rumination. In addition, we investigated age differences in adolescence and adulthood. In Study 1 (cross-sectional, 521 participants, aged 18-86 years), attentive-analytical listening to music showed positive relations to accommodative coping, whereas emotional listening showed a positive relation to rumination. No age differences were found in music reception in adulthood. Study 2 (cross-sectional, 152 adolescents ranging in age from 12-17 years) investigated the relation between music reception, accommodative coping, and rumination and replicated the results of Study 1. The transition from adolescence to adulthood (12 to 23 years) was critical for the development of music reception. A comparison of adolescents and young adults revealed that attentive-analytical listening was negatively associated with age up to approximately 17 years, after which the correlation between age and attentive-analytical listening became positive. Adolescents demonstrated age increments in emotional listening. We argue that music reception is not only a possible avenue for investigating emotional regulation over the life course, but also provides a basis for possible interventions aimed at modifying emotional regulation processes in adulthood.

AB IntroductionFew studies have examined anxiety and depression experiences of primary (middle) school-aged children from ethnically diverse backgrounds, and most have relied on parents or others as informants. The present study aimed to investigate self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms in Singaporean primary school-aged children. Age, gender, and ethnic differences and interactions were explored as well as similarities and differences between Singaporean children and US norms.
   MethodsA large representative community sample of 1655 8- to 12-year-old Singaporean children (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) as part of a larger epidemiological study of mental health in Singaporean children.
   ResultsRates of clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were 9.3% and 16.9% on the MASC and the CDI, respectively. Separation and social anxieties were most common. Evidence of a gender difference in levels of emotional symptoms was most evident in Indian children, with girls reporting more symptoms than boys. The relationship between age and internalizing problems was weak.
   DiscussionA substantial minority of primary school-aged Singaporean children reported elevated anxious and depressive symptoms. Better understanding of the factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of these problems can help the development of culture-specific interventions and facilitate the planning of community-tailored services and initiatives.

AB Little is known about how the challenges faced by caregivers influence the variation in social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) outcomes of youth placed in kinship versus non-relative foster care. This study examined SEB symptoms among youth in kinship and non-relative foster care settings, hypothesizing that changes in caregiver depression would modify children's change in behavior over time. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) assessments of 199 children placed with kinship and non-relative foster care providers in a Mid-Atlantic city were conducted at time of placement and 6-12 months post-placement. Linear regression estimated CBCL change scores for youth across placement type and caregiver depression trajectories. Kinship caregivers were more likely to become depressed or remained depressed than non-relative foster caregivers. Youth in kinship care always exhibited better change in SEB outcomes than youth in non-relative foster care, but these positive outcomes were principally observed among families where caregivers demonstrated a reduction in depression over time or were never depressed. Adjusted change scores for non-relative foster care youth were always negative, with the most negative scores among youth whose caregivers became depressed over time. Caregiver well-being may modify the influence of placement setting on SEB outcomes for youth placed into out-of-home care. Findings lend to policy relevance for child welfare systems that seek kinship settings as a panacea to the challenges faced by youth, without allocating resources to address caregiver needs.

AB Teenage mothers use marijuana more frequently than older mothers, and marijuana use may predict HIV risk behavior in offspring. Our goals were to (1) describe trajectories of marijuana use in teenage mothers and (2) determine if these trajectories were associated with early sexual behavior in their offspring. Pregnant adolescents (12-18 years) were recruited at a prenatal clinic and interviewed during pregnancy, at delivery, and during follow-up visits when offspring were 6, 10, 14 and 16 years old. At 16 years, 332 women (71 % Black, 29 % White) and their offspring were assessed. Mothers were asked about their marijuana use at each time point. Offspring reported on their sexual behavior at age 14. Trajectory analyses using growth mixture models revealed four maternal patterns of marijuana use: no use, only at the 6 year follow-up, quit by the 16 year follow-up, and used across most of the time points. The children of chronic users were more likely to have early sex. The maternal marijuana trajectory group variable remained a statistically significant predictor in multivariate models controlling for race, gender, socioeconomic status, child pubertal timing, child externalizing behavior problems, and child marijuana use. These findings suggest that a minority of teenage mothers continue to use marijuana over time. Chronic maternal marijuana use across a decade was associated with early sex in offspring (oral or vaginal sex by age 14). Early sexual behavior places these children at significantly higher risk of teenage pregnancy and HIV risk behaviors.

AB While an accumulating body of research has documented increased risk of psychopathology among children of depressed fathers, most studies have used cross-sectional design, and little is known about offspring outcomes beyond childhood. Using prospective data from a community sample (N=395), we found that paternal depressive symptoms when children were in early adolescence (age 13) predicted offspring depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 21, controlling for baseline youth symptoms, maternal depressive symptoms, and other known correlates of internalizing problems in early adulthood. Associations were not moderated by maternal depressive symptoms or child gender. These results suggest that the unique and long-term effects of paternal depression on children's risk of mood disorders may persist into adulthood.

AB The ability to regulate temptation and manage appetitive cravings is an important aspect of healthy adolescent development, but the neural systems underlying this process are understudied. In the present study, 60 healthy females evenly distributed from 10 to 23 years of age used reappraisal to regulate the desire to consume personally-craved and not craved unhealthy foods. Reappraisal elicited activity in common self-regulation regions including the dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (specifically superior and inferior frontal gyri), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Viewing personally-craved foods (versus not craved foods) elicited activity in regions including the ventral striatum, as well as more rostral and ventral anterior cingulate cortex extending into the orbitofrontal cortex. Age positively correlated with regulation-related activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, and negatively correlated with reactivity-related activity in the right superior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Age-adjusted BMI negatively correlated with regulation-related activity in the predominantly left lateralized frontal and parietal regions. These results suggest that the age-related changes seen in the reappraisal of negative emotion may not be as pronounced in the reappraisal of food craving. Therefore, reappraisal of food craving in particular may be an effective way to teach teenagers to manage cravings for other temptations encountered in adolescence, including alcohol, drugs, and unhealthy food.

AB The interpersonal model of loss of control (LOC) eating proposes that socially distressing situations lead to anxious states that trigger excessive food consumption. Self-reports support these links, but the neurobiological underpinnings of these relationships remain unclear. We therefore examined brain regions associated with anxiety in relation to LOC eating and energy intake in the laboratory. Twenty-two overweight and obese (BMIz: 1.9 +/- 0.4) adolescent (15.8 +/- 1.6 y) girls with LOC eating (LOC+, n = 10) and without LOC eating (LOC-, n = 12) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a simulated peer interaction chatroom paradigm. Immediately after the fMRI scan, girls consumed lunch ad libitum from a 10,934-kcal laboratory buffet meal with the instruction to "let yourself go and eat as much as you want." Pre-specified hypotheses regarding activation of five regions of interest were tested. Analysis of fMRI data revealed a significant group by peer feedback interaction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), such that LOC+ had less activity following peer rejection (vs. acceptance), while LOC-had increased activity (p < .005). Moreover, functional coupling between vmPFC and striatum for peer rejection (vs. acceptance) interacted with LOC status: coupling was positive for LOC+, but negative in LOC-(p < .005). Activity of fusiform face area (FFA) during negative peer feedback from high-value peers also interacted with LOC status (p < .005). A positive association between FFA activation and intake during the meal was observed among only those with LOC eating. In conclusion, overweight and obese girls with LOC eating may be distinguished by a failure to engage regions of prefrontal cortex implicated in emotion regulation in response to social distress. The relationship between FFA activation and food intake supports the notion that heightened sensitivity to incoming interpersonal cues and perturbations in socio-emotional neural circuits may lead to overeating in order to cope with negative affect elicited by social discomfort in susceptible youth.

AB Functional neuroimaging studies in adults show that aggression involves reduced brain communication between subcortical and cortical areas dedicated to motivation and control, respectively. Prior research indicates that sex steroid hormone production during adolescence negatively influences the rapid development of white matter connectivity between subcortical and cortical areas during adolescence and may potentiate aggression. Here, we tested this hypothesis in 258 participants between 8 and 25 years of age by using Diffusion Weighted Imaging to examine the microstructure of white matter connections within the fronto-temporal-subcortical network. Trait aggression was measured using the Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire and testosterone and estradiol levels were measured in saliva. Results indicated that higher levels of testosterone were associated with less white matter integrity within the fronto-temporal-subcortical network (i.e., higher mean diffusivity [MD] longitudinal [LD], and radial diffusivity [RD]). Furthermore, lower fractional anisotropy and higher MD, LD, and RD values within this network increased expressive forms of aggression and reduced inhibited forms of aggression (hostility). Our study indicates higher levels of testosterone relating to lower quality of structural cortical-subcortical connectivity, arguably resulting in a shift from inhibited towards expressive forms of aggression. Our data adds evidence to the idea that aggressive tendencies are subcortically driven, but individuals with relatively high testosterone might have lower structural connectivity within cortical control areas, resulting in a stronger tendency to act on these aggressive tendencies.

AB Introduction: The aim of the study was an attempt at defining the risk factors and immunity resources allowing prediction of the use and abuse of alcohol and marijuana in early adulthood. Temperament and character traits, anxiety levels, self-destructive tendencies and style of coping with stress were examined.
   Method: The research sample included 166 secondary school students aged 1820 years defined by targeted selection. The following questionnaires were used: AUDIT, Spielberger et al.' s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Kelley et al.' s Chronic Self-destructiveness Scale, Endler and Parker's Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations and Cloninger et al.' s Temperament and Character Inventory.
   Results: A relationship was demonstrated between temperament and character traits, style of coping with stress, self-destructive tendencies and marijuana/alcohol use (p < 0.05). Temperament and character traits included exploratory excitability, disorderliness, sentimentality, bad habits, vindictiveness and advantage of personal benefits. Among stress-coping styles, important significance was ascribed to emotion-oriented strategy. No significant relationship was found between psychoactive substance use and declared anxiety level.
   Conclusions: Alcohol and marijuana users significantly differ from abstainers as regards temperament and character traits, manifested, e. g. by a higher degree of exploratory excitability, unconventionality, lower tolerance to monotony, poorer discipline and control in frustrating situations. As regards stress-coping styles - marijuana and alcohol users are worse at coping with frustration, and they tend to focus attention on themselves and their emotional problems. The investigation on the severity of self-destructive tendencies showed that psychoactive substance users have a tendency to initiate intentional suffering and failures, give in to temptation easily and show addictive tendencies.

AB Purpose of review
   Anxiety is one of the most common co-occurring psychiatric conditions in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This article reviews recent evidence as well as earlier relevant studies regarding the characteristics, assessment, and treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD.
   Recent findings
   It is well established that the prevalence of anxiety in youth with an ASD is significantly greater than the prevalence of anxiety in the general population. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of informant, method, and instrument when measuring anxiety in this population. Despite the high prevalence, findings to date have been unable to identify any consistent risk factors for anxiety. New psychological treatments, including modified cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with high functioning ASD and co-occurring anxiety, are emerging. Pharmacological data, however, are scant. Existing studies show that youth with ASD are at increased risk for behavioral activation when taking SSRIs.
   Summary
   Clinicians working with youth with ASD are encouraged to routinely screen for anxiety. Until further data are available, clinical judgment is needed when prescribing treatments, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which require close monitoring of side-effects. Research on risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition is needed.

AB Every day, thousands of children suffer the effects of chronic health conditions and families struggle with illness management and children's behavioural and emotional adjustment. Many parents experience difficulties with their caregiving role and lack confidence in their ability to manage their child's illness and ensure the child's well-being. While there is consistent evidence as to the extent and impact of childhood chronic illness, there is a paucity of evidence-based parenting approaches to help children with chronic health conditions and their families. This paper provides a narrative review of the current literature to examine relationships between chronic childhood illness, emotional and behavioural disorders and parenting. Key guidelines and recommendations for the development of evidence-based parenting programs for parents of children affected by chronic health conditions are provided.

AB BackgroundChild and adolescent mental health problems are common, associated with wide-ranging functional impairments, and show substantial continuities into adult life. It is therefore important to understand the extent to which the prevalence of mental health problems has changed over time, and to identify reasons behind any trends in mental health.
   Scope and MethodologyThis review evaluates evidence on whether the population prevalence of child and adolescent mental health problems has changed. The primary focus of the review is on epidemiological cross-cohort comparisons identified by a systematic search of the literature (using the Web of Knowledge database).
   FindingsClinical diagnosis and treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders increased over recent decades. Epidemiological comparisons of unselected population cohorts using equivalent assessments of mental health have found little evidence of an increased rate of ADHD, but cross-cohort comparisons of rates of ASD are lacking at this time. Findings do suggest substantial secular change in emotional problems and antisocial behaviour in high-income countries, including periods of increase and decrease in symptom prevalence. Evidence from low- and middle-income countries is very limited. Possible explanations for trends in child and adolescent mental health are discussed. The review also addresses how cross-cohort comparisons can provide valuable complementary information on the aetiology of mental illness.

AB Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood, but it remains unclear which childhood factors predict future outcome. Aim: To identify childhood predictors of ADHD outcome using both dimensional and categorical approaches.
   Methods: 116 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD were followed up on average 6.6 years later. ADHD outcome variables were interview-based parent-reported ADHD symptoms and impairment. Childhood predictors included parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and co-occurring behaviours; actigraph measures of activity level; socio-economic status (SES); and cognitive measures previously associated with ADHD.
   Results: Of the sample, 79% continued to meet clinical criteria of ADHD in adolescence and young adulthood. Higher parent-rated ADHD symptoms and movement intensity in childhood, but not teacher-rated symptoms, predicted ADHD symptoms at follow up. Co-occurring symptoms of oppositional behaviours, anxiety, social and emotional problems were also significant predictors, but these effects disappeared after controlling for ADHD symptoms. IQ and SES were significant predictors of both ADHD symptoms and impairment at follow up, but no other cognitive measures significantly predicted outcome.
   Conclusions: SES and IQ emerge as potential moderators for the prognosis of ADHD. Childhood severity of ADHD symptoms, as measured by parent ratings and actigraph movement intensity, also predicts later ADHD outcome. These factors should be considered when identifying ADHD children at most risk of poor long-term outcomes and for the development of interventions to improve prognosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Parental divorce was known for over 40 years as being the cause of some serious, long lasting behavioural, emotional, social and academic problems in children. The aim of this study was to identify the consequences of divorce upon children, mothers' wellbeing and the parenting styles. We have studied a group of 79 children and adolescents selected from one school in Timisoara (Romania), aged between 7-15 years, and their mothers. The children were divided into two groups: 41 children and adolescents from divorced families and a control group of 38 children and adolescents from two parents ("normal") families. The following instruments were used: Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure the children's emotions, behaviour and social competencies; Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) to measure the mother's psychological wellbeing; The Parenting Scale to identify the parenting style used by mothers in the educational process. The results showed that children from divorced families have more emotional problems compared with children coming from two parents families; the divorced mothers have higher scores at all psychological problems compared with married mother and are more likely to be over reactive or have more hostility in their parenting style, while the married mothers are more lax in their parenting style. Emotional and behavioural problems of children from divorced families were strongly correlated with their mother's problems. In conclusion, the psychological wellbeing of divorced mothers have a certain influence on the child's adjustment, and thus, on the ability of the children to cope with the divorce situation.

AB Background: Psychological items discriminating children of fathers diagnosed with an illicit drug-related substance use disorder and normal controls are indicators of a unidimensional construct termed transmissible liability index (TLI) (Vanyukov et al., 2009). TLI is a highly heritable (Vanyukov et al., 2009; Hicks, Iacono, McGue, 2012) and valid (Vanyukov et al., 2009; Hicks et al., 2009; Kirisci et al., 2013a) measure of childhood liability to substance use disorders (SUDS).
   Aims: This longitudinal study determined whether TLI has incremental validity for predicting SUD beyond commonly measured psychological indicators of risk.
   Methods: TLI and measures of executive cognitive capacity, emotion dysregulation and externalizing disturbance were administered to boys at ages 10-12 and 16. SLID outcome determined at age 22 was assessed as (1) any SLID, (2) the number of drug-specific SUDs, and (3) SLID severity.
   Results: TLI predicted SLID beyond the contribution of measures of emotion dysregulation, executive cognitive capacity and externalizing disturbance. The association of emotion dysregulation and externalizing behavior at ages 10-12 and 16 with SLID at age 22 was also reduced to non-significance after controlling for transmissible risk measured by TU.
   Conclusions: TLI's incremental validity beyond these latter indicators of risk points to its utility for identifying vulnerable youths requiring intervention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prenatal maternal depression is associated with alterations in the neonatal amygdala microstructure, shedding light on the timing for the influence of prenatal maternal depression on the brain structure of the offspring. This study aimed to examine the association between prenatal maternal depressive symptomatology and infant amygdala functional connectivity and to thus establish the neural functional basis for the transgenerational transmission of vulnerability for affective disorders during prenatal development. Twenty-four infants were included in this study with both structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) at 6 months of age. Maternal depression was assessed at 26 weeks of gestation and 3 months after delivery using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Linear regression was used to identify the amygdala functional networks and to examine the associations between prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and amygdala functional connectivity. Our results showed that at 6 months of age, the amygdala is functionally connected to widespread brain regions, forming the emotional regulation, sensory and perceptual, and emotional memory networks. After controlling for postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, infants born to mothers with higher prenatal maternal depressive symptoms showed greater functional connectivity of the amygdala with the left temporal cortex and insula, as well as the bilateral anterior cingulate, medial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, which are largely consistent with patterns of connectivity observed in adolescents and adults with major depressive disorder. Our study provides novel evidence that prenatal maternal depressive symptomatology alters the amygdala's functional connectivity in early postnatal life, which reveals that the neuroimaging correlates of the familial transmission of phenotypes associated with maternal mood are apparent in infants at 6 months of age.

AB Objectives. Although many authors have highlighted similarities between conduct disorder (CD) and alexithymia, little empirical research has actually investigated the contribution of emotion processing to CD. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between CD and scores on affect regulation scales among 75 adolescents: a group of 30 adolescents with CD and a group of 45 controls, ranging in age from 13 to 18.
   Method. All participants filled in a socio-demographic questionnaire. CD diagnosis was assessed in regard to DSM-IV criteria using the specific CD section of the Kiddie-Sads. Affect regulation was measured with two self-reports: TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale), known as the gold standard for alexithymia measurement, and DERS (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), a recently validated scale. In addition, since depression may influence the correlations between CD and alexithymia, it was also measured with the BDI. In order to have more information on the CD group, the CTQ was also used. One way analyses of variance adjusting for age were used for mean score comparisons. Partial correlations adjusting for age were used to investigate the link between the CD severity (the severity index was calculated from the Kiddie-Sads) and affect regulation scores. Finally, discriminant analyses were conducted to explore whether affect regulation could correctly categorize controls and adolescents with CD.
   Results. These results provided some additional data in order to understand the relationship between affect regulation and CD. Controls and adolescents with CD had significantly different emotion regulation scales scores at both scales (TAS-20 and DERS) and in most of their dimensions. Moreover, they also point out the positive correlation between difficulties in affect regulation and CD severity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to have investigated relationships between CD and alexithymia using a severity index of CD. Finally, discriminant analyses showed that the two emotion regulation scales permitted the significant discrimination of both groups. These results are consistent with previous works highlighting the theoretical relationship between deficit in mental elaboration and acting-out. They point to the need to develop therapeutic programs in order to improve emotion regulation of teenagers with CD. Finally, an additional analysis showed a relationship between emotional neglect in childhood (measured with CTQ) and the CD severity. A task for future research would be to study the relationships between attachment, emotional regulation and CD in adolescence. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2014.
