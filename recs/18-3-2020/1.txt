AB Background: Adolescents are at high risk of sexual assault compared to any other age group. The pattern of post-traumatic stress symptoms plus life-impairing disturbances in self-organization (emotion dysregulation, negative self-concept and interpersonal problems) is termed Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD). Research about CPTSD after sexual assault in adolescents is limited owing to the challenges associated with assessing this group. This study aims to determine the frequency and structure of CPTSD, and the relationship of emotion dysregulation with impairment and additional trauma exposure among adolescents who have been sexually assaulted. Method: Prospective cohort study of adolescents attending the Sexual Assault Referral Centres serving London over a 2-year period. We conducted cross-sectional analyses (n = 99) on data collected 4-5 months after sexual assault, and Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) and Latent Class Analyses (LCA) to determine the CPTSD profile. CTPSD was defined according to the ICD-11, selecting symptom indicators from the following measures: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES-13), Short version of the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (S-MFQ), The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). We analysed the association of CPTSD symptom domains with impairment (measured with the SDQ, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale; C-GAS) and with additional trauma exposure. Results: The frequency of ICD-11 PTSD was 59%, and of ICD-11 CPTSD was 40%. CPTSD symptoms showed a strong fit for a correlated 4-factor model, and LCA distinguished a class of participants with high levels of CPTSD symptoms. Emotion dysregulation was associated with impairment in functioning and exposure to trauma beyond other self-organization disturbances and core PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Disturbances in self-organization are frequent in sexually assaulted adolescents, and emotion dysregulation is associated with impairment and further exposure to trauma. Emotion dysregulation should be considered in preventive and treatment strategies for these vulnerable youth.

AB Objective/Background: Numerous psychiatric conditions characterized by repetitive negative thinking (RNT) are also frequently associated with disruptions in the duration and timing of sleep. The emerging literature supports that these types of sleep disruptions may be associated with negative psychological consequences such as depressed mood, anxiety, and poor emotion regulation, all of which have features of RNT. There is a paucity of research on the association between RNT and disruptions in sleep duration and timing in adolescents. The aim of the current study was to examine if sleep duration and timing in an adolescent sample would be predictive of RNT. Participants: Participants included 1,021 adolescents (ages 11 to 17) from a public school district in upstate New York. Methods: Participants completed a survey about their sleep practices, symptoms of psychopathology, and RNT. Results: Results indicated that sleep timing was predictive of RNT, but sleep duration was not. This result remained even after controlling for symptoms of psychopathology. Further, sleep onset latency was also predictive of RNT. Conclusions: These results indicate that it may be important to make the distinction between sleep duration and sleep timing. Sleep timing may uniquely impact RNT in adolescents.

AB Objective: We examine how instructions to exclude behaviors occurring in playful or joking contexts influence the measurement of physical partner violence victimization. Specifically, we demonstrate how such instructions influence the prevalence and validity of self-reported victimization. Method: Study 1 used a Think Aloud procedure to evaluate thoughts of college students (n = 451) reporting victimization experiences that occurred during high school. Participants were randomized to report on physical partner violence victimization with or without instructions to exclude playful acts. Study 2 experimentally evaluated whether the instructions affect the criterion validity of victimization scores with measures of depressive symptoms and emotion regulation among first-year college students (n = 615). Study 3 sought to replicate findings from Study 2 in a community sample of 18-25-year-olds (n = 398), using alternative violence items, response formats, and a different recall period. Study 4 utilized a short-term longitudinal design to replicate the pattern of findings from Studies 2 and 3, and examine how instructions influence self-reports of revictimization over a 2-month follow-up among first-year college students (n = 887). Study 5 presents a single-paper meta-analysis that synthesizes prevalence rates across these four studies. Results: Overall, instructions designed to eliminate aggressive acts in joking contexts did not consistently influence prevalence rates of victimization or improve criterion validity over standard instructions. Conclusions: Instructions designed to exclude behaviors occurring in playful or joking contexts do not necessarily produce more valid self-reports of physical partner violence victimization, as compared with standard instructions.

AB Objective: Although there has been a considerable amount of research on the association between emotional dysregulation and intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration, few researchers have examined this connection from a dyadic perspective. This perspective is important because emotional regulation is a largely dyadic process and IPV is often bidirectional. The current research aims to identify how partners' levels of emotional dysregulation interact to predict IPV perpetration. Method: Participants included young adult romantic dyads (N = 160). Participants completed self-report measures of emotional dysregulation and psychological, physical, and sexual violence perpetration. Results: Actor and partner effects for physical and sexual violence perpetration were found and only an actor effect for psychological perpetration was found, indicating that higher levels of emotional dysregulation of either partner were associated with an increased risk of physical and sexual violence perpetration, and a higher risk of psychological perpetration when only the actor was dysregulated. A significant interaction between partners' levels of emotional dysregulation, gender, and physical perpetration was found, indicating that when men were paired with relatively regulated female partners, their own dysregulation was not related to their perpetration. However, when paired with a relatively dysregulated female partner, their own dysregulation was related to their perpetration. Conclusions: These results underscore the dyadic nature of couple conflict and the importance of addressing both partners' emotional dysregulation in interventions. Future research would benefit from the development of measures of interpersonal emotion regulation and exploration of the possibility that couples-focused emotion regulation therapy may mitigate experiences of IPV.

AB Prior research has stated that successful emotion regulation (ER) contributes to psychological health and favorable interpersonal relationships. However, few studies have explored adaptive ER strategies in a school setting. The present study targeted Japanese female adolescents and examined the relationship between two specific ER strategies (reappraisal and suppression) and school adjustment, with social support as a mediating variable. Two hundred and seventy Japanese middle school girls completed measures of ER, perceived social support, and subjective school adjustment. The results showed that school adjustment was highest among reappraisers, followed by a balanced group who used both strategies with equal frequency, then suppressors. In addition, reappraisal showed both direct and indirect effects on school adjustment, while suppression showed only a negative indirect effect on school adjustment. Our findings suggest that reappraisal is an effective strategy that promotes receiving social support and consequently enhances school adjustment. Suppression, on the other hand, has neither favorable nor harmful impacts on school adjustment, but may, in the long run, result in poorer adjustment by impairing social relationships among adolescent girls.

AB Background Social anxiety is common in autistic adolescents. While emerging evidence indicates the importance of several mechanisms (including intolerance of uncertainty (IU), alexithymia and sensory processing) for maintaining anxiety, limited research has explored how these factors are associated with social anxiety in autistic adolescents.
   Methods We investigated whether IU, emotional and sensory processing are related to social anxiety in autistic and neurotypical adolescents, gathering experimental and questionnaire data from 61 autistic and 62 neurotypical 11- to 17-year-olds recruited to have similarly high levels of anxiety.
   Results In autistic and neurotypical adolescents matched for social anxiety, similar significant associations were observed between social anxiety and IU, alexithymia, maladaptive emotion regulation, sensory hypersensitivity and interoceptive sensibility. Taking a dimensional approach, we found that child- and parent-reported IU, alexithymia and sensory hypersensitivity mediated the relationship between autistic traits and social anxiety symptoms in the combined group of adolescents.
   Conclusions Our findings indicate that similar correlates of social anxiety are evident in autistic and neurotypical youths experiencing social anxiety and further our understanding of mechanisms that may contribute towards social anxiety in both groups.

The Youth Inventory 4 (YI-4) test was administered to assess risk of addiction in 668 participants between 13 and 19 years old. Representations of the attachment were evaluated with Cartes, Modeles Individuelles de Relation, reduced version (CaMir-R), and self-concept dimensions, with Autoconcepto Forma 5 (AF5). The results indicate a high risk of substance addiction in adolescence, 19.5%, both for boys and girls, CI between 15.4 and 24.3, with age being a risk factor. The prevalence of addiction risk decreases with high scores on security, which correlates -.22 with such a risk and positive academic self-concept, correlating -.20.

AB Background: In DSM 5, three disorders are related to trauma and/or maltreatment: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) but how these disorders relate to each other and to traumatic events is unknown.
   Objective: We examined 1. Prevalence of Potentially Traumatic Events (PTEs) and poly-victimization for youths in foster care. 2. Associations between single/multiple PTEs and PTSD, DSED, and the two symptom-clusters that constitute RAD: Failure to seek/accept comfort (RAD A), and Low social-emotional responsiveness/ emotion dysregulation (RAD B).
   Participants, setting and methods: Foster youth 11-17 years (N = 303) in Norway completed The Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen. Foster parents completed the RAD and DSED Assessment interview.
   Results: Foster youth reported experiencing, on average, 3.44 PTEs each (range 0-15, SD 3.33), and 52.9 % reported PTSD symptoms at or above clinical cut off. The PTE sum score was associated with the latent factors PTSD (r = .66, p < 0.001), RAD cluster B symptoms (Low social-emotional responsiveness / emotion dysregulation, r = .28, p < 0.001) and DSED (r = .11, p = 0.046), but not with RAD cluster A symptoms (Failure to seek/accept comfort).
   Conclusions: These findings raise new questions about the nature, mechanisms and timing of development of RAD and DSED. Maltreatment assessment needs to encompass a wide range of PTEs, and consider poly-victimization.

AB Background: Child maltreatment, trauma symptoms, and alpha electroencephalography (EEG) asymmetry have been linked to problem behaviors and alcohol use disorders.
   Objective: The goal of this pilot study was to clarify the role of alpha EEG asymmetry in the relation of maltreatment and problem behaviors. It was hypothesized that adolescents with more maltreatment, trauma symptoms, and right alpha EEG asymmetry would have more problem behaviors and alcohol use. It was also hypothesized that alpha EEG asymmetry would moderate the association between maltreatment/trauma symptoms and problem behaviors.
   Participants and Setting: Participants were 52 adolescents aged 12-14 years. Resting-state alpha EEG asymmetry was measured in this home-based study as a potential moderator in the association of child maltreatment and trauma symptoms to problem behaviors including alcohol use.
   Results: Child maltreatment reports and trauma symptoms were significantly associated with problem behaviors (beta = 0.259, p = 0.037 and beta = 0.594, p < 0.001, respectively). Trauma symptoms were associated with alcohol-use (Incidence Rate Ratio = 1.048, p = 0.032). Right alpha EEG asymmetry moderated the positive association of trauma symptoms and problem behaviors (beta = - 0.383, p = 0.024). However, this was not the case for left alpha EEG asymmetry.
   Conclusions: Neural correlates associated with individuals' affective-behavioral profiles may play a role in the susceptibility for problem behaviors among adolescents exposed to higher levels of childhood trauma. This could be useful in developing targeted assessments and interventions to prevent or treat these problems in adolescents.

AB Objective: Problems in childhood and adolescence are often present with recurring physical signs of illness, called somatoform symptoms. These symptoms are a common reason for consultation at both paediatric care and psychotherapeutic/psychiatric praxis. We propose that attachment is a possible predictive factor. This article provides a systematic overview of the existing research literature concerning the relationship between attachment and somatoform symptoms in children and adolescents.
   Methods: A systematic search for empirical articles from 1990 up to August 2018 focusing on this association was conducted. Out of six databases, 4994 studies were detected by using defined keywords. One study was added identified by checking reference lists. Finally, 15 studies were selected, which were the bases for the narrative review. Ten studies were included in meta-analysis.
   Results: Combining study results, we found that attachment cannot solely predict somatoforrn symptoms. Mixed results are shown. The quantitative analysis substantiated these narrative results, revealing a small but significant combined effect size of Delta approximate to .12 (95% CI .04-.19).
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that a relationship exists, but further investigations need to demonstrate that these are not only superficial. There are many developmental factors that affect the relationship between attachment and somatoform symptoms in children and adolescents. Further research should explore this interplay in order to gain a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to these correlations and to discover possible predicting factors.

AB This study examined the prevalence of cyber-aggression in Spanish adolescent couples as well as the common and differential predictors for cyber-aggression and psychological aggression using a short-term longitudinal study. Over a 6-month period, six hundred and thirty-two (632) Spanish adolescents with romantic relationship experience from seven schools were randomly selected to participate in the study (51% male; average age = 15.03). The results revealed a prevalence of cyber-aggression of 13% and that 68.3% of adolescents engaged in psychological aggression. Girls were significantly more involved than boys in both forms. The analysis of predictors for cyber and psychological aggression showed that these two forms of aggression shared a common factor, negative couple quality. Furthermore, cognitive empathy predicted cyber-aggression whereas anger regulation and jealousy predicted psychological aggression. These results highlighted the need to consider the particular characteristics of each setting, face-to-face and online, for designing future prevention programs.

AB Objectives The aim of the current research was to develop and validate a parent, self-report questionnaire to measure parents' gendered beliefs about emotion. Methods Scale items were first developed based on a previous qualitative study examining emotions, parenting, and gender in a sample of parents. The Parents' Gendered Emotion Beliefs scale (PGEB) was validated in a sample of 704 parents of middle childhood youth. Results Item-response theory analyses indicated a three-factor solution with factors measuring beliefs consistent with: gendered emotion expression, gender-neutral emotion expression, and gendered emotion socialization. All factors showed good internal consistency with alphas ranging from 0.79 to 0.90. Analyses then examined convergent validity by correlating PGEB factors to established measures of broad emotion beliefs, emotion socialization, family expressiveness, and child emotion regulation and psychopathology. Conclusions Overall, findings support the PGEB, its factor structure and psychometric properties, and its potential to contribute to our understanding of the role of gender in emotion socialization and children's emotional development.

AB Insecure attachment to primary caregivers is associated with the development of depression symptoms in children and youth. This association has been shown by individual studies testing the relation between attachment and depression and by meta-analyses focusing on broad internalizing problems instead of depression or adult samples only. We therefore meta-analytically examined the associations between attachment security and depression in children and adolescents, using a multilevel approach. In total, 643 effect sizes were extracted from 123 independent samples. A significant moderate overall effect size was found (r = .31), indicating that insecure attachment to primary caregivers is associated with depression. Multivariate analysis of the significant moderators that impacted on the strength of the association between attachment security and depression showed that country of the study, study design, gender, the type of attachment, and the type of instrument to assess attachment uniquely contributed to the explanation of variance. This study suggests that insecure attachment may be a predictor of the development of depression in children and adolescents. When treating depression in children, attachment should therefore be addressed.

AB Background Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with emotional problems, and their co-occurrence often leads to worse outcomes. We investigated the developmental associations between ADHD and emotional problems from childhood to early adolescence and examined the genetic and environmental contributions to their developmental link. We further tested whether this developmental association remained across the transition to young adulthood.
   Methods We used data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a cohort of 2,232 British twins. In childhood, ADHD and emotional problems were assessed at ages 5, 7, 10 and 12 with mothers' and teachers' reports. At age 18, we used self-reported symptoms according to DSM-5 criteria for ADHD, and DSM-IV for anxiety and depression.
   Results Longitudinal analyses showed that earlier ADHD was associated with later emotional problems consistently across childhood. However, earlier emotional problems were not associated with later ADHD symptoms. The developmental association between ADHD and later emotional problems in childhood was entirely explained by common genetic factors. Consistent with results in childhood, earlier symptoms of ADHD were associated with later emotional problems during the transition to young adulthood.
   Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that ADHD symptoms are predictors of the development of emotional problems, from childhood up to young adulthood, through shared genetic influences. Interventions targeting ADHD symptoms might prevent the development of emotional problems. Clinicians treating youth with ADHD must be aware of their risk for developing emotional problems and ought to assess, monitor and treat emotional problems alongside ADHD symptoms from childhood to adulthood.

AB Emotion dysregulation is common in autism spectrum disorder; a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms could inform treatment development. The tendency toward repetitive cognition in autism spectrum disorder may also increase susceptibility to perseverate on distressing stimuli, which may then increase emotion dysregulation. Therefore, this study investigated the mechanisms of sustained processing of negative information in brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used an event-related task that alternated between emotional processing of personally relevant negative words, neutral words, and a non-emotional task. A priori criteria were developed to define heightened and sustained emotional processing, and feature conjunction analysis was conducted to identify all regions satisfying these criteria. Participants included 25 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and 23 IQ-, age-, and gender-matched typically developing controls. Regions satisfying all a priori criteria included areas in the salience network and the prefrontal dorsolateral cortex, which are areas implicated in emotion regulation outside of autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, activity in the identified regions accounted for a significant amount of variance in emotion dysregulation in the autism spectrum disorder group. Overall, these results may provide a potential neural mechanism to explain emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder, which is a significant risk factor for poor mental health.
   Lay abstract
   Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder struggle with emotions that are intense and interfering, which is referred to as emotion dysregulation. Prior research has established that individuals with autism may be more likely than individuals who are not autistic to have repetitive thoughts. It is possible that persistent thoughts about negative or distressing stimuli may contribute to emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder. This study aimed to identify areas of the brain with evidence of persistent processing of negative information via functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging. We used a task that alternated between emotional processing of personally relevant negative words, neutral words, and a non-emotional task. Criteria were developed to define heightened and persistent emotional processing, and analyses were conducted to identify all brain regions satisfying these criteria. Participants included 25 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and 23 typically developing adolescents who were similar to the autism spectrum disorder group in IQ, age, and gender ratios. Brain regions identified as having greater and continued processing following negative stimuli in the autism spectrum disorder group as compared with the typically developing group included the salience network and the prefrontal dorsolateral cortex. These areas have been previously implicated in emotion dysregulation outside of autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, brain activity in the identified regions was associated with parent-reported emotion dysregulation in the autism spectrum disorder group. These results help to identify a potential process in the brain associated with emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder. This information may be useful for the development of treatments to decrease emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder.

AB Background Research investigating the role of emotion regulation (ER) in the development and treatment of psychopathology has increased in recent years. Evidence suggests that an increased focus on ER in treatment can improve existing interventions. Most ER research has neglected young people, therefore the present meta-analysis summarizes the evidence for existing psychosocial intervention and their effectiveness to improve ER in youth. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-one randomized-control-trials (RCTs) assessed changes in ER following a psychological intervention in youth exhibiting various psychopathological symptoms. We found moderate effect sizes for current interventions to decrease emotion dysregulation in youth (g = - 0.46) and small effect sizes to improve emotion regulation (g = 0.36). Significant differences between studies including intervention components, ER measures and populations studied resulted in large heterogeneity. This is the first meta-analysis that summarizes the effectiveness for existing interventions to improve ER in youth. The results suggest that interventions can enhance ER in youth, and that these improvements correlate with improvements in psychopathology. More RCTs including larger sample sizes, different age groups and psychopathologies are needed to increase our understanding of what works for who and when.

TI Development of a Composite Primary Outcome Score for Children with

AB Objective: Study goals were to (1) provide a rationale for developing a composite primary outcome score that includes symptom severity for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emotional dysregulation, plus symptom-induced impairment; (2) demonstrate weighting methods to calculate the composite score using a sample of children diagnosed with ADHD and aggression; and (3) identify the optimal weighting method most sensitive to change, as measured by effect sizes.
   Methods: We conducted secondary data analyses from the previously conducted Treatment of Severe Childhood Aggression (TOSCA) study. Children aged 6-12 years were recruited through academic medical centers or community referrals. The composite primary outcome comprised the ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, and peer conflict subscales from the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI), a DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)-referenced rating scale of symptom severity and symptom-induced impairment. Five weighting methods were tested based on input from senior statisticians.
   Results: The composite score demonstrated a larger (Cohen's d) effect size than the individual CASI subscales, irrespective of the weighting method (10%-55% larger). Across all weighting methods, effect sizes were similar and substantial: approximately a two-standard deviation symptom reduction (range: -1.97 to -2.04), highest for equal item and equal subscale weighting, was demonstrated, from baseline to week 9, among all TOSCA participants. The composite score showed a medium positive correlation with the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scores, 0.46-0.47 for all weighting methods.
   Conclusions: A composite score that included severity and impairment ratings of ADHD and emotional dysregulation demonstrated a more robust pre-post change than individual subscales. This composite may be a more useful indicator of clinically relevant improvement in heterogeneous samples with ADHD than single subscales, avoiding some of the statistical limitations associated with multiple comparisons. Among the five similar weighting methods, the two best appear to be the equal item and equal subscale weighting methods.

AB There are few studies of behavior problems in preterm children prior to 2 years old and the changes that occur over time. The aims of this study were to examine the patterns and prediction of behavior problems and the effects of gender and socioeconomic status (SES) on behavior problems in preterm children at the toddler and preschool periods. Parents of 124 very low birthweight preterm children completed a standardized behavior questionnaire at 18 months corrected age and 3 years old. At both times, scores were significantly higher on Attention and Withdrawn Problems than on other behavior problem syndromes. There was a significant overall increase in Externalizing and Internalizing behavior problem scores between 18 months and 3 years, particularly in Internalizing problems. Overall prediction for normal versus not-normal categorization (>= 1 standard deviation) on behavior problem and broad-spectrum scales ranged from 77% to 90% and was higher for children in the normal than not-normal categories. Boys had higher Internalizing Problems at 18 months and higher Externalizing Problems at 3 years. Children from low SES families had higher Internalizing and Total Behavior problems at 18 months and higher Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Behavior problems at 3 years. Screening preterm children for behavior problems before 2 years old appears useful for early intervention of such problems.

AB Objectives: To compare demographic, clinical, and familial characteristics across bipolar disorder (BD) subtypes in adolescents.
   Methods: A total of 168 participants, 13 to 19 years of age, with BD-I (n = 41), BD-II (n = 68), or operationalized BD-not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 59) were recruited from a tertiary subspecialty clinic at an academic health sciences center. Diagnoses were determined using the semistructured K-SADS-PL (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version) interview. Omnibus analyses were followed up with post hoc pairwise comparisons.
   Results: After controlling for age, race, and living with both natural parents, BD-I was associated with greater functional impairment, increased rates of psychiatric hospitalization, psychosis, and lifetime exposure to second-generation antipsychotics and lithium, less self-injurious behavior, less anxiety disorders, and less severe worst lifetime depression and lower levels of emotional dysregulation and lability compared with both BD-II and BD-NOS. Lifetime most severe manic symptoms were highest in BD-I, lowest in BD-NOS, with BD-II intermediate. Lifetime exposure to psychosocial treatment followed the opposite pattern: lowest in BD-I, highest in BD-NOS, with BD-II intermediate. Variables for which there were no significant between-group differences included suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, comorbidities other than anxiety, or family history of BD.
   Conclusion: Among observed differences, most distinguish BD-I from other subtypes, whereas few variables differed between BD-II and BD-NOS. Different BD subtypes share important similarities in multiple clinical and familial characteristics, including family history of BD. Present findings support and extend knowledge regarding the course and outcome of bipolar youth study operationalized definition of BD-NOS. Further research is warranted to evaluate intermediate phenotypes and treatment strategies that address these subtype-related differences.

AB Childhood maltreatment is a major risk factor for emotional problems in adolescence and adulthood and has deleterious effects on cognitive functions such as working memory. A key aspect in the study of the cognitive and affective consequences of maltreatment is autobiographical memory, especially regarding the difficulty retrieving specific memories, known as overgeneral memory. In this study, autobiographical memory tests, working memory, and a depressive symptom assessment were administered to 48 adolescents in care with a history of maltreatment (22 abused and 26 neglected) without mental disorder, who had been removed from their family and were living in residential child care, and to 61 adolescents nonmaltreated who had never been placed in care. The results show that adolescents with a history of maltreatment remember fewer specific events (Cohen d = 1.1-1.3) and that both working memory and depressive symptoms are involved in overgeneral memory (R-2 = .13-.26). Directions for future research include neuropsychological assessment and implementation of a training program to increase specific memory recall in this population.

AB Objective To test whether polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-S) interacts with childhood adversity and daily-life stressors to influence momentary mental state domains (negative affect, positive affect, and subtle psychosis expression) and stress-sensitivity measures.
   Methods The data were retrieved from a general population twin cohort including 593 adolescents and young adults. Childhood adversity was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Daily-life stressors and momentary mental state domains were measured using ecological momentary assessment. PRS-S was trained on the latest Psychiatric Genetics Consortium schizophrenia meta-analysis. The analyses were conducted using multilevel mixed-effects tobit regression models.
   Results Both childhood adversity and daily-life stressors were associated with increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, and increased subtle psychosis expression, while PRS-S was only associated with increased positive affect. No gene-environment correlation was detected. There is novel evidence for interaction effects between PRS-S and childhood adversity to influence momentary mental states [negative affect (b = 0.07, P = 0.013), positive affect (b = -0.05, P = 0.043), and subtle psychosis expression (b = 0.11, P = 0.007)] and stress-sensitivity measures.
   Conclusion Exposure to childhood adversities, particularly in individuals with high PRS-S, is pleiotropically associated with emotion dysregulation and psychosis proneness.

AB Social support promotes resilience to adverse childhood events, but little is known about the role of natural mentors-caring, nonparental adults-in the lives of childhood abuse survivors. The current study draws from a large, longitudinal, nationally representative sample (Add Health) to examine the prevalence and characteristics of natural mentoring relationships for adolescents with a history of caregiver childhood abuse, and the extent to which these relationships are associated with psychological and health outcomes in adulthood. Among the sample (n = 12,270), 28.82% and 4.86% reported caregiver childhood physical and sexual abuse, respectively. Youth who reported caregiver childhood physical abuse were more likely than those who did not endorse abuse to report having a natural mentor, but their mentoring relationships were characterized by lower interpersonal closeness, shorter duration, and less frequent contact. Exposure to caregiver childhood abuse was associated with adverse outcomes during adulthood, including antisocial behavior, physical health limitations, and suicidality; the presence of a natural mentor did not buffer the negative impact of trauma on adult outcomes. However, longer mentoring relationships during adolescence buffered the strength of the association between both caregiver physical and sexual abuse during childhood and suicidality during early adulthood.

TI Prevalence of Electronic Cigarette Dependence Among Youth and Its
   Association With Future Use
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN

AB Question What are the prevalence, symptom presentation, and future vaping patterns associated with youth electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) dependence? Findings In this cohort study of 444 youths aged 16 to 18 years with past-year e-cigarette use, 11.7% of youth reported experiencing at least 1 e-cigarette dependence symptom. While less common and severe than combustible cigarette dependence, e-cigarette dependence had a similar symptom profile and was positively associated with vaping continuation, frequency, and intensity 6 months later. Meaning These findings suggest that e-cigarette dependence among youth may be an expression of tobacco use disorder that is associated with use escalation.
   This cohort study examines the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) dependence among youth in Southern California and the association of e-cigarette dependence with future e-cigarette use.
   Importance Understanding the prevalence and symptoms of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) dependence and its association with future e-cigarette use among youth may help to guide pediatric clinical services and health policy. Objectives To examine the cross-sectional prevalence and symptom presentation of e-cigarette dependence and to determine whether e-cigarette dependence is associated with subsequent e-cigarette use patterns 6 months later among youth with baseline past-year e-cigarette use. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study used baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys among students in the 12th grade during the 2016 to 2017 school year who reported any past-year e-cigarette use. Surveys were conducted on site in 10 high schools in Los Angeles, California. Data were analyzed from March 2019 to December 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures Self-reported checklist of 10 tobacco product dependence symptoms reflecting loss of control over use, craving or urge, or withdrawal symptoms while abstinent, completed at baseline and administered separately for e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. Reporting 1 or more symptoms indicated a positive screen for dependence. Vaping continuation, defined as any past 6-month vaping, and past 30-day nicotine vaping days (range, 0-30), sessions per vaping day (range, 0-20), and puffs per session (range, 0-20) at 6-month follow-up were assessed. Results Among 3168 twelfth-grade students who completed the baseline survey, 444 youths (mean [SD] age, 17.48 [0.39] years; 217 [48.9%] female) reported past-year e-cigarette use. Among these, 52 youths (11.7%) reported at least 1 e-cigarette dependence symptom. Among youth who reported past-year dual e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use, combustible cigarette dependence, reported by 43 youths (29.7%), was more prevalent than e-cigarette dependence, which was reported by 24 youths (16.4%). The most common symptoms, craving, urge, and need to use, and least common symptoms, abstinence-related concentration and emotional problems, were similar in both combustible and e-cigarette dependence. The prevalence of e-cigarette dependence was higher among youth who reported vaping in the past month than among those who did not (41 youths [17.6%] vs 11 youths [5.2%]; P < .001) and among youth who used e-cigarettes with nicotine than among those who used e-cigarettes without nicotine (42 youths [15.2%] vs 10 youths [6.0%]; P = .004). After adjusting for baseline vaping and e-cigarette dependence risk propensity scores, baseline e-cigarette dependence symptom status was associated with vaping continuation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.07-4.94]; P = .02) and past 30-day number of nicotine vaping days (adjusted rate ratio, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.44-3.28]; P < .001), vaping sessions per day (adjusted rate ratio, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.52-3.83]; P < .001), and puffs per session (adjusted rate ratio, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.09-2.66]; P = .02) at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that e-cigarette dependence may be an expression of tobacco use disorder associated with future use persistence and escalation among youth. Electronic cigarette dependence may be a behavioral health consequence of adolescent vaping that warrants consideration in pediatric patient care and public health policy.

AB This paper is a twelve-month follow-up study that explores perceived outcomes from participation in a Norwegian wilderness therapy program. Through a critical realist approach, the authors performed an in-depth analysis of individual interviews with ten adolescent participants. Long-term outcomes included the transfer and adaptation of calming and nature-supported strategies to the participants' home environments, improvements in mood and emotional regulation, and increased social interaction. Overall, the adolescents seemed to exert greater independence and agency in their lives at twelve months post-treatment. This ability appeared to be facilitated by underlying processes that entailed insight, awareness, and acceptance of oneself and one's situation. The authors suggest that these emerging stories are fragile, yet conditioned by a fundamental (re)connection with the self and address this cautious proposition in the discussion. Finally, a more precise theoretical framework should be developed to support future in-depth explorations.

AB Objective Parental accommodation contributes to the maintenance of child anxiety and related symptoms. The current study examines the contributions of parent and child factors to parental accommodation in a sample of anxious youth.
   Methods Sixty-four treatment-seeking youth (6-16 years) and their mothers, as well as a subset of fathers (N = 41) reported on parental accommodation, parental distress and emotion regulation, child psychopathology, child externalizing behaviors, and child intolerance of uncertainty.
   Results Parental accommodation was not related to parental distress or emotion regulation. Parents who viewed their child as being more symptomatic (e.g., anxious, externalizing, and intolerant of uncertainty) were more likely to engage in accommodation. For mothers, child anxiety and externalizing symptoms were notable predictors of accommodation.
   Conclusions Parent perceptions of child symptomology is an important factor significantly related to accommodation behaviors. This finding can be used to inform programming designed to target parental responses to child anxiety and related disorders.

AB Objective: Sleep difficulties are pervasive in Chinese adolescents, which exert aversive influence on their emotional health. However, the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. This study addressed whether stress responses mediate the concurrent and prospective relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms in Chinese adolescents.
   Method: 17,946 adolescents (14-18 years-old) were administrated the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Responses to Stress Questionnaire. Further, 710 of them finished the one-year follow-up assessments. Structural equation models were conducted to determine the concurrent and prospective mediation effects of stress responses and the moderated effect of gender and age.
   Results: Involuntary engagement and disengagement responses, as well as engagement coping, significantly mediated the cross-sectional relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms. Moreover, sleep difficulties at baseline predicted enhanced involuntary engagement responses but reduced the use of engagement coping strategies one year later, resulting in an elevated level of depressive/anxiety symptoms. Finally, females and younger adolescents with greater sleep difficulties were more likely to generate maladaptive stress responses.
   Limitations: First, sleep difficulties were only measured using self-reported approaches. Second, potential confounding variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) were not adjusted for. Third, our study only focused on typically-developing youth samples rather than clinical samples.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the important role of stress responses in the relationship between sleep difficulties and depressive/anxiety symptoms. The findings might also shed some light on the psychological intervention of sleep difficulties and mood disorder in adolescent populations.

AB Background: In the last 10 years, psychological approaches based on mindfulness techniques have been proposed for the management of psychotic experiences.
   Method: In this brief review we summarized, to our knowledge for the first time, published studies on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) applied to the early phase of major psychoses (affective and non-affective).
   Results: Despite the great variability in terms of MBIs protocols, available studies on young people at risk to develop or with a first episode of psychosis suggest MBIs as a feasible, well-tolerated and effective approach in ameliorating symptoms, functioning, emotion regulation, and finally reducing the psychological distress associated with the onset of mania and/or psychotic experience.
   Limitations: The small sample size and inconsistencies between studies in terms of design, MBIs protocols and outcome measures suggest being cautious in interpreting and generalizing results. Moreover, specific guidelines are missing for the adaptation of MBIs to youth at risk of developing affective psychoses.
   Conclusions: Preliminary findings show that MBIs may be considered a promising adjunctive therapy for the treatment of major psychoses in the early phases of the illness. However, the conduct of further studies in larger samples and with a more rigorous methodology is warranted to confirm the beneficial effect of MBIs in the early stages of major psychoses.

AB The current study was aimed at contributing to the understanding of the role of perceived parental monitoring, psychological control, and coping strategies on adolescents' problem behaviors, in terms of anxiety and drinking behavior. Participants were 541 high school students, 17 to 19-year old (M = 17.09, SD = 0.80) high school students in Sicily and Calabria (Italy). Participants completed self-report measures assessing parental monitoring, psychological control, coping strategies (i.e., Task-Oriented, Emotion-Oriented, and Avoidance-Oriented). Results of the path analysis showed that coping strategies play a mediating role in the association between parental psychological control and both adolescents' anxiety and drinking behavior. Furthermore, a direct positive association was reported from parental psychological control and anxiety, while a negative direct association was reported from parental monitoring to drinking behavior. Results of this study provide a comprehensive model that showed that the different coping strategies could explain the psychological mechanisms that underline the associations between two different kinds of parental control (psychological control and monitoring) and both internalizing and externalizing adolescents' form of maladjustment (e.g. anxiety and drinking behaviors). Overall, coping strategies seem to be a fruitful target for the prevention programs for adolescents' anxiety and drinking behaviors.

AB Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently comorbid and, as both are defined as neurodevelopmental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, simultaneous diagnosis is possible. However, despite the frequency of this comorbid state, its endophenotypic features remain unclear. This study thus aimed to describe the behavioral and emotional problems in boys with comorbid ASD and ADHD using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).
   Methods In total, 102 boys (age, 6-12 years) diagnosed with one or both disorders were divided into three groups according to their clinical diagnosis: ASD + ADHD (N = 39), ASD (N = 37), and ADHD (N = 25). Symptoms and related behaviors were compared among the groups using parents' ratings of the autism spectrum quotient, ADHD rating scale-IV, and SDQ.
   Results In the ASD + ADHD group, the proportion of "clinical-range" cases was as high as 76.9% for the SDQ total difficulties score (TDS). The ASD + ADHD and ADHD groups had significantly higher TDS as well as behavioral problems and hyperactivity subscale scores than did the ASD group; however, the ASD + ADHD group did not have significantly different scores on any subscale compared with the other two groups. The ASD + ADHD and ASD groups also had significantly lower prosocial behavior scores than the ADHD group.
   Conclusions When using the SDQ as a screening tool for neurodevelopmental disorders, a high TDS, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and low prosocial behavior can be considered characteristic of ASD and ADHD comorbidity in 6- to 12-year-old boys.

AB Youth with autism spectrum disorder are at elevated risk for impaired emotion regulation and clinically impairing anxiety. A prior developmental framework posited that impaired emotion regulation leads to co-occurring psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, with outcome determined in part by autism spectrum disorder-specific moderating factors. Using measures developed and validated in autism spectrum disorder, this study evaluated (1) the association between emotion regulation and anxiety in a large, community-based sample of youth with autism spectrum disorder and a wide range of intellectual and verbal abilities and (2) whether greater core autism spectrum disorder symptoms strengthened the association between impaired emotion regulation and anxiety. Parents of 1107 children with a community diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (881 boys; age 6-17 years) participated in an online survey assessing their child's emotion regulation, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder symptoms. Emotion regulation impairment significantly predicted whether participants had elevated levels of anxiety, after controlling for demographic variables and autism spectrum disorder symptoms; however, there was no interaction of emotion regulation and autism spectrum disorder symptoms. This study is the first to support the anxiety-emotion regulation association with measures developed and validated specifically for autism spectrum disorder, in a large sample with co-occurring intellectual disability and minimally verbal youth with autism spectrum disorder.
   Lay abstract
   Many children with autism spectrum disorder have problems with managing their emotions (emotion regulation) and anxiety. In this study, over 1000 parents completed an online survey which showed that emotion regulation and anxiety are closely linked. Although emotion regulation and anxiety are inter-connected, the results also show that autism symptoms play an important role in anxiety in autism spectrum disorder. Emotion regulation problems may be an important target for the treatment of anxiety in autism.

AB Objective Weight loss during an inpatient obesity treatment is an important predictor of subsequent weight maintenance. However, psychological factors influencing weight loss are not well established. Psychological models suggest some importance of executive functioning and emotion regulation strategies. Therefore, this study investigated whether these factors predict weight loss during an inpatient obesity treatment and whether this effect holds after controlling for general personal and treatment characteristics.
   Method A total of 158 adolescents with diagnosed obesity underwent inpatient obesity treatment at a German rehabilitation clinic. Psychological factors (executive functioning and emotion regulation) were measured at admission and used to predict BMI reduction after treatment completion.
   Results More frequent use of reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy, but not suppression or executive functioning, predicted weight loss at the end of the obesity treatment, even after controlling for age, gender, treatment duration, and BMI at admission.
   Conclusion Functional emotion regulation strategies, like reappraisal, might offer an additional target for obesity treatment programmes, complementary to the more traditional components of psychoeducation, physical activity, and caloric restriction.

AB Background Eating disorders (EDs) are associated with a reduced ability to regulate emotion and impulses during the lifrks involving the pre-frontal cortex. Studies in EDs found impaired functioning in these domains, showing an association between EDs and the reduced ability to control emotions and impulses. Objective To investigate EF in adolescents and young women with eating disorders (ED) using a quasi-experimental design, focusing on cognitive efficiency, emotional regulation (ER) and behavioural outcomes also taking into account pharmacological treatment and duration of illness. Methods A sample of 151 females belonging to two groups took part in this study. Twenty-six girls and young women (M-age 22;8 years) with ED and 125 typically developed girls and young women (M-age 17;4 years) completed a battery of cognitive tasks (Go-no-go, Stop-signal task, Symmetry span, Reading Span) and the Youth Self-Report and the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale Performance. A series of ANOVA with the Brown-Forsythe test was used to compare the groups. Results Participants with ED and controls did not show significant differences in EF tasks, whereas differences between younger and older participants with ED emerged. Moreover, ER difficulties seem to be associated with mainly internalizing problems in EDs. Further analysis on the full ED sample did not reveal any significant differences associated with the disorder persistence. Considering pharmacological treatment effects over cognitive, emotional and behavioural measures emerged. Conclusions The present study documented no specific differences in EF between control and participants with EDs, whereas important differences emerged in ER and behavioural outcomes perception in the clinical sample, together with a partial influence of pharmacological treatment.

AB Objective Suicide attempts requiring hospitalization are known to be common in patients who are diagnosed with eating disorders. Attempting suicide is a major indicator for those at risk of completed suicide. Both the specific eating disorder diagnosis and the influence of psychiatric comorbidities on suicide attempts requiring hospitalization were investigated, with demographic and socioeconomic variables as confounders, over a 10-year observation period from January 2007 to March 2017.
   Methods Anonymized health-record data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) were retrieved through the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource; this is linked to national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data. These data include all diagnoses for inpatient admissions. Hazard ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated from cox regression analyses and the effects of a number of confounders were estimated by performing multivariable analyses.
   Results In total, 4,895 patients were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), or eating disorder otherwise not specified (EDNOS). Of these, 331 (6.7%) had attempted suicide requiring hospitalization and 21 (0.04%) completed suicide. The eating disorder category associated with the highest risk of a suicide attempt was AN (HR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.08-1.89, p = .01). The risk was significantly increased further if the patient had a comorbid diagnosis of personality disorder, depression, bipolar affective disorder, and substance misuse.
   Discussion Suicide attempts requiring hospitalization have a high incidence rate among patients with eating disorders, and the risk is significantly increased in AN. Comorbid psychiatric illness and suicidal ideation should be carefully assessed in all eating disorder patients.

AB The parent-child relationship and family context influence the development of emotion regulation (ER) brain circuitry and related skills in children and adolescents. Although both parents' and children's ER neurocircuitry simultaneously affect how they interact with one another, neuroimaging studies of parent-child relationships typically include only one member of the dyad in brain imaging procedures. The current study examined brain activation related to parenting and ER in parent-adolescent dyads during concurrent fMRI scanning with a novel task - the Testing Emotional Attunement and Mutuality (TEAM) task. The TEAM task includes feedback trials indicating the other dyad member made an error, resulting in a monetary loss for both participants. Results indicate that positive parenting practices as reported by the adolescent were positively correlated with parents' hemodynamic activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region related to empathy, during these error trials. Additionally, during feedback conditions both parents and adolescents exhibited fMRI activation in ER-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule. Adolescents had higher left amygdala activation than parents during the feedback condition. These findings demonstrate the utility of dyadic fMRI scanning for investigating relational processes, particularly in the parent-child relationship.

Analyses examined the frequency and persistence of SI and SSIB, and the association of SI and SSIB at any time point with child characteristics and internalizing and externalizing problems at age 7. SI occurred in 9.6% of children and was associated with fewer ASD symptoms and better adaptive functioning at age 7. SSIB occurred in 14.6% and was associated with poorer adaptive functioning and more externalizing behaviour at age 7. Internalizing problems were not associated with SI or SSIB at any time point. SI and SSIB rarely co-occurred (4%).

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate contributions of maternal emotional resources to individual differences in adolescents' functional connectivity during emotion regulation. Participants included 35 adolescent girls who completed an implicit emotion regulation task during fMRI. Mothers reported on the quality of their adult attachment and emotional awareness when youth were in elementary school. Higher anxious attachment and lower emotional awareness were significantly correlated with more positive amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity, a pattern linked in prior research with ineffective emotion regulation and emotional difficulties. Further, there was an indirect effect of anxious attachment on adolescent connectivity through emotional awareness. These results suggest that compromised maternal emotional resources in childhood may be linked to atypical neural processing of emotions.

AB Individuals with a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) tend to have altered pain perception and difficulty in regulating their emotions. Previous work on NSSI has relied heavily on retrospective self-report data and clinical Western samples. The present study explored pain perception, emotional reactivity, distress tolerance and self-compassion in a sample of non-clinical Turkish young adults with and without a history of self-injury by employing a multi-method, laboratory-based design. Participants were 70 Turkish young adults (34 with a history of NSSI and 36 controls). Pain was induced by the cold pressor test before and after a distressing card-sorting task. Skin conductance was recorded throughout the entire procedure. Measures of NSSI, emotion dysregulation and self-compassion were also administered. Although the groups were comparable in pain threshold and physiological reactivity to pain, participants with NSSI had increased pain tolerance and reported more subjective distress during the distressing task. Pain perception did not change as a function of distress and both groups were similar in physiological reactivity to distressing stimuli. Participants who self-injure reported less self-compassion and more difficulty in regulating emotions than controls. These findings illustrate that participants with a history of NSSI have altered pain perception and experience more subjective distress during a stressful task. Individuals who self-injure may benefit from interventions targeting emotion regulation and self-compassion.

TI Why does early childhood deprivation increase the risk for depression

AB Background Using data from the English & Romanian Adoptees (ERA) study, we recently reported that early time-limited exposure to severe institutional deprivation is associated with early-onset and persistent neurodevelopmental problems and later-onset emotional problems. Here, we examine possible reasons for the late emergence of emotional problems in this cohort. Our main focus is on testing a developmental cascade mediated via the functional impact of early-appearing neurodevelopmental problems on late adolescent functioning. We also explore a second putative pathway via sensitization to stress.
   Methods The ERA study includes 165 Romanian individuals who spent their early lives in grossly depriving institutions and were subsequently adopted into UK families, along with 52 UK adoptees with no history of deprivation. Age six years symptoms of neurodevelopmental problems and age 15 anxiety/depression symptoms were assessed via parental reports. Young adult symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by both parent and self-reports; young adults also completed measures of stress reactivity, exposure to adverse life events, and functioning in work and interpersonal relationships.
   Results The path between early institutional deprivation and adult emotional problems was mediated via the impact of early neurodevelopmental problems on unemployment and poor friendship functioning during the transition to adulthood. The findings with regard to early deprivation, later life stress reactivity, and emotional problems were inconclusive.
   Conclusions Our analysis suggests that the risk for adult depression and anxiety following extreme institutional deprivation is explained through the effects of early neurodevelopmental problems on later social and vocational functioning. Future research should more fully examine the role of stress susceptibility in this model.

AB Twenty-nine pediatric patients (age range, 10-16 years) with working memory (WM) deficits, including children with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) with and without attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity and children with ADHD, underwent a Cogmed WM training program. For both patient groups, WM performance on Cogmed tasks and on the Digit Span test improved significantly after training. Moreover, the PBD group improved on Trails Making Test A and on the Inhibition Scale, the Behavior Regulation Index, and the Global Executive Composite of the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function. The ADHD group improved significantly on the Trails Making Test B, the Spatial Span Test, and the Reading Fluency Test of the Woodcock-Johnson III, as well as on depressive symptoms. The present findings suggest that working memory training is beneficial not only in youths with ADHD but also in youths with PBD. They also show evidence of near and far transfer of WM improvement in these patients, although in different ways for the two patient groups. Future studies examining the mechanisms of cognitive remediation in pediatric patients will aid in creating tailored illness-specific cognitive interventions.

AB The school-based mental health promotion and suicide prevention universal program Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) significantly reduces incident suicide attempts and severe suicidal ideation. This paper aims at elucidating psychological mechanisms underlying YAM's efficacy. Our hypothesis is that YAM operates through interactions with coping strategies (CS) on the reduction of suicidal ideation (SI). In the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study, five coping strategies were assessed at baseline (T0) and 12-month follow-up (T12): "learning", "help-seeking", "arts", "sports" and "fight". We analyzed interactions between the YAM intervention, coping strategies and SI in the YAM group (N = 1693) and the minimal intervention group (N = 1909), after excluding prevalent cases with SI and previous suicide attempts from our total sample (N = 5654). General Linear Mixed Model regressions were performed. The present study confirms that coping strategies play an influential role on suicidal ideation. Our results showed that YAM acts whatever the prevailing coping strategies used. It is particularly efficient for pupils insufficiently using adaptive coping strategies such as LEARN and HELP-SEEKING or using maladaptive coping strategies, such as ARTS and FIGHT. The socialization induced by the YAM intervention seems to be a strong component of its efficiency.

AB Aim Borderline personality disorder and severe emotion dysregulation in adolescence is a major public health concern. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy is a promising treatment for suicidality in adolescents. The aim of this work is to present an adaptation of this intervention to the Spanish national health system, Actions for the Treatment of Adolescent Personality (ATraPA).
   Method Data consists of a description of the different ATraPA subprogrammes, including interventions for adolescents aged 13 to 17 and their families. Participants were referred to ATraPA from different hospitals within the region of Madrid, Spain.
   Results ATraPA has been developed as an intensive outpatient treatment and it comprises different subprogrammes. ATraPA-TAI is an intensive outpatient treatment, including a skills-based group, individual therapy and email therapy. ATraPA-FAL is a psychoeducational intervention for families, including emotion regulation strategies for parents themselves. Finally, the Alternatives Group is offered to adolescents during the hospital admission, with the aim of promoting alternative coping skills. The group of therapists provides a support network to the professionals involved in ATraPA.
   Conclusions ATraPA has been successfully implemented in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Service within the Spanish national health system. Future studies should address the efficacy of ATraPA using a controlled design.

AB Objective: Although it is known that certain emotion regulation processes produce a buffering effect on the relationship between life events and well-being, this issue has been poorly studied in the elderly population. Thus, the aim of the present study is to test and confirm a comprehensive model of the impact that past life events have on older adults' psychological distress, exploring the possible mediating roles of emotion regulation processes. These include rumination, experiential avoidance, and personal growth. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 387 people over 60 years old residing in the community were assessed on life events, physical functioning, emotion regulation variables, psychological well-being, as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression. Results: The structural model tested achieved a satisfactory fit to the data, explaining 73% of the variance of older adults' psychological distress. In addition, the main results suggest possible mediation effects of both the physical functioning and the emotional variables: rumination, experiential avoidance, and personal growth in the face of hardship. Conclusions: These findings confirm the importance of emotion regulation processes in the final stages of life. They reveal the various adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms that underlie the relationship between life events and psychological distress. The findings suggest - both in the explanatory models of psychological well-being and in psychotherapeutic interventions - the importance of emotion regulation in the elderly population's health.

   Design: Cross-sectional and descriptive study.
   Setting: Primary care (Health Area IV of the Principado of Asturias) and Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Spain.
   Participants: Parents of 87 premature children with birth weight less than 1500g and 43 full term controls, both aged 5-7 years.
   Main measurements: The BASC questionnaire (parent version) was applied.
   Results: Preterm children presented a high rate of inactivity (Z = -4.125, P < 0.001), anxiety (Z = -2.801, P = 0.005) and internalization problems (Z = -2.148, P = 0.032), being more evident at 5 years of age. Preterm boys show higher levels of hyperactivity (Z = -2.082, P = 0.037) and behavioural problems (Z = -2.354, P = 0.019) than girls, who presented more attentional problems (Z = -2.345; P = 0.019).
   Conclusions: The BASC questionnaire is useful for the detection and early diagnosis at the primary care level of the behavioral and emotional problems of premature children. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license

AB The goal was to examine the contribution of parenting style to externalizing/internalizing problems in children and early-adolescents, on the hypothesis that parenting style would affect externalizing and internalizing problems via its effects on behavioral dysregulation. The participants were parents and teachers of 199 children (111 F) from 6 to 15 years old. A multi-informant study was carried out to assess parenting style (parents reports), and (a) behavioral dysregulation, (b) aggressive behavior with peers, (c) hyperactivity/distractibility, (d) anxiety/fear, in an ecological interactive context such as the classroom (teacher report). We tested our hypotheses with Structural Equation Model analysis. Authoritarian style is associated with aggressive behavior with peers, hyperactivity/distractibility, and anxiety/fear, via its effects on behavioral dysregulation. These findings confirm that the authoritarian style plays an important role in externalizing and internalizing problems by increasing behavioral dysregulation, and it has broad implications for interventions aimed at reducing maladjustment in children and adolescents.

AB This reserach investigates the potential roles of different types of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) and self-esteem with the one of the most common presentations of mental health pathologies, depression. Two hundred seventy four first year university students participated in the study. Results indicated that in responding to threatening or stressful life situations, self-blame, rumination, refocusing on planning, and self-esteem were identified as predictors of depressive scores. The more frequent use of rumination and self-blame were related to the reporting of higher levels of depression and the more frequent use of refocusing on planning and higher levels of self-esteem were related to the reporting of lower levels of depression. Additionally, results showed that the effects of self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, acceptance, and refocusing on planning were mediated by self-esteem on depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that different CERS and self-esteem may have an influential role in the severity of depressive symptomatology. Effective clinical focus on self-esteem and the development and active use of adaptive CERS may mitigate depressive symptoms.

AB Individuals' emotion regulatory styles are differentially related to well-being. Drawing on self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci 2017, Self-determination theory: basic psychological needs in motivation, development, and wellness, Guilford Press, New York), researchers have recently explored the concept of integrative emotion regulation (IER) as an adaptive emotion regulation style, contrasting it with the less adaptive style of suppressive emotion regulation (SER). This research studied the extent to which the relations between IER and SER and well-being are mediated by the satisfaction and frustration of individuals' basic psychological needs. Data were collected in three countries, Israel (n = 224), Peru (n = 304), and Brazil (n = 203). Participants filled in questionnaires assessing the study variables. Multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that integrative emotion regulation positively predicted well-being, mediated by psychological need satisfaction, in all three countries. Moreover, psychological need frustration mediated the relationship between suppressive emotion regulation and well-being. The results support and extend recent findings demonstrating the adaptive outcomes of IER and the maladaptive outcomes of SER. The article concludes by discussing the implications and limitations of the research.

AB Objectives This study examines the feasibility and acceptability of a local adaptation of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) program for Filipino school children, called Kamalayan, that was facilitated by trained public school teachers. It also presents preliminary evidence of program effects on the children's depressive and anxiety symptoms and difficulties in emotion regulation. Methods We utilized a randomized controlled design with an active control condition. Filipino elementary and high school students aged 9 to 16 years old from low-resource schools were randomly assigned to the Kamalayan (n = 87) or the active control Handicrafts condition (n = 99). Changes in outcomes from baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 2-month follow-up were assessed using multilevel modeling. Results Participation in the Kamalayan program did not affect depression, anxiety, or emotion regulation. Impulse control difficulties increased for the Handicrafts group across post-intervention and follow-up but remained stable for Kamalayan participants. Depressive symptoms decreased over time for the Handicrafts group but remained stable for the Kamalayan condition. Implementation issues qualify the absence of program effects, such as the impracticability of delivering after-school sessions in the public school context, program content that may be discordant with cognitive-developmental and cultural considerations, and the inadequacy of the personal mindfulness practice of the paraprofessional facilitators. Conclusions The findings reaffirm the importance of using active control groups and considering the capacities of facilitators in evaluating the effects of mindfulness-based interventions. Testing mindfulness-based interventions in low-resource, non-Western school settings require deeper contextual adaptation and facilitator preparation.

AB The person's agentic "Will to Exist/Live and Survive" (WTELS) is overlooked in the literature. We proposed a measure as well as a conceptual predictive model for WTELS. The conceptual model included oppression and cumulative life adversities and WTELS as independent variables, existential annihilation anxieties (EAA), emotion regulation strategies, and self-esteem as mediating variables and psychopathology and posttraumatic growth (PTG) as outcome variables. The sample included 490 participants (age range: 14 to 75, M = 26.03, SD = 10.90, 20.4% adolescents, 58.6% females) from three Egyptian cities that represented different regional cultures. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses tested the structural validity of the measure, Path analysis supplemented by PROCESS macro was used to test the predictive validity of the measure and the effect size for each mediator. Multigroup invariance analysis tested the invariance of the measurement and structural models. The developed measure was found to have good reliability, stability, and structural validity. Path analysis validated its predictive validity and indicated that WTELS had strong direct negative effects on EAA and the direct and indirect negative effects on psychopathology. Self-esteem and emotion regulation (reappraisal) were mediators of its indirect effects. WTELS had direct positive effects on PTG and direct and indirect positive effects on emotion regulation. WTELS had direct and indirect positive effects on self-esteem. Its indirect effects on self-esteem were mediated by reappraisal. The results indicated that both the measurement and the structural models of WTELS were strictly invariant across gender, regional, age, and religious groups. We further discussed the importance of developing WTELS-focused intervention and prevention programs.

AB The general factor of psychopathology (GP, or p factor) and the Dysregulation Profile (DP) are two conceptually similar, but independently developed approaches to understand psychopathology. GP and DP models and their stability, antecedents and outcomes are studied in a longitudinal sample of 1073 children (49.8% female). GP and DP models were estimated at ages 8 and 14 years using the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR). Early childhood antecedents and adolescent outcomes were derived using a multi-method multi-informant approach. Results showed that the general GP and DP had similar key symptoms and were similarly related to early-childhood antecedents (e.g., lower effortful control, higher maternal depression) and adolescent outcomes (e.g., reduced academic functioning, poorer mental health). This study demonstrates that GP and DP are highly similar constructs in middle childhood and adolescence, both describing a general vulnerability for psychopathology with (emotional) dysregulation at its core. Scientific integration of these approaches could lead to a better understanding of the structure, antecedents and outcomes of psychopathology.

AB The goal of this study was to examine whether the links between Chinese college students' parental attachment, peer attachment, and prosocial behaviors were moderated by a physiological factor-baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). The simplified version of the Inventory of Parental and Peer Attachment (IPPA-R) and the Chinese version of the Prosocial Tendencies Measure (PTM-R) were administered to one hundred forty-four undergraduate students (M = 18.96 years, SD = 1.06 years; 30 % men) to assess parental and peer attachment and prosocial behaviors. Baseline RSA was calculated by electrocardiogram (ECG) data collected during a resting period in the laboratory. The results showed that both parental and peer attachment were positively associated with college students' global prosocial behaviors. Moreover, peer attachment interacted with baseline RSA to predict college students' global prosocial behaviors. Specifically, peer attachment was positively related to global prosocial behaviors among college students with low baseline RSA, while peer attachment was not related to global prosocial behaviors among college students with high baseline RSA. In addition, the examination with submeasures of prosocial behaviors revealed that parental and peer attachment and their interaction with baseline RSA have different effects on these different types of prosocial behaviors. The current findings highlight the importance of the consideration of psychosocial factors in conjunction with physiological factors to predict college students' prosocial behaviors.

AB It is unclear how individual differences in parenting and brain development interact to influence adolescent mental health outcomes. This study examined interactions between structural brain development and observed maternal parenting behavior in the prediction of adolescent depressive symptoms and psychological well-being. Whether findings supported diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility frameworks was tested. Participants completed observed interactions with their mothers during early adolescence (age 13), and the frequency of positive and aggressive maternal behavior were coded. Adolescents also completed structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at three time points: mean ages 13, 17, and 19. Regression models analyzed interactions between maternal behavior and longitudinal brain development in the prediction of late adolescent (age 19) outcomes. Indices designed to distinguish between diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility effects were employed. Results supported differential susceptibility: less thinning of frontal regions was associated with higher well-being in the context of low levels of aggressive maternal behavior, and lower well-being in the context of high levels of aggressive maternal behavior. Findings suggest that reduced frontal cortical thinning during adolescence may underlie increased sensitivity to maternal aggressive behavior for better and worse and highlight the importance of investigating biological vulnerability versus susceptibility.

AB Emotion regulation dysfunction is characteristic of psychotic disorders, but little is known about how the use of specific types of emotion regulation strategies differs across phases of psychotic illness. This information is vital for understanding factors contributing to psychosis vulnerability states and developing targeted treatments. Three studies were conducted to examine emotion regulation across phases of psychosis, which included (a) adolescent community members with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; n = 262) and adolescents without PLEs (n = 1,226); (b) adolescents who met clinical high-risk criteria for a prodromal syndrome (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 29); and (c) outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ; n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 67). In each study, participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and measures of psychiatric symptoms and functional outcome. The three psychosis groups did not differ from each other in reported use of suppression; however, there was evidence for a vulnerability-related, dose-dependent decrease in reappraisal. Across each sample, a lower use of reappraisal was associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Findings indicate that emotion regulation abnormalities occur across a continuum of psychosis vulnerability and represent important targets for intervention.

AB The parent-child relationship undergoes substantial reorganization over the transition to adolescence. Navigating this change is a challenge for parents because teens desire more behavioral autonomy as well as input in decision-making processes. Although it has been demonstrated that changes in parental socialization approaches facilitates adolescent adjustment, very little work has been devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms supporting parents' abilities to adjust caregiving during this period. Guided by self-regulation models of parenting, the present study examined how parental physiological and cognitive regulatory capacities were associated with hostile and insensitive parent conflict behavior over time. From a process-oriented perspective, we tested the explanatory role of parents' dysfunctional child-oriented attributions in this association. A sample of 193 fathers, mothers, and their early adolescent (ages 12-14) participated in laboratory-based research assessments spaced approximately 1 year apart. Parental physiological regulation was measured using square root of the mean of successive differences during a conflict task; cognitive regulation was indicated by set-shifting capacity. Results showed that parental difficulties in vagal regulation during parent-adolescent conflict were associated with increased hostile conflict behavior over time; however, greater set-shifting capacity moderated this association for fathers only. In turn, father's dysfunctional attributions regarding adolescent behavior mediated the moderating effect. The results highlight how models of self-regulation and social cognition may explain the determinants of hostile parenting with differential implications for fathers during adolescence.

AB At multiple developmental periods spanning from middle childhood through adolescence, we investigated the development of aggressive-victims. Multiple-informant data collected across four grade levels (1, 5, 8, and 11; N = 482; 50% females) was used to perform person-centered analyses including latent profile and latent transition analyses in order to examine the co-occurring development of multiple forms (i.e., physical, verbal, and relational) of aggression and peer victimization. Results indicated that there were two distinct subgroups of aggressive-victims, one of which was more relational in form (i.e., relational aggressive-victims), and children in these two subgroups were distinguishable with respect to their individual characteristics (emotion dysregulation, withdrawn behaviors, and moral disengagement) and relational experiences (peer rejection and friendships). Furthermore, the findings elucidated the mechanisms by which developmental continuity and change (i.e., transitions) among the subgroups occurred across childhood and adolescence.

AB Difficulties in regulating affect are core characteristics of a wide range of mental health conditions and are associated with deficits in cognitive control, particularly in affective contexts, affective control. The current study explored how affective control relates to mental health over the course of adolescence. We developed an Affective Control Task, which was administered to young adolescents (11-14 years; n = 29); mid-adolescents (15-18 years; n = 31), and adults (22-30 years; n = 31). The task required individuals to sort cards according to continuously changing rules: color, number, or item type. There was a neutral condition in which items were shapes, and an affective condition, in which items were emotional facial expressions. Better affective control was associated with fewer mental health difficulties (p < .001, R-2 = .15). Affective control partially accounted for the association between age group and mental health problems, z = 2.61, p = .009, Akaike information criterion = 484, with the association being strongest in young adolescents, r (27) = -.44, p = .018. Affective control further accounted for variance in the association between self-reported (but not experimental) emotion regulation and mental health (z = -3.44, p < .001, Akaike information criterion = 440). Poor affective control, especially in young adolescents, is associated with more mental health problems and higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties. Improving affective control therefore may constitute a promising target for prevention.

AB Although research has documented the adverse consequences of parental academic conditional regard in different developmental periods, few studies have examined antecedents and, in particular, the possibility of intergenerational continuity of this parenting dimension. The current study aimed to identify patterns of intergenerational similarity in two types of conditional regard (i.e., positive and negative). Additionally, it examined mothers' and adolescents' contingent self-esteem (CSE) and depressive symptoms as outcomes of this process. In total, 211 mothers and their 10- to 16-year-old adolescents filled out questionnaires assessing perceived conditional regard in the relationship with their own mother (i.e., grandmothers', and mothers' conditional positive (PACPR) and negative regard (PACNR)), contingent self-esteem (i.e., maternal child-invested CSE and adolescents' academic CSE), and maternal and adolescents' depressive symptoms. Results revealed direct intergenerational similarity for PACPR, but not for PACNR. Within generations, PACPR was related positively to CSE, which, in turn, was related positively to depressive symptoms. Moreover, PACNR was related positively to depressive symptoms. Our findings provide preliminary evidence for the intergenerational continuity of conditional regard, which has important consequences because of its relation to CSE and subsequent depressive symptoms within both generations.

ID ADOPTED-CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; CHILDHOOD
AB Background While considered a rare diagnosis, reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is simultaneously the subject of considerable debate. A recent report suggested that RAD is overdiagnosed in community settings and that conduct problems may be used to make a diagnosis of RAD (Woolgar & Baldock, Child and Adolescent Mental Health, 20, 2015, 34-40). This study seeks to replicate and extend these findings. Method Clinical assessment data from 100 consecutive admissions of maltreated foster and adopted children (ages 3-17) to a specialty treatment clinic in the United States were reviewed. Measures included semi-structured interviews of RAD and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED) symptoms and caregiver-report questionnaires of emotional problems, conduct problems, and the quality of the parent-child relationship. Results Of the 100 cases reviewed, 39 presented with a diagnostic history of RAD, DSED, or 'attachment disorder'. Of these cases, three were diagnosed in-clinic with DSED; no cases met diagnostic criteria for RAD according to DSM-5 criteria. However, analyses found that those diagnosed with RAD by community-based clinicians were significantly more likely to display conduct problems and to be adopted (as opposed to in foster care). Conclusions These findings confirm those of Woolgar and Baldock (Child and Adolescent Mental Health, 20, 2015, 34-40). It appears that the diagnostic criteria of RAD are commonly being inaccurately applied in general community-based practice. Clarification of diagnostic criteria for RAD in recent revisions of diagnostic taxonomies, the accumulation of empirical data on RAD, and improved instrumentation are either poorly disseminated or inadequately implemented in community-based practice settings.

AB Objective Adopting a socio-ecological perspective, we used data extracted from clinical casefiles to investigate factors associated with externalising and internalising problems in a large, representative sample of children with a diagnosis of dyslexia. Method This study is a secondary analysis of data collected by the Dyslexia-SPELD Foundation in Western Australia. Casefiles for school-aged children who had received a dyslexia diagnosis in 2014 and 2015 were identified (n = 1,235), and a subset of casefiles were randomly selected for data extraction (n = 454). Of the sample, 58% (n = 262) were male, 42% (n = 192) were female. Ages ranged between 6 and 17 years (M = 12.32, SD = 3.07). Casefiles include results from assessments of literacy-related achievement, as well as parent-reported information on behavioural and socio-emotional development. Results After controlling for child age, gender, and reading ability, it was found that low self-esteem, difficulties in emotion regulation, and social skills difficulties were all associated with externalising problems. Additionally, low self-esteem, difficulties in emotion regulation, and bullying victimisation were all associated with internalising problems. Peer relationship difficulties were indirectly associated with both externalising and internalising problems through associations with low self-esteem and difficulties in emotion regulation. Conclusion Self-esteem, bullying victimisation, emotion regulation, social skills, and peer problems are salient correlates of externalising and internalising problems in children with a diagnosis of dyslexia. Implications for intervention are discussed, both universal school-based mental health promotion programs, as well as more targeted programs for children with dyslexia.

AB The primary purpose of this review was to examine theory and research published during the past decade that focused on family processes and children's and adolescents' well-being. Scholarship focused on family processes and child and adolescent well-being made significant and exciting advances during this decade based on several key advancements. In addition to a brief introduction and a conclusion, this decade in review is organized into four sections. In the first section, advances made in the literature because of increased attention to complexity and specificity are illustrated. The second section describes advances that were made because of increased attention to family processes in diverse families. Diversity in the samples of families studied, extensions in family process models, and the revisioning of grand theories using a diversity lens that were used to conceptualize family processes are detailed. In the third section, the importance of time in the study of family processes and child and adolescent well-being is described. The emphasis on families' daily lives is noted. In addition, prospective considerations and studies of change over time are highlighted. Strengths in family functioning are detailed in the fourth section of this article: positivity, regulatory processes, and family organization. These three areas were selected to elaborate the idea that one of the major advancements in the family process literature during the past decade was an emphasis on family strengths. This review concludes with a commentary regarding how conceptual and methodological advancements during the past decade can guide future scholarship.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of peer bullying among the adolescents, determine the risk factors of PB and determine the relationship between peer bullying and psychiatric symptoms and expressed emotion. Methods: The sample of the study consisted of 5th, 6th 7th and 8th grade students, and the students who were selected with simple random sampling method were divided into four groups as the victim, bully, bully/victim and no peer bullying. In the study, a Personal Information Form, O/weus Bullying Questionnaire, Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and Shortened Expressed Emotion Scale were used as data collection tools. Results: Prevalence of peer bullying of secondary school was found to be %47 (31.4% victim, 4.6% bully, 11% bully/victim). VVhen the study groups were compared in terms of subscales, behavioral problems and emotional problems were significantly higher in both the bully and the victim groups, while prosocial behaviors were found to be significantly less in these two groups. However, teenagers, who were a victim or a bully, were found to perceive their families significantly less emotionally supportive and intrusive compared to their peers who were not a victim or a bully. The perception of the family as intrusive increased the chances of being a victim by 1.04 times and a victim/bully by 1.08 times. The lack of emotional support increased the chances of being a bully/victim by 1.03 times. Conclusion: Our study reveals that there is a relationship between emotional-behavioural problems and peer bullying. It has been found that being part of bully, victim or both forms of peer bullying is significantly related to psychopathology. The findings showed the importance of family climate in peer bullying.

AB Background Chronic medical conditions (CMCs) affect up to 35% of children and adolescents. Youth with chronic medical conditions are at an increased risk of psychological distress and reduced health-related quality of life, and report rates of mental illness up to double that of their physically healthy peers. Accessible, evidence-based interventions for young people with chronic illness are urgently required to improve their mental health and daily functioning. Self-compassion involves taking a mindful, accepting approach to difficult experiences, being aware that one is not alone in one's suffering, and being kind and understanding with oneself during challenging times. Self-compassion shares strong associations with mental health outcomes among young people and preliminary work indicates that interventions that build self-compassion have the potential to substantially improve youth mental health. Self-compassion is also associated with better physical and mental health outcomes among individuals living with CMCs. While face-to-face self-compassion training is available, there are several barriers to access for youth with CMCs. Online self-compassion training potentially offers an accessible alternative for this high-risk group. Methods Self-Compassion Online (SCO) is a self-compassion program that has been tested with a non-clinical adult group. For the proposed trial, a reference group of youth (16-25 years) with chronic illness reviewed the program and proposed adaptations to improve its suitability for youth with chronic illness. In alignment with the SPIRIT Checklist, this paper outlines the protocol for a CONSORT-compliant, single-blind randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of the adapted program, relative to a waitlist control, for improving self-compassion, wellbeing, distress, emotion regulation, coping and quality of life among young Australians with CMCs. Mechanisms of action and feasibility of SCO will be analysed using quantitative data and participant interviews, respectively. Finally, cost-utility will be analysed using health-related quality of life data. Discussion The SCO program could provide a scalable solution for improving psychological outcomes and quality of life among youth with chronic illness. The proposed trial will be the first to determine its efficacy for improving these outcomes, relative to waitlist control.

AB The importance of psychopathy in the forensic and criminal justice domains is largely due to its robust associations with aggression and violent behavior. Hence, investigators have increasingly been interested in elucidating potential mechanisms linking psychopathy and aggression. Recent research highlighted previously overlooked associations between psychopathy and difficulties in emotion regulation, the process responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and managing one's emotional experience, as well as for guiding behavior under intense emotional arousal. Yet, it remains unclear whether emotion dysregulation may be helpful to explain well-documented associations between psychopathy and aggression. The present study examined whether emotion dysregulation mediated associations (i.e., explained a significant portion of the shared variance) between psychopathy and aggression across community (N = 521) and offender (N = 268) samples. Participants completed self-report measures of psychopathy, emotion dysregulation, trait aggressiveness (i.e., anger, hostility, physical and verbal aggression), as well as reactive and proactive aggression. Across both samples, psychopathy had significant indirect effect on all indices of aggression through emotion dysregulation, with the exception of verbal aggression. These findings support the relevance of emotion regulation for the construct of psychopathy and its maladaptive correlates and highlight the potential relevance of focusing on emotion regulation as a possible target for interventions aimed at reducing aggression among individuals with psychopathic traits.

AB Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a genetic syndrome most often caused by a deletion on chromosome 17 or more rarely by a mutation in the retinoic acid-induced 1 gene. The aim of this study was to investigate the Developmental Behavior Checklist (DBC) profile of persons with SMS and the associations between behavioural and emotional problems, age, gender, adaptive behaviour and autism symptomatology. Twenty-eight persons with SMS were represented by their parents in this study. DBC Total scores are reduced with age, but they still show a mean that is clearly above the cut-off of 46. The differences between the age groups <9 years and 9-17 years (p = 0.024) and between the age groups 18 years (p = 0.007) are significant. We found a significant decrease in behavioural and emotional problems with age in SMS. We did not find a relationship between adapted behaviour and communication and behavioural and emotional problems.

AB This study utilized web-based data collection and latent profile analysis to visualize and describe the relational well-being of youth experiencing foster care-related sibling separation. Legally authorized representatives for 724 youth in seven states in the U.S.A. completed a brief electronic questionnaire assessing youth's social competence, emotional competence, sibling warmth, and sibling interaction quality. Six profiles of relational well-being emerged from the analysis and included youth who were "struggling-all domains," "struggling-sibling relationships," "thriving-all domains," "near struggling-all domains," "mixed-thriving sibling relationships/near-struggling social-emotional competence," and "average-all domains." Significant differences were observed for the proportion of youth in a particular profile based on their current out-of-home care status, permanency plan goal, and the survey respondent's relationship to the youth. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB Sleep disturbances are likely to be associated with emotional and behavioural problems in typically and atypically developing children. The study was aimed to evaluate sleep disturbances in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their associations with emotional/behavioural problems. The study comprised eighteen 5-year-old boys with diagnosed ASD. Control group was made up of matched 54 clinically healthy typically developing boys. The mothers were requested to fill in Child Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) aimed to measure certain sleep troubles in children and the Achenbach Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL/1.5-5) aimed to find major emotional/behavioural disturbances. Children with ASD had significantly higher scores on sleep onset delay, night waking, parasomnia, sleep disordered breathing and daytime sleepiness scores. They also presented with statistically significantly higher values on affective, anxiety, pervasive developmental, attention deficit/hyperactivity and oppositional defiant problems subscales. Predictive analysis showed that anxiety problems could be finely predicted by ASD diagnosis, low IQ, sleep delay, sleep anxiety, and daytime sleepines. Affective problems could be predicted by ASD diagnosis, night waking and low IQ. So far as attention deficit/hyperactivity and oppositional defiant problems were concerned, these variables were most dependant on child IQ and gastrointestinal symptoms. Sleep disturbances in children with ASD are common and may be associated with emotional problems.

AB Family-based treatment (FBT) for anorexia nervosa (AN) is an empirically supported treatment for this disorder. Derived from several different schools of family therapy, it is a highly focused approach that initially targets weight restoration under parental management at home. However, the view that manualized FBT is solely a behavioral therapy directing parents to refeed their children AN with the single purpose of weight gain is a common but misleading over simplification of the therapy. Indeed, weight restoration is the main goal only in phase 1 of this 3-phase treatment. When practiced with fidelity and skill, FBT's broadest aim is to promote adolescent development without AN thoughts and behaviors interfering and disrupting these normal processes. Although weight restoration is a key starting point in FBT, the entire course of treatment takes into consideration the ongoing impact of starvation, cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on adolescent development. These factors associated with maintaining low weight are viewed in FBT as interfering with the adolescent being able to take up the tasks of adolescence and thus must be overcome before fully turning to those broader adolescent tasks. In addition, FBT recognizes that adolescence takes place in the context of family and community and respects the importance of learning in a home environment both for weight gain as well as related developmental tasks to have a lasting effect. Specifically, in this article we describe how the current FBT manualized approach addresses temperament/personality traits, emotional processing, cognitive content and process, social communication and connections, psychiatric comorbidity, and family factors. This report makes no claim to superiority of FBT compared to other therapies in addressing these broader concerns nor does it add interventions to augment the current manual to improve FBT.

AB Background
   Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a growing public health concern that commonly begins in adolescence, and can persist into young adulthood. A promising approach for advancing our understanding of NSSI in youth is to examine white matter microstructure using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI).
   Method
   The present study examined whole-brain group differences in structural connectivity (as measured by generalized fractional anisotropy [GFA]) between 28 female adolescents and young adults ages 13-21 years with NSSI and 22 age-matched healthy controls (HC). We also explored the association between clinical characteristics including NSSI severity and duration, impulsivity, emotion regulation and personality traits within the NSSI group and GFA of the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum.
   Results
   Compared to the HC group, participants with NSSI had lower GFA in several white matter tracts, including the uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, anterior thalamic radiation, callosal body, and corticospinal tract. When controlling for depressive symptoms, the NSSI group showed an association between NSSI duration (time since initiating NSSI behavior) and lower GFA in the left cingulum. Higher levels of attentional impulsivity were related to lower GFA in the left uncinate fasciculus within the NSSI group.
   Conclusions
   We found evidence suggesting widespread white matter microstructure deficits in adolescents and young adults with NSSI versus HC. We also report inverse associations between white matter integrity and clinical characteristics (duration of NSSI and attentional impulsivity). These white matter microstructural deficits may represent a possible neurobiologically-based vulnerability to developing maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as NSSI. Additionally, results suggest that this white matter disorganization may either worsen with prolonged engagement in NSSI or predict persistent NSSI; thereby highlighting the importance of early intervention targeting this behavior.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the formulation and psychological treatment of a complex case whereby a combination of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has resulted in violent and aggressive behaviour.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper provides a brief summary of literature in relation to ASD, OCD and risk-offending behaviour followed by a case study of a man (referred to as "John") with a diagnosis of ASD and OCD who has an extensive history of institutional violence and aggressive behaviour.
   Findings
   This paper highlights the complexity of a case that may support research suggesting that impaired theory of mind, poor emotional regulation and problems with moral reasoning increase the risk of an individual with ASD engaging in violence, in addition to a comorbidity of ASD and OCD resulting in a more severe and treatment-resistant form of OCD.
   Originality/value
   This paper highlights the challenges faced when working with a patient with Asperger's syndrome and OCD with entrenched beliefs that lead to the use of violence as a compulsion to temporarily overcome unpleasant thoughts related to low self-esteem.

AB Although theoretical work proposes that emotion regulation development exhibits a positive growth trajectory across adolescence as prefrontal brain regions continue to mature, individual differences in developmental changes of emotion regulation merit elucidation. The present study investigates longitudinal links between the family environment (i.e., socioeconomic risk and family emotional context) and emotion regulation development. The sample included 167 adolescents (53% males) who were first recruited at 13-14 years of age and assessed annually four times. Latent change score analyses identified family emotional context as a mediator between socioeconomic risk and emotion regulation development, such that lower socioeconomic risk (higher socioeconomic status and lower household chaos) at Time 1 was associated with a more positive family emotional context (parent emotion regulation, parenting practices, and parent-adolescent relationship quality), which in turn was associated with larger year-to-year increases in emotion regulation. The findings highlight the important role of the family emotional context as a process explaining how the challenges of growing up in a household laden with socioeconomic risk may be associated with emotion regulation development during adolescence.

AB Early life experiences play a vital role in contributing to healthy brain development. Adverse experiences have a lasting impact on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), brain regions associated with emotion regulation. Early life adversity via maternal separation (MS) has sex-specific effects on expression of parvalbumin (PV), which is expressed in fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons that are preferentially enwrapped by perineuronal nets (PNNs). Importantly, PNN formation coincides with the closure of developmental critical periods and regulates PV-expressing interneuron activity. Since aberrant PNN organization has been reported following adverse experiences in adolescent and adult rats, we investigated the impact of adversity early in life in the form of MS on the developing brain. Rat pups were separated from their dams for 4 h per day from postnatal day (P) 2-20. Tissue sections from juvenile (P20), adolescent (P40), and early adult (P70) animals containing the PFC and BLA were fluorescently stained to visualize Wisteria floribunda agglutinin + PNNs and PV-expressing interneurons, and density and intensity was quantified. Our results confirm past reports that PFC PNNs form gradually throughout development; however, PNN density plateaus in adolescence, while intensity continues to increase into adulthood. Importantly, MS delays PNN formation in the prelimbic PFC and results in sex-specific aberrations in PNN structural integrity that do not appear until adulthood. The present findings reveal sex-, age-, and region-specific effects of early life adversity on PNN and PV maturation, implicating neuroplastic alterations following early life adversity that may be associated with sex differences in psychopathology and resilience.

AB Little scientific attention has been paid to the problem of cyberbullying in the university environment, compared to similar studies conducted on adolescents. This study attempts to analyze the predictive capacity of certain emotional problems (anxiety, depression, and stress) and university adaptation with respect to cyberbullying in victims and aggressors. The European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 and the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire were administered to a sample of 1282 university students (46.33% male) aged between 18 and 46. The results suggest that high levels of depression and stress increase the probability of being a cyberbullying victim, while high levels of depression increase the probability of being a cyberbullying aggressor. Similarly, the personal-emotional and social adaptation of students are found to be predictor variables of being a cyberbullying victim, in that high levels of personal-emotional and social adaptation decrease the probability of being a victim, while high levels of personal-emotional, academic and institutional adaptation decrease the probability of being a cyberbullying victim. The results of this study are of special relevance, since they indicate that intervention programs should consider the influence of emotional intelligence, as well as the relevance students' adaptation to university.

AB While a considerable number of youth with autism spectrum disorder exhibit impaired self-regulation (dysregulation), little is known about the neural correlates of dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder. In a sample of intellectually able boys with autism spectrum disorder (further categorized as those with and without dysregulation) and typically developing boys (aged 7-17 years), we conducted a multivariate connectome-wide association study to examine the intrinsic functional connectivity with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dysregulation was defined by the sum of Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales on the Child Behavior Checklist. We identified that both categorical and dimensional neural correlates of dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder involved atypical connectivity among the components of multiple brain networks, especially between those subserving sensorimotor processing and salience encoding, beyond higher-level cognitive control circuitries. Interaction within the attention network might serve as autism spectrum disorder-specific neural correlates underpinning dysregulation. Our results highlight that the inter-individual variability in dysregulation might contribute to the inconsistency in the neuroimaging literature of autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, the present findings provide evidence to suggest that dysregulation might be considered as both categorical and dimensional moderators to parse heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder. Lay Abstract Impaired self-regulation (i.e., dysregulation in affective, behavioral, and cognitive control), is commonly present in young people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known about what is happening in people's brains when self-regulation is impaired in young people with ASD. We used a technique called functional MRI (which measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow) at a resting state (when participants are not asked to do anything) to research this in intellectually able young people with ASD. We found that brains with more connections, especially between regions involved in sensorimotor processing and regions involved in the processes that enable peoples to focus their attention on the most pertinent features from the sensory environment (salience processing), were related to more impaired self-regulation in young people with and without ASD. We also found that impaired self-regulation was related to increased communication within the brain system involved in voluntary orienting attention to a sensory cue (the dorsal attention network) in young people with ASD. These results highlight how different people have different degrees of dysregulation, which has been largely overlooked in the earlier brain imaging reports on ASD. This might contribute to understanding some of the inconsistencies in the existing published literature on this topic.

AB Objectives Bipolar disorder (BD) and familial risk for BD have been associated with aberrant white matter (WM) microstructure in the corpus callosum and fronto-limbic pathways. These abnormalities might constitute trait or state marker and have been suggested to result from aberrant maturation and to relate to difficulties in emotion regulation. Methods To determine whether WM alterations represent a trait, disease or resilience marker, we compared youth at risk for BD (n = 36 first-degree relatives, REL) to youth with BD (n = 36) and healthy volunteers (n = 36, HV) using diffusion tensor imaging. Results Individuals with BD and REL did not differ from each other in WM microstructure and, compared to HV, showed similar aberrations in the superior corona radiata (SCR)/corticospinal tract (CST) and the body of the corpus callosum. WM microstructure of the anterior CC showed reduced age-related in-creases in BD compared to REL and HV. Further, individuals with BD and REL showed in-creased difficulties in emotion regulation, which were associated with the microstructure of the anterior thalamic radiation. Discussion Alterations in the SCR/CST and the body of the corpus callosum appear to represent a trait marker of BD, whereas changes in other WM tracts seem to be a disease state marker. Our findings also support the role of aberrant developmental trajectories of WM microstructure in the risk architecture of BD, although longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this association. Finally, our findings show the relevance of WM microstructure for difficulties in emotion regulation-a core characteristic of BD.

AB This study examined early adolescent romantic "churning," defined here as having a large number of boyfriends/girlfriends by age 13, as a problematic marker likely to predict hostility, abuse, and avoidance during conflict in later relationships. A sample of 184 adolescents was followed through age 24 to assess predictions of hostility, abuse, and avoidance during conflict from early romantic churning. Controlling for gender and family income, romantic churning at age 13 predicted relative decreases in peer preference and relative increases in conflict and betrayal in close friendships from ages 13 to 16, as well as higher observable hostility and self- and partner-reported abuse in romantic relationships by age 18 and greater avoidance during conflict with romantic partners by age 24. Findings remained after accounting for attachment security, social competence, and friendship quality in early adolescence, suggesting that early romantic churning may uniquely predict a problematic developmental pathway.

AB Background: Bullying and peer victimization among adolescents are growing public health concerns that affect victims' emotional well-being, and their social and academic functioning. Despite concerns about this public health epidemic in low- and middle-income countries, most prevalence, policy and intervention studies have been conducted in developed countries and economies. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2016 and July 2017 at seven public and private schools located in five districts in Pakistan: Lodhran, Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Multan, Thatta, and Nawabshah. A total of 2,315 schoolchildren were surveyed with a specially designed instrument in Urdu with items about demographics and bullying behavior, together with a strengths and difficulties questionnaire. Results: Mean age of the respondents was 14.63 (2.87) years. More than half of the respondents were males (n = 1301, 56.2%), and a majority reported that their mothers were housewives (n = 2,100, 90.7%). A total of 615 (26.6%) respondents reported being bullied at school, and 415 (17.9%) reported being bullied away from school. Perpetration of bullying was reported by 430 (18.6%) participants at school and 376 (16.3%) away from school. Being bullied in the past was strongly associated with becoming a perpetrator of bullying in the future. Internalizing symptoms were significantly associated with male gender, older age, being a victim of bullying, and employment status of the respondent's mother. Externalizing symptoms were significantly associated with male gender, older age, being a victim and perpetrator of bullying, and mother's employment status. Conclusion: Bullying perpetrators have a greater tendency to exhibit externalizing symptoms, whereas victims develop both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies.

AB Perceived illness stigma is associated with increased depressive symptoms in youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the mechanisms by which stigma influences emotional adjustment remain unclear. It is possible that youth with IBD who are more present-focused and better able to come to terms with aspects of their disease that are less controllable (i.e. are mindful) may develop more adaptive strategies when facing illness uncertainty, resulting in more positive emotional adjustment. The present study examined the indirect association between illness stigma, illness uncertainty, depressive symptoms, and the potential moderating effect of mindfulness on this process. One hundred and seven youth (56 female, 51 male; M-age = 14.73) with IBD completed measures of illness stigma (SS-C), illness uncertainty (CUIS), depressive symptoms (CDI-2), and trait mindfulness (MAAS-A). Analyses revealed a significant SS-C -> CUIS -> CDI-2 indirect path (beta = .686, 95% CI = .1346 to 1.489), which was moderated by MAAS-A (beta = -.445, 95% CI = -.972 to -.083). Results indicate that the SS-C -> CUIS -> CDI-2 indirect path was significant at low, but not medium or high, levels of MAAS-A. Illness uncertainty appears to be a potential route through which stigma impacts emotional adjustment in youth with IBD, particularly for youth characterized by low mindfulness. Clinical interventions that emphasize mindfulness training along with acknowledgement/acceptance of IBD illness factors may help diminish the negative effects of stigma and illness uncertainty on adjustment in this population.

AB Mental health difficulties, conduct problems, and emotional maladjustment predict a range of negative outcomes, and this may include gang involvement. However, few studies have examined how behavioral, mental health, socio-cognitive, and emotional factors all relate to adolescent gang involvement. This study examined 91 adolescents to compare non-gang with gang-involved youth on their conduct problems, emotional distress, guilt-proneness, anxiety and depression, and use of moral disengagement and rumination. Analyses revealed that gang-involved youth had higher levels of anxiety, depression, moral disengagement, and rumination. Gang-involved youth also had higher levels of conduct disorder and exposure to violence, but they did not differ from non-gang youth on levels of emotional distress and guilt-proneness. Discriminant function analysis further showed that conduct problems, moral disengagement, and rumination were the most important predictors of gang involvement. Discussion focuses on how intervention and prevention efforts to tackle gang involvement need to consider the mental health and behavioral needs of gang-involved youth. Further research is also needed to build an evidence base that identifies the cause/effect relationship between mental health and gang involvement to inform the best practice when tackling gang membership.

AB Objective The current study aimed to provide a preliminary evaluation of two universal school-based prevention programs, Emotion Regulation (ER) and Behavioral Activation (BA), by increasing resilience to manage excessive worry, a transdiagnostic feature across anxiety and depression. Method Primary school children (N = 295; 52.5% female; 8-13 years) from five Australian schools were cluster randomized to an ER, BA or usual class control condition. Outcome measures included resilience, worry, anxiety, and depression symptomology; ER and BA were measured as potential mediators. Participants completed measures at pre- and postprogram, and at 6-month follow-up. Results Children in the BA condition showed increased resilience at 6 months. Expressive suppression mediated the effects of both programs on worry. Conclusion The current study aimed to provide a preliminary evaluation of two universal school-based prevention programs, ER and BA, by increasing resilience to manage excessive worry, a transdiagnostic feature across anxiety and depression.

ID DEPRESSION; INTERVENTION; CHILDREN
AB Objectives Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder associated with emotion dysregulation and is common in clinical samples of adolescents. The identification and delineation of BPD from other disorders is important, yet methods for effectively screening for BPD are lacking. Here, we examine whether irritability can be used as a screening item for BPD in adolescents at risk for the disorder. Methods We assessed Diagnostic Interview for Borderline-Revised and Development of Well-Being Assessment scores in a clinical sample of female adolescents ages 12-17 (n = 78) to identify BPD and group cases into 'irritable' and 'non-irritable' mood types, respectively. We then examined the prevalence of irritability and its predictive association with BPD. Results The prevalence of BPD was 26% (n = 20). There was a significant association between irritable mood and BPD, specifically (chi(2)(1) = 17.740, p < 0.001). Irritability was endorsed in all (n = 20) BPD cases (sensitivity: 100%), while in non-BPD cases (n = 58), irritability was endorsed in 27 (specificity: 53%; positive predictive value: 0.33; and negative predictive value: 1.0). Conclusion Irritability is a highly sensitive screening item for BPD in adolescents. The absence of irritability in an adolescent may be an important clinical tool to rule out BPD.

AB The aim of the present study is the psychometric review of a Spanish language version of the German Stress and Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (SSKJ 3-8). The SSKJ 3-8 assesses emotion regulation strategies by asking children to indicate how often they use five different emotion regulation strategies in response to a social and an academic stress situation. The Spanish language adaptation of the inventory was developed for a cross-cultural study with Chilean and German fourth-graders. The sample includes 76 German and 169 Chilean fourth graders. The SSKJ 3-8 was first translated into Spanish by a bilingual translator, then back-translated by a German native speaker, and finally adapted for the cultural context in Chile. To analyze the psychometric comparability, the measurement invariance was examined within the framework of the Item Response Theory (IRT) with the R package pairwise. The results show that the new developed Spanish language adaptation of the SSKJ 3-8 is comparable to the German version in terms of psychometric measurement characteristics. Only few items show deviations with regard to strong measurement invariance. We conclude that the Spanish language adaptation of the SSKJ 3-8 is a reliable instrument to assess emotion regulation strategies in Chile.

AB Objective: The Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI) is an informant questionnaire developed based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R)) Scientific Standards and refined through factor analyses and item response theory (IRT) analyses. Although it was developed to improve measurement of emotion dysregulation in youth with autism spectrum disorder, emotion dysregulation has transdiagnostic significance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the EDI's psychometric properties and to establish IRT-based scores for a general population of youth. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of 1000 caregivers of 6- to 17-year-old youth matched to the US census on age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of education, and region. Confirmatory factor analyses and IRT analyses using the two-parameter graded response model were performed to evaluate the EDI's structure and psychometric properties. Results: Analyses supported the original two-factor structure of the EDI, reflecting factors for Reactivity and Dysphoria. Simulations of computerized adaptive testing supported use of the same items for a Reactivity short form as those that emerged as most informative in the original autism psychometric analyses. IRT co-calibration with commonly used measures of emotion regulation and irritability in child clinical or community samples indicated the EDI scales provide more information across a wider range of emotion dysregulation. Validity was supported by moderate correlations with measures of related constructs and expected known-group differences. Conclusions: The EDI is an efficient and precise measure of emotion dysregulation for use in general community and clinical samples as well as samples of youth with ASD.

AB Purpose: The study aimed to investigate whether emotional and behavioral strengths and difficulties differ between children with cochlear implants (CIs) or hearing aids (HAs), to correlate the outcomes of children on four psychological instruments, and to identify new socio-demographic and linguistic predictors of emotional and behavioral strengths and difficulties in children. A battery of psychological instruments (SDQ, ITPA, Peabody, and Raven's) was administered to children in two provinces of the Canary Islands, Spain. Method: The study involved 187 children with CIs, 113 children with HAs, 176 parents, and 300 schoolteachers. Results: Rating disagreements were found between children, parents, and schoolteachers in terms of their SDQ ratings. Total SDQ score correlated weakly with other total ITPA subtests, and the final Peabody and Raven's outcomes. Six socio-demographic and linguistic factors significantly predicted children's overall strengths and difficulties. Conclusion: Findings have consequences for implementing instructional systems for children who are in need of personal and educational support.

AB Background and Purpose: Emotion dysregulation is characterised by difficulties monitoring, understanding, and accepting uncomfortable emotions and may lead some individuals to attempt to attenuate or escape emotional experiences by engaging in distracting activities, such as video gaming. Preliminary findings suggest that some dimensions of emotion dysregulation may be related to problem video gaming, but these findings are not generalisable to the general English-speaking population. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether dimensions of emotion regulation were associated with problem video gaming in a sample of self-reported video gamers from the general English-speaking adult population. Method: Self-identified adult video game players (N = 928) completed an online survey including the Problem Video Game Playing Scale (PVP) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Results: A sequential regression analysis revealed age and gender as statistically significantly predictors of problem gaming in the full sample, as well as two dimensions of emotion dysregulation: (1) difficulties with impulse control; and (2) perceived limited access to emotion regulation strategies. A second sequential regression analysis was conducted to explore if gender moderated the relationship between any DERS subscales and problem gaming, and no significant moderations were found. Conclusions: This study represents the first examination of emotion dysregulation and problem gaming in English-speaking adults and expands upon existing evidence supporting associations between specific dimensions of emotion dysregulation and problem video gaming.

AB The present longitudinal study examined the role of neural cognitive control in the relation between negative and positive life events and depressive symptoms in adolescents. The sample comprised 138 adolescents (52% male, M-age = 13.49 at baseline) and their parents. At Time 1, adolescents participated in a functional neuroimaging session in which neural cognitive control was measured as hemodynamic activity during an inhibitory control task, and parents reported on adolescents' positive and negative life events within the past year. Adolescents and parents reported on adolescent depressive symptoms at Time 1, Time 2 (1 year later), and Time 3 (2 years later). Conditional latent growth curve model was used to test the main and interaction effects of neural cognitive control and positive/negative life events on the growth factors of depressive symptoms. Higher neural cognitive control moderated the relation between negative life events and the intercept of depressive symptoms. Adolescents with higher neural cognitive control did not experience higher depressive symptoms when confronted with more negative life events, whereas their counterparts with lower neural cognitive control did. The interaction effect between neural cognitive control and positive life events on depressive symptoms was not significant. Results suggest that neural cognitive control acts as a protective factor such that adolescents with higher neural cognitive control are protected against depressionogenic effects of negative life events, whereas adolescents with lower cognitive control are at greater risk for depressive symptoms in response to negative life events.

AB Objective: Research suggests that college is a risky period for changes in eating behavior and beliefs. Although social health determinants relate to health behavior changes, research has not explored subjective social status, one's societal standing, in terms of eating expectancies among college students. The present study examined the emotion dysregulation in association between subjective social status and eating expectancies among college students. Participants: Participants were a diverse sample of 1,589 college students (80.4% females; M-age = 22.2 years, SD = 5.27) from an urban university. Results: Results showed a significant indirect association of subjective social status via emotion dysregulation in relation to expectancies of eating to help manage negative affect, to alleviate boredom, and to lead to feeling out of control. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that college students with lower subjective social status may have a higher risk for dysregulated emotions, and consequently, expressing maladaptive eating expectancies.

AB The goal of the current research is to test the 15-items existential annihilation anxieties (EAA) scale cross-nationally. The EAA scale found in a previous study to have four first-order factors: psychic, collective, status and physical identity EAA, and a unitary second-order factor. The study utilized a previously collected data (N = 1566) that included five countries: Egypt (N = 490), Turkey (N = 420), Kuwait (N = 300), UK (N = 177) and Syria (N = 179). Participants included 51.4% of males and 14.6% of adolescents. Age ranges between 14 and 75. Measures included EAA, cumulative stressors and traumas (CST), the "will to exist, live and survive" (WTELS), the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, emotion regulation, identity salience, PTSD, and poor health. We conducted a zero-order correlation between the primary variables, alpha reliability, and confirmatory factor analysis of the factor structure of EAA, found in the previous study. We further tested its invariance across different age, gender, and national groups. Results indicated a high alpha of .92 of the scale. The confirmatory factor analysis found that the previously found structure fit well in the multinational data and was strictly invariant across genders and age group and strongly invariant across the five national groups. EAA highly correlated with PTSD (.52) and correlated with psychopathology, internalizing, externalizing, thought disorder, poor health, and CST. EAA was negatively correlated with WTELS, self-esteem, religiosity and emotion regulation (reappraisal). The EAA scale has robust psychometrics cross-nationally, and its conceptual framework is clinically significant and worth considering as a new focus of the new Transdiagnostic intervention strategy for PTSD.

AB Affect and reward are associated with unhealthy eating and weight; however, less research has examined affective predictors of hedonic hunger (i.e., extreme reward responsivity, pleasure toward, and drive for food), particularly among adolescents. Whether symptoms indicative of emotional disturbance increase risk of adverse reward-based eating-related symptoms such as hedonic hunger, is unknown. Such evidence could explain why emotional problems increase risk of eating and weight problems among adolescents, when eating-related health problems often originate. This report examined baseline emotional disorder symptoms, negative urgency (i.e., tendency to act impulsively in response to negative affect), and anhedonia (i.e., loss of interest in activities and decreased pleasure) as prospective predictors of increases in hedonic hunger in adolescents; associations between changes in emotional disturbance problems and hedonic hunger were also examined. Ninth-grade students (N = 2598) from high schools completed paper-and-pencil surveys at baseline and a 1-year follow-up. In a multivariable model controlling for the covariance of emotional problems, higher negative urgency, general anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and lower anhedonia at baseline independently predicted increases in hedonic hunger one year later. Also, increases in negative urgency, general anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and decreases in anhedonia independently predicted increases in hedonic hunger. Affect- and reward-related variables may be important contributors to risk of hedonic hunger in adolescence.

AB Psychological flexibility refers to the ability to be in contact with emotions, thoughts and feelings while behavior is directed at values. Psychological flexibility is considered to be a protective factor of health and psychological wellbeing, and includes six interrelated factors including; acceptance, values, committed action, contact with the present moment, self as context and defusion. The aim of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a Spanish adaptation of the Willingness and Action Measure for Adolescents with 649 adolescents from Spain aged 12 to 17. The Willingness and Action Measure for Adolescents proved to be a two-factor psychometrically sound instrument, reliability and internal consistency that showed adequate psychometric goodness. Total scores of psychological flexibility correlates positively with emotional clarity and emotion regulation. Concurrent validity shows that psychological flexibility is related to skills for emotional regulation.

DT Article
DE adolescence; CBT; emotion regulation; insomnia; sleep
AB Background: Insomnia disorder in adolescence is prevalent, persistent and associated with adverse outcomes, including reduced quality of life. Cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) has shown promise as an effective treatment for adolescents. Recent research has highlighted the role of emotion regulation in insomnia, suggesting that the inclusion of emotion regulation techniques may enhance CBT-i. Aims: To evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a CBT-i treatment program for insomnia in early adolescence, augmented with emotion regulation strategies, using a case-series design. Method: Three participants (mean 11.67 years) completed the program that consisted of seven, weekly individual therapy sessions and parental participation. Participants monitored their sleep daily during the intervention, and insomnia diagnostic status and severity, use of emotion regulation strategies and quality of life were assessed at baseline, post-intervention and at 6-week follow-up. Results: At post-treatment, none of the participants met criteria for insomnia and all reported statistically reliable reductions in symptoms. Improvements were maintained at follow-up for two participants. Sleep onset latency was reduced and improvements in quality of life were evident. There were no changes in the use of emotion regulation strategies following treatment. Adolescents and parents reported high program satisfaction. Conclusions: This preliminary evaluation provides support for the effectiveness of the CBT-i program tested. However, given that emotion regulation did not change and yet improvements in sleep were evident, the usefulness of augmenting the program with emotion regulation strategies requires further evaluation.

AB This longitudinal study of 562 students (from ages 10 to 13) investigated whether developmental changes in internalizing problems (emotional and peer problems) can be predicted by school grades in mathematics and language arts and whether these predictive relations are mediated by students' self-esteem. The data comprised of teacher-rated internalizing problems, grades in math and language arts, and student self-ratings of self-esteem. The latent change score modeling indicated that math grades positively predicted self-esteem. Furthermore, lower self-esteem was related to an increase in internalizing and emotional problems in the total sample, and to an increase in peer problems in boys. The indirect effect of poorer math grades, via lower self-esteem, on increases in internalizing and emotional problems was significant. The sample included an overrepresentation of children at risk of reading difficulty, but the tested models did not differ between at-risk and not-at-risk children. Overall, the findings revealed that low math grades contribute negatively to students' global self-esteem and predict an increase in internalizing problems in early adolescence.

AB The quality of the relationship between adolescents and significant figures constitutes a relevant factor to emotional and adaptive functioning. Caregivers at the institution have a significant responsibility in caring for adolescents and represent a key determinant in adolescents' adaptation. However, less attention has been devoted to how adolescents perceive these relationships and to predictors of their quality. This study aims to analyze different level predictors (sociodemographic and institutional hystory-related, emotional/relational and contextual level) of the quality of the relationship between adolescents and their caregivers, in a sample of 326 adolescent participants (228 female and 98 male) from 20 residential care institutions. Participants responded to self-report questionnaires concerning the quality of relationship with caregivers, attachment, emotion regulation and institutional climate. Data regarding structural and functional information about the residential care context were collected with the directors. The results suggested that the adolescents' perception of quality of relationship was associated with individual (gender) and emotional/relational factors (emotion regulation and attachment), but not with contextual factors (cohesion, ratio and number total children/youth) and other individual variables (time living in institution, age at entering the institution, live another institution and age at entering in the first institution). The results are discussed in light of attachment theory, pointing out the role of the relevance of quality of relationship with caregivers.

This study examined whether emotion regulation difficulty would be related to adolescent problematic smartphone use, whether depression would mediate the relationship between emotion regulation difficulty and problematic smartphone use, and whether perceived social support would moderate the links between emotion regulation difficulty and problematic smartphone use. A total of 720 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 13.66 years, SD = 1.36) completed anonymous questionnaires regarding depression, emotion regulation difficulty, perceived social support, and problematic smartphone use. The results indicated that emotion regulation difficulty was positively related to problematic smartphone use and depression mediated this relationship. Moderated mediation analyses showed that the pathway between depression and adolescent problematic smartphone use was moderated by perceived social support. These findings highlight the significance of identifying the mechanisms that moderate the mediated paths between emotion regulation difficulty and adolescent problematic smartphone use.

AB Young people in residential care (RC) are a group at high risk of developing mental health problems. One of the most commonly-used screening instruments is Achenbach and Rescorla (2001) dimensional, multi-informant ASEBA. The main objective of this study is to analyze the level of agreement between young people in RC and their care workers (who, in Spain, are called social educators, and who have a specific university degree). 617 young people in RC aged between 11 and 17 completed the Youth Self Report, while their social educators completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A 2 x 2 ANOVA was performed with the intra-subject variable being the test scores and the inter-subject variable being in receipt of specialist treatment or not. The results indicate that the social educators tended to score more highly in externalizing scales, whereas the young people reported more internalizing problems. In the treatment group, the CBCL scores were higher than the YSR scores, but in the non-treatment group the opposite was found, particularly in internalizing scales. The results are discussed in comparison with concordance studies in the general population and we conclude that multi-informant instruments are appropriate for the population in RC.

AB A limited body of empirical evidence suggests a strong sense of cultural identity promotes wellbeing and other socio-economic outcomes for First Nations people, including for Indigenous Australians. A challenge to this evidence is potential endogeneity: that Indigenous people who achieve positive outcomes are then more likely to maintain and engage in their traditional culture. Data from Australia's Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children were used to address that challenge. Indigenous parents' attitudes and practices with respect to passing on traditional culture to their children in early childhood were related to children's later health and socio-emotional adjustment. Exploratory factor analysis identified three key elements of parental transmission of Indigenous culture to their children: connection to country, connection to kin and traditional knowledge. Parents fostering a strong kinship connection was found to contribute to positive child development. Positive effects of connection to country and parental desires to pass on traditional knowledge were also identified in some regional contexts, providing further evidence that traditional Indigenous cultures should be seen as a resource for addressing Indigenous disadvantage, not a contributing factor. The research design eliminates the possibility of (the child's) outcomes 'causing' greater cultural identity or engagement, but not the possibility of omitted variables shaping both parents' practices toward cultural engagement and child outcomes.

AB This paper aimed to analyze the relationship between emotional intelligence, academic burnout and school performance in a sample of 1.756 adolescent students belonging to 9 compulsory secondary education (ESO) centers. The instruments used were the Spanish versions of the Traid Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24), the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS); school performance was quantified through the average mark of each student. A prospective ex post facto study was conducted with a simple descriptive design. The results showed positive relationships of school performance with the dimensions of understanding and emotional regulation, as well as with academic effectiveness, and negative relationships with physical/emotional exhaustion and cynicism. The results highlight the influence of personal resources associated with emotional intelligence in preventing burnout, as well as personal effectiveness improvement that can lead to greater performance. The need to promote emotional skills in the classroom as facilitators of positive attitudes for school performance and the prevention of academic burnout is revealed.

AB It is well-established that the prenatal period is a critical and sensitive period of an individual's life, linking prenatal circumstances to short- and long-term outcomes such as infant mortality, educational and occupational success. However, little is known about how prenatal nurture affects intermediate outcomes and noncognitive characteristics such as behavior and behavioral problems. In this paper, I investigate the effects of birth weight on behavioral problems at age 12. I comprehensively control for confounders related to family background and genetics by employing a research design exploiting differences among Danish monozygotic twins. I find that birth weight has a statistically significant negative effect on behavioral problems measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and that birth weight affects boys and girls differently: birth weight is significantly negatively associated with emotional problems among girls and hyperactivity among boys.

AB Caregivers' own childhood maltreatment experiences potentiate the risk for psychopathology and perpetration of maltreatment against one's children. In turn, both of these factors may negatively impact children's mental health. The nature of these intergenerational patterns of maltreatment may vary as a function of type of child outcome and may also be influenced by child age and sample characteristics (i.e., involvement of Child Protection Services, CPS). The present study uses a Structural Equational Model to examine cross-sectional relationships between caregiver maltreatment experiences in childhood and child-rated emotional and conduct problems and tests the mediational effect of caregiver internalizing symptoms and child maltreatment exposure. This sample is comprised of 791 children aged 3-16 years (Mage = 10.6 years; n = 302 3 to 8-year-olds, n = 489 9 to 16-year-olds; 51.5% male) and their caregivers (88.4% biological mothers). Children were recruited from CPS (n = 124), youth psychiatric services (n = 144), and the general population (n = 523). Results indicated indirect links between caregivers' childhood maltreatment experiences and their children's emotional and conduct problems. Specifically, caregiver-perpetrated child maltreatment predicted was related to child conduct problems, whereas both caregiver-perpetrated child maltreatment and caregiver internalizing symptoms were related to child emotional problems. Multi-group analyses revealed no moderation effect of CPS involvement. Our results highlight the importance of independent outcome-specific intergenerational patterns in prevention approaches for families with maltreatment experiences.

AB Although parent emotion socialization and child temperament are theorized to interact in the prediction of borderline personality disorder (BPD) features, few studies have directly examined these relationships. The present study examined whether parental emotion socialization interacted with behavioral ratings and physiological indicators of emotional vulnerability in the prediction of BPD features among preadolescent children. Participants were 125 children (10-12 years; 55% female) and their parents recruited from the community. Parents and children reported on children's BPD features and parents completed a measure of supportive and non-supportive emotion socialization. Children's emotional vulnerability was assessed based on parent-rated negativity/lability and emotion regulation skills and children's respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance level (SCL) reactivity to a social stressor. Several significant interactions of parent supportive reactions, non-supportive reactions, and child emotional reactivity emerged. Children were lowest in BPD features when parents were high in supportive reactions and/or low in non-supportive reactions and the child was low in emotional vulnerability (e.g., low negativity/lability, good emotion regulation skills, or low SCL reactivity to stress). These findings suggest that specific emotion socialization factors in interaction with children's emotional reactivity may predict risk for BPD features in preadolescence. Future research is needed to replicate these findings and examine whether this interaction prospectively predicts trajectories of BPD features.

AB Background: Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is associated with depression and schizophrenia in adults. The effect of VDD in childhood on behavioral development is unknown.
   Objectives: We aimed to study the associations of VDD and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) in middle childhood with behavior problems in adolescence.
   Methods: We quantified plasma total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and DBP in 273 schoolchildren aged 5-12 y at recruitment into a cohort study in Bogota, Colombia. Externalizing and internalizing behavior problems were assessed after a median 6-y follow-up by parental report [Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)] and self-report [Youth Self-Report (YSR)]. We estimated mean problem score differences with 95% CIs between exposure categories using multivariable linear regression. We also compared the prevalence of clinical behavior problems (score >63) between exposure groups. We assessed whether the associations between DBP and behavior problems were mediated through VDD.
   Results: Mean +/- SD CBCL and YSR externalizing problems scores were 56.5 +/- 9.3 and 53.2 +/- 9.5, respectively. Internalizing problems scores averaged 57.1 +/- 9.8 and 53.7 +/- 9.8, respectively. VDD [25(OH)D <50 nmol/L] prevalence was 10.3%. VDD was associated with an adjusted 6.0 (95% CI: 3.0, 9.0) and 3.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 6.6) units higher CBCL and YSR externalizing problems scores, respectively, and an adjusted 3.6 (95% CI: 0.3, 6.9) units higher CBCL internalizing problems scores. The prevalence of clinical total externalizing problems was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.1) times higher in children with VDD than that in children without VDD. DBP concentration below the population median was related to higher YSR aggressive behavior and anxious/depressed subscale scores and to higher prevalence of clinical total externalizing problems. The associations between DBP and behavior problems were not mediated through VDD.
   Conclusions: VDD and low DBP in middle childhood are related to behavior problems in adolescence.

AB Objective: Although studies have shown an association between poor sleep and chronotype with psychiatric problems in young adults, few have focused on identifying multiple concomitant risk factors.
   Methods: We assessed depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), circadian typology (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire [MEQ]), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]), social rhythm (Social Rhythm Metrics [SRM]), and salivary cortisol (morning, evening and night, n=37) in 236 men (all 18 years old). Separate analyses were conducted to understand how each PSQI domain was associated with depressive symptoms.
   Results: Depressive symptoms were more prevalent in individuals with higher perceived stress (prevalence ratio [PR] = 6.429, p < 0.001), evening types (PR = 2.58, p < 0.001) and poor sleepers (PR = 1.808, p = 0.046). Multivariate modeling showed that these three variables were independently associated with depressive symptoms (all p < 0.05). The PSQI items subjective sleep quality and sleep disturbances were significantly more prevalent in individuals with depressive symptoms (PR = 2.210, p = 0.009 and PR = 2.198, p = 0.008). Lower levels of morning cortisol were significantly associated with higher depressive scores (r = -0.335; p = 0.043).
   Conclusion: It is important to evaluate multiple factors related to sleep and chronotype in youth depression studies, since this can provide important tools for comprehending and managing mental health problems.

AB The acquisition and mastery of emotion regulation is one of the most important developmental tasks of adolescence. Difficulties in regulating emotions are one of the most robust risk factors for the development of difficulties and psychopathology. This study investigates whether a mindful parenting style is associated with adolescent's difficulties in emotion regulation and whether adolescents' self-compassion and psychological inflexibility mediate this association. This study also explores gender and age differences in study variables and the moderating role of adolescents' gender and stage of adolescence in the mediation model. A total of 375 mother-adolescent dyads participated in the study. The adolescents had a mean age of 14.19 years (SD = 1.67; range = 12-19 years) and 59.5% were girls. The mindful parenting dimensions of compassion for the child and nonjudgmental acceptance of parental functioning were indirectly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation through self-compassion, whereas the mindful parenting dimension of listening with full attention was indirectly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation through psychological inflexibility. Some associations were only significant for girls. These findings suggest that mindful parenting is a possible vehicle to foster adaptive emotion regulation in adolescents by facilitating their self-compassion and psychological flexibility.

AB Purpose This study aims to examine and compare the effects of direct and indirect exposure to armed conflicts on the mental health of primary school students in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand. Methods A school-based survey was conducted. Detailed exposure of traumatic events both directly and indirectly were measured by a self-completed questionnaire. Behavioral-emotional problems were measured by the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire and screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was done using the Children's Revised Impact of Events Scale (CRIES). Multivariate analysis adjusted for gender and other covariates was used to determine the effect of direct and indirect exposure of armed conflict on mental health problems. Results Out of 941 students included in the study, almost half had direct exposure to an armed conflict event. Overall, 42.1% of students had at least one behavioral-emotional problem (47.6% and 38.5% in the direct- and indirect-exposed groups, respectively) and 30.5% was found to have PTSD (37.3% and 25.9% in the direct- and indirect-exposed groups, respectively). Students who had direct exposure to an armed conflict event had a two times higher odds of mental health problems than their peers. Other modifiable factors of mental health problems were receiving news from two sources including other adults and media, and exposure to other non-conflict-related traumatic life events. Conclusions Children living in armed conflict areas of southern Thailand, although without any direct exposure to traumatic events, also suffered from mental health problems. Research on appropriate interventions for these children should be further conducted.

AB Previous studies have found that gifted children experience symptoms such as existential anguish, anxiety, depression, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion. The inherent intensity and sensitivity of these young people may make them more susceptible to significant emotional distress and existential concerns. Endeavoring to address such issues, we designed a second-generation mindfulness-based intervention, called the "Atencion plena para altas capacidades" (APAC; Mindfulness for Giftedness). This paper presents the pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up findings on the implementation of the program in a sample of 22 gifted children in Spain. The program comprised eight weekly 90-min group sessions covering mindfulness, emotional intelligence, emotional regulation, acceptance, values, compassion, and self-compassion. The program's efficacy was measured using standardized, validated tools (the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure, the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the Children's Depression Inventory, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children, and the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire) at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up time periods.. Our study's findings at the posttreatment stage suggested that the APAC program improved the emotional abilities and reduced negative symptoms. Results from the 12-month follow-up assessment stage appeared to uphold these findings. However, we recommend that future second-generation mindfulness-based interventions for gifted children should include more activities and exercises that address the meaning of life and other related existential worries of particular concern to these young people.

AB In 1995 Terrie Moffitt published a fully articulated version of a 1993 paper that proposed a dual developmental taxonomy of antisocial behavior. The paper triggered a cascade of research on types of criminal offending, thereby making it one of the most researched and most influential of all developmental theories of antisocial behavior, The silver anniversary of the 1995 publication seems a fitting time to review the status of the life-course-persistent (LCP) group who Moffitt suggested would enable researchers to learn more about the etiology of severe, persistent antisocial behavior from studying this group than from studying the group that had its onset of antisocial behavior in adolescence. The LCP group was hypothesized to consist of a relatively few males whose early-onset of severe antisocial behavior would persist into adulthood and had its origins in neurodevelopmental deficits interacting with various environmental risk factors. This review assessed the evidence supporting these hypotheses and reviewed the findings for early identification of the LCP group-a topic that was only modestly addressed in 1995. Lastly, the paper discussed what is one of most significant impacts of the taxonomy, providing impetus to the early-years crime prevention movement.

AB Sleep is a basic need. Mounting evidence suggests this is particularly true during adolescence, a developmental period involving substantial changes in the brain regions supporting cognition, learning, and emotion. Although sleep loss is a normative psychosocially and biologically driven developmental process, it occurs alongside behaviors that characterize adolescence, including deepening cognitive sophistication, improved emotion regulation, and intensifying social cognition, calling into question how sleep may impact these developmental milestones. This review synthesizes growing research aimed at addressing this timely question. It presents evidence that neurodevelopmental changes in brain structure, function, and sleep physiology mechanistically link the relationship between sleep and cognitive ability.

AB A culture- and age-appropriate instrument for measuring emotion regulation ability is needed for the research and practice of Chinese adolescents' emotion regulation. This study developed and validated a situational judgment test of emotion regulation ability for Chinese youth (STER-CY). Three samples were recruited, and approximately 4380 5th- to 11th-grade students (but no 9th-grade students) participated in the study. Researchers collected emotional situations and responses based on the life of indigenous samples and examined the reliability and validity of the test scores. The results showed that Cronbach's alpha and test-retest correlations provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis supported unidimensionality. Construct validity was further verified by convergent and discriminant validity. Criteria-related validity was confirmed by the correlations between this test and some outcome variables related to emotion regulation. It was also found that girls scored higher on this test than boys did and that emotion regulation ability significantly increased from 5th to 7th grade, but it did not improve from 7th to 11th grade. Considered together, these findings showed that the STER-CY is a psychometrically sound measure of emotion regulation ability and can be used in future research and practice.

AB Distressing intrusive images commonly occur in anxiety. Worry may function to reduce the emotional power of intrusive imagery, but this also prevents emotional processing. As worry is a future-orientated process, suppression of intrusive future imagery could be particularly pertinent to generalized anxiety. Here, we investigate whether youth high in symptoms of generalized anxiety (compared to depression and social anxiety) experience greater impact of future imagery (more intrusions, hyperarousal and avoidance), and whether this relationship varies as a function of the tendency to suppress or reappraise emotional experience. These relationships are important in adolescence, when generalized anxiety commonly begins and emotional regulation strategies develop. Participants (n = 352, age 11-16) completed measures of symptomatology, the impact of prospective personally-relevant imagery (IFES) and emotional regulation strategies. IFES scores correlated with an established measure of prospective imagery. Higher IFES scores were uniquely associated with more symptoms of generalized anxiety and depression, but not with social anxiety. A tendency to supress emotion was related to higher IFES scores and moderated the relationship between generalized anxiety and IFES (but not between depression and IFES). This provides initial impetus to develop novel approaches to investigate and intervene cognitively with negative prospective imagery in adolescent generalized anxiety.

AB Objectives This study examined whether the relation between peer victimization or rejection and internalizing distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms) was moderated by emotion regulation processes in a sample of elementary schoolers.
   Methods Analyses were based on a sample of 476 third and fourth-grade children (M= 9.16 years). Data were collected in the fall and spring of one academic year. Peer-reported victimization and rejection were assessed through a peer nomination inventory. Child-reported victimization, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation were assessed via self-report measures.
   Results Findings from multiple group path models provided evidence that girls scoring higher on peer rejection and boys scoring higher on peer-reported relational victimization reported fewer depressive symptoms in the spring when scoring lower on expressive suppression (girls: beta = 0.157, SE = 0.067, p = 0.019; boys: beta = 0.239, SE = 0.099, p = 0.016). Alternatively, boys scoring higher on self-reported peer victimization in the fall reported fewer anxiety symptoms in the spring when scoring higher on expressive suppression (beta= -0.260, SE = 0.117, p = 0.027) or lower on cognitive reappraisal (beta = 0.246, SE = 0.097, p = 0.011). Boys' peer-reported victimization emerged as a positive predictor of anxiety in the spring, but only at high levels of cognitive reappraisal (beta = 0.284, SE = 0.128, p = 0.026).
   Conclusions Results suggest that expressing emotion is a useful process for reducing depressive symptoms in rejected girls and relationally victimized boys. For boys, suppressing emotion may reduce the risk for developing anxiety as a consequence of peer victimization. Results suggest cognitive reappraisal is not an effective strategy for reducing anxiety in boys as a consequence of peer victimization. This study helps inform our understanding of the role of emotion regulation in relation between peer relationship difficulties and internalizing distress.

AB Objectives With the rise of internal migration in China, research has shown parental migration is linked to adolescent psychological adjustment, but little is known about the corresponding adjustment among left-behind adolescents in urban areas. More importantly, the protective factors for their adjustment are still sparsely covered in the literature. Guided by a risk and resilience ecological framework, the current study compares internalizing problem behavior (IPB) and externalizing problem behavior (EPB) between urban left-behind adolescents and their non-left-behind counterparts in mainland China. It also examines whether the direct and interactive effects of peer attachment and two facets of grit-perseverance of effort (PE) and consistency of interests (CI)-can mitigate problem behaviors in urban left-behind adolescents.
   Methods A propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the two groups concerning age, gender, socioeconomic status, and family functioning. Finally, 246 left-behind adolescents (53.6% girls) and 492 non-left-behind counterparts (55.1% girls) aged 13-18 years were involved in this study.
   Results Urban left-behind adolescents perceived higher levels of IPB and EPB compared to non-left-behind peers. Moreover, higher levels of PE buffered the association between peer attachment and IPB, whereas lower levels of PE exacerbated the association between peer attachment and EPB for urban left-behind adolescents only. Additionally, higher levels of CI buffered the association between peer attachment and EPB for both groups.
   Conclusions This study concludes that peer attachment and PE have protective roles in mitigating problem behaviors among urban left-behind adolescents.

AB Objectives Evidence of the acceptability and potential efficacy of mindfulness strategies with at-risk youth is mounting. Yet only a few studies have assessed these strategies among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH).
   Methods We conducted a mixed methods feasibility study of an adapted mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) with sheltered YEH. The MBI consisted of five 1.5-h sessions delivered at a youth homeless shelter over 2.5 weeks. A one-group pre/post-test design was utilized to collect quantitative assessments of real-time cognitions followed by qualitative inquiry to assess participants' experiences and perceptions of the intervention.
   Results Participants (N = 39) were between 18-21 years old with the majority identifying as male (56.4%), heterosexual (74.4%), Black (51.3%) and Hispanic (15.4%). Attendance was challenging for participants (2.2 sessions attended on average) who had varying work and school obligations. However, pre-post session survey data completeness was excellent (92% completion rate). Participants completed self-report surveys prior to and after each session that measured affect. Significant improvement in pre-post session outcomes were found for frustration, restlessness, stress, depression, boredom, and mindlessness. Participants reported high levels of acceptability of the curriculum content and delivery format. However, several substantial adaptations that youth identified may improve feasibility and acceptability among YEH. The results are limited by the small sample size and the use of a curriculum not developed with or for YEH.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential feasibility of using MBIs among YEH although adaptations to existing curricula are necessary to increase relevance, acceptability of, and access to MBIs among YEH.

AB Background: Whilst there is a growing body of research on the psychological outcomes for siblings of autistic children (autism siblings), few studies have considered the school context.
   Aims: To explore group differences on two school-related self-reported outcomes for autism siblings and siblings of non-autistic children: sense of school belonging, and academic self-concept. Data on self- and parent/carer-reported behavioural and emotional problems were also collected.
   Methods and procedures: 65 autism siblings and a comparison group of 57 siblings of non-autistic children aged 11-16 years completed questionnaires measuring sense of school belonging, academic self concept, and behaviour problems. 73 parents in the autism sibling and 67 parents in the comparison sibling group completed the behaviour problems measure.
   Outcomes and results: Autism siblings reported significantly lower school belonging and academic self-concept, and had significantly poorer self- and parent- reported behaviour problems. When controlling for demographic variables and internalising and externalizing behaviour, robust sibling group differences on academic variables remained.
   Conclusions and implications: Autism siblings reported poorer school-related outcomes and increased behavioural difficulties relative to siblings of non-autistic children. There was wide variation in autism siblings' outcomes, highlighting the importance of taking an individualised and contextualised approach to understanding the varying needs of autism siblings.

AB The current study examined the relationships of typically developing (TD) children with siblings with and without intellectual disabilities (ID), as expressed in TD children's drawings and questionnaires answered by TD children and their mothers. It also examined group differences in the sibling relationships, as well as the associations between having a sibling with or without ID and sibling relationships, and TD children's social-emotional adjustment. Participants were mothers and their TD children (8-13 years). Some had ID siblings ID (N = 28); others had TD siblings (N=31). Sibling relationships were examined via mothers' and target children's completion of questionnaires, and objective visual indicators (location, size, distance) and observed content-based indicators (support, investment, presence of parents) of children's drawings were assessed following the art-based phenomenological analytic approach. Mothers reported on children's social-emotional adjustment. Findings indicated differences in sibling relationships, including higher levels of positive relationships for children with ID siblings. Children's drawings also showed positive relationship aspects for these children. Sibling relationship qualities were significantly associated with children's adjustment. Children's drawings may be a useful data gathering tool to deepen our understanding of unique aspects of sibling relationships.

AB Purpose: We developed a Japanese version of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA) and examined its reliability and validity across three studies.
   Patients and Methods: In Study 1, the Japanese version of ERQ-CA was developed and administered to 389 children aged 8-12 years. In Study 2, the questionnaire was administered to 1738 adolescents aged 12-18 years. In Study 3, utilizing a sample of 1300 children and adolescents, the test was administered twice over a period of four weeks in order to assess test-retest reliability.
   Results: In Study 1, the Japanese version of ERQ-CA showed the same factor structure as the original version, along with good internal consistency reliability and acceptable construct validity. In Study 2, the questionnaire's factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity were again confirmed. Finally, in Study 3, measurement invariance was tested across distinct age groups (8-11, 12-15, and 16-18 years), and the questionnaire had good test-retest reliability over a period of four weeks.
   Conclusion: The Japanese version of the ERQ-CA had good reliability and validity.

AB Research on emotion regulation is now extensive and shows the benefits of the adaptive management of emotions for social functioning and psychological well-being. Our purpose was to test the psychometric properties of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents with a sample of nonclinical Spanish adolescents. A total of 462 secondary education students (223 girls, mean age = 13.89 years, SD = 1.38) participated. The instrument proved to be two-factor and gender-invariant. Results revealed the temporal stability of both emotion regulation strategies, while the predictive validity study revealed that depressive symptoms were negatively related to cognitive reappraisal, and positively related to expressive suppression. Our findings support the use of the ERQ-SpA in Spanish adolescents.

AB In this review, we evaluate evidence for the hypothesis that developmental changes in emotion regulation tendencies during adolescence depend on the maturation of affective control. Affective control refers to the application of cognitive control to affective contexts, that is, the capacity to attend and respond to goal-relevant affective information, while inhibiting attention and responses toward distracting affective information. The evidence suggests that affective control develops throughout adolescence into adulthood. However, the developmental trajectory appears not to be uniform across different facets of affective control. In particular, the capacity to inhibit attention and responses to distracting affective information may be reduced during adolescence relative to childhood and adulthood. Focusing on the association between affective control and emotion regulation development in adolescence, the research reviewed supports the notion of affective control as a cognitive building block of successful emotion regulation. Good affective control appears related to fewer ruminative tendencies in adolescence as well as more frequent and successful reappraisal in older adolescents. Lower use of habitual suppression, itself a type of affective inhibition, shows an association with updating capacity. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for mental health and the potential mental health benefits associated with improving affective control.

AB Emotion regulation skills are critical to young children's school readiness and later academic achievement, as well as educators' efficacy, stress, and job satisfaction. In this article, we demonstrate how the science of emotion regulation can be translated into practical steps for educating teachers and students in schools. We begin with the crucial role of supporting educators in developing their own emotion regulation skills. We also discuss concrete and accessible tools that can be used to support both educators' own skill development and that of their students. We demonstrate how educators can integrate the teaching of emotion regulation through direct instruction, its integration into existing curricula, and daily practices and routines. The examples we provide are part of RULER, an evidence-based, whole school approach to social and emotional learning (SEL) that was developed at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. RULER is grounded in the theory of emotional intelligence, which emphasizes the critical role of emotion regulation in healthy development.

AB Prevalence of pediatric obesity has increased worldwide in the last 20 years. Obese children suffer not only physical complications but also mental health problems such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and eating disorders, as well as psychosocial impairments, such as school adjustment problems, bullying, and low self-esteem. Recently, there have been some studies on the association of mental health problems and pediatric obesity. In the treatment of pediatric obesity, many previous studies suggest multidisciplinary treatment. However, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has attracted attention because obese children are accompanied by body image distortion, emotion dysregulation, and difficulties in stimulus control. This review is a narrative summary of the recent studies on mental health problems and CBT in pediatric obesity. The relationship between depression/anxiety and pediatric obesity is still inconsistent but recent studies have revealed a bidirectional relation between depression and obesity. Additionally, some studies suggest that obese children may have eating disorder symptoms, like loss of control eating, and require therapeutic intervention for pediatric obesity treatment. Furthermore, impulsivity and inattention of ADHD symptom is thought to increase the risk of obesity. It has also been suggested that CBT can be very effective for mental health problems such as depression, impulsivity, and body image distortion, that may coexist with pediatric obesity, and use of multimedia and application can be useful in CBT.

AB Background: The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) is an instrument that assesses nine cognitive strategies to cope with negative situations. The aim of this study was to validate the CERQ for a sample of Spanish adolescents, to analyse reliability and validity, and to examine the factor structure by confirmatory factor analysis. Method: The Spanish version of CERQ (CERQ-S) and other scales (gratitude, emotional intelligence, satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety and stress) were completed by 835 adolescents aged 14-18 (455 girls) from the South of Spain. Results: The results showed that the CERQ-S in adolescents (CERQ-SA) has appropriate psychometric properties with indexes of reliability alpha = .89 and omega = .96. and the original nine-factor structure was confirmed. There was also significant correlation between the CERQ-SA and the other scales, showing evidence of convergent validity. Conclusions: The results suggest that the CERQ-SA could be useful for appraising cognitive coping in adolescents. This will help to expand the study and understanding of these strategies, their influence and their consequences for adolescents psychological functioning and health.

AB The present study aimed to identify the evidence of validity of the internal structure and in relation to other variables of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-18) in peruvian adolescents. The sample consisted of 255 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19 (M=15.494, DE=1.192) from a public school of the district of Ventanilla (Peru). The instruments used were the CERQ-18 and the State / Trait Depression Inventory. Four structural hypotheses were proposed, which were evaluated by confirmatory factor analysis, including bifactor analysis. The results indicate that the evolutionary model represented by automatic (self-blame, rumination, catastrophization) and deliberate strategies (acceptance, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, positive refocusing and putting into perspective), present satisfactory indicators, favoring their interpretation, and showing significant relationships with positive and negative affect. It is concluded that the internal structure of CERQ-18 in adolescents is supported by the evolutionary model.

AB Therapeutic alliance is often an important aspect of psychotherapy, though it is rarely examined in clients with autism. This study aims to determine the child pre-treatment variables and treatment outcomes associated with early and late alliance in cognitive behaviour therapy targeting emotion regulation for children with autism. Data were collected from 48 children with autism who participated in a larger randomized-controlled trial. Pre-treatment child characteristics included child, parent, and clinician report of child emotional and behavioural functioning. Primary outcome measures included child and parent-reported emotion regulation. Therapeutic alliance (bond and task-collaboration) was measured using observational coding of early and late therapy sessions. Pre-treatment levels of child-reported emotion inhibition were associated with subsequent early and late bond. Pre-treatment levels of parent and child-reported emotion regulation were related to early and late task-collaboration. Late task-collaboration was also associated with pre-treatment levels of behavioural and emotional symptom severity. Task-collaboration in later sessions predicted improvements in parent-reported emotion regulation from pre- to post-therapy. Future research is needed to further examine the role of task-collaboration as a mechanism of treatment change in therapies for children with autism.

AB An inverted U-shaped pattern in heart rate (HR) and a U-shaped pattern in heart rate variability (HRV) are easily recognizable when individuals experience any acute stressor. How cardiac complexity (scaling and entropy) changes under acute stress is not well known. Psychologically, emotion regulation (ER) style is likely to influence the individual's specific behavioral response when affronting stress. This study tested whether adolescents with distinct ER styles would show different patterns of linear and nonlinear cardiac changes under stressful conditions. We predicted less autonomic flexibility for adolescents with a highly negative emotional regulation (HNER) style (n = 10) than for those adolescents with a highly positive emotional regulation (HPER) style (n=10). Further, associations between linear and nonlinear measures during each condition were examined for each group. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that HR and HRV changed according to the predicted pattern. Higuchi's fractal dimension and Sample Entropy followed a U-shaped pattern, whereas the short-term scaling exponent followed the reverse pattern. Cardiac changes across conditions were larger in the HPER group. Significant associations between linear and nonlinear measures were found in the HPER group but not in the HNER group. Results are cautiously discussed within a multiscale framework of fluctuations of the different cardiac features.

AB Drawing from dispositional mindfulness research and stress and coping theories, we tested whether adolescents' dispositional mindfulness was associated with perceptions of peer victimization and exclusion and internalizing symptoms. We further explored the role of dispositional mindfulness as a protective factor buffering the impact of peer victimization and exclusion (PVE) on internalizing symptoms. Participants were 361 (40% boys) adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.4) who completed a questionnaire to assess dispositional mindfulness, perceptions of PVE, social anxiety and depressive symptoms, and loneliness. As expected, more frequent experience of PVE was associated with reporting more symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Further, adolescents who reported higher dispositional mindfulness also reported fewer symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness, even after controlling for gender and experiences of PVE. Dispositional mindfulness was not protective against (i.e., did not buffer) the effects of PVE on internalizing symptoms. Instead, we found that PVE had a stronger association with symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness when mindfulness was high relative to when it was medium or low. Yet, victimization was associated with greater social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness at all levels of mindfulness.

AB The aim of the current article is to extend prior conceptualizing by presenting a model of social and emotional competence that recognizes both the mechanisms and the manifestations of social and emotional competence. The Social and Emotional Competence School Model draws together conceptual underpinnings from the social and emotional competence literature along with theoretical grounding from self-determination theory and applies this within the schooling context. Social and emotional competence is operationalized by way of three components: basic psychological need satisfaction (of autonomy, competence, and relatedness), autonomous motivation, and behaviors. In the model, the three components form an iterative process of social and emotional competence development. Need satisfaction promotes social-emotional autonomous motivation and, in turn, socially and emotionally competent behaviors. The behaviors then promote need satisfaction in an ongoing cycle. The associations identified in the iterative process are impacted by need-support within the social environment, and the associations influence and are influenced by individual differences and human development.

AB Objective: A new cancer diagnosis leads to many daily changes in the lives of youth. We aimed to determine how short-term emotion dynamics relate to psychosocial adjustment over time in youth with newly diagnosed cancer and healthy peers. Methods: Youth with newly diagnosed cancer (n = 71, weeks since diagnosis: M = 6.56, SD = 1.94) and age-matched controls (n = 63), aged 8-17 years, reported on their daily mood across the week (T1). Two to 4 months later (T2), youth reported on perceived parental care and overprotection, anxiety, and quality of life. Primary caregivers reported on youth's externalizing and internalizing problems and on parental distress. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted to identify individual daily mood profiles at T1. These profiles were used to predict adjustment at T2, controlling for sociodemographic factors and looking at differences between cancer patients and comparisons. Results: LPA revealed 4 daily mood profiles: stable positive mood (SPM, 61.6%), stable negative mood (SNM, 4.8%), intermediate mood (27.6%), and fluctuating negative mood (FNM, 6%). No sociodemographic or cancer/comparison differences were found across mood profiles. Results showed several relations between mood profiles across the week and adjustment outcomes at T2. Overall, a SPM related to favorable adjustment outcomes, whereas a SNM related to less favorable adjustment. Compared to an FNM, SNM demonstrated less youth-reported perceived parental care (p = .02) and higher youth-reported anxiety (p = .05). Conclusions: Most children show healthy emotions during treatment for cancer. Close monitoring of mood during treatment is important to identify youth at risk for adverse psychosocial adjustment outcomes over time.

AB Former studies demonstrated that antisocial youth with callous-unemotional (CU) traits are impaired in the processing of negative emotional stimuli. The aim of the current study was to explore the moderating role of different behavioural (i.e. conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention) and emotional problems (i.e. internalizing symptoms) in the relationship between CU traits and attentional bias towards emotional stimuli. Besides using self-report measures, attentional bias was tested by an affective dot-probe task in a high-risk sample of 102 adolescent boys (M age = 16.34 years; SD = 1.32). CU traits were related to reduced attention to emotionally distressing pictures. Furthermore, conduct problems significantly moderated the relationship between CU traits and attention to distress cues. These findings highlight the importance of considering potential moderators to the well-established link between CU traits and deficits in response to negative emotional cues.

AB The fact that youth widely engage with the online space in order to improve their emotional health has been lost amongst the debate surrounding adolescents' technology use and associated well-being. Two studies focused on adolescents' use of technology to cope with stressors in daily life. Focus groups (Study 1; n = 16) indicated that youth readily identify using technology to cope and perceive it as helpful for emotional relief. Experience sampling participants (Study 2; n = 156) completed a baseline assessment of online coping and mental health and one week of reports, five times daily, on their technology use, stress, and emotions. Multilevel regression results indicated that across their daily lives, youth who widely endorsed using online strategies to cope responded more negatively to stressors and displayed difficulties in recovering from worry and jealousy. Results held even controlling for use of technology, typical number of stressors, and mental health. Findings highlight the potential shortcomings and comorbid vulnerabilities for youth who frequently turn to the online environment to seek support, information, or distraction.

AB Objective: The study aimed to identify early childhood risk factors for de novo and subthreshold late-onset ADHD. Method: ADHD symptoms were assessed in 9,875 participants from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) using the Conners' Parent Rating Scale at ages 8, 12, 14, and 16 years, along with other childhood characteristics and adolescent outcomes. Multinomial logistic regressions were implemented to identify early childhood predictors of late-onset ADHD and childhood-onset persistent ADHD, with non-ADHD controls as the reference category. Results: Male sex, increased childhood conduct problems, and low socioeconomic status predicted de novo late-onset ADHD. Additional risk factors predicted subthreshold late-onset ADHD and childhood-onset persistent ADHD. Late-onset ADHD symptoms were also accompanied by increased co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems. Conclusion: Findings of different childhood predictors between subthreshold and de novo late-onset ADHD suggest further investigation into time-varying environmental and biological factors driving psychopathological changes is warranted to fully characterize late-onset ADHD.

AB Background: Mental illness is a worldwide public health concern. In the UK, there is a high prevalence of mental illness and poor mental wellbeing among young people. The aim of this study was to investigate whether physical activity is associated with better mental wellbeing and reduced symptoms of mental health disorder in adolescents.
   Methods: A cohort of 928 12-13 year olds (Year 8) from six secondary schools in England, who had participated in the AHEAD trial, 'Activity and Healthy Eating in Adolescence', were followed up three years later (when 15-16 years old, Year 11). At baseline, physical activity was measured using accelerometers. At follow-up, mental wellbeing was measured using the 'Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale' (WEMWBS) and symptoms of mental health disorder using the 'Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire' (SDQ). Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to investigate associations between physical activity and both mental wellbeing and symptoms of mental health disorder.
   Results: 794 (86%) of the eligible 928 young people provided valid accelerometer data at baseline. 668 (72%) provided complete mental wellbeing data and 673 (73%) provided complete symptoms of mental health disorder data at follow-up. The multivariable analyses showed no evidence of an association between physical activity volume (counts per minute (cpm)) or intensity (Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA)) and mental wellbeing (WEMWBS overall score) or overall symptoms of mental health disorder (SDQ Total Difficulties Score). However, higher levels of physical activity volume at age 12-13 years were associated with lower scores on the emotional problems subscale of the SDQ at age 15-16 years.
   Conclusions: This cohort study found no strong evidence that physical activity is associated with better mental wellbeing or reduced symptoms of mental health disorder in adolescents. However, a protective association between physical activity and the emotional problems subscale of the SDQ was found. This suggests that physical activity has the potential to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents. Future cohort study designs should allow for repeated measures to fully explore the temporal nature of any relationship.

AB There is little neurological evidence linking sensation seeking and emotion regulation in adolescence, which is characterised as an emotionally fluctuant period. The present study examined the relationship between sensation seeking and emotion regulation in adolescents. Electroencephalograms were recorded from 22 high sensation-seeking adolescents (HSSs, M-age = 12.36) and 24 low sensation-seeking adolescents (LSSs, M-age = 12.84) during the reactivity and regulation-image task. Group differences in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) associated with the regulation of negative and neutral stimuli were analysed. The results showed that (a) the P2 of HSSs were larger than LSSs during emotion regulation; (b) in down-regulation conditions, the LPP in all time windows were smaller than no-regulation in LSSs. However, there was no significant difference in HSSs; (c) the LPP 300-600 and LPP 1000-1500 of down-regulation were smaller in LSSs than HSSs; (d) for LPP 600-1000, HSSs induced larger LPP than LSSs in the negative down-regulation and negative no-regulation conditions. The results provide neurological evidence that higher sensation seeking is related to the high reactivity to emotional stimuli and poor cognitive control during the regulation of emotions.

AB The study explored the narratives and attachment profiles of eight young men who had engaged in harmful sexual behaviour (HSB) and four of their parents. A multiple-case design was utilised which included information from interviews; Transition to Adulthood Attachment Interviews (TAAI) and the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). The findings indicated that all of the young men presented with extreme insecure or mixed insecure attachment strategies alongside indicators of unresolved traumas or losses. The interview data highlighted absences of effective strategies for self-soothing, emotional regulation, and experience of comfort. A trans-generational pattern was evident in that the four parents were similarly found to show complex insecure attachment strategies and indicators of unresolved trauma and loss. The findings also indicated that insecure attachment and trauma influenced the content and structure of the young men's narratives and of their explanation of their sexually harmful actions. Explanations of the development of sexually harmful behaviours and clinical implications for intervention are discussed.

AB Background: Self-harm (SH) behaviors are established risk factors of suicide, however, in Chinese left-behind children (LBC), SH remains severely under-discussed. In this study, we aimed to investigate SH and explore its association between resilience in a large group of LBC.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study of 2898 LBC was conducted in Yunnan province, China. Information was collected by self-reporting questionnaires. Descriptive analysis was used to depict and compare characteristics of the subjects. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were applied to estimate the associations between resilience and SH prevalence, SH severity, SH repetition.
   Results: The prevalence of SH in LBC was 48.8% (95%CI: 47.0-49.7%). Compared to LBC with lower level of resilience, a higher level of resilience was related to 0.40 folds of SH odds (95%CI: 0.34-0.48). Besides, among all dimensions of resilience, every 1 average score increase of emotion regulation and family support were associated with 0.13 (95%CI: 0.04-0.37) and 0.14 (95%CI: 0.04-0.47) folds of odds in severer SH, respectively; one unit increase in the average score of emotion regulation was related to an OR of 0.23 (95%CI: 0.07-0.71) for repeated SH.
   Conclusions: Psychological resilience presented protective effect on SH in LBC, especially the dimensions of emotion regulation and family support. Intervention measures focusing on enhancing emotion regulation ability and building parent-child connection could be considered in order to reduce SH and suicidal risk in LBC.

AB This study applied emotion regulation theory to examine parental communication that predicts possible markers of adolescent resilience in families of harmful versus non-harmful parental alcohol use. Parent-adolescent dyads (30 with and 30 without harmful parental alcohol use) participated in video-taped interactions rated for parents' emotion coaching and emotion dismissing communication and adolescents' emotion regulation and behavioral impulsivity. Emotion coaching was positively associated with adolescent emotion regulation and behavioral impulsivity. Emotion dismissing was only positively associated with adolescent behavioral impulsivity. Adolescents in families of harmful alcohol use demonstrated more impulsivity but also showed more emotion regulation in the presence of emotion dismissing communication. Findings suggest that dimensions of parental communication are uniquely associated with potential markers of adolescent resilience. For families of harmful parental alcohol use, results point to a need for greater consistency in parental communication behavior and efficacy in modeling desired expressions of emotions to foster adolescent resilience.

AB This study examined associations between tic severity, emotion regulation, social functioning, and social impairment in youth with Tourette Syndrome (TS). Emotion regulation was examined as a mediator between tic severity and social outcomes. Seventy-seven caregivers of youth with TS (M age = 13.1 years; SD = 2.29) were administered proxy-report measures of tic severity, emotion regulation, social functioning, and social impairment. Total and motor tic severity were negatively associated with emotion regulation and social functioning, and positively associated with social impairment (r's = 0.23 to 0.43). Vocal tic severity was not related to emotion regulation or social functioning, but was positively associated with social impairment (r = 0.36). Emotion regulation mediated the relations between total tic severity and both social outcomes, and motor tic severity and both social outcomes. Interventions that target emotion regulation would likely be a beneficial adjunctive therapy for youth with TS, and may result in improved social outcomes.

   VALIDATION
AB The current study examined the psychopathy-aggression relationship by considering different forms of aggression, including aggressive motivation. Emotions were explored as useful in understanding any emerging relationship, notably those consistent with detachment and sensitivity/poor regulation. In three studies, involving non-offending samples (Study one: n = 150, 47 men, 103 women; Study two: n = 442, 314 men, 123 women, five not disclosed; Study three: n = 200, 100 men and 100 women), it was predicted that higher levels of psychopathy would be associated with reports of higher overall, proactive and reactive aggression, and that the association would be moderated by emotion. Specifically, it was predicted that emotion regulation difficulties would associate with higher levels of reactive but not proactive aggression, and that proactive aggression would involve a lack of emotion. Findings generally supported the predictions. The role of emotion-regulation difficulties as a mediator between psychopathy and reactive aggression, and greater emotional detachment as a mediator between psychopathy and proactive aggression was demonstrated. The results demonstrate importance for the components of psychopathy and different aspects of emotion for the psychopathy-aggression link. Directions for future research and some implications for practice are outlined.

AB Background Studies on mental health are scarce from Arab countries, especially studies focusing on adolescents. In addition to the neurobiological and physiological changes that occur during adolescent development, psychological, societal and cultural influences have strong effects on adolescents' behavior and on their somatic and mental health. The present study aimed (1) to describe the mental health profile, operationalized as psychological distress, of a sample of Moroccan adolescents, and (2) to investigate how specific psychosocial factors (parental alcohol use problems and the experience of physical and/or psychological abuse) may affect adolescents' mental health. Methods The sample included 375 adolescents from conveniently selected classes of four high schools in the city of Tetouan in Morocco. The participants responded to an anonymous survey containing, beside other inventories, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and identified those reporting parental alcohol use problems and/or the previous experience of abuse. The sample characteristics were defined using descriptive statistics. The effects of the defined psychosocial factors were identified using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the post hoc Fisher's least significant difference test. Results The most common problems found in high school students from an urban region of Morocco were memory problems, concentration difficulties, restlessness, fear, nervosity and feelings of inadequacy during interpersonal interactions. The female students reported significantly higher psychological distress levels when compared to the male students (p < 0.001). The adolescents reporting parental alcohol use problems and the experience of physical/psychological abuse showed significantly higher levels of psychological distress (p = 0.02), especially symptoms of somatization (p < 0.001), hostility (p = 0.005) and anxiety (p = 0.01), than those not reporting any of these psychosocial factors. Conclusion The mental health profile of female adolescents from an urban area of Morocco is worse than that of their male fellow students. Adolescents reporting parental alcohol use problems and/or the experience of physical/psychological abuse need synchronized support from social- and healthcare services.

AB Academic burnout is a severe problem among adolescents, and coping skills are becoming more crucial. The current study identified the latent profiles of Estonian middle school students, who were reporting different levels of burnout at three measurement points, during one academic year and examined the differences between identified profiles in the context of academic buoyancy and cognitive emotion regulation strategies. The final sample consisted of 148 students (71 girls, 77 boys), and two burnout profiles were identified: "above-average" (40%) and "below-average" (60%). The study confirmed buoyancy acting as the strongest protective factor against burnout. Rumination, self-blame, catastrophising and positive reappraisal were also strong differentiators between the profiles, suggesting that burnout follows the analogue pattern previously identified in known psychopathologies. The extension of Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire to academic burnout was also supported by the study. Results suggest the need for implementing a proactive, sustainable approach to burnout prevention in schools.

AB Objectives The primary objective of this research was to examine patterns of parent-child relationship functioning among pediatric cancer survivors and their caregivers across a variety of relationship indicators (ie, Involvement, Attachment, Communication, Parenting Confidence, and Relational Frustration), and evaluate how these factors relate to psychosocial outcomes in survivors. Methods Young survivors aged 10 to 18 and their caregivers (N = 165) completed measures related to posttraumatic stress and general distress. Caregivers also completed assessments of parent-child relationship functioning, and survivors completed assessments of social functioning. Latent profile analysis was performed to identify patterns of relationship functioning. Medical, demographic, and parent functioning variables were examined as predictors, and youth's psychological and social functioning were examined as outcomes. Results A three-class solution was the best fit to the data. The struggling parent-child relationship profile (15%) evidenced below average levels of parent-child relationship functioning across several domains. The normative parent-child relationship (60%), was characterized by average levels of parent-child relationship functioning across all domains. Finally, the high-involved parent-child relationship profile (25%) demonstrated above average levels of parent-child relationship functioning in involved activities, communication, and attachment and normative levels of functioning across all other domains. Medical and parent functioning factors predicted profile membership. In turn, profile membership was associated with survivor psychological and social outcomes. Conclusion Findings document the importance of extending existing research to examine patterns of parent-child relationship functioning, which may serve as a clinically relevant target to improve psychological and social outcomes in young survivors of childhood cancer.

AB Parents are important for the development and maintenance of regulatory control. The current longitudinal study examined associations between parental coercion and autonomy support and impulse control in 117 youth (ages 8-16; M-age= 12.87, SD = 2.53; 44% male) with Type 1 diabetes and explored whether youth negative affect mediated these associations. Parental coercion (but not autonomy support) was concurrently associated with lower impulse control and higher negative affect within individuals. Increases in youth negative affect partially mediated the within-person association between parental coercion and impulse control. These findings suggest that parent-directed interventions to reduce parental coercion may be most beneficial for impulse control if combined with youth-directed interventions to help them regulate negative affect. Replication of the current findings in a larger sample of youth with and without a chronic illness is needed to address the theoretical and empirical importance of negative affect as a potential mechanism through which parental coercion impacts youth impulsivity.

AB Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have social interaction deficits and difficulties in emotional regulation. The neural substrates for these socio-affective deficits are not yet clear, but one potential candidate is maldevelopment of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a white matter tract thought to be involved in socio-affective processing. However, the developmental trajectory of the UF in young children with social interaction deficits has not been examined. The present study was designed to describe the developmental growth trajectory of the UF and the relationships between UF development and social deficits in ASD.
   Methods: Eigenvalues of the UF were measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based tractography in 37 children with ASD and 27 matched 2-3-year-old subjects with developmental delay (DD) at baseline (time 1) and at 2-year follow-up (time 2). Growth rates of the UF were compared between groups and associations with social deficit scores according to the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) analyzed by Pearson's correlations.
   Results: At time 1, axial diffusivity (AD) of the left UF was significantly larger in the ASD group than the DD group. At time 2, left UF fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly higher and radial diffusivity (RD) significantly lower in the ASD group than the DD group. The rate of UF growth during this 2-year interval was faster in children with ASD than DD. Significant negative correlations were found between the rise in ADI-R social deficit measures and both right UF RD and left UF mean diffusivity (MD).
   Conclusions: Young children with ASD demonstrate UF overgrowth during the 2-year development period between 2 and 3 and 4-5 years of age, and this white matter abnormality is directly associated with the progression of social deficits.

AB Background and aim Personality functioning is predictive of drug misuse and relapse, yet little is known about the role of personality in engagement with the treatment process. This study aimed to estimate the extent to which broad- and facet-level characteristic adaptations contribute to or hinder treatment engagement, while controlling for psychosocial indicators. Design Multi-site cross-sectional survey. Setting In-patient treatment units covering 80% of residential treatment entries in Greece. Participants A total of 338 service users, 287 (84.9%) male, 51 (15.1%) female, average age 33.4 years. Measurements Expressions of personality functioning (characteristic adaptations) were assessed using the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118). Treatment engagement was measured using the Client Evaluation of Self and Treatment, in-patient version (CEST). Findings Dysfunctional levels of relational capacities predicted counselling rapport [beta = 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.326-2.69, P = 0.013], treatment participation (beta = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.15-3.11, P < 0.001) and treatment satisfaction (beta = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.735-2.57, P < 0.001). Counselling rapport was also predicted by dysfunctional levels in self-control (beta = 1.78, 95% CI = 0.899-2.67, P < 0.001), self-reflective functioning at the facet-level (beta = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.01-3.46, P < 0.001) and aggression regulation (beta = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.438-2.42, P = 0.005). Dysfunctional levels on social concordance (beta = -1.90, 95% CI = -2.87 to -0.941, P = 0.001), emotional regulation (beta = 1.90, 95% CI = 0.87-2.92, P < 0.001) and intimacy (beta = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.31-3.05, P < 0.001) were significant predictors of treatment participation. Treatment readiness and desire for help predicted treatment engagement. Conclusions In people attending substance use treatment services, maladaptive interpersonal patterns and relational intimacy, emotional dysregulation and impulse control may be associated with low levels of counselling rapport and treatment participation. Low frustration tolerance and aggressive impulses also appeared to predict low participation.

AB Background: This study is built on a long-standing research partnership between the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health and the White Mountain Apache Tribe to identify effective interventions to prevent suicide and promote resilience among American Indian (AI) youth. The work is founded on a tribally-mandated, community-based suicide surveillance system with case management by local community mental health specialists (CMHSs) who strive to connect at-risk youth to treatment and brief, adjunctive interventions piloted in past research.
   Methods: Our primary aim is to evaluate which brief interventions, alone or in combination, have the greater effect on suicide ideation (primary outcome) and resilience (secondary outcome) among AI youth ages 10-24 ascertained for suicide-related behaviors by the tribal surveillance system. We are using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial with stratified assignment based on age and suicidal-behavior type, and randomizing N = 304 youth. Brief interventions are delivered by AI CMHSs, or by Elders with CMHS support, and include: 1) New Hope, an evidence-based intervention to reduce immediate suicide risk through safety planning, emotion regulation skills, and facilitated care connections; and 2) Elders' Resilience, a culturally-grounded intervention to promote resilience through connectedness, self-esteem and cultural identity/values. The control condition is Optimized Case Management, which all study participants receive. We hypothesize that youth who receive: a) New Hope vs. Optimized Case Management will have significant reductions in suicide ideation; b) Elders' Resilience vs. Optimized Case Management will have significant gains in resilience; c) New Hope followed by Elders' Resilience will have the largest improvements on suicide ideation and resilience; and d) Optimized Case Management will have the weakest effects of all groups. Our secondary aim will examine mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness and sequencing.
   Discussion: Due to heterogeneity of suicide risk/protective factors among AI youth, not all youth require the same types of interventions. Generating evidence for what works, when it works, and for whom is paramount to AI youth suicide prevention efforts, where rates are currently high and resources are limited. Employing Native paraprofessionals is a means of task-shifting psychoeducation, culturally competent patient support and continuity of care.

AB This study adopted a single-group pretest-posttest design to explore the changes in 2,876 undergraduate students in positive youth development, psychological well-being and desired graduate attributes after they took a leadership subject utilising the positive youth development approach at one university in Hong Kong. The subject aims to promote undergraduates' leadership qualities, particularly their intra- and inter-personal competencies. Participants completed the same objective outcome evaluation forms before and after taking the subject. We found that the participants showed significant positive changes in most positive youth development attributes (i.e. self-determination, cognitive competence, behavioural competence, social competence, emotional competence, self-efficacy, spirituality, and clear and positive identity), life satisfaction and desired graduate attributes (including problem-solving ability, critical thinking, life-long learning and ethical leadership). The findings demonstrate that leadership subjects can promote the positive youth development of Chinese university students and enhance their psychosocial well-being and desired graduate attributes.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a widespread tool for assessing behavior problems in children and adolescents. Despite being investigated thoroughly concerning both validity and reliability, peer reviewed studies that provide norms, especially for preschool children, are lacking. This paper provides Swedish norms using data from a large community sample of children aged 3-5, based on mothers', fathers', and preschool teacher's ratings. Preschool teachers' ratings were generally lower than parents' ratings, which contradicts some previous studies. Differences between girls and boys were found, suggesting that boys display higher levels of behavior problems. Lower parental education and country of origin outside of Sweden were also associated with more difficulties. Cut-offs are presented for each age group, gender and rater category. Population-specific norms and percentile cut-offs provided in this study facilitate identifying children in need of interventions in paediatric care and enable cross-country comparisons of children's mental health problems.

AB Objective: To describe the timeline to diagnosis for children with central precocious puberty (CPP) and evaluate their psychosocial and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was used to prospectively collect data from caregivers, recruited via the MAGIC Foundation, of children with CPP. The control (non-CPP) group was recruited from a national panel of parents/caregivers. After completing a screening survey, respondents completed a burden of illness survey. Respondents in both groups completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) peer relationship instruments. Results: Responses from 142 caregivers of children with and 300 without CPP were assessed. Mean time to treatment after a child's visit to the pediatric endocrinologist was 220 days and time from onset of symptoms to initiating treatment was approximately 2 years. Responses to HRQoL inventories were all lower in children with CPP versus non-CPP. Adjusted mean (+/- standard error) PedsQL total (65.3 +/- 1.8 versus 75.7 +/- 1.2), Psychosocial Health Summary (62.4 +/- 1.8 versus 73.4 +/- 1.2), and Physical Health Summary (70.7 +/- 2.2 versus 79.9 +/- 1.5) scores were significantly lower (p < .01) in CPP versus non-CPP group. PROMIS peer relationship T score (+/- standard error) was numerically lower for the CPP versus non-CPP group (45.4 +/- 1.0 versus 47.4 +/- 0.7, p = .11). Conclusions: In clinical practice, there is a longer than expected delay between CPP symptom onset and referral to an endocrinologist and ultimate treatment. Children with CPP experience a substantial disease burden with a significant impact on emotional, social, and physical functioning compared with children without CPP.

AB A growing number of studies support the internal and external validity of youth self-reported sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms. However, no study has examined SCT in adolescents without ADHD, examined whether adolescent self-reported SCT is distinct from adolescent self-reported ADHD inattention (ADHD-IN), or evaluated whether links between SCT and internalizing problems differ for adolescents with or without ADHD. The present study is the first to (1) determine the convergent and discriminant validity of self-reported SCT and ADHD-IN symptoms in both adolescents with and without ADHD, (2) test the invariance of SCT and ADHD-IN symptoms across ADHD and comparison groups, (3) examine SCT as uniquely related to a range of internalizing-relevant domains, and (4) evaluate if the association between SCT with internalizing correlates differs for adolescents with or without ADHD. Participants were adolescents (M-age = 13 years) with (n = 162) and without (n = 140) ADHD. Adolescents and parents completed measures of internalizing symptoms and emotion dysregulation; adolescents completed measures of rumination and suicidal ideation. Analyses indicated that 13 of the 15 SCT items demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity from ADHD-IN, and SCT and ADHD-IN demonstrated invariance across the ADHD and comparison groups and across sex. SCT, but not ADHD-IN, was uniquely associated with greater adolescent-reported internalizing symptoms and suicidal ideation. Both SCT and ADHD-IN were uniquely associated with adolescent-reported emotion dysregulation and parent-reported internalizing symptoms. Only ADHD-IN was uniquely associated with parent-reported emotion dysregulation. Findings support the differentiation of adolescent-reported SCT and ADHD-IN and demonstrate associations between SCT and increased internalizing problems in adolescents with and without ADHD.

AB Recent theory and evidence support an integrated affective-cognitive model of adolescent depressive symptoms in which temperament predicts the use of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation (ER) strategies which, in turn, predict depressive symptoms. We concurrently and prospectively investigated whether two cognitive ER strategies (dampening and brooding) mediated the effect of trait positive and negative affect on adolescent depressive symptoms. Young adolescents (11-14 years old) completed questionnaires at baseline (N = 150) and at a 4-month follow-up (N = 126). Findings indicate brooding mediated the relationship between both positive and negative affect and depressive symptoms, both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Dampening yielded inconsistent results. This suggests brooding may be a unique mechanism from trait affect to depressive symptoms in late childhood to early adolescence.

AB Purpose Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) aims to reduce emotional dysregulation and engagement in less adaptive behaviours for adults with mixed disorders of conduct and emotions (MDCE). However, there is limited evidence available for the effectiveness of DBT skills training for adolescents with MDCE who are resident within a secure impatient setting. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach A retrospective study investigated changes in aggressive and self-injurious behaviours in 22 adolescents within a secure inpatient mental health setting with MDCE who had completed one cycle of DBT skills training. Changes in symptomatic problems, behavioural and social impairment were also investigated in 17 of the 22 participants who completed the DBT skills training cycle. Findings There were statistically significant decreases in the frequencies of engagement in total aggressive and deliberate self-harm behaviours after the DBT skills training cycle. There was a significant improvement in symptomatic and behavioural impairment, but not in social impairment. Practical implications - The findings of this study suggest that DBT skills training may be beneficial for behavioural and symptomatic outcomes in adolescent inpatients with MDCE. Originality/value This study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of DBT skills training for adolescents with MDCE within a secure inpatient setting. Additional studies are required to investigate the clinical benefits of specific aspects of DBT for individual patients.

AB The purpose of this study was to extend research on the Personality Assessment Inventory-Adolescent (PAI-A; Morey, 2007) to include an examination of mean PAI-A results and associations between the PAI-A and indicators of impulsivity in a large sample of at-risk adolescents (M-age = 16.75; 79% male; 64% Caucasian) in a military-style residential program. Included in this study are archival records for a diverse sample of 497 youths who participated in the program during a 2-year period. Average T scores on PAI-A scales ranged from 44.67 to 65.41. Moderate to large positive associations (rs = .30-.65) were found between relevant PAI-A scales and both UPPS-P scales and self-reported substance use. There were smaller effects (r = .17) for associations between the PAI-A and program disciplinary infractions. Small to large group differences (ds = .19-.93) on PAI-A scales differentiated youths who had experience with arrests or NSSI from those who did not. This study provides information about the under-studied but vulnerable youths occupying the space between the normative population and youths with identified clinical or legal problems. It also clarifies how impulsivity and impulsivity-related behaviors may be represented on the PAI-A.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity, as well as executive dysfunction. Recent work underlines the importance in understanding the role of emotion reactivity and regulatory deficits in the context of the disorder. One study (i.e., Musser et al. 2011) utilized a positive and negative emotion induction and suppression task, as well as indexes of autonomic nervous system reactivity, to examine emotional functioning in youth with ADHD. This study revealed inflexible parasympathetic-based regulation across emotion conditions among youth with ADHD compared to typically developing youth. The present study sought to replicate and extend these findings to a clinically recruited, diverse sample, while also examining sympathetic functioning. Two hundred fifty-nine participants (160 youth with ADHD), aged 5 to 13, completed the task utilized in Musser et al. 2011, while indexes of parasympathetic (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) and sympathetic (i.e., pre-ejection period [PEP] and electrodermal activity [EDA]) reactivity were obtained. ADHD was associated with significantly elevated parasympathetic (i.e., augmented RSA) and sympathetic (as indexed by EDA) reactivity. Overall, results replicate and extend Musser et al. 2011, revealing sympathetic-linked disruptions in emotion reactivity and parasympathetic-linked disruptions in emotion regulation among youth with ADHD. Future studies of behavioral therapies for ADHD should consider the efficacy of adding an emotion regulation skills training component.

AB Anxiety and depression are common emotional problems in children and adolescents. This study used a long-term tracking large database to investigate whether the proportion of children who were diagnosed with speech and language impairments were later diagnosed with anxiety or depression were significantly greater than that of matched group of the same age and gender without speech and language impairments. More than 4300 eligible children with speech and language impairments and matched controls were identified and assessed for anxiety and depression. The risk of anxiety and depressive disorders in children with speech and language impairments were examined with Cox regression analyses and adjusting for covariables (gender, age, and comorbidities). The results showed that speech and language impairments were positively associated with anxiety disorders (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.20-3.76) and depressive disorders (AHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.52-4.13). The number of boys with speech and language impairments was more than twofold that of girls, but boys did not different from girls in the risk of anxiety disorders (AHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.75-1.20) and depressive disorders (AHR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47-1.11). Infantile autism and intellectual disabilities were positively associated with anxiety (AHR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.21; AHR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09-1.98), and the latter was positively associated with depression (AHR 1.83, 95% CI 1.06-3.17). In addition to speech and language impairments interventions, our findings supported the necessity of identification and interventions in anxiety and depressive disorders among children with speech and language impairments from elementary school until youth.

AB This investigation examined vagal modulation of arousal, as indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), as a moderator of the covariance between interpretation biases and anxiety disorder symptom severity in a diverse sample of clinically anxious youth. A sample of 105 children with anxiety disorders (M-age = 10.07 years, SD = 1.22; range = 8-12 years; 57.1% female; 61.9% ethnic minority) and their mothers completed a battery of measures assessing interpretation biases and anxiety disorder symptom severity. Children also completed a behaviorally-indexed assessment of interpretation biases and participated in an anxiety-provoking speech task. Physiological assessment of RSA was collected at baseline (i.e., baseline RSA) and during the speech task (i.e., challenge RSA). The interaction between challenge RSA and both self-reported and behaviorally-indexed interpretation biases (adjusting for baseline RSA) was significant (Delta R-2 = .05 and .04 respectively) in relation to maternal report of child anxiety symptoms. Specifically, among children with low (vs. high) challenge RSA, greater self-reported interpretation biases were significantly associated with maternal report of more severe child anxiety symptoms, and greater behaviorally-indexed interpretation biases were marginally associated with maternal report of more severe child anxiety. Interactions predicting child self-report of anxiety symptoms were not significant. Greater child interpretation biases coupled with lower challenge RSA were associated with maternal report of more severe child anxiety symptoms. Future work should examine whether interventions targeting RSA weaken the association between interpretation biases and anxiety symptoms in youth.

AB The devastating consequences of cyberbullying during adolescence justify the relevance of obtaining empirical evidence on the factors that may cause participation in its distinct roles. The goal of this study was to analyze the predictive capacity of aggressiveness (physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility) and emotional intelligence (attention, understanding, and emotional regulation) with respect to being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor of cyberbullying during adolescence. The Screening for Peer Bullying, the Aggressiveness Questionnaire and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 were administered to a sample of 1102 Spanish secondary education students, aged 12 to 18. In general, results revealed a higher probability of being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor as physical aggressiveness and anger increased. On the other hand, results revealed a low probability of being a victim, aggressor or victim-aggressor as emotional understanding and emotional regulation increased. These findings highlight the importance of considering said variables when creating prevention programs to stop or reduce the social and educational issue of cyberbullying during adolescence.

AB The Social Emotional Health Survey-Secondary (SEHS-S), which is a measure of core psychological assets based on a higher-order model of Covitality, is comprised of 36 items and four latent traits (with three measured subscales): belief in self (self-efficacy, self-awareness, and persistence), belief in others (school support, family coherence, and peer support), emotional competence (emotional regulation, behavioral self-control, and empathy), and engaged living (gratitude, zest, and optimism). Previous international studies have supported the psychometric properties of the SEHS-S. The present study extended this research by examining the psychometric properties of a Spanish-language adaptation with a sample of 1042 Spanish adolescents (M-age = 14.49, SD = 1.65.). Confirmatory factor analyses replicated the original factorial structure, with hierarchical omega between 0.66-0.93, with 0.94 for the total score. Factorial invariance across genders revealed small latent mean differences. A path model evaluated concurrent validity, which revealed a significant association between Covitality and bidimensional mental health (psychological distress and well-being). Specifically, correlational analyses showed a negative association with internalizing/externalizing symptoms, and positive associations with subjective well-being, health-related quality of life, and prosocial behaviors. This study provides an example of a culturally relevant adaptation of an international tool to measure student strengths, which is critical to planning school programming and policy.

AB Objectives The Father and Mother Attachment Questionnaire (FMAQ) is a 30-item self-report measure developed for assessing adolescents' and young adults' representations of attachment relationships with each parental figure separately, across three dimensions: quality of emotional bond, separation anxiety, and inhibition of exploration and individuality. Five studies were conducted to develop a short-form of FMAQ and to examine whether this new short measure presented with fit psychometric properties. Method Study 1 involved Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses with 563 Portuguese adolescents and aim to select the best items to include in the short-form of the FMAQ. Studies 2 to 5 aimed to replicate the reliability and factor structure found in Study 1 through confirmatory factor analysis on independent samples of adolescents, young adults and adults. Results The IRT results suggested including 15-items in the short-form of FMAQ. The results provide support for the adjustment of the short factor structure, internal consistency, and invariance measurement (among gender of participants and parental roles), and predictive validity across different samples. Conclusions The results obtained in the five studies indicate that the short-form FMAQ is a reliable instrument to assess the quality of attachment to parents in adolescence and emerging adulthood, as well as to evaluate adults' perceptions of their parents as attachment figures during their adolescence. Thus, we suggest this short-form as a promising research tool for researchers quickly to assess attachment to parents in these ages taking into account a three-dimensional approach.

AB Background. Interoceptive deficits (ID) have been associated with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior in multiple studies. Many of these studies are limited in scope, and have not fully examined possible mechanisms explaining how ID affect suicidal behavior.
   Methods. This study assesses how self-reported ID relate to suicide ideation and attempts in six distinct and geographically diverse samples of adults (n = 2706) and one sample of adolescents (n = 436). Participants responded to a variety of self-report questionnaires and interviews.
   Results. Contrary to our hypothesis, self-reported ID were only associated with suicidal ideation in two samples, one of which was the adolescent sample. Largely consistent with our predictions, self-reported ID exhibited an indirect effect on suicide attempts through versatility of NSSI in four of the five adult samples tested. Finally, the indirect effects of self-reported ID on suicide attempts through NSSI versatility did not act indirectly through behaviorally assessed pain tolerance.
   Conclusions. We found that, in adults, self-reported ID are not associated with suicidal ideation, but are connected with a history of suicide attempts, through an indirect effect via NSSI. Our findings also indicate that the mechanism of action leading from self-reported ID to suicidal behavior may differ between adolescents and adults, and relate to suicidal behavior independent of pain tolerance. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB A 17-year-old girl with a history of anxiety and emotional dysregulation presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, weight loss, dizziness, and vomiting. She had previously been prescribed several medications for ongoing somatic and psychiatric complaints, but her symptoms continued to escalate. She was noted to have significant weight loss, orthostatic hypotension, a prolonged QTc on electrocardiogram, and a serum sodium of 130 mEq/L. She was admitted with concern for an eating disorder. While inpatient, her symptoms continued to evolve, and a test was sent that revealed her underlying diagnosis.

AB IMPORTANCE The long-term association between sleep duration and mental health in children is currently unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the prospective associations between sleep duration and symptoms of emotional and behavioral disorders at ages 6, 8, 10, and 12 years.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study obtained data from the Trondheim Early Secure Study in Trondheim, Norway. A representative, stratified random sample of children born between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004, were invited to participate. Participants were followed up biennially from age 4 years (2007-2008) to 12 years (2013-2014). Data analysis was conducted from January 2, 2019, to May 28, 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sleep duration was assessed with 1 week of continuous use of a triaxial accelerometer. Symptoms of emotional (anxiety and depression) and behavioral (oppositional defiant, conduct, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity) disorders were measured by semistructured clinical interviews (using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment) with parents (at all ages) and children (from age 8 years).
   RESULTS The analytical sample comprised 799 children (mean [SD] age at time point 2, 6.0 [0.2] years; 405 [50.7%] boys; and 771 [96.5%] Norwegian). Shorter sleep duration at age 6 years (beta [unstandardized regression coefficient] = -0.44; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.08; P = .02) and 8 years (beta = -0.47; 95% CI, -0.83 to -0.11; P = .01) forecasted symptoms of emotional disorders 2 years later. Comparatively short sleep duration at age 8 years (beta = -0.65; 95% CI, -1.22 to -0.08; P = .03) and 10 years (beta = -0.58; 95% CI, -1.07 to -0.08; P = .02) was associated with symptoms of behavioral disorders 2 years later among boys but not among girls at age 8 years (beta = -0.14; 95% CI,- 0.52 to 0.24; P = .48) or 10 years (beta = -0.05; 95% CI, = -0.49 to 0.40; P = .84). These associations were statistically significant among boys compared with girls at age 8 years (Delta chi(2)(1) = 13.26; P < .001) and 10 years (Delta chi(2)(1) = 10.25; P = .001). Symptoms of psychiatric disorders did not forecast sleep duration at any age.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found an association between short sleep duration and increased risk of future occurrence of emotional disorder symptoms in both boys and girls and between reduced sleep and behavioral disorder symptoms in boys. These results suggest that improving sleep in children may help protect against the development of symptoms of common psychiatric disorders and may be advantageous in the treatment of such disorders.

AB This study evaluated the efficacy of a family-centered preventive intervention, the Family Check-Up (FCU), delivered as an online, eHealth model to middle school families. To increase accessibility of family-centered prevention in schools, we adapted the evidence-based FCU to an online format, with the goal of providing a model of service delivery that is feasible, given limited staffing and resources in many schools. Building on prior research, we randomly assigned participants to waitlist control (n = 105), FCU Online as a web-based intervention (n = 109), and FCU Online with coaching support (n = 108). We tested the effects of the intervention on multiple outcomes, including parental self-efficacy, child self-regulation, and child behavior, in this registered clinical trial (NCT03060291). Families engaged in the intervention at a high rate (72% completed the FCU assessment) and completed 3-month posttest assessments with good retention (94% retained). Random assignment to the FCU Online with coaching support was associated with reduced emotional problems for children (p = .003, d = -0.32) and improved parental confidence and self-efficacy (p = .018, d = 0.25) when compared with waitlist controls. Risk moderated effects: at-risk youth showed stronger effects than did those with minimal risk. The results have implications for online delivery of family-centered interventions in schools.

AB This study investigates suicide risk in late childhood and early adolescence in relation to a family-centered intervention, the Family Check-Up, for problem behavior delivered in early childhood. At age 2, 731 low-income families receiving nutritional services from Women, Infants, and Children programs were randomized to the Family Check-Up intervention or to a control group. Trend-level main effects were observed on endorsement of suicide risk by parents or teachers from ages 7.5 to 14, with higher rates of suicide risk endorsement in youth in the control versus intervention condition. A significant indirect effect of intervention was also observed, with treatment-related improvements in inhibitory control across childhood predicting reductions in suicide-related risk both at age 10.5, assessed via diagnostic interviews with parents and youth, and at age 14, assessed via parent and teacher reports. Results add to the emerging body of work demonstrating long-term reductions in suicide risk related to family-focused preventive interventions, and highlight improvements in youth self-regulatory skills as an important mechanism of such reductions in risk.

AB Several research teams have previously traced patterns of emerging conduct problems (CP) from early or middle childhood. The current study expands on this previous literature by using a genetically-informed, experimental, and long-term longitudinal design to examine trajectories of early-emerging conduct problems and early childhood discriminators of such patterns from the toddler period to adolescence. The sample represents a cohort of 731 toddlers and diverse families recruited based on socioeconomic, child, and family risk, varying in urbanicity and assessed on nine occasions between ages 2 and 14. In addition to examining child, family, and community level discriminators of patterns of emerging conduct problems, we were able to account for genetic susceptibility using polygenic scores and the study's experimental design to determine whether random assignment to the Family Check-Up (FCU) discriminated trajectory groups. In addition, in accord with differential susceptibility theory, we tested whether the effects of the FCU were stronger for those children with higher genetic susceptibility. Results augmented previous findings documenting the influence of child (inhibitory control [IC] gender) and family (harsh parenting, parental depression, and educational attainment) risk. In addition, children in the FCU were overrepresented in the persistent low versus persistent high CP group, but such direct effects were qualified by an interaction between the intervention and genetic susceptibility that was consistent with differential susceptibility. Implications are discussed for early identification and specifically, prevention efforts addressing early child and family risk.

AB Smoking is a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Almost no evidence-based intervention programs are available to help youth quit smoking. We argue that ineffective targeting of peer influence and engagement difficulties are significant barriers to successful youth smoking cessation. To address these barriers, we developed the mobile game intervention HitnRun. A two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 144) was conducted and young smokers (M-age = 19.39; SDage = 2.52) were randomly assigned to either play HitnRun or read a psychoeducational brochure. Prior to, directly following the intervention period, and after three-month follow-up, weekly smoking behavior, abstinence rates, intervention dose, and peer- and engagement-related factors were assessed. Results indicated similar reductions in weekly smoking levels and similar abstinence rates for both groups. Yet, we found a dose effect with HitnRun only: The longer participants played HitnRun, the lower their weekly smoking levels were. In the brochure group, a higher dose was related to higher weekly smoking levels at all measurement moments. Exploratory analyses showed the most powerful effects of HitnRun for participants who connected with and were engaged by the intervention. Future work should build on the promising potential of HitnRun by increasing personalization efforts and strengthening peer influence components.

AB Psychosocial stress, uncontrolled eating and obesity are three interrelated epidemiological phenomena already present during youth. This broad narrative conceptual review summarises main biological underpinnings of the stress-diet-obesity pathway and how new techniques can further knowledge. Cortisol seems the main biological factor from stress towards central adiposity; and diet, physical activity and sleep are the main behavioural pathways. Within stress-diet, the concepts of comfort food and emotional eating are highlighted, as cortisol affects reward pathways and appetite brain centres with a role for insulin, leptin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), endocannabinoids, orexin and gastrointestinal hormones. More recently researched biological underpinnings are microbiota, epigenetic modifications and metabolites. First, the gut microbiota reaches the stress-regulating and appetite-regulating brain centres via the gut-brain axis. Second, epigenetic analyses are recommended as diet, obesity, stress and gut microbiota can change gene expression which then affects appetite, energy homeostasis and stress reactivity. Finally, metabolomics would be a good technique to disentangle stress-diet-obesity interactions as multiple biological pathways are involved. Saliva might be an ideal biological matrix as it allows metagenomic (oral microbiota), epigenomic and metabolomic analyses. In conclusion, stress and diet/obesity research should be combined in interdisciplinary collaborations with implementation of several-omics analyses.

AB Substance use among women is a major public health concern. This review article takes a developmental-relational approach to examine processes through which early relational trauma and violence in relationships may lead to substance use. We examine how early exposure to violence in relationships can impact neurological development, specifically through interference with physiological mechanisms (e.g., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), brain structure and functioning (e.g., the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex), and neuropsychological development (e.g., executive functioning and emotion regulation) across the lifespan. Further, we discuss the impact of exposure to violence on the development of relational capacity, including attachment, internal working models, and subsequent interpersonal relationships across the lifespan, and how these developmental pathways can lead to continued problematic substance use in women.

AB Social and emotional factors such as emotional competence and self-esteem are protective factors that promote adolescent mental health and well-being. In this paper, we will examine the combined contribution of these socio-emotional factors in addition to personal factors, in the prediction of psychological adjustment and subjective well-being in adolescence. The study included 840 adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years old (M = 13.37, SD = 1.16, 51.4% girls). We measured personal variables (sex, age, number of siblings), socio-emotional variables (emotional competence and self-esteem), psychological adjustment (emotional and behavioural problems) and subjective well-being (life satisfaction and affect balance). Besides descriptive analysis and Pearson bivariate correlations, two different methodologies were performed, including hierarchical regression models and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results show that emotional competence is a protective factor for optimal adjustment and well-being, and suggest that self-esteem reinforces this relation. Different patterns were observed for female and male adolescents of different ages and with different family backgrounds. The practical implications of our findings for intervention programs have been discussed.

AB This study investigated change in depression and revealed factors related to change using one-year follow-up data. A sample of 108 North Korean Refugee Youths (NKRYs) aged 13 to 26 years (66 females) was recruited from two alternative schools for NKRYs in South Korea. Based on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale cut-off score of 16, respondents were grouped based on change in depression score after one year as stable low, alleviated, deteriorated, or prolonged. Multinomial logistic regression assessed the influence of baseline psychological scores (resilience, emotional regulation strategy, and self-esteem), and reported social support (psychological/practical) on the odds of group classification. With the stable low group as the reference category, those with alleviated depression at Time 2 had significantly higher odds of expressive suppression and tended to have lower self-esteem at Time 1. The deteriorated depression group was more likely than the stable low group to have lower resilience and cognitive appraisal scores. Those with prolonged high depression were more likely than the stable low group to have lower resilience, less practical social support, and lower self-esteem. Psychological interventions, particularly those focused on increasing self-esteem and resilience, could be helpful for NKRYs with potential risk of depression. In addition, practical support should be provided on an as-needed basis to prevent chronic depression among NKRYs.

AB The present study investigated the associations of media use of children, media use of mothers, and parent-child interactions with behavioral strengths and difficulties in children. Screen time of 553 2- to 9-year-old children and their mothers were indicated by the daily durations of their TV/games console/computer/mobile phone use. The amount of parent-child interaction was indicated by the frequencies of shared activities at home. Behavioral strengths and difficulties of children were investigated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Children whose mothers reported high screen times (>/= 5 h/day) were significantly more likely to show high screen times (>/= 2 h/day). High screen time of children was associated with more conduct problems, more symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention and less prosocial behavior. High screen time of mothers was associated with emotional problems, conduct problems, and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention. In contrast, a higher frequency of parent-child interactions was associated with fewer conduct problems, fewer peer-relationship problems, and more prosocial behavior of children. Children might use the media behavior of their mothers as a role model for their own media use. Furthermore, the findings suggest that media use of children and mothers and parent-child interaction contribute independently to behavioral strengths and difficulties of children.

AB Background: High prevalence rates of mental disorders and its impairment in affected children and adolescents indicate the necessity of prevention programs. Methods: The primary goal was to develop, implement, and evaluate a modularized prevention program with a focus on emotional competence that can be conducted by students (service learning concept). The sample consisted of 1,195 children (M = 11.5 years, SD = 2.42) with 53% boys, 38 teachers (M = 45.76 years, SD = 9.49), and 188 group leaders (M = 23.38 years, SD = 2.61). Acceptance rates, self-efficacy, stress management, emotion regulation, and the increase of knowledge in a pre-post design were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Results: Teachers, children, and students reported high acceptance rates. In all three groups, recommendation rates ranged from 82 to 93%. A t test for dependent samples showed a small effect for an increase of constructive-palliative emotion regulation (t(97) = 2.62, p = 0.025, d = 0.29). There were no significant effects in the other outcome measures. Conclusion: Results indicate a successful implementation of a modularized prevention program. The strength of the modularized conception of a prevention program is the naturalistic study design and good transferability into practice, at the cost of internal validity.

AB Objective: The first aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between childhood trauma and Internet addiction (IA) symptom severity. The second aim was to evaluate the mediator effects of dissociative experiences and emotion dysregulation on this relationship.
   Method: We conducted the study using an online survey with 920 university student participants. Participants were evaluated with the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
   Results: Compared with participants evidencing low IA risk (n=806, 87.6%), those with high IA risk (n=114, 12.4%) had a longer duration of daily Internet use and a higher rate of problems related to Internet use. The high IA risk group was connected to the Internet less through a smartphone and more through computer use. In addition, scale scores (DES, DERS and CTQ-28) were higher among the group with high IA risk. Scale scores were mildly to moderately correlated with each other. In linear regression analysis, childhood trauma (particularly emotional abuse and physical neglect) was related to severity of IA symptoms. Severity of dissociative experiences and emotion dysregulation mediated the childhood trauma-IA symptom relationship.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest relations between the severity of childhood trauma, particularly emotional abuse and physical neglect dimensions, and severity of IA symptoms among Turkish young adults. Severity of dissociative experiences and emotion dysregulation may also partially mediate this relationship.

AB Feldman et al. (Human Development, 36, 327-342, 1993) called for a new kind of psychology, a cultural cognitive developmental psychology. We critically consider their initial studies to discuss the scope of their program. In the spirit of this program we explore the development of scaffolding of narrative emotion regulation in adolescence. We present two co-narrations of sad events between mothers and their 12- and 18-year-old offspring to exemplify these mothers' age-sensitive strategies to scaffold adolescents' narrative emotion regulation. We identified three kinds of narrative arguments which mothers used for scaffolding and which are apparently acquired only in the course of adolescence: Embedding events in extended temporal, biographical contexts, relating events and reactions to individuals' enduring personalities, and re-appraising events by including more others', external, and hypothetical perspectives. They confirm developmental observations made by Feldman et al. (Human Development, 36, 327-342, 1993) and demonstrate their utility in the context of the development of emotion regulation.

TI Bruner and Beyond: a Commentary
SO INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE Bruner; Narrative; Meaning; Self
AB The philosophy of Bruner transcends traditional boundaries in the study of the human mind with a new kind of psychology, one that frees the thinking mind from its opposition to feelings and also from the limitations of being considered an 'inside-the-head' phenomenon. It is with active engagement with the outside world that a child develops its understanding. In this engagement with the outside world, the developmental construction of thought is actively created through the use of symbols. The cultural context, images, and languages a person experiences are thus considered to be formative in thinking. Opposing the notion of readiness, Bruner believed children to be capable of complex thought, and the dynamics of these developments were guided by meaning-making. The significance of meaning in Psychology was resurrected in his writing. Furthermore, the notion of narrative as constructive in facilitating the organisation and management of mental processes is invaluable. In this article, we bring a commentary on two articles, one that relates to the study of scaffolding of emotion regulation by parents of adolescents and the other on the narrative understanding of selfhood of individuals with autism.

AB Digital well-being emerged as a postmodern concept describing the overflowing daily input of information and social networking options. The theoretical literature frameworks related to digital skills are not specifically considering some particular abilities needed for coping with daily interactions' overwhelming and currently depict two sides of the digital well-being story: as a personal obtainable status through individual digital wellbeing abilities and skills, and on the other hand as a specificity common to a social community where values, norms, and aspirations bring valuable inputs to the safety, comfort, self-satisfaction along with socio-psychological fulfillment of group members. In order to investigate the interactions of the youth digital well-being, our team has implemented the project Hate's journey funded under Erasmus+. Our research team has designed a multiple specific sections online questionnaire addressing 206 youth from Turkey, Spain, Latvia, and Romania. We have used a SEM analysis approach with the purpose of providing model fit output about the consistency of the hypothesized mediation model: youth online duality, considered a correlate of digital well-being, mediates the relationship between the predictor helpfully perceived network and the outcome, emotional regulation. Consistent with previous research, our results support the hypothesis that youth online duality totally mediates the relationship between the helpfully perceived digital environment and youth digital emotional regulation. Conclusions and implications are discussed.

AB Rumination has been conceptualized as a stable, trait-level response style involving repetitive and passive focus on the symptoms of distress and the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms. This theoretical review examines developmental risk factors of ruminative response style, incorporating a developmental psychopathology perspective. A model integrating these developmental factors within a conceptual framework is proposed, wherein risk factors for distress (i.e., temperamental negative affectivity, stressful environments, parenting, and genetic vulnerability) lead to engagement in rumination. We propose that when rumination is well-practiced, it will consolidate into a trait-like response style, especially among adolescents who experience cognitive control deficits. Reciprocal relationships and moderators that may contribute to the formation of a ruminative response style are also included. To understand how these factors converge and influence the formation of ruminative response styles, we review patterns of stability and change in physical and cognitive development to demonstrate that individual differences in rumination may emerge and consolidate into enduring, trait-level response styles during early adolescence.

AB Stress appraisals including challenge and threat have been consistently studied since the publication of Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) influential stress model, as have cognitive and emotional resource depletion. However, no study to date has examined the effect of appraisal type on resource depletion - an area with implications for the conceptualization of stress and coping in research and clinical settings. The present study utilized novel stress tasks to induce varying levels of state anxiety and prompt challenge and/or threat appraisals from participants. After the task, participants were asked to rate their current levels of cognitive depletion and emotional exhaustion. Results of a path model analysis indicated that challenge appraisals are uniquely associated with cognitive depletion, whereas threat appraisals result in both cognitive depletion and emotional exhaustion. Findings further the conceptualizations of challenge and threat appraisals and highlight the importance of managing both cognitive and emotional resources when under threat.

AB How parents manifest symptoms of anxiety or depression may affect how children learn to modulate their own distress, thereby influencing the children's risk for developing an anxiety or mood disorder. Conversely, children's mental health symptoms may impact parents' experiences of negative emotions. Therefore, mental health symptoms can have bidirectional effects in parent-child relationships, particularly during moments of distress or frustration (e.g., when a parent or child makes a costly mistake). The present study used simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of parent-adolescent dyads to examine how brain activity when responding to each other's costly errors (i.e., dyadic error processing) may be associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression. While undergoing simultaneous fMRI scans, healthy dyads completed a task involving feigned errors that indicated their family member made a costly mistake. Inter-brain, random-effects multivariate modeling revealed that parents who exhibited decreased medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex activation when viewing their child's costly error response had children with more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Adolescents with increased anterior insula activation when viewing a costly error made by their parent had more anxious parents. These results reveal cross-brain associations between mental health symptomatology and brain activity during parent-child dyadic error processing.

AB Adolescence is a neuroplastic period for self-processing and emotion regulation transformations, that if derailed, are linked to persistent depression. Neural mechanisms of adolescent self-processing and emotion regulation ought to be targeted via new treatments, given moderate effectiveness of current interventions. Thus, we implemented a novel neurofeedback protocol in adolescents to test the engagement of circuits sub-serving self-processing and emotion regulation.
   Methods: Depressed (n = 34) and healthy (n = 19) adolescents underwent neurofeedback training using a novel task. They saw their happy face as a cue to recall positive memories and increased displayed amygdala and hippocampus activity. The control condition was counting-backwards while viewing another happy face. A self vs. other face recognition task was administered before and after neurofeedback training.
   Results: Adolescents showed higher frontotemporal activity during neurofeedback and higher amygdala and hippocampus and hippocampi activity in time series and region of interest analyses respectively. Before neurofeedback there was higher saliency network engagement for self-face recognition, but that network engagement was lower after neurofeedback. Depressed youth exhibited higher fusiform, inferior parietal lobule and cuneus activity during neurofeedback, but controls appeared to increase amygdala and hippocampus activity faster compared to depressed adolescents.
   Conclusions: Neurofeedback recruited frontotemporal cortices that support social cognition and emotion regulation. Amygdala and hippocampus engagement via neurofeedback appears to change limbic-frontotemporal networks during self-face recognition. A placebo group or condition and contrasting amygdala and hippocampus, hippocampi or right amygdala versus frontal loci of neurofeedback, e.g. dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, with longer duration of neurofeedback training will elucidate dosage and loci of neurofeedback in adolescents.

AB Background: Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis may manifest with complex behavioral, attentional, and emotional sequelae. The authors characterized higher level brain connectivity in adolescent nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients in response to emotional frustration. Methods: Surgically corrected patients older than 9 years with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis were age/sex/handedness matched to controls. Patients participated in a "go/no-go" task, structured as win/lose/recovery paradigms. BioImage Suite was used to analyze whole-brain intrinsic connectivity between tasks with cluster-corrected group-level t maps. A value of p < 0.05 was significant. Results: Seven unilateral coronal (average age, 12.2 years), six metopic (average age, 11.5 years), and controls were included. Unilateral coronal had worse emotional regulation scores on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function survey (p = 0.065) and performed poorly on the go/no-go task (p < 0.001). Metopic had four regions of interest, with the majority having decreased activity compared with controls, and few differences between tasks. Unilateral coronal patients had 11 regions of interest; the majority decreased during the win and lose conditions, but all increased during the recovery condition. Metopic patients had decreased blood oxygenation level- dependent signal in the posterior cingulate (p = 0.017) and middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.042). Unilateral coronal had decreased signal in the posterior cingulate (p = 0.023), middle temporal gyrus (p = 0.027), and thalamus (p = 0.033), but increased signal in the cuneus (p = 0.009) and cerebellum (p = 0.009). Right unilateral coronal, but not metopic/controls, had increased right brain activity in the caudate (p = 0.030), thalamus (p = 0.011), temporal lobe (p = 0.012), and cerebellum (p = 0.029). Conclusions: Unilateral coronal patients may have emotional dysregulation in response to frustration, whereas metopic patients may have attenuated emotional reactions. Evidence of right unilateral coronal brain laterality suggests that the area of suture fusion may contribute to the mechanism of dysfunction.

AB The MAP is an innovative receptive music therapy intervention derived from psychomusical relaxation methods that aims to foster the well-being and recovery of youths with mental health problems by providing them with an adaptive and effective music-assisted means to regulate their mood states. In this quasi-experimental pilot study, we assessed the mood-enhancing potential of participation in MAP sessions delivered by a music therapist in an in-patient mental health facility for children and adolescents. Using short standardized self-reported questionnaires, 20 participants aged 9-17 years old (M = 14, SD = 2.4), mainly girls (13 = 65%), rated their affective state immediately before and after two to four MAP sessions and a similar number of regular unit activity sessions used as comparison. This created a 2 x 2 (Time x Condition) single-group within-individual design. We analyzed pre-post session changes in affect using multilevel mixed models and found participation in MAP sessions to be associated with systematic reductions in self-reported general negative affect and state anxiety. These variations were of modest-to-large magnitude and significantly greater than those associated to participation in regular unit activities. While only a first step towards the validation of the MAP as an effective intervention to foster more adaptive and effective day-to-day mood regulation in youths with mental health problems, this study supports its specific potential to alleviate negative affects and provides a rare demonstration of the putative benefits of music therapy in a pediatric mental health inpatient context.

AB Parenting stress and children's behavior problems have frequently been linked. with bidirectional relations spanning from early childhood through adolescence. However, this association has not been well studied in infancy or toddlerhood, and prospective mediators have not been thoroughly explored. This prospective, longitudinal study utilized two transactional models to examine bidirectional relations between parenting stress and children's behavior problems and explore perceived family conflict and parental supportiveness as potential mediators. Data were taken from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study, where 835 parent-child dyads were assessed at 1, 2, and 3 years. Parenting stress and behavior problems were measured at all 3 time points, while family conflict and observed parental supportiveness were measured at ages 2 and 3. Results indicated that parenting stress and children's behavior problems were relatively stable over time and had bidirectional or cross-lagged associations. Family conflict mediated the relation between children's behavior problems at age 1 and parenting stress at age 3. while parental supportiveness mediated the relation between parenting stress at age I and behavior problems at age 3, suggesting both "child" and "parent" effects that function through two different mechanisms. These findings suggest that early prevention programs should focus on both children's behavior and parenting stress in the first year and work to reduce family conflict and increase parental supportiveness in order to disrupt this negative cycle.

AB BACKGROUND: Disruptive behaviors are prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and often cause substantial impairments. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of disruptive behaviors remain poorly understood in ASD. In children without ASD, disruptive behavior is associated with amygdala hyperactivity and reduced connectivity with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). This study examined amygdala reactivity and connectivity in children with ASD with and without co-occurring disruptive behavior disorders. We also investigated differential contributions of externalizing behaviors and callous-unemotional traits to variance in amygdala connectivity and reactivity.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved behavioral assessments and neuroimaging in three groups of children 8 to 16 years of age: 18 children had ASD and disruptive behavior, 20 children had ASD without disruptive behavior, and 19 children were typically developing control participants matched for age, gender, and IQ. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants completed an emotion perception task of fearful versus calm faces. Task-specific changes in amygdala reactivity and connectivity were examined using whole-brain, psychophysiological interaction, and multiple regression analyses.
   RESULTS: Children with ASD and disruptive behavior showed reduced amygdala-vlPFC connectivity compared with children with ASD without disruptive behavior. Externalizing behaviors and callous-unemotional traits were associated with amygdala reactivity to fearful faces in children with ASD after controlling for suppressor effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reduced amygdala-vlPFC connectivity during fear processing may differentiate children with ASD and disruptive behavior from children with ASD without disruptive behavior. The presence of callous-unemotional traits may have implications for identifying differential patterns of amygdala activity associated with increased risk of aggression in ASD. These findings suggest a neural mechanism of emotion dysregulation associated with disruptive behavior in children with ASD.

AB Psychological resilience of Chinese left-behind children (LBC) remains under-studied. In this cross-sectional survey, we intended to analyze factors associated with resilience in a large group of LBC. One-stage random cluster sampling was used to select 2898 LBC aged between 10 and 17 years in Yunnan province of southwestern China. Face-to-face interview was used to collect relevant information from the participants. Resilience was measured by the Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents (RSCA). Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that having a better educated mother, feeling closer to people living in the same residence, and having more close friends were associated with higher psychological resilience in LBC. LBC who felt less close to people living in the same residence were consistently lower in all five dimensions of resilience. Compared with LBC with 2 or less close friends, LBC with more close friends had significantly greater resilience in goal concentration, family support, and interpersonal assistance. Higher mother's education level was related to higher resilience in emotion regulation, family support, and interpersonal assistance. Our findings suggest that dimension-specific intervention measures should be developed and implemented to improve psychological resilience of LBC.

AB Racial discrimination has detrimental effects on ethnic minority adolescents' development. Guided by the integrative model of minority children's competencies and the bioecological model, the current study examined how family and peer cultural socialization independently and conjointly buffered the detrimental effects of discrimination on ethnic minority adolescents' academic and socio emotional adjustment. Using short-term longitudinal data from 245 eighth graders (87% Latinx, 51% female), results suggested that the moderating roles of cultural socialisation operated differently for academic and socioemotional outcomes. Specifically, the three-way interaction results indicated that family and peer cultural socializations appeared to be protective for adolescents' school engagement in the face of discrimination. The significant two-way interaction results revealed that both peer and family cultural socialisation tended to be protective-reactive for socioemotional outcomes, wherein the benefits of cultural socialisation were realised under low-risk but not high-risk conditions for depressive symptoms. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of the moderating roles of cultural socialisation in the links between discrimination and adolescents' well-being, and it highlights the importance of considering cultural socialisation from multiple contexts in examining ethnic minority adolescents' adjustment.

AB This pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of delivering a new cognitive behavioural intervention package 'Emotion-Based Social Skills Training (EBSST) for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Mild Intellectual Disability (ASD + MID)' in schools. Fourteen school counsellors nominated 75 children (aged 7-13 years) with ASD + MID to receive 16 sessions of EBSST in groups of 3-8 children in their schools. Parent and teacher pre-post ratings of emotional competence (Emotions Development Questionnaire), social skills (Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales) and mental health (Developmental Behaviour Checklist) were collected. Forty-three children received 16 sessions of EBSST and 32 children were allocated to the 9-month waitlist control group. Teachers and parents also received six EBSST training sessions in separate groups at school. Significant improvements in parent and teacher ratings of emotional competence were found at posttreatment among children in the EBSST group relative to controls; however, the results were not significant after the Bonferroni adjustment. Small to medium effect sizes were found. No difference in untrained social skills or mental health was observed. This study provides preliminary support for the utility of EBSST in teaching emotional competence skills for children with ASD + MID in schools and provides valuable pilot data for future research.

AB Aims: A decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures among obese (OB) and overweight (OW) children has been shown in several studies, but knowledge about the variables affecting HRQOL impairments is missing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between HRQOL and sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, metabolic parameters, mental symptoms and parental attitudes in a sample of OB/OW children.
   Methods: Eighty-six OB/OW children, aged between 9 and 17 years, participated in the study. We performed sociodemographic questioning, anthropometric examinations and laboratory evaluations of the participants. HRQOL was assessed using the Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory (PedsQL), and levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED) questionnaire and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), respectively. Parental attitudes were assessed with the Parental Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) questionnaire.
   Results: A statistically significant relationship was found between total scores of CDI and SCARED answered by children and the total and subscale scores of PedsQL. Scores of total quality of life subscale, physical functionality and emotional functionality subscales were significantly lower in children with a family history of mental illness. No relationship was found between PedsQL subscales, anthropometric and metabolic parameters.
   Conclusions: Emotional problems and parental psychological distress are important factors in models of HRQOL in the OB/OW pediatric population.

AB The current cross-sectional study examined the relationship between affiliate stigma and externalizing and internalizing problems by investigating the role of family cohesion among adolescents having a parent with serious mental illness (SMI). One hundred sixty-four adolescents were recruited from two community mental health centers. Family cohesion, affiliate stigma, and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed. A significant relationship was found between adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems and family cohesion (r = -0.462, p < 0.01 and r = - 0.534, p < 0.001, respectively) and affiliate stigma (r = 0.512, p < 0.01 and r = 0.656, p < 0.001, respectively). Family cohesion partially mediated the relation between affiliate stigma and externalizing problems (Z = -4.97, p < 0.001) and fully mediated the relation between affiliate stigma and internalizing problems (Z = -5.18, p < 0.001). The current study highlights the need for effective interventions aimed at families to support parents with SMI in their parenting role and enhance family cohesion.

AB Background Although emotion is central to most models of children's well-being, few studies have looked at how well-being is related to the ways in which children regulate their emotions. Aims The aim of this study was to examine the associations among children's emotion regulation strategy choice and their emotional expression, behaviour, and well-being. The study also investigated whether contextual factors influenced the emotion regulation strategies children chose to use. Sample Participants (N = 33) were selected from four Year 5/6 composite classrooms situated in low-socioeconomic urban communities in New Zealand. Method Questionnaires were used to measure children's well-being and teacher-reported emotional and behavioural problems. Emotional expression and emotion regulation strategies were measured through video-recorded observations in the classroom. A total of 1,184 instances of emotion regulation strategy use were coded using a framework based on Gross' process model of emotion regulation. Results The findings highlight the complexity of the relations among emotion regulation, emotion expression, and well-being. Some strategies, such as Cognitive Reappraisal, were effective at upregulating negative emotion in the short term, yet not strongly associated with well-being. Others, such as Situation Modification: Physical, were positively associated with well-being, yet not with an immediate change in a child's emotional experience. The findings also suggest children flexibly use different strategies in relation to different contextual demands. Conclusion These findings may be used to guide future intervention efforts which target emotion regulation strategy use as well as those which focus on teachers' support of children during emotionally challenging situations.

AB Background Friendships have been linked to mental health and school attainment in children. The effects of friendlessness and friendship quality have been well researched, but less is known about the role of friendship stability (i.e., maintaining the same friend over time), an aspect of friendship which is often interrupted by the transition between phases of schooling. Many children report concerns about the secondary school transition which introduces a number of new social and academic challenges for children. Aims To explore rates of friendship stability and whether maintaining a stable best friend across the primary to secondary school transition provided benefits to children's adjustment during this period. Sample Data were from 593 children (M age = 11 years 2 months). Methods This study used longitudinal data from children transitioning into 10 UK secondary schools and explored the association between self-reported friendship stability and three outcomes: academic attainment, emotional problems and conduct problems. Analyses controlled for friendship quality and pre-transition psychological adjustment or attainment as appropriate. Results Rates of friendship stability were relatively low during this period. Children who kept the same best friend had higher academic attainment and lower levels of conduct problems. Exploratory analyses indicated that secondary school policies that group children based on friendships may support friendship stability. Conclusions Helping maintain children's best friendships during the transition to secondary school may contribute to higher academic performance and better mental health.

AB This study examined the concurrent associations linking youths' parasympathetic nervous system activity, specifically baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSAR; vagal withdrawal), with youth depression risk in a community sample of young adolescents. Youth gender was examined as a moderator of associations. Participants included 100 youth (53% boys; M age = 11.05 years, SD = 0.33; 43% ethnic minorities), along with their mothers and teachers. Youth and mothers participated in a laboratory protocol involving a peer problem-solving conversation, during which youths' physiological activity was measured. Youth reported on their depressive symptoms. Teachers reported on youth depression risk via internalizing symptoms and emotion regulation (e.g., emotion lability/negativity). Results from regression analyses revealed that youths' vagal withdrawal during the mother-youth peer problem conversation was associated with lower youth-reported depressive symptoms. Further, gender moderated the associations linking youth baseline RSA and RSAR with youth depression risk. Specifically, among girls but not boys, higher baseline RSA was associated with lower depressive symptoms and emotion lability/negativity, and higher RSAR (i.e., vagal withdrawal) was linked with lower internalizing symptoms. Findings contribute to the relatively small literature linking youth parasympathetic functioning with depression risk, and point to specific implications for girls.

AB Sleep-related problems (SRPs) among adolescents are a growing concern. Theory and research suggest that emotional arousal may have cyclical relation with SRPs, but whether emotional dysregulation plays a role is not clear. We investigated associations between two physiological indices of emotion regulation (video baseline heart rate variability and change in heart rate variability to a stressor) and SRPs in a sample of 80 adolescents (ages 11-17 years; 51% female; 37.5% African American). The findings showed a negative relation between video baseline heart rate variability and SRPs, controlling for non-sleep-related anxiety disorder symptoms (beta = -0.29) and general manifest anxiety (beta = -0.25). We found no relation between change in heart rate variability to a stressor and SRPs when non-sleep-related anxious arousal was controlled. If replicated, findings illustrate the importance of physiological regulation of emotion influencing (or influenced by) SRPs during adolescence.

AB Adolescence is a critical period for the development of physiological emotion regulatory systems. While stressful life experiences are known to inhibit adaptive regulation, less is known about how parental socialization of emotion regulation may affect this relation. We examined the effect of stressful life experiences on changes in the resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) levels of 107 (M-age = 12.84, SD = 0.85) young adolescents over a year, moderated by supportive parental responses to negative emotions. The significant interaction (B = 0.02, p = 0.04) indicated that young adolescents who experienced low levels of supportive parenting in the context of high levels of stressful life experiences showed significant decreases in resting RSA over the year, while adolescents who experienced high levels of supportive parenting showed minimal decreases in RSA. Thus, more supportive parenting significantly compensated for the effect of greater stressful life experiences on changes in resting RSA over time.

AB Adolescents learn about emotions through interacting with parents and friends, though there is limited longitudinal research on this topic. This study examined longitudinal patterns in parent and friend emotion socialization and adolescent emotion regulation. Eighty-seven adolescents reported on parent and friend emotion socialization. Parents reported on adolescent emotion regulation. Parents' responses were stable over time and across gender. Friends of girls reciprocated negative emotions more and were less punitive over time, whereas friends of boys increased in comforting and decreased in neglect of negative emotions. Parents and friends evidenced unique effects on adolescent emotion regulation, and the effect of friend socialization responses differed for girls and boys. Future research should examine combinatory influences of multiple socializers on adolescent adjustment.

AB Adaptive mother-adolescent conflict interactions are characterized by the ability to move from negative to positive emotions. The current micro-observational study investigated how mothers and adolescents make transitions between positive, neutral and negative emotions and whether these transitions depend on maternal internalizing problems. We used three annual waves of conflict interaction observations among 102 mother-adolescent dyads. Mothers were more likely than adolescents to initiate positivity after negativity whereas adolescents were more likely than mothers to reciprocate negativity. Mothers high and low in internalizing problems were equally likely to drive transitions toward positivity. Our study indicates that an active role of mothers in regulating negativity toward positivity is desirable because adolescents are likely to maintain dysfunctional interaction patterns of rigid negativity.

AB Irritability is an important dimension of psychopathology that spans multiple clinical diagnostic categories, yet its relationship to patterns of brain development remains sparsely explored. Here, we examined how transdiagnostic symptoms of irritability relate to the development of structural brain networks. All participants (n = 137, 83 females) completed structural brain imaging with 3 Tesla MRI at two timepoints (mean age at follow-up: 21.1 years, mean inter-scan interval: 5.2 years). Irritability at follow-up was assessed using the Affective Reactivity Index, and cortical thickness was quantified using Advanced Normalization Tools software. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, a multivariate analysis technique. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with irritability at follow-up were evaluated using generalized additive models with penalized splines. The False Discovery Rate (q < 0.05) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data revealed that 11 of the 24 covariance networks were associated with irritability, with higher levels of irritability being associated with thinner cortex. Longitudinal analyses further revealed that accelerated cortical thinning within nine networks was related to irritability at follow-up. Effects were particularly prominent in brain regions implicated in emotion regulation, including the orbitofrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal cortex. Collectively, these findings suggest that irritability is associated with widespread reductions in cortical thickness and accelerated cortical thinning, particularly within the frontal and temporal cortex. Aberrant structural maturation of regions important for emotional regulation may in part underlie symptoms of irritability.

AB Risk for behavioral/emotional problems in adolescence is a significant predictor of negative student outcomes, including lower academic achievement and future disciplinary problems. Latinx students are often overrepresented in school disciplinary practices, highlighting the need for further research specifically within this population. Based on the framework of resilience, students' relationships with teachers may serve as protective factors against behavioral problems for those who are at elevated levels of risk for problematic outcomes. The current study examined associations and interactions among risk for behavioral/emotional problems, office disciplinary referrals (ODRs), and teacher caring within a sample of 1151 predominantly Latinx middle school students. Higher levels of behavioral/emotional risk and lower levels of teacher caring predicted more ODRs, as expected. An interaction between behavioral/emotional risk and teacher caring suggested that the effect of teacher caring was even more pronounced for students who did not present with elevated levels of behavioral/emotional risk; students with normal levels of risk who reported higher levels of teacher caring received significantly fewer ODRs than those students with normal risk who reported lower levels of teacher caring. Implications for practitioners are discussed, with emphasis placed on the importance of culturally responsive practices.

AB ObjectivesLittle is known about factors that contribute to conflict between parents and adolescents with ADHD. The current study examines the frequency and intensity of arguments between adolescents with ADHD and their parents with attention to situational triggers and adolescent and parent characteristics that predict conflict.MethodAdolescents and parents (N=128) completed a battery of rating scales at baseline intake into a randomized clinical trial.ResultsThe most frequent and clinically significant argument topics identified by parent were homework problems, personal hygiene, and bedtime. Similarly, homework problems were rated by parents as the most intense sources of arguments. Adolescents with ADHD who displayed higher comorbid depressive or aggressive symptoms had the most frequent arguments with their parents.ConclusionsIntervention and prevention programs targeting conflict between teens with ADHD and their parents might consider concurrent treatment of argument sources (i.e., disorganization, homework problems). Comorbid mood and behavior problems should also be addressed.

AB Objectives Although studies support a direct association between parent and child emotion regulation, little work has considered potential mechanisms, such as family context. For example, parents who have difficulty regulating their emotions may be more likely to adopt an authoritarian parenting style, especially under high family chronic stress, and this parenting style may then influence children's development of emotion regulation. The current study examined authoritarian parenting style as a potential mechanism of the intergenerational transmission of emotion regulation. We also examined how maternal emotion regulation and family chronic stress interact to influence parenting behaviors. Methods A total of 218 mother-adolescent dyads (M age = 15.5 years, 55% female) were recruited from the community and assessed using a mix of self-report measures of emotion dysregulation and parenting style, and interview-based measures of family chronic stress. Results Results showed maternal emotion dysregulation predicted authoritarian parenting style that, in turn, predicted adolescent emotion dysregulation, with a significant indirect effect. Family chronic stress strengthened the association between maternal emotion dysregulation and authoritarian parenting style, such that the indirect effect of maternal emotion regulation on adolescent emotion regulation via authoritarian parenting style was stronger at high levels of chronic stress. Conclusions Results suggest that authoritarian parenting style and family chronic stress serve as important factors in the intergenerational transmission of emotion regulation.

AB Contemporary models emphasize linkages between malleable positive psychological orientations and enhanced quality of life. As such, it is important to consider if these positive orientations provide unique explanatory power beyond the long-established relations between quality of life and within-person, less malleable personality traits. This study contributed to the literature by examining the relations among adolescents' personality traits, positive psychology orientations, and self-reported quality of life indicators. These relations were further examined by considering the mediating effects of the important contextual influences of school connectedness. Self-report responses of 1867 California high school students to an 88-item schoolwide online survey that included the Big Five Inventory-10 (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness), the Social Emotional Health Survey-Secondary (Belief in Self, Belief in Others, Emotional Competence, and Engaged Living), the School Connectedness Scale, the Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale, and the Social Emotional Distress Scale-Secondary were used to examine relations. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that after controlling for demographic variables (Block 1: sex, grade, and ethnicity) the personality traits (Block 2) were, as expected, significantly associated with life satisfaction and emotional distress. Supporting study hypotheses, the inclusion of positive psychological orientations (Block 3) explained significantly more variance of students' life satisfaction (oR(2) = 26%) and emotional distress (oR(2) = 5%). Mediation analyses using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) found that only positive psychological orientations had significant indirect relations with quality of life through school connectedness. Implications and future research and practice are discussed.

AB Concurrent associations between parenting behaviors and youth depression are well established. A smaller body of work has demonstrated longitudinal associations between aspects of parenting and youth risk for depression; however, this limited longitudinal work has predominantly relied upon self- and parent-report questionnaire measures and is thus affected by biases related to retrospective recall and common method variance. The present study used behavioral observation measures of parenting and clinical interview measures of youth depression to examine prospective relationships between observed parental support, responsiveness, criticism, and conflict and youths' onset of a depressive episode in a 3-year longitudinal design. Participants included 585 community youth age 8-16 (M = 11.92, SD = 2.39, 56.6% female) and a participating caregiver. Parental behavior was coded by trained observers in the context of a 5-min conflict resolution discussion at the baseline assessment. Youth onset of depression was subsequently assessed every 6 months for a period of 3 years using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children (KSADS) to ascertain whether youth experienced onset of depressive episode over the follow-up. Logistic regression analyses indicated that greater parental conflict at baseline predicted higher odds of youth experiencing a depressive onset across the 3-year follow up period, even after controlling for youth and caregiver history of depression at baseline. Findings suggest that parental conflict is particularly influential in youth vulnerability to depression.

AB Bullying and peer victimization are stressful experiences for youth, and are associated with increased risk for psychopathology. Physiological differences in the body's stress response system may help us to understand vulnerability for depressive symptoms among youth involved with bullying. The current study examined both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity using skin conductance (SCL) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at a neutral baseline and during Cyberball, a stressful social exclusion paradigm. Participants consisted of 175 youth in grades 6-11 (mean age 13.6 years, 51% girls). Multilevel modeling was used to examine changes in both positive and negative affect, and physiological stress reactivity over time. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between bullying, victimization, and RSA on depressive symptoms. Peer victimization was negatively associated with resting RSA. Bullying others was negatively associated with SCL during Cyberball. Additionally, RSA reactivity during acute stress moderated the link between victimization and depressive symptoms. Victimization was more strongly associated with depressive symptoms when youth also demonstrated blunted RSA reactivity. These results suggest that both victimized youth and those who bully others have differences in their autonomic responses to acute stress. Individual differences in stress physiology may help us to understand vulnerability and resilience to depressive symptoms in the context of bullying and victimization.

AB The current cross-sectional study examined whether internalizing (i.e. anxiety and depressive) symptoms and/or emotion dysregulation moderated the association between witnessed community violence and aggressive behavior. Participants were 180 predominantly African American adolescents (62% girls; M age = 15.87 years, SD = 1.19 years) from a high school located in an urban community in the United States. Approximately 95% of adolescents reported having witnessed at least one violent act during their lifetimes, with many endorsing repeated exposure to severe acts of community violence. Results indicated that emotion dysregulation exacerbated the association between witnessed community violence and aggression. A quadratic effect of anxiety symptoms also moderated this association, such that witnessed community violence was linked to aggression at low and high, but not moderate, levels of anxiety symptoms. In contrast, a quadratic effect of depressive symptoms was uniquely related to aggression, regardless of witnessed community violence. Directions for future research and implications for practice are reviewed.

AB Recent research demands a multi-informant and multi-factorial assessment of preschool-age psychopathology. Based on a tripartite model, we tested the relationship between emotional and social competence and their contribution to externalizing and internalizing symptoms in a preschool-age community sample (N = 117, M = 4.67 years, SD = 2.75 months). We assessed teachers' (N = 109) and parents' (N = 77) perspective using the Strengths-and-Difficulties-Questionnaire and children's perspective using the Berkeley-Puppet-Interview and a standardized emotional-competence-test (MeKKi). We found externalizing symptoms being negatively related to prosocial behavior in teachers' and parents' reports and positively related to social initiative in teachers' reports. In teachers' reports only, a mediation effect of emotional competence via social competence on externalizing symptoms was shown. Children, but not caregivers, reported internalizing symptoms being positively related to prosocial behavior. These results highlight the importance of multiple informants and especially of children's self-perception in preschool-age psychopathology.

AB Resilience is associated with the internal capacity for the regulation of unpleasant emotions in the face of adversity. These self-regulatory processes, linked with both explicit and implicit emotion regulation systems, have wide ranging implications for overall psychological health. Child psychotherapy can be conceptualized as helping children adapt more effectively to the external environment and develop a more comfortable sense of self as a result of improved emotion regulation and, thus, greater resilience. Most available treatments for youth promote resilience by addressing the explicit emotion regulation system. These treatments include helping parents improve their parenting skills or helping youth modify dysfunctional thinking patterns. In these treatments there is less consideration of the key role of implicit emotion regulation in the enhancement of resilience. The psychodynamic construct of defense mechanisms offers an observable and measurable manifestation of implicit emotion regulation. Thus, addressing the nature of a child's maladaptive defense mechanisms in the clinical situation can strengthen the implicit emotion regulation system without explicitly instructing the parent or the child to act in a more pro-social manner. This paper utilizes a Regulation Focused Psychotherapy for Children (RFP-C) model to describe how iterative, systematic interpretation of children's maladaptive defense mechanisms can target the implicit emotion regulation system. This intervention aims to improve the capacity for self-regulation, increase the flexibility of responses to the environment, promote proactivity towards change, and improve interpersonal relatedness. As a result of increases in these adaptive implicit emotion regulation capacities, there is a resultant increase in resilience, especially for children who respond to stressful events with externalizing behaviors. A brief clinical illustration is provided.

AB Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has significant negative impacts on a child's development as well as their family's social, emotional, and economic wellbeing. In an effort to better understand the aeitology of ASD and therefore provide interventions for children on the autism spectrum, various factors have been taken into consideration, one of which is emotion regulation (ER) ability. This paper sought to synthesize the current research on ER in children, specifically young children (aged 12-72 months), with ASD to better understand the association between ASD and ER in young children.
   Method: Research databases and reference lists of relevant papers were searched systematically for articles on ASD and ER in young children. Fifteen articles were identified that reported on ER in children with ASD and had participants that fell within the 12-72 month age range. These articles were systematically reviewed.
   Results: Children with ASD were found to have a different repertoire of ER strategies and rely more on others to regulate their emotions than their typically developing peers; ASD symptom severity and executive functioning ability were associated with ER abilities; and treatments incorporating both parents and children were found to improve ER abilities in children.
   Conclusions: Research on ER in young children with ASD is in its infancy with many of the studies reviewed being preliminary in nature. Furthermore, the majority of studies include participants that encompass a broad age range, making it difficult to distinguish the nature and occurrence of ER in toddlers and preschoolers with ASD from ER in older children and adolescence with ASD. Nonetheless, the review provides some insight into the nature of ER in young children with ASD and highlights important directions for future research.

AB Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience depression and anxiety at higher rates than typically developing (TD) youth. The current study examined how restricted and repetitive behaviors or interests (RRBs) may be related to symptoms of depression and anxiety. Participants included 35 children with ASD (29 male, 6 female) between 3 and 14 years. Youth who met clinical cut-off for depression and anxiety demonstrated increased self-injurious behavior compared to peers with ASD who did not meet clinical cut-off. These findings might suggest that self-injurious behaviors may serve as behavioral indicators of heightened negative affect. This could have important implications for assessment of symptoms of anxiety and depression in this population, which is especially critical given that children with ASD often experience language delays and difficulties.

AB Perseverative cognitions-rumination and worry-can contribute to mental and somatic health problems in adolescence. Girls usually report stronger rumination or worry than boys even in earlier years across the development age spectrum. Our aim was to test the gender invariance and psychometric properties of the Nonproductive Thoughts Questionnaire for Children (NPTQ-C). Study 1 involved 1,572 students (mean age = 15.39 years, SD = 2.26; 49% boy) recruited representatively from local schools. We applied confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the measurement model of perseverative cognitions. The gender invariance of the measurement model and the convergent validity were analyzed as well with CFA with covariates model. The original one-factor structure of NPTQ-C was supported in our adolescent sample. Gender invariance was also confirmed. The NPTQ-C indicated high convergent validity: showing positive correlations with emotional instability and emotional symptoms. In Study 2 (385 students; mean age = 16.05; SD = 1.23; 34% boy), we tested the construct validity of NPTQ-C. The applied CFA with covariates model supported the construct validity. In summary, NPTQ-C proved to be a good instrument for measuring ruminative and worrying thoughts of adolescents, which reliably measures perseverative cognitions across genders.

AB Background Among adolescent girls, anorexia nervosa (AN) and major depression (MD) are common and often comorbid mental health problems. Both disorders are characterised by difficulties in recognising and verbalising (alexithymia) as well as regulating one's emotions, but research in adolescent patients is scarce and little is known about the relation between alexithymia and difficulties in emotion regulation. The aims of this study were to investigate alexithymia and emotion regulation skills in adolescents with AN, adolescents with MD, and healthy adolescents, and to determine whether alexithymia functions as a predictor for emotion regulation skills. Methods Emotion regulation strategies, alexithymia, and depressive symptoms were assessed by questionnaire measures in 12-18 year old girls with AN (n = 26), girls with MD (n = 25), and healthy girls (n = 35). Groups were compared with respect to the these variables and multiple regression analyses were calculated separately for adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in order to examine if alexithymia predicted emotion regulation over and above age and depressive symptoms. Results Girls with AN or MD both reported using adaptive emotion regulation strategies less frequently and maladaptive emotion regulation skills more frequently as well as higher levels of alexithymia compared to healthy girls. Alexithymia positively predicted maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, while depressive symptoms negatively predicted adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Conclusions The results suggest that different mechanisms may underlie the lack of adaptive and the surplus of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in adolescent psychiatric patients.

AB This study examined the hypothesis that parent socialization of coping (SOC) would have a longitudinal relation with child emotion regulation abilities. Participants included a sample of 256 parents of 5- to 12-year-old children (child M age = 8.36, SD = 2.03, 54.7% male; parent M age = 34.49, SD = 6.20, 59% female). Data on demographic information, parenting behaviors, and child emotion regulation abilities were collected via online questionnaires at baseline and 12 months. Results from longitudinal structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses suggested that parent SOC, measured at baseline, predicted child adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation, measured 12 months later. More specifically, parental engagement coping suggestions predicted child's adaptive emotion regulation, whereas parental disengagement coping suggestions predicted child's maladaptive emotion regulation. Further, child gender emerged as a moderator in the longitudinal association between socialization of engagement coping and child adaptive emotion regulation: Whereas this association was small and marginally significant for girls, it was large and statistically significant for boys. Results highlight the importance of parent SOC as potentially contributing to emotion regulation abilities of 5- to 12-year-olds.

AB Emotional nonacceptance is associated with greater posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among trauma-exposed youth. Similarly, the use of distraction as a coping strategy is associated with greater PTSD symptoms, yet synergistic relations between emotional nonacceptance and distraction coping among trauma-exposed youth have not been examined. The present study examined associations and interactive effects of emotional nonacceptance and distraction coping in relation to PTSD symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents. Participants included 50 adolescents (52.0% female; M-age = 15.1 years, SD = .51; 44% White) receiving acute psychiatric care at an inpatient hospital. All participants reported experiencing at least one traumatic event and completed measures of emotion dysregulation, coping strategies, and PTSD symptoms. Analyses revealed a significant interaction between emotional nonacceptance and distraction coping in relation to PTSD symptoms ( increment R-2 = 0.05; B = 0.60, SE = 0.29; t = 2.06, p = 0.045; 95% CI [0.12, 1.18]). PTSD symptoms were most severe among youth who reported higher levels of emotional nonacceptance and greater use of distraction as a coping strategy. Difficulties accepting negative emotions, coupled with greater use of distraction as a coping mechanism, were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms. The importance of teaching adaptive coping mechanisms to trauma-exposed youth who experience difficulties accepting negative emotions is discussed.

AB A history of childhood trauma has been found to have a robust influence on juvenile delinquency, and evidence suggests that childhood sexual abuse is particularly common among female youth involved in the juvenile justice system. The current study sought to investigate impulsivity as a potential mediator of the relationship between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and juvenile incarceration amongst a community sample of low-income, urban, African American adult women. Although impulsivity has been studied among justice-involved youth, few studies have examined the influence of impulsivity within the relationship between CSA and juvenile incarceration and no known studies have explored their relationship in community populations of African American women with histories of juvenile incarceration. Results revealed that impulsivity mediated the relationship between CSA and previous juvenile incarceration. As an exploratory analysis, overall emotion dysregulation as well as other facets of emotion dysregulation did not serve as significant mediators in this relationship. These findings suggest that difficulties in impulse control may be one mechanism through which childhood sexual abuse increases risk for juvenile justice system involvement among African American women.

AB Background: Binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity in adolescents is associated with variations in social cognition and emotion regulation. The current study aimed to evaluate the Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities in adolescents with obesity with and without BED and to examine how they related to emotional and psychopathologic evaluations. Methods: One hundred twenty-eight adolescents comprising 32 non-BED adolescents with obesity, 32 adolescents with BED and obesity, and 64 healthy controls (HC) completed a battery of tests to analyze their social cognition and clinical psychopathologic profile. Results: Patients with BED and non-BED patients with obesity showed poorer performance in emotional regulation and social cognition tasks compared with normal-weight adolescents without BED. Various correlations were evident between depression, emotional regulation problems, and eating attitudes and patterns. Conclusions: Patients with BED and non-BED adolescents with obesity showed a decline in ToM tasks, independent of their clinical psychopathological profile. Consistent with other studies, this is the first study to assess both social cognition and emotion regulation skills in adolescents with BED and obesity.

AB Recent conceptualisations of resilience have advanced the notion that it is a dynamic and multifaceted construct. However, its adaptive components, especially those forged by adversity, have not been fully realised, and its neurobiological and psychosocial underpinnings are yet to be meaningfully integrated. In part, this is because a developmental perspective is often neglected in the formulation of resilience. In this review, we consider the findings of resilience research, with a specific emphasis on the developmental period of adolescence. To bridge the gaps in our current understanding, we propose a model of resilience that is predicated on experiencing adversity. Specifically, our model provides a sophisticated insight into the components of resilience, which, together with intrinsic features, involves facilitation of, and skill acquisition via strengthening processes we term tempering and fortification. The model also points to the potential trajectories of adversity-driven resilience and forms the basis of a framework that allows for individual variance in resilience, and the identification of both neurobiological and psychosocial targets for prevention and therapeutic interventions.

AB Objectives Current research suggests significant disruptions in functional brain networks in individuals with mood disorder, and in those at familial risk. Studies of structural brain networks provide important insights into synchronized maturational change but have received less attention. We aimed to investigate developmental relationships of large-scale brain networks in mood disorder using structural covariance (SC) analyses. Methods We conducted SC analysis of baseline structural imaging data from 121 at the time of scanning unaffected high risk (HR) individuals (29 later developed mood disorder after a median time of 4.95 years), and 89 healthy controls (C-well) with no familial risk from the Scottish Bipolar Family Study (age 15-27, 64% female). Voxel-wise analyses of covariance were conducted to compare the associations between each seed region in visual, auditory, motor, speech, semantic, executive-control, salience and default-mode networks and the whole brain signal. SC maps were compared for (a) HR(all) versus C-well individuals, and (b) between those who remained well (HR-well), versus those who subsequently developed mood disorder (HR-MD), and C-well. Results There were no significant differences between HR(all) and C-well individuals. On splitting the HR group based on subsequent clinical outcome, the HR-MD group however displayed greater baseline SC in the salience and executive-control network, and HR-well individuals showed less SC in the salience network, compared to C-well, respectively (P < .001). Conclusions These findings indicate differences in network-level inter-regional relationships, especially within the salience network, which precede onset of mood disorder in those at familial risk.

AB Background Few studies have explored the well-being of fathers of children with intellectual disability (ID), despite the significant role that they play in their children's lives. The current study compared fathers of children with and without a child with ID on measures of psychological well-being (life satisfaction, work-family balance and general health) and dimensions of parenting (parenting self-efficacy and parent-child closeness) and then examined whether the presence of a child with ID in the family was a significant predictor of paternal well-being when controlling for a number of father (age, education, employment and residency), child (ID status, gender, behavioural and emotional problems) and family (income poverty and number of children in the household) variables. Methods Data were drawn from the third wave of the Millennium Cohort Study, a UK population-representative and cohort study, where the cohort child was 5 years of age; 256 fathers were identified as having a child with ID, with data available for 10 187 fathers without a child with ID. Fathers were compared on the four well-being and parenting outcomes and then multiple regression models were conducted to explore associations between these outcomes and variables identified as potential correlates of well-being. Results Initial group comparisons showed that there were differences in the well-being of fathers, with fathers of children with ID reporting poorer life satisfaction and general health. However, these differences were small. Regression analyses showed that child behavioural and emotional problems, living in income poverty and paternal employment were more important than disability status in predicting fathers' well-being. Conclusions These works add to the limited amount of research on fathers using population-representative data. The current findings are consistent with rejecting a general simplistic and negative narrative that raising a child with ID puts fathers at risk of poorer outcomes. However, some fathers, such as those with children with behavioural problems and living in poverty, may require greater support. Future longitudinal research that explores the impact of paternal well-being on the long-term outcomes of children with and without ID is warranted.

AB Guided by attachment theory of emotion regulation (ER), the current study utilized a person-centred approach to identify clusters of individuals that differed in their attachment representations and ER, and further examined individual differences in socio-emotional functioning based on these profiles. Participants included 658 emerging adults (M = 19.9, SD = 2.7, 65.5% female) who completed surveys measuring responses to rejection, friendship closeness, and emotional maladjustment. Five clusters were identified: secure regulated (19%), disorganized unregulated (21%), anxious unregulated (16%), emotive (21%), and avoidant suppressor (22%). Each group displayed unique patterns, with the secure regulated group reporting significantly less withdrawal, retribution, rumination, and emotional maladjustment, and the disorganized unregulated group reporting the poorest functioning across all indicators. Significant cluster x sex effects were also found for friendship closeness. These findings suggest the importance of considering attachment and ER, and implications for attachment theory and development are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Insecure attachment representations are a significant risk factor for poorer outcomes across development. Hyperactivating and deactivating strategies are maladaptive responses to coping with emotional threat. These strategies are an extension of the internal working model and positive correlates of poorer functioning. What does this study add? Previous studies have over-relied on variable-centred approaches to replicate findings of attachment theory. A person-centred approach allowing for the joint consideration of patterns of both attachment and ER strategies. The identification of five novel profiles revealing unique differences in three important domains of functioning.

Method Behavioral indicators of family functioning (e.g., cohesion, coercion, and invalidation) and a physiological index of emotion dysregulation (respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) were examined across two conflict tasks (pre- and postskills training). Results Dyads' subjective affect and observed behavior generally improved when practicing validation. Findings indicate mother-, daughter-, and dyad-level behavior accounted for significant variance in RSA reactivity. Conclusions Results demonstrate that teaching a single skill on one occasion can have detectable effects on biosocial functioning, with important implications for the etiology and treatment of SII.

AB Alexithymia has been linked to reduced emotional awareness and increased aggression. One line of evidence suggests that authoritarian parenting contributes to the development of alexithymia. To elucidate the relationship between experienced parenting style, alexithymia and aggression the Parental Authority Questionnaire, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire were administered to a group of emerging adults. Current findings show a positive relationship between: (i) authoritarian parenting style and alexithymia, (ii) alexithymia and aggression, iii) authoritarian parenting style and aggression. This study also found that paternal authoritarian parenting predicted alexithymia and aggression when controlling for maternal authoritarian style, but not the other way round. In addition, alexithymia mediated the relationship between paternal authoritarian parenting and aggression when controlling for maternal authoritarian style suggesting that elevated alexithymia which is likely to be a consequence of authoritarian parenting, especially when it is practiced by a father, contributes to increased aggression in adulthood.

AB Background: Congenital heart disease places survivors at increased risk for cardiovascular complications as they age and requires long-term medical management. Perceived health competence, or how capable one feels in managing one's health, is linked to emotional adjustment in various disease populations, but has not been investigated among congenital heart disease survivors. Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of perceived health competence at baseline (T1) as a predictor of anxiety and depressive symptoms three years later (T2). Methods: Congenital heart disease survivors (n=125; M-T1age=27; 58.6% female; severity of cardiac lesion: 25% simple, 44% moderate, 31% complex) were recruited from a pediatric and an adult hospital as part of a larger study. Participants completed the Perceived Health Competence Scale and the Youth or Adult Self-Report at T1 for anxiety and affective/depressive symptoms. At T2, participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. New York Heart Association functional class, a measure of functional impairment, was abstracted from medical charts at T2. Results: Lower T1 perceived health competence was significantly associated with greater emotional distress at T1 (depression r=-0.47; anxiety: r=-0.45), as well as greater T2 functional impairment (r=-0.41). T1 perceived health competence also predicted T2 anxiety and depressive symptoms, which remained significant when including T1 anxiety and depressive symptoms and T2 functional impairment. Conclusion: Congenital heart disease survivors who feel more competent in managing their health may be less likely to experience future anxiety and depressive symptoms. Perceived health competence may be a worthwhile target for psychosocial intervention to promote emotional wellbeing among congenital heart disease survivors and ensure the best outcomes.

AB BackgroundChild maltreatment has been linked to lower health, education, and income later in life, and is associated with increased engagement in delinquent or criminal behaviors. This paper explores trajectories of these behaviors from adolescence into early adulthood and tests maltreatment as a predictor, and whether observed patterns are consistent across different demographic groups.MethodsUsing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents (in grades 7-12 in the 1994-95 school year), we ran linear mixed effects models to estimate growth curves of two dependent variables: violent and nonviolent offending behavior. We tested if maltreatment altered the intercept or slope of the curves and how the curves of these behaviors and the associations between them and maltreatment varied by sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.ResultsThe sample (n=10,613) had equal proportions males and females, approximately one third identified as a race/ethnicity other than white, and over 10% were non-heterosexual. Experiences of maltreatment were highest for Native Americans and lowest for whites. Models indicated that males were more likely than females to engage in both violent and nonviolent offending and respondents who identified as non-heterosexual were more likely than their heterosexual peers to engage in nonviolent offending behavior. When maltreatment was included in models as a predictor, adolescents who experienced maltreatment had a more rapid increase in their non-violent offending behavior. For violent offending behavior, adolescents who experienced maltreatment had higher levels of offending and the levels progressively increased as maltreatment frequency did. Sex was a moderator; the relationship between maltreatment and predicted nonviolent offending was stronger for males than it was for females. Race/ethnicity and sexual orientation did not moderate the associations between maltreatment and offending behavior.ConclusionsThis study provides insights from a nationally representative sample into the pattern of both delinquent and criminal behaviors in adolescence and young adulthood, describing not only how the pattern varies over time, but also by sociodemographics and offending type. Additionally, it highlights how the association between maltreatment and these behaviors varies by both offending type and sex.

AB The migration makes an influence on children's mental health and behaviors. However, the majority of studies investigate the families and people in migration rather than left-behind groups in their home countries. OBJECTIVE: to assess the possible impact of parents' migration on emotional and behavioral problems of their left-behind children. The study comprised 10-19-year-old adolescents from five urban secondary schools (n = 1292). The cross-sectional study was conducted in Kaunas city (Lithuania). Main measures were self-reported scales - Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as well as items on subjective perceptions and feelings towards the change of relationship with a missing parent due to migration or divorce. Findings show that left-behind children report more risky behaviors and emotional problems, they tend more to feel unloved (OR = 2.34, p < 0.05), longing for missing parent (OR = 4.72, p < 0.05), contemplating suicide or self-injuring behavior (OR = 3.92, p < 0.05). Emotional and behavioral problems are more prevalent among 15-19-year-old male adolescents (OR = 1.71, p < 0.05). The left-behind children report more emotional and behavioral problems compared to the children from divorced families. The findings suggest that parental migration has specific negative effects on left-behind children's emotional state and behaviors.

AB Objective Attachment insecurity and emotional competences (EC) form a key part of conceptual models of anorexia nervosa (AN). We explored the relationship between attachment dimensions and EC on the severity of eating disorders in patients diagnosed with restrictive AN. Method Sixty-three female patients with restrictive AN and 63 healthy participants completed self-report measures (eating symptoms, EC, attachment, depression, and anxiety). Result Patients with restrictive AN used fewer adaptive and more maladaptive regulation strategies and showed low levels of intrapersonal EC. The partial least squares path modeling analysis showed that high levels of attachment anxiety or avoidance lead to a decrease in intrapersonal EC, which in turn contributes to greater severity of eating symptoms in anorexic patients. Conclusions Lower intrapersonal EC played an important mediating role in the effects of attachment insecurity on the severity of eating disorders. The joint use of therapeutic programs that target both EC and attachment processes constitutes a promising approach.

AB Recent conceptualization and research in personality development have shown that significant changes in personality taking place during emerging adulthood where young people tend to become more emotionally mature and stable. In line with these contentions, we examined in a sample of 205 Israeli emerging adults the longitudinal association between change in self-criticism across ages 23 and 29 and positive developmental and psychological well-being outcomes at age 35. In addition, we examined the extent to which the association between change in self-criticism and future outcomes would be mediated through reflectivity. Findings indicated that greater decrease in self-criticism during emerging adulthood associated with greater reflective capability at age 29 and both longitudinally associated with greater achievement of developmental tasks and better psychological well-being at age 35. Additionally, associations of decrease in self-criticism with future outcomes were mediated through reflectivity. These findings point to maturity processes that can explain outcomes in young adulthood.

AB Past research indicates that humility predicts enhanced self-control. In the present research, two event-sampling studies and a longitudinal study were conducted to test the hypothesis that humility facilitates the capacity in resisting substance consumption. Undergraduates rated their alcohol and tobacco dependence every three days across either four sessions (Study 1) or six sessions (Study 2). Humility was reported across four time-points in Study 1, and measured at the first session in Study 2. In Study 3, data from inmates in a prison facility for drug offenders were collected across three time-points over 8 months, including data for humility and emotion regulation strategies at the first and second time-points. Information on whether they experienced a relapse was coded at the third time-point, which was six months after they were released. Across three studies, humility predicted greater resistance against substance use. In Study 3, we found that cognitive reappraisal mediated this relationship.

The sample consisted of 1000 children. The results indicated that a child's adjustment was correlated with the host country, traumatic events, and time spent in host country. Coping strategies, family relationships, and school environment are strong predictors. Interventions may target psychosocial problems and risk modifiers that focus on emotion regulation, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving and coping skills, positive relationships within the family, and positive school environment.

AB The transition to middle school is recognized as a period of increased risk for students' adjustment difficulties across the academic, behavioral, and social domains, underscoring the need for developmentally responsive interventions that address these potential vulnerabilities. This study examined the impact of a multi-component intervention on students' perceived adjustment during the first year of middle school using a cluster randomized controlled trial design. A total of 24 metropolitan schools (12 intervention), 220 teachers (122 intervention), and 2925 students (1537 intervention) participated. Teachers in intervention schools received training and consultation in the Behavioral, Academic, and Social Engagement (BASE) classroom management model. Significant intervention effects, moderated by students' gender, race/ethnicity, and economic status, were found for self-reported social anxiety, defiance, willingness to protect peers being bullied, and emotional problems. The results suggest that teachers trained in the BASE model were better able to create supportive classroom contexts during the middle school transition which promoted positive adjustment for particular students. This study stresses the importance of using developmentally appropriate strategies across correlated domains to reduce adjustment difficulties during the transition to middle school.

AB Theory of Mind (ToM) or the ability to understand mental states in self and others to explain behavior continues to develop in adolescence and connects to social experiences. Research shows during adolescence, ToM may influence one's ability to evaluate and judge one's self-worth and their social interactions. However, few studies examine the associations among self-knowledge, ToM, and social experiences. This study explored individual differences and associations among 146 Canadian adolescents' ToM, self-knowledge, and loneliness (86 females; M-age = 13.2 years). Self-report questionnaires and semi-structured interviews measured ToM, self-knowledge, and perceptions of friendship quality, social preferences, and loneliness. Results showed higher levels of ToM were related to lower ratings of self-perceived physical appearance, global self-worth, and loneliness. Compared to boys, girls with higher levels of ToM reported a more comprehensive understanding of self-distinctiveness and agency, although they felt less lonely. Implications for developmental social cognitive theory and mental health education are discussed.

AB The purpose of the present study is to analyze the quality of attachment in substance abuse patients in outpatient treatment vs. patients in therapeutic communities in order to identify the role of attachment insecurity in choosing a care system. The sample consisted of 127 subjects (107 males and 20 females); 97 were outpatients (83 males) and 30 therapeutic community patients (24 males). Attachment with respect to current, significant relationships was assessed using the Relationship Questionnaire. In the outpatient subgroup, the prevailing attachment style was preoccupied; for the therapeutic community patients, the prevailing attachment style was dismissive. The dimensions of care (how the caregiver is perceived as loving and caring) and overprotection (how the caregiver is perceived as intrusive and interfering)-evaluated by means of the Parent Bonding Instrument-were higher in the outpatient subgroup. Scores were higher with respect to maternal subscales regardless of treatment modality. No differences emerged with respect to self-perceived symptoms (SCL-90-R) between the subgroups; however, fearful-avoidant and dismissive-avoidant individuals reported higher self-perceived symptom regardless of treatment modality. Understanding the distribution of different attachment patterns with respect to the treatment modality may improve efficacious interventions, attuning them to the individual and his or her developmental environment.

AB Despite abundant research on the benefits of dispositional mindfulness and mindfulness-based interventions, little is known about the naturally occurring developmental course of mindful awareness. Given dramatic strides during adolescence in competencies that may support mindfulness (e.g., emotion regulation), the high school years are a suitable window to study developmental changes in mindfulness. Using an accelerated cohort design to examine the longitudinal trajectory of mindfulness from 9th grade through 12th grade, we employed data from a 5-year study of 3,453 U.S. adolescents (55% female; 40% Latinx, 38% White, 13% Black, and 7% Asian) from high schools in three geographical regions in the U.S. Adolescents annually completed self-report surveys measuring mindful awareness and several internal and external factors. Latent growth curve analyses found that, after controlling for cohort, there was no average linear change in mindful awareness from grades 9 through 12, although there was significant interindividual variability in slopes. Within-person analyses found that in grades when needs-supportive climate was higher and discrimination was lower, adolescents reported greater mindful awareness. Unexpectedly, in grades when perspective taking and prosocial behaviors were higher, mindfulness was lower. These findings inform developmental understanding of mindful awareness and the ways that it naturally occurs and is supported during adolescence.

AB Background: Previous research has illustrated a relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. However, it is not yet understood how this relationship manifests. The aim of this study was to explore if two beliefs about suicide, (1) suicide as a way to escape from emotional pain and (2) suicide as a solution to a problem, moderate the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation.
   Methods: One hundred one community participants completed questionnaires examining emotion dysregulation, suicidal ideation, and beliefs in the functions of suicide. Inclusion criteria were used to over-sample individuals within the community experiencing higher levels of suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation. Hierarchical linear regressions with interaction terms were used to assess moderation effects. The moderating role of beliefs in the function of suicide was examined both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
   Results: Suicide as an escape significantly moderated the relationship between global emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation cross-sectionally, while it moderated the relationship between a facet of emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation longitudinally. Greater endorsement of this belief resulted in a stronger relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation. The function of suicide as a solution to a problem did not moderate the emotion dysregulation-suicidal ideation relationship.
   Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of not only addressing emotion dysregulation but also addressing the underlying belief that suicide is an escape in individuals who experience both emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation. Intervention efforts to address belief in suicide as an escape along with emotion dysregulation are delineated.

AB Despite various advances in the study of the neurobiological underpinnings of personality traits, the specific neural correlates associated with character and temperament traits are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by exploring the biochemical basis of personality, which is explored with the temperament and character inventory (TCI), during brain development in a sample of adolescents. Twenty-six healthy adolescents (aged between 13 and 21 years; 9 males and 18 females) with behavioral and emotional problems underwent a TCI evaluation and a 3T single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) acquisition of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Absolute metabolite levels were estimated using LCModel: significant correlations between metabolite levels and selective TCI scales were identified. Specifically, phosphocreatine plus creatine (PCr+Cre) significantly correlated with self-directedness, positively, and with a self-transcendence (ST), negatively, while glycerophosphocholine plus phosphocholine (GPC+PC) and myo-inositol negatively correlated with ST. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting associations of brain metabolites with personality traits in adolescents. Therefore, our results represent a step forward for personality neuroscience within the study of biochemical systems and brain structures.

AB Children of depressed parents are at heightened risk for developing depression, yet relatively little is known about the specific mechanisms responsible. Since preventive interventions for this risk group show small effects which diminish overtime, it is crucial to uncover the key risk factors for depression. This study compared various potential mechanisms in children of depressed (high-risk; n = 74) versus non-depressed (low-risk; n = 37) parents and explored mediators of parental depression and risk in offspring. A German sample of N = 111 boys and girls aged 8 to 17 years were compared regarding children's (i) symptoms of depression and general psychopathology, (ii) emotion regulation strategies, (iii) attributional style, (iv) perceived parenting style and (v) life events. Children in the high-risk group showed significantly more symptoms of depression and general psychopathology, less adaptive emotion regulation strategies, fewer positive life events and fewer positive parenting strategies in comparison with the low-risk group. Group differences in positive and negative attributional style were small and not statistically significant in a MANOVA test. Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and negative life events were identified as partial mediators of the association between parental depression and children's risk of depression. The study highlights the elevated risk of depression in children of depressed parents and provides empirical support for existing models of the mechanisms underlying transmission. Interestingly, the high-risk group was characterised by a lack of protective rather than increased vulnerability factors. These results are crucial for developing more effective preventive interventions for this high-risk population.

AB Purpose To examine the association between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), neurocognitive and psychosocial late-effects, health behaviors, and healthcare utilization in long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Methods Participants included individuals (N = 6844; 52.5% female; mean [SD] age at diagnosis = 7.6 [5.8], at follow-up = 34.9 [7.5]) in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Follow-up included the Posttraumatic Stress Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Short-form 36 Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) survey, CCSS Neurocognitive Questionnaire, and questions about sociodemographics, physical health, health behaviors, and healthcare utilization. Modified Poisson regression and multinomial logistic regression models examined associations between posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and neurocognitive, HRQOL, health behavior, and healthcare outcomes when adjusting for sociodemographics, disease, and treatment. Results Long-term survivors with PTSS (N = 995, 14.5%) reported more impairment in mental (relative risk [RR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.05-3.85), and physical (RR = 2.26, CI = 1.96-2.61) HRQOL. PTSS was also associated with increased impairment in task efficiency (RR = 3.09, CI = 2.72-3.51), working memory (RR = 2.55, CI = 2.30-2.83), organization (RR = 2.11, CI = 1.78-2.50), and emotional regulation (RR = 3.67, CI = 3.30-4.09). Survivors with PTSS were significantly more likely to attend cancer-specific health visits in the past 2 years (OR = 1.89, CI = 1.50-2.39), and showed greater likelihood of either high frequency (OR = 1.89, CI = 1.50-2.39) or complete lack of (OR = 1.63, CI = 1.32-2.01) primary care visits compared to survivors without PTSS. Conclusions Survivors with PTSS reported significantly more psychosocial and neurocognitive late effects, and were more likely to engage in variable use of healthcare.

AB This study used latent class analysis to examine whether multiple subgroups can be identified based on rule-breaking and aggressive behavior in school-based and at-risk adolescent samples. These groups were tested for differences in behavioral, emotional, personality and interpersonal correlates. Rule breaking and aggressive behavior co-occurred across all classes. School-based adolescents were classified as having minimal, minor or moderate antisocial problems. At-risk adolescents were classified as having mild, medium or severe antisocial problems. Generally, at-risk adolescents had higher levels of antisocial behavior, and greater severity of antisocial behavior was associated with more problems in various domains. Results differed however, for the school-based and at-risk samples with respect to emotional problems, sensation-seeking and peer conformity pressure. There is a need to jointly consider both non-aggressive rule-breaking behavior and aggressive behavior in prevention and intervention work, as it is insufficient to address isolated symptoms and problems in children and adolescents.

AB Coping and emotion regulation are central features of risk and resilience in childhood and adolescence, but research on these constructs has relied on different methods of assessment. The current study aimed to bridge the gap between questionnaire and experimental methods of measuring secondary control coping strategies, specifically distraction and cognitive reappraisal, and examine associations with symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth. A community sample of 70 youth (ages 9-15) completed a novel experimental coping and emotion regulation paradigm and self-report measures of coping and emotion regulation and symptoms. Findings indicate that use of distraction and reappraisal during the laboratory paradigm was associated with lower levels of negative emotion during the task. Youth emotion ratings while implementing distraction, but not reappraisal, during the laboratory task were associated with youth self-reported use of secondary control coping in response to family stress. Youth symptoms of anxiety and depression were also significantly positively associated with negative emotion ratings during the laboratory task, and both laboratory task and self-reported coping and emotion regulation accounted for significant variance in symptoms in youth. Both questionnaire and laboratory methods to assess coping and emotion regulation in youth are important for understanding these processes as possible mechanisms of risk and resilience and continued integration of these methods is a priority for future research.

AB Children of depressed mothers are at risk for maladaptive emotion regulation. This study examined a model of maternal rumination that links maternal depressive symptoms to child emotion regulation. A sample of 126 mother-child dyads (65 girls) participated in the current study, at three assessment points when children were age three, four, and five. At all assessment points, mothers reported their depressive symptoms and ruminative response style. Child emotion regulation was assessed observationally from two laboratory tasks, which were designed to elicit anger and sadness. Elevated maternal depressive symptoms were associated with higher concurrent rumination. Maternal rumination at child age four predicted that more child focus on distress during sadness-eliciting tasks and less child active distraction during anger-eliciting tasks 1 year later. Additionally, maternal rumination at child age three and four predicted less child passive behaviors in anger-eliciting tasks prospectively. Findings suggest that maternal rumination is predictive of using maladaptive regulatory strategies among children of depressed mothers. This study has significant implications for intervention programs targeting depressed mothers and their children.

AB Background: Many adolescents and young adults get insufficient sleep. A link between sleep loss and risk-taking behavior has been consistently found in the literature, but surprisingly, the role played by the origin of sleep loss in this link has never been investigated. Sleep loss can be voluntary (instead of sleeping, a significant amount of time is devoted to other activities) or involuntary (caused by a sleep disorder, for example, insomnia). The aim of this research was to investigate whether both types of sleep loss are associated to the same extent with risky behavior. Participants: Five hundred thirty-six university students between 19 and 25?years old participated in this study. Three groups were selected: participants with voluntary sleep loss, participants with insomnia, and normal sleepers. Methods: We assessed risk-taking behavior in virtual driving situations, as well as drinking habits in terms of quantity and frequency. To further explore the differences between the groups, we also measured sensation seeking, a personality trait related to risk-taking behavior. Results: Compared to participants with insomnia and normal sleepers, participants with voluntary sleep loss take more risks in dangerous driving situations, drink more alcohol, and have higher disinhibition scores on the Sensation-Seeking Scale. On the other hand, no such differences were found between participants with insomnia and normal sleepers, suggesting that sleep loss is not always associated with risk taking. Conclusions: Whether sleep loss is associated with risk-taking behavior or not could depend on the origin of sleep loss and the underlying personality traits.

DE Dialectical behavior therapy; emotional dysregulation; personality

AB Emotion dysregulation is the inability to control and modulate one's affective state, and it might be associated with mental disorders. The development of secure attachment with significant others, in early childhood, has been theorized to be essential to the development of emotional regulation. Disruption of the formation of secure internal representations may, therefore, substantially compromise the acquisition of emotional-regulation capacities in childhood and lead to social maladjustment in later life. It is a pre-post case study design of two adolescents who presented with acts of self-harm and history indicating a provisional diagnosis of personality disorder. However, an in-depth assessment revealed emotional dysregulation. The model of Dialectical Behavior therapy (DBT) recommended for non-clinical populations was delivered in 12-16 sessions, resulting in a positive outcome that sustained for 12-24 months follow-up, improving interpersonal effectiveness. The role of DBT as an early intervention in emotional dysregulation is highlighted, as it enhances social adjustment by altering the attribution style.

AB A universal school-based intervention was developed to enhance coping with school-related stress by building students' social and emotional competence. The intervention was carried out in six classes in three upper secondary schools in southwestern Norway, and covered mindfulness, self-regulated learning, and social competence. Three focus groups were conducted with a stratified selection of general education students (n=24) and one focus group with primary school teachers (n=6). Summative content analysis was conducted using NVivo Software. Findings indicate that the students perceived the core themes useful, and believed that the intervention increased their coping with school-related stress and to some extent improved their learning environment. Teachers' perceptions supported these findings to some degree. Future directions for universal school-based interventions to build social and emotional competencies are suggested.

AB Parental threatening behaviors have emerged as a subset of negative parental behaviors strongly related to internalizing symptoms among youth, yet the underlying mechanisms in this association have remained unexplored. The current investigation examined the role of difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior while emotionally distressed in the association between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and internalizing symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient psychiatric youth. Participants (N = 50; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [0.51] years; age range, 12-17 years) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, exposure to maternal threatening behaviors, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, as well as trauma-related functional impairment. Results revealed that inability to engage in goal-directed behavior while distressed significantly explained associations between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and each of the three symptom classes, but not the association between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and trauma-related functional impairment. These novel findings underscore the need for interventions that target the capacity for goal-directed behavior in the context of emotional distress, especially among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threatening behaviors.

AB The objective of the research was to design and establish the effect of a group intervention program with Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for self-injurious behavior without suicidal intentionality. The design was quasi-experimental and the sample consisted of 14 adolescents between 13 and 17 years old. Measurements were taken with the subscale of thoughts related to self-harm (EPCA-P), the subscale of self-injury (EPCA-A), the scale of difficulties in emotional regulation (DERS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Inventory of anxiety of Beck (BAI). The intervention was performed and post-test measurements were taken. The results indicate that there are statistically significant differences between the pre-test and post-test scores of the EPCA-P, the DERS, the SDI and the BAI.

   BEHAVIORS; ADVERSITY; SYMPTOMS
AB Background: Compared to typically developing individuals, individuals with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are on average more often exposed to stressful conditions (e.g., school failure, family conflicts, financial problems). We hypothesized that high exposure to stress relates to a more persistent and complex (i.e., multi-problem) form of ADHD, while low-stress exposure relates to remitting ADHD over the course of adolescence. Method: Longitudinal data (ages 11, 13, 16, and 19) came from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Life Survey (TRAILS). We selected children diagnosed with ADHD (n = 244; 167 males; 77 females) from the TRAILS clinical cohort and children who screened positive (n = 365; 250 males; 115 females) and negative (gender-matched: n = 1222; 831 males; 391 females) for ADHD from the TRAILS general population sample cohort (total n = 1587). Multivariate latent class growth analysis was applied to parent- and self-ratings of stress exposure, core ADHD problems (attention problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity), effortful control, emotion dysregulation (irritability, extreme reactivity, frustration), and internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints). Results: Seven distinct developmental courses in stress exposure and psychopathology were discerned, of which four related to ADHD. Two persistent ADHD courses of severely affected adolescents were associated with very high curvilinear stress exposure peaking in mid-adolescence: (1) Severe combined type with ongoing, severe emotional dysregulation, and (2) combined type with a high and increasing internalization of problems and elevated irritability; two partly remitting ADHD courses had low and declining stress exposure: (3) inattentive type, and (4) moderate combined type, both mostly without comorbid problems. Conclusions: High-stress exposure between childhood and young adulthood is strongly intertwined with a persistent course of ADHD and with comorbid problems taking the form of either severe and persistent emotion dysregulation (irritability, extreme reactivity, frustration) or elevated and increasing irritability, anxiety, and depression. Conversely, low and declining stress exposure is associated with remitting ADHD and decreasing internalizing and externalizing problems. Stress exposure is likely to be a facilitating and sustaining factor in these two persistent trajectories of ADHD with comorbid problems into young adulthood. Our findings suggest that a bidirectional, continuing, cycle of stressors leads to enhanced symptoms, in turn leading to more stressors, and so forth. Consideration of stressful conditions should, therefore, be an inherent part of the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, to potentiate prevention and interruption of adverse trajectories.

AB KBG syndrome is a rare multisystem developmental disorder caused by ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) gene haploinsufficiency, resulting from either intragenic loss-of-function mutations or microdeletions encompassing the gene. Concerning the behavioral phenotype, a limited amount of research has been focused on attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, autistic-like features, anxiety and impairments in emotion regulation, and no study has provided a systematic assessment. The aim of the present work is to investigate the psychopathological profile in children, adolescents, and young adults with KBG syndrome. Seventeen subjects with molecularly confirmed diagnoses were evaluated to investigate cognitive abilities and psychopathological features. Parametric and nonparametric indexes were used to describe the patient cohort according to type and distribution of specific measures. The KBG subjects were characterized by a low mean IQ score, with a distribution characterized by a variability similar to that occurring in the general population. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders were computed as well as the corresponding confidence intervals to compare their prevalence to that reported for the general population. The KBG subjects were characterized by higher prevalence of obsessive-compulsive, tic, depressive and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a peculiar aspect characterizing the psychopathological profile of KBG patients, which does not seem to be related to the cognitive level. The present study provides new relevant information towards the definition of a psychopathological phenotype of KBG syndromes useful to plan a better treatment for patients.

AB This study examined the relationship between dark triad personality traits and chronotype disposition, whilst incorporating the mediating role of anxiety and/or depression after excluding individuals presenting insomnia and/or physiological sleep-disorder symptoms. Members of the general population (N = 453) completed online measures of dark triad personality traits, chronotype, and anxious and depressive symptoms. Psychopathy and Machiavellianism were independently related to an evening chronotype disposition. However, after accounting for age, sex, anxiety and depression, psychopathy and depression remained the only significant predictors of chronotype. Therefore, whilst psychopathy was the strongest predictor of an evening chronotype preference, this relationship is partially mediated by depression. Individuals presenting an evening disposition may display increased psychopathic traits due to greater emotion dysregulation. This is potentially perpetuated by depressive symptoms stemming from a delayed or blunted affective rhythm. Interacting factors (e.g. reduced light exposure) may also contribute to alterations in the biological rhythm amongst evening-types, resulting in a negative feedback cycle. Targeting chronotype and depressive symptoms amongst individuals presenting psychopathic tendencies could increase the efficacy of existing sleep-based interventions for hostile behaviour.

AB Purpose: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning has been widely studied in relation to antisocial behavior, such as Conduct Disorder (CD). However, research in females is scarce and findings are inconsistent. This study investigated baseline ANS activity in CD children and adolescents and tested for sex differences. Furthermore, subgroups of CD were investigated: +/- Limited Prosocial Emotions (LPE), +/- comorbid internalizing disorders (INT).
   Methods: Baseline ANS activity was measured by Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV; parasympathetic activity), Pre-Ejection Period (PEP; sympathetic activity), and Respiration Rate (RR). 659 females (296 CD, 363 controls) and 351 males (187 CD, 164 controls), aged 9-18 years participated.
   Results: Baseline HR, HRV and PEP did not differ between CD subjects and controls in both sexes. RR was higher in CD participants than controls amongst females, but not males. LPE was unrelated to ANS activity, whereas females with CD + INT presented lower HRV.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that baseline ANS activity is not a robust indicator for CD. However, deviant ANS activity - especially parasympathetic activity - was observed in CD females with internalizing comorbidity. The psychophysiological abnormalities observed in this subgroup are indicative of emotion regulation problems. Accordingly, this subgroup may require specific interventions.

AB Purpose: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning has long been studied in relation to antisocial behaviour, but relevant measures (heart rate, heart rate variability, pre-ejection period, respiration rate) have rarely been considered together. This study investigated the relationship between these measures and antisocial behaviour.
   Methods: Using a sample of 1010 youths with (47.8%) and without conduct disorder (52.2%) aged between 9 and 18 years (659 females, 351 males, mean age = 14.2 years, SD = 2.4), principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to various measures of psychopathology and antisocial behavior. Structural equation modelling was performed in order to test whether the ANS measures predicted PCA-dimensions. Cluster analysis was used in order to classify patterns of ANS activity. Analyses were performed separately for males/females and controlled for body-mass-index, age, caffeine use, cigarette smoking, sports, socioeconomic status, medication, cardiac problems.
   Results: The PCA yielded three components: antisocial behaviour/comorbid psychopathology, narcissistic traits, and callous-unemotional traits. ANS measures were only weakly correlated with these components. Cluster analysis yielded high and low arousal clusters in both sexes. When controlling for covariates, all associations disappeared.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that resting ANS measures are only weakly related to antisocial behaviour and indicate that smoking should be considered as an important covariate in future psychophysiological studies.

AB Prevention approaches aim to implement scientifically sound concepts, especially in day care centers, schools, at the workplace and in nursing homes. On the basis of specific risk and protection factors which provide information about normal and deviant courses of development, everyday-integrated, age-specific and development-related prevention approaches can be better justified and finally successfully implemented. Development-accompanying school-based prevention approaches for the promotion of social-emotional competences are -currently of particular significance.

In addition, preschool teachers rated the EMK-F with regard to practicability and acceptance. Analytical procedures for examining the EMK-F are based on the data of 124 three- to six-year-olds (control group: n = 65) from nine kindergartens. Emotional competencies were assessed using the EMK 3-6 and vocabulary was measured with the SET 3 -5. Children in the intervention group showed a significant increase in the emotional knowledge compared to the untreated control group. Ratings of preschool teachers for the EMK-F were predominantly positive. Implications of the findings as well as methodological limitations of the study are discussed.

AB Stressful experiences and physical strain increase significantly across childhood and adolescence. Especially the development and evaluation of secondary preventive stress management programs among children and adolescents have been widely neglected in previous German studies. In the present pilot study, a newly developed secondary preventive Anti-Stress-Training for children (Hempel & Petermann, 2017) was evaluated, particularly using formative evaluation methods. First effects of the training were examined applying a single-group-pretest-posttest design to N = 8 sixth graders. The acceptability and feasibility were confirmed. First beneficial results with high effect sizes were found in perceived stress and coping. In contrast, physical strain improved clinically only moderately, and quality of health did not change significantly. Thus, this secondary preventive stress management training shows a good acceptability and feasibility. Overall, results support its beneficial effects, in particular on maladaptive coping, and lend support to the assumption that mental health of children may be improved by this training.

AB The aim of the study was to examine the long-term effects of the prevention program "Emotion Training with students': Immediately and after a period of six months after the end of the training, students were expected to report an increase in emotion awareness, empathy, and emotion regulation strategies, as well as a decrease in self-reported depressive symptomatology. Data were collected from 149 adolescents (age: 10 - 13 years, m = 11.69, SD = 0.73, 51.7% female) at three different measuring times (pre, post and six-month follow-up) which were analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measurements. The results showed an increase in emotional awareness between pre- and posttest which remain stable six months after. Students did not report any change in depressive symptoms immediately after training's completion, however symptoms were reported to decrease significantly six months after. Empathy and emotion regulation strategies only improved between preand posttest. The results indicate that the Emotion Training with Students solely has long term positive effects on emotion awareness. Improvements in depressive symptomatology show up in the long term.

AB Non-human primate models have been useful in clarifying estradiol's role in cognitive processing. These animal studies indicate estradiol impacts cognitive processes supported by regions within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Although human functional neuroimaging studies have begun to find similar relationships between estradiol in women for some forms of 'cold' cognitive control, to date no studies have examined the relationship between estradiol and DLPFC function in the context of active attempts to regulate one's emotions. Here, we asked whether peripheral 17-beta estradiol levels in adolescent girls in different pubertal developmental stages (age = 14.9 years +/- 1.74) were related to engagement of DLPFC regions during the use of a cognitive strategy for regulating emotion known as reappraisal using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Findings indicated that higher estradiol levels predicted greater DLPFC activity during the down-regulation of negative emotion using reappraisal. This is the first report of an association between estradiol level and DLPFC activity during cognitive reappraisal of negative emotion. The study suggests a possibility that estradiol might positively contribute to regulatory function of a cortical system important for emotional experiences.

AB Objective: The endocannbinoid system and cannabis exposure has been implicated in emotional processing. The current study examined whether regular cannabis users demonstrated abnormal intrinsic (a.k.a. resting state) frontolimbic connectivity compared to non-users. A secondary aim examined the relationship between cannabis group connectivity differences and self-reported mood and affect symptoms. Method: Participants included 79 cannabis-using and 80 non-using control emerging adults (ages of 18-30), balanced for gender, reading ability, and age. Standard multiple regressions were used to predict if cannabis group status was associated with frontolimbic connectivity after controlling for site, past month alcohol and nicotine use, and days of abstinence from cannabis. Results: After controlling for research site, past month alcohol and nicotine use, and days of abstinence from cannabis, cannabis users demonstrated significantly greater connectivity between left rACC and the following: right rACC (p = 0.001; corrected p = 0.05; f(2) = 0.55), left amygdala (p = 0.03; corrected p = 0.47; f (2) = 0.17), and left insula (p = 0.03; corrected p = 0.47; f (2) = 0.16). Among cannabis users, greater bilateral rACC connectivity was significantly associated with greater subthreshold depressive symptoms (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Cannabis using young adults demonstrated greater connectivity within frontolimbic regions compared to controls. In cannabis users, greater bilateral rACC intrinsic connectivity was associated with greater levels of subthreshold depression symptoms. Current findings suggest that regular cannabis use during adolescence is associated with abnormal frontolimbic connectivity, especially in cognitive control and emotion regulation regions.

AB Nearly half of adolescents experience depressive or aggressive symptoms that impair their functioning at some point in adolescence. Experiencing intense difficult emotions and difficulties regulating such emotions may lead to these depressive and aggressive symptoms. However, existing work largely investigates how adolescent emotions at a single time point predict adolescent depressive or aggressive symptoms months or years later. New investigations are needed to capture the dynamic, changing nature of adolescents' daily experiences of emotions and symptoms of mental distress. Such investigations would further understanding of how emotions affect mental health in adolescents' everyday lives. Answering this call, the present study investigated how emotion dysregulation moderated and mediated daily associations between sadness and depressive symptoms and between anger and aggression utilizing ecological momentary assessment in a community sample of 103 Italian adolescents (M-age = 16.77, SD = 0.78, range: 15-18 years old; 47% female). The results revealed that if an adolescent experienced higher-than-usual sadness or anger on a particular day, then they also experienced higher than usual depressive or aggressive symptoms, respectively. Emotion dysregulation mediated and moderated these associations. Adolescents with higher anger had greater difficulties regulating their anger, which led to higher aggressive symptoms (a mediating effect). If adolescents' sadness was higher than usual on a given day, their depressive symptoms were more severe than usual if they also had higher than usual difficulties regulating sadness (a moderating effect). These findings contribute to our understanding of how emotions impact mental distress on a daily basis for adolescents, emphasize the importance of examining specific adolescent emotions, and shed new light on how emotional regulatory capacities influence emotions and mental health in adolescents' everyday lives.

AB Despite prior studies supporting the existence of "aggressive-victims", it remains unclear if they possess unique risk factors from adolescents who are mostly aggressive or victimized. The present study sought to determine whether aggressive-victims differ from adolescents with distinct patterns of involvement in aggression and victimization in their social and emotional adjustment. Secondary analyses were conducted on baseline data from 984 seventh grade students (54% female) from three schools. Most participants identified their race as White (49%) or African American (19%), with 24% identifying as Latino/a. Latent class analysis identified four subgroups: predominant-aggressors (25%), predominant-victims (17%), aggressive-victims (12%), and limited-involvement (47%). The findings did not provide evidence of unique social-emotional characteristics of aggressive-victims that were not accounted for by their involvement in both aggression and victimization. Further evidence of unique differences in risk factors is needed to support targeted interventions for aggressive-victims.

AB Online exchange of sexual content ("sexting") is associated with potentially negative consequences, especially for girls. We investigated possible associations between family functioning and girls' sexting. Italian teenage girls (N = 250; M-age = 16.36 years; SDage = 1.88) completed online surveys that evaluated family functioning (communication, flexibility, cohesion, disengagement, chaos, enmeshment, and rigidity) and five sexting behaviors: (a) engaging in sexting, (b) sexting with a partner, (c) number of people with whom girls share sexts, (d) nonconsensual forwarding of sexts, and (e) sexting for emotion regulation. We found that engaging in sexting, sexting for emotion regulation, and the number of people with whom girls share sexts were predicted by age and low family communication. Sexting with a partner was predicted by age and high flexibility, and nonconsensual forwarding of sexts was positively predicted by enmeshment.

AB We evaluated whether narrating anger-provoking events promoted learning from those events, as compared with other responses to anger, and whether the effectiveness of narrative depended on age. In addition, we tested relations between anger reduction and learning and, in a subset of participants, between narrative quality and learning. A sample of 248 young people (eight to 17 years old) recalled an anger-provoking experience and were randomly assigned to one of four activities: recalling the event a second time; narrating the event; and distraction (via video game play or conversation). The young people then recalled the event one last time, and rated the extent to which they had learned from that event. Younger children reported more learning when they had narrated their experience. Youths reported more learning when they had narrated the event more frequently prior to participation. Stronger reductions in anger following regulation were associated with greater self-reported learning. Finally, more elaborative and less resolved narratives were associated with greater self-reported learning.

AB Humans already start to show stress responses on a physical and mental level in early childhood. Numerous studies have demonstrated age- and gender-related differences in experiencing and managing stress. During the transitional period of adolescence young people often experience higher stress-levels. This might lead to a higher vulnerability for maladaptive stress responses. In other words, adolescents who do not have adequate coping strategies to deal with the developmental challenges of puberty might be at risk for later physical and mental symptoms. On the other hand, adequate coping strategies represent a protective factor. Therefore, education and prevention in home and school settings are of particular relevance for adolescent age groups.

AB In the present study, the stress perception and coping of German and immigrant adolescents with regard to future stress were compared. The 1,789 adolescents (164 immigrated, 1,625 German adolescents) at the age of fifteen completed questionnaires on the assessment of stress and coping with regard to future stress. Immigrated youth show a higher stress burden in the domain future than German adolescents. The fear of becoming unemployed was a major stressor in both groups, and both groups were also very active in tackling future-related problems. However, German youths show an even more active approach to coping with future stress and involve parents or friends more often. Migrant youth have higher levels of the coping style withdrawal, especially in emotion regulation and resignative withdrawal. The ability to reflect on the solution of future-related stressors is quite high in both groups. Worries about the increasing destruction of the environment are more important for German youth, while migrant youth care more about how they should reconcile work and family life later.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common phenomenon in adolescence. Furthermore, it is often associated with maltreatment during childhood. One factor determining the relation between childhood maltreatment and NSSI is maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. The current study examines this relation in adolescent psychiatric inpatients (n = 97). Adolescents engaging in NSSI present maladaptive strategies in emotion regulation more frequently. In addition, they experienced maltreatment in childhood more often than inpatients not engaging in NSSI. Further, partial mediation was established among childhood emotional abuse and neglect, NSSI and maladaptive emotion regulation.

AB BACKGROUND: Conduct disorder (CD), which is characterized by severe aggressive and antisocial behavior, is linked to emotion processing and regulation deficits. However, the neural correlates of emotion regulation are yet to be investigated in adolescents with CD. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether CD is associated with deficits in emotional reactivity, emotion regulation, or both.
   METHODS: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study effortful emotion regulation by cognitive reappraisal in 59 female adolescents 15 to 18 years of age (30 with a CD diagnosis and 29 typically developing (TD) control adolescents).
   RESULTS: Behaviorally, in-scanner self-report ratings confirmed successful emotion regulation within each group individually but significant group differences in emotional reactivity and reappraisal success when comparing the groups (CD < TD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging results revealed significantly lower activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus in CD compared with TD adolescents during emotion regulation, but no group differences for emotional reactivity. Furthermore, connectivity between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral putamen, right prefrontal cortex, and amygdala was reduced in CD compared with TD adolescents during reappraisal. Callous-unemotional traits were unrelated to neural activation, but these traits correlated negatively with behavioral reports of emotional reactivity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate reduced prefrontal brain activity and functional connectivity during effortful emotion regulation in female adolescents with CD. This sheds light on the neural basis of the behavioral deficits that have been reported previously. Future studies should investigate whether cognitive interventions are effective in enhancing emotion-regulation abilities and/or normalizing prefrontal and temporoparietal activity in female adolescents with CD.

AB Binge eating among adolescents is associated with negative developmental outcomes. From a cognitive perspective, the role of impaired self-regulation is increasingly emphasized as an underlying factor in binge eating, whereas the affect regulation model proposes that affectivity is a key factor in explaining binge eating. Studies combining both perspectives are scarce, but necessary to add to the understanding of this pathological eating behavior. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate unique and joint contributions of both factors in understanding binge eating among adolescents. Participants were 301 adolescents (10-17 years; 67.2% girls; M-age = 13.46 years; SD = 1.99) from the general community. Adolescents self-reported on different types of binge eating episodes (loss of control over eating in general, objective and subjective binge eating in particular), self-regulation (general self-regulation and inhibitory control) and affectivity (positive and negative). The parents were questioned about their children's self-regulatory capacities. Results revealed main effects of self-regulatory capacities (adolescent report) and negative affectivity in predicting objective binge eating. In addition, negative affectivity interacted with self-regulation (parent report) to predict objective binge eating, whereas positive affectivity interacted with self-regulation (adolescent report) to predict subjective binge eating. No significant effects were found for loss of control over eating specifically. Both self-regulation and affectivity each make unique as well as joint contributions to binge eating among adolescents, with results differing across types of binge eating episodes and informants. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD) often face various associated social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties. In such a marginalized group, it is crucial to identify factors that may impact psychological functioning to better accommodate their needs. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of two specific risk factors, poor peer relations and general family functioning, on the development of psychological problems in adolescents with GD, and their possible interaction effect. The Youth Self-Report, a Peer Relations Scale, and a General Family Functioning scale were assessed in a sample of n = 180 clinically referred adolescents (mean age 15.5; 146 transgender boys with a female birth-assigned sex, and 34 transgender girls with a male birth-assigned sex) with a complete GD diagnosis (fulfillment of the DSM 5 criteria A and B) at their initial admission to the Hamburg Gender Identity Service. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between peer relations, family functioning, and psychological functioning outcomes. Adolescents with GD presented significantly higher Internalizing and Total Problem scores compared to the German reference norm. Externalizing problems were above the norm for transgender boys, but within the normal range for transgender girls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, overall, adolescents with an advanced age, a female birth-assigned sex, poorer peer relations, and poorer family functioning showed more behavioral and emotional problems. Consequently, incorporating both the family and social environment in transgender care is of high importance to adequately tend to the needs of adolescents with GD.

AB This study examined cognitive-affective strategies as predictors of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses to a social-evaluative stressor in adolescence as compared to late childhood as a function of early life experiences. Participants included 159 children (9-10 years) and adolescents (15-16 years) divided into two groups based on early care experiences: non-adopted youth raised in their birth families (n = 81) and post-institutionalized youth internationally adopted from orphanage care (n = 78). Youth completed a version of the Trier Social Stress Test modified for use with children and reported on their trait emotion regulation and coping strategies. Children reported more use of suppression and disengagement than adolescents, while adolescents reported more engagement coping strategies. Non-adopted and post-institutionalized youth did not differ in reported strategies. Cognitive reappraisal predicted higher cortisol reactivity in non-adopted children and adolescents, and was not associated with reactivity in the post-institutionalized group. This study has implications for efforts aimed at promoting self-regulation and adaptive stress responses during the transition to adolescence for both typically developing children and children who experienced adverse early care.

This study examined 29 children with ASD in a manualized group psychotherapy program, Resilience Builder Program (R) (RBP), where emotional and social functioning of parent and child were measured through pre- and post-treatment questionnaires. Greater parental symptomatology was associated with children's reduced response to RBP in resilience-based emotion regulation skills. Greater parental interpersonal sensitivity (beta = - .27, p = .024) predicted worse post-treatment scores in child communication skills, greater parental anxious symptoms (beta = - .45, p = .005) predicted worse post-treatment scores in child emotional control, and greater parental depressive (beta = .27, p = .041) and anxious symptoms (beta = .36, p = .004) predicted worse post-treatment scores in child internalizing problems.

AB Adverse childhood experiences have been associated with more negative coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala, a brain network involved in emotion regulation in both children and adults. This pattern may be particularly likely to emerge in individuals exposed to threatening experiences during childhood (e.g., exposure to child abuse), although this has not been examined in prior research. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data on 57 adolescents during an emotion regulation task. Greater negative functional connectivity between vmPFC and amygdala occurred during viewing of negative compared to neutral images. This vmPFC-amygdala task-related functional connectivity was more negative in adolescents exposed to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse than those without a history of maltreatment and was associated with abuse severity. This pattern of more negative functional connectivity was associated with higher levels of externalizing psychopathology concurrently and 2 years later. Greater negative connectivity in the vmPFC-amygdala network during passive viewing of negative images may reflect disengagement of regulatory responses from vmPFC in situations eliciting strong amygdala reactivity, potentially due to stronger appraisals of threat in children exposed to early threatening environments. This pattern may be adaptive in the short term but place adolescents at higher risk of psychopathology later in life.

AB The quality of early caregiving may partially shape brain structure and circuits involved in regulating emotions, including the frontal cortex, affecting vulnerability to the development of psychopathology and maladaptation. Given the profound impact of child maltreatment (CM) on psychological and neural development, we tested whether CM alters the pathways linking mother-adolescent relationship, frontal cortex, and adult outcomes. We used structural equation modeling to investigate whether CM history affected the association between mother-child relationship quality during early adolescence, frontal lobe volume in adulthood, and adult internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and competence. Participants from a longitudinal high-risk, low-income sample included 48 adults with a history of CM and 40 adults without such history (M = 30.0 years). Results showed that greater frontal lobe volume predicted higher levels of adult adaptive functioning and fewer adult internalizing symptoms but showed no relation to adult externalizing symptoms. Frontal lobe volume significantly mediated the effect of adolescent maternal relationship quality on both adult internalizing symptoms and adult adaptive functioning, but only for individuals with no maltreatment history. Given the observed relationship between frontal lobe volume and healthy adult functioning across the full sample, it will be important to identify protective factors in maltreated individuals that foster frontal lobe development.

AB Childhood maltreatment is associated with a lifetime increase in risk of mental health disorder. We propose that such vulnerability may stem in large part from altered patterns of social functioning. Here, we highlight key findings from the psychological and epidemiological literature indicating that early maltreatment experience compromises social functioning and attenuates social support in ways that increase mental health vulnerability. We then review the extant neuroimaging studies of children and adolescents, focusing on three domains implicated in social functioning: threat processing, reward processing, and emotion regulation. We discuss how adaptations in these domains may increase latent vulnerability to mental health problems by impacting on social functioning via increased stress susceptibility as well as increased stress generation. Finally, we explore how computational psychiatry approaches, alongside systematically reported measures of social functioning, can complement studies of neural function in the creation of a mechanistic framework aimed at informing approaches to prevention and intervention.

AB The present study examined the intraindividual, longitudinal, cross-lagged associations between adolescents' perceptions of mothers' and fathers' psychologically controlling parenting and their self-regulation from ages 11-17. Using 7 waves of data involving 500 families and their adolescents (M-age = 11.29; SD = 1.01 at Wave 1), results indicated that adolescent-reported increases in mothers' and fathers' psychological control prospectively and uniquely predicted intraindividual decrements in their self-regulation, controlling for prior levels of self-regulation. Sex differences were largely absent except for one, where fathers' psychological control predicted adolescent females', but not males', declines in self-regulation, and where reverse associations manifested. Implications for intervention efforts are suggested for parents, educators, and practitioners, and future directions for research are discussed.

AB The ways parents socialize their adolescents to cope with anxiety (i.e., coping socialization) may be instrumental in the development of threat processing and coping responses. Coping socialization may be important for anxious adolescents, as they show altered neural threat processing and over reliance on disengaged coping (e.g., avoidance and distraction), which can maintain anxiety. We investigated whether coping socialization was associated with anxious and healthy adolescents' neural response to threat, and whether neural activation was associated with disengaged coping. Healthy and clinically anxious early adolescents (N = 120; M = 11.46 years; 71 girls) and a parent engaged in interactions designed to elicit adolescents' anxiety and parents' response to adolescents' anxiety. Parents' use of reframing and problem solving statements was coded to measure coping socialization. In a subsequent visit, we assessed adolescents' neural response to threat words during a neuroimaging task. Adolescents' disengaged coping was measured using ecological momentary assessment. Greater coping socialization was associated with lower anterior insula and perigenual cingulate activation in healthy adolescents and higher activation in anxious adolescents. Coping socialization was indirectly associated with less disengaged coping for anxious adolescents through neural activation. Findings suggest that associations between coping socialization and early adolescents' neural response to threat differ depending on clinical status and have implications for anxious adolescents' coping.

AB Developmental patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms in early childhood have previously been related to anxiety and mood disorders in middle childhood. In the current study, trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms (1.5-10 years) were related to children's broader psychosocial and school-related functioning at 10 years. We included a population-based sample of 7499 children, for whom primary caregivers reported anxiety and depression symptoms on the Child Behavior Checklist, at children's ages of 1.5, 3, 6, and 10. Growth Mixture Modeling identified four distinct, gender-invariant, trajectories of anxiety and depression symptoms: low (82.4%), increasing (7.4%), decreasing (6.0%), and increasing symptoms up to age 6 followed by a decrease to age 10 (preschool-limited, 4.2%). Children with a non-Dutch ethnicity had lower odds to be in the increasing trajectory and higher odds to be in the decreasing and pre-school limited trajectory. Also, low maternal education predicted the decreasing and pre-school limited trajectory. Higher levels of psychopathology during pregnancy for both mothers and fathers predicted the increasing, decreasing, and preschool-limited trajectory, compared to the low trajectory. At age 10, children in the increasing and preschool-limited trajectory had diminished psychosocial outcomes (friendship-quality and self-esteem) and worse school-related outcomes (school performance and school problems). This study adds to current knowledge by demonstrating that developmental patterns of anxiety and depression symptoms in early childhood are related to broader negative outcomes in middle childhood. Child and family factors could guide monitoring of anxiety and depression symptoms in the general population and provide targets for prevention programs.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), or self-harming behavior without intent to die (Nock Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18, 78-83, 2009), is associated with distress and impairment across domains, including increased risk for suicidality (Kiekens et al. Journal of Affective Disorders, 239, 171-179, 2018). In adolescence, prevalence of NSSI is high (Swannell et al. Suicide and Life-threatening Behavior, 44, 273-303, 2014), and peer influence regarding NSSI is thought to be strong (Brechwald and Prinstein Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21, 166-79, 2011). Although concern regarding "clusters" of NSSI has long been documented, peer socialization of NSSI in adolescence is understudied. This paper tests peer influence on NSSI frequency within adolescent friendship dyads. Emotion regulation difficulties and friendship quality were evaluated as factors that may influence susceptibility to peer influence effects. Adolescents (N = 196, M age = 15.68, 69.9% female, 87.6% White) nested within 93 friendship dyads reported on their own NSSI frequency, difficulties in emotion regulation, and friendship quality at three time points spaced 3 months apart. Cross-lagged Actor-Partner Interdependence Models examined peer influence effects over time. Friends' Time 1 frequency of NSSI uniquely predicted adolescents' own NSSI frequency over 3 and 6 months, controlling for initial similarity among friends as well as individual risk factors for NSSI. Peer influence effects were strongest in adolescents with higher levels of emotion regulation difficulty but did not vary as a function of friendship quality. Friends' NSSI frequency is a significant and unique predictor of increases in adolescents' own NSSI frequency over time. Implications for interventions that leverage the important developmental context of peer relationships are discussed.

AB Previous work has shown that dampening appraisals (e.g., thinking "this is too good to last") reduce happiness and enhance sadness when adults recall positive events. In contrast, amplifying appraisals (e.g., thinking "this is the sign of good things to come") do not significantly alter affective experience during the same task. The present study examined whether this pattern holds in adolescence. Eighty-nine adolescents completed an uninstructed positive recall task before being randomized to either dampening, uninstructed control or amplifying instructions during a second positive recall task. Participants experienced a significantly smaller increase in happiness and a significantly less marked reduction in sadness when recalling a positive memory under dampening instructions, relative to both the amplifying and no instruction control conditions. There was no significant difference between the amplifying and control conditions. This broadly replicates adult findings, but the detrimental effects of dampening were less marked in adolescents than adults. Nevertheless, given that elevated dampening appraisals are associated with depressed mood, dampening may partly account for why depressed adolescents struggle to experience positive emotions, and represent a promising target for clinical intervention.

AB Purpose/Objective: Alexithymia refers to reduced emotional awareness and is associated with higher levels of burden and disability in adults with chronic pain. Limited research has examined alexithymia in adolescents with chronic pain. The current study aimed to (a) determine whether alexithymia was higher in adolescents with (vs. without) chronic pain and (b) examine the relationship between alexithymia and pain experiences in youth. Research Method/Design: We assessed alexithymia in 22 adolescents with chronic pain and in 22 adolescents without chronic pain (otherwise healthy), and its relation to pain experiences (i.e., self-reported pain intensity, pain bothersomeness, and pain interference), while controlling for the concomitant effects of psychological distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms). Results: After controlling for psychological distress, adolescents with versus without chronic pain had higher total alexithymia scores (p = .042; eta(2) = .10), and specifically, greater difficulty identifying feelings (p = .001; eta(2) = .23). Difficulty identifying feelings was related to worse pain interference (r = .55; p = .015) and pain bothersomeness (r = .55; p = .015). Conclusions/Implications: These preliminary findings suggest that adolescents with chronic pain may have greater difficulty identifying their emotions, and that this might be related to increased pain interference and pain bothersomeness.
   Impact and Implications
   Emerging research suggests that alexithymia can be reduced in targeted interventions for adults with chronic pain, and that changes in alexithymia are associated with improvements in pain experiences. Limited research examining the relationship between alexithymia and chronic pain in adolescents hinders the application of such research to pediatric samples. In this project, we took one step toward this larger goal by establishing preliminary findings regarding the association between alexithymia and pain in adolescents. Adolescents with chronic pain may have reduced ability to identify their feelings, compared to their peers without chronic pain. This may have implications for emotion regulation and mental health. This may also impact the delivery of psychological interventions to youth with chronic pain; for example, these youth may benefit from strategies to label and identify their emotions in therapy.

Only recently have we begun to explore the physiological nature of this effect and implications for the influence of social factors on individual regulation of emotion in children. Also not well understood is how contextual and experiential factors influence this relationship by impacting emotional regulation skill development in children; e.g., parents' experiences of trauma, loss, and stress may affect parenting behavior and child emotional and behavioral outcomes. To further advance our understanding, the present pilot study investigated how children, ages 9 to 14 years old, and their primary female caregivers (N = 41 dyads) respond physiologically to affective challenge, experienced both independently and jointly. Methods Using a community sample, we examined mother and child respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) while viewing a positive and negative video clip (task) either alone or jointly (condition). Further, we explored the influence of self-reported trauma/adversity experiences and symptoms and quality of parenting on RSA response in the dyads. Results Results indicate caregiver's RSA responses were lower across conditions but demonstrated greater increases during the joint sessions than their children. Also, child and caregiver characteristics played a complex role; e.g., caregivers were more likely to increase RSA when with their child if they perceived their child to be suffering greater symptoms of trauma exposure. Conclusions Caregivers may be suppressing their own arousal to play a regulatory role for the benefit of their children.

AB Objectives This study explores the relations between the functional subtypes of relational aggression (proactive and reactive) and difficulties with emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression). Further, it examines the moderating role of parental attachment including parental availability and dependency in these associations. Based on previous research, it was expected that difficulties in emotion regulation strategies would be associated with reactive but not with proactive relational aggression, and these links would be moderated by self-reported attachment quality to both parents. Methods Participants of the study were 518 Greek junior high school students (50% girls), aged between 12 t omicron 16 (M = 13.66, SD = 1.13) who completed a self-report questionnaire. Results The results showed that expressive suppression holds a positive association only with reactive but not with proactive relational aggression, while low maternal attachment security was linked to both proactive and reactive relational aggression. Moderation analyses also revealed that at low levels of perceived dependency on father the expressive suppression was negatively associated with student's engagement in proactive relational aggression. The findings also evidenced that gender differentiates adolescents' self-reported engagement in proactive RA and perceived dependency on father for males as well as cognitive reappraisal for females. Conclusions The importance of exploring interpersonal factors along with individual traits in the interpretation of relational aggression is discussed.

AB Objective: We evaluated whether initiating the Family Check-Up (FCU) during early childhood prevented a severe form of psychopathology in adolescence-co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems-and whether effects operated indirectly through early childhood maternal depression and parents' positive behavior support. Method: Participants were drawn from a randomized controlled trial of the FCU (50.2% FCU; 49.5% girls; 46.6% Caucasian, and 27.6% Black; 13.4% Hispanic/Latino). At Ages 2 and 3, mothers self-reported depression, and primary caregivers' (PCs') positive behavior support was coded by trained observers. PCs, alternate caregivers (ACs), and teachers reported on 14-year-olds' problem behaviors. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) identified problem behavior groups for each reporter. which were outcomes in multinomial logistic regressions (PC, n = 672; AC, n = 652; teacher, n = 667). Results: LPAs identified a low-problem, internalizing-only, externalizing-only, and co-occurringproblem group for each reporter. For PC- and AC-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, externalizingonly (p < .05), and internalizing-only (p < .05 for PC, p < 0.10 for AC) groups; these effects operated through maternal depression (p < .05). For teacher-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, internalizingonly, and externalizing-only (p < 0.05) groups; effects operated through positive behavior support (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Early delivery of the FCU indirectly prevented adolescents' co-occurring internalizing/externalizing problems in both home and school contexts by improving the quality of the early home environment.

AB Background and aims: We aimed to determine whether a second-order global competence latent factor could be identified as underlying relations between adolescent mental health, social skills, and academic functioning. A secondary aim was to test whether early childhood characteristics predict adolescent global competence. A final aim was to test differences in these models across youth with typical cognitive development (TD) or intellectual disability (ID).
   Methods and procedures: Participants were 246 youth with TD (n = 148) or ID (n = 98), with assessments from early childhood (3, 4, 5 years) and adolescence (13, 15). These youths' parents and teachers provided measures. A Multiple Indicator, Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model was tested using structural equation modeling, in which parenting, maternal depression, and emotional dysregulation in early childhood were entered as predictors of adolescent global competence.
   Outcomes and results: A second-order global competence factor emerged, and was predicted by early childhood variables. The final MIMIC model demonstrated excellent fit. Negative parenting in early childhood predicted lower adolescent global competence for both TD and ID youth. Maternal depression predicted adolescent global competence only for youth with ID, while emotion dysregulation predicted only for youth with TD.
   Conclusions and implications: Results have implications for longitudinal mechanisms of influence and early intervention targets for specific populations.

AB BACKGROUND A combination of increased suicide in the past decade, documented high rates of anxiety and depression, and the preponderance of other behavioral and emotional regulation challenges place black youth at risk for school suspension and involvement in the juvenile justice system. Pointing to deficits in black youth and their families negates how forces of racism, whether unconscious or conscious, can disrupt well-being. METHODS A framework for race-related trauma in the public education system illustrates the interplay between macro-level forces, such as institutional and symbolic racism, and micro level forces of racism such as racial discrimination and violence. Identifying causal links between these forces and adverse academic and health outcomes for black youth can inform interventions and strategies to reduce race-related trauma. RESULTS The framework for race-related trauma is a multi-level analysis of racism and recognizes school districts facing economic restraints and school personnel turnover may face significant challenges in designing intervening strategies. CONCLUSION The framework guides change effort towards improving school climate and culture through preparing school professionals to meet the diverse needs of youth, strengthening family and community collaboration, and tackling those policies and behaviors that exclude and disconnect black youth.

AB Co-occurring social-emotional problems are associated with increased risk of aggression and substance use. However, few studies examine their configurational patterns. This study identifies patterns of co-occurring social skills, anxiety, learning, and conduct problems among 2,632 urban boys at entry into sixth grade, and their related aggression and substance use trajectories through eighth grade. Latent class analysis revealed four patterns at school entry: "low-all," "poor social skills," "positive social skills," and "high all." Findings point to important variation in risk. Problem behaviors increased the least through middle school for the "low-all" pattern. The "positive social skills" pattern had an average increase, while the "poor social skills" pattern had higher levels of problem behaviors in sixth and seventh grade. The "high all" showed the fastest increase in problem behaviors and the highest levels in eighth grade. Discussion focuses on implications for a multi-tiered school-based system of supports for behavioral risk management.

AB Increasing research studies and data, mostly focused on Western countries, suggest a dynamic relationship between coping with anger and psychological risk factors among children. Although there are cultural variations in anger coping, little attention has been directed among non-Western children. The present study examined the diverse influence of six anger coping styles on friendship quality and mental health among Chinese adolescents. Six competing anger coping strategies were tested as potential predictor variables: direct anger-out, assertion, social support-seeking, diffusion, avoidance, and rumination. Friendship quality was examined as a potential mediator. Mediation analyses were conducted using path analysis. The results indicated that friendship quality fully mediated the influence of social support-seeking on mental health problems, and partially mediated the influence of assertion on mental health problems. Furthermore, the direct anger-out and rumination coping styles directly and positively predicted mental health problems. These findings partially support the Simple Incidental Model suggesting that the influence of anger coping styles on mental health problems is complex, and friendship quality can mediate this influence. The present study points to a malleable target for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at increasing the favorable impact of anger coping strategies on psychological adjustment during the developmentally critical period of adolescence.

AB Objective: The role of heterogeneous self-regulation deficits in ADHD has long been emphasized. Yet, longitudinal studies examining distinct self-regulation processes as prospective predictors of developmental change in ADHD symptoms spanning wide developmental periods are scarce. The aim of the current study was to examine affective and cognitive self-regulation as predictors of developmental change in ADHD symptoms from preschool to adolescence in a sample with one third of the children being at risk for developing an ADHD and/or ODD diagnosis. Method: At 5 years laboratory measures for hot and cool executive function (EF) and parental and teacher ratings were used for regulation of positive and negative emotionality. Symptoms of ADHD and ODD were measured at 5 and 13 years using parental and teacher ratings based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV). Results: Converging developmental paths in hyperactivity/impulsivity across time were found for those high versus low in early cognitive self-regulation, whereas the development of inattention symptoms diverged across time for those high versus low in early affective self-regulation. Conclusion: These results support the idea that different aspects of self-regulation are important for developmental change in the two separate ADHD symptom domains from preschool to adolescence.

This large-scale study was conducted to test, among Chinese adolescents, the associations of emotional and behavioral problems with single and multiple suicide attempts and whether these associations vary with adolescents' academic performance.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the 2019 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey (n = 20,702). Information about emotional and behavioral problems, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, academic performance, and sleep duration was gathered. Multinomial logistic regression models using Firth penalized likelihood approach and appropriate sampling weights were performed.
   Results: Compared with no suicide attempt, peer problems, emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity were associated with an elevated risk of both a single suicide attempt and multiple suicide attempts, respectively (P < 0.05); the magnitudes of these associations in multiple suicide attempters were higher than those in single suicide attempters. Further stratification analyses by academic performance showed a greater association of the four difficulties with multiple suicide attempts in adolescents reporting poor academic performance than in those with good or average academic performance.
   Limitations: The school-based study sample only included students, and causal inference could not be delineated due to the cross-sectional design.
   Conclusions: Emotional and behavioral problems are associated with an elevated risk of single and multiple suicide attempts with differences between multiple suicide attempters and single suicide attempters. Adolescent academic performance plays a modulating role in these associations for multiple suicide attempts.

AB Background There is a good deal of evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy is effective for children and adolescents with anxiety-related problems. In Japan, an anxiety prevention programme based on cognitive behavioural therapy called 'Journey of the Brave' has been developed, and it has been demonstrated to be effective for elementary school students (aged 10-11 years). The purpose of this study was to have classroom teachers deliver the programme to junior high school students (aged 12-13 years) and to test the feasibility and efficacy of the programme in this setting. Methods This study was a prospective observational study and was approved by the Chiba University Review Board. An intervention group consisting of six classes of students in their first year of junior high school at two different schools (n = 149; 81 boys, 68 girls) received seven 50-min programme sessions. Participants in the control group were recruited from four classes of students in their second year of junior high school at one school (n = 89; 51 boys, 38 girls). All participants completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale at pre-test, post-test, and 2-3 month follow-up. Statistical analysis was conducted using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures model. Results Mean total anxiety scores indicated a non-significant decrease at the 2-3 month follow-up for the intervention group compared to the control group. The group differences on the SCAS from baseline to post-test was - .71 (95% CI - 2.48 to 1.06, p = .43), and the 2-3 month follow-up was - .49 (95% CI - 2.60 to 1.61, p = .64). Conclusions In this pilot study, implementation of the programme confirmed the partial feasibility of the programme but did not elicit a significant reduction in anxiety scores. In addition, there are several methodological limitations to this study. In the future, we propose to test the feasibility and efficacy of the programme with the required sample size and by comparing groups with equal characteristics as well as by carrying out additional follow-up assessments.

AB This study aims to describe the psychological needs in children with celiac disease (CD) and to examine the feasibility of psychological consultation in a multidisciplinary clinic. Participants (N = 69) included children with CD and their parents who completed a pre-clinic mental health survey and a 30-min psychological consultation as part of a multidisciplinary clinic (including gastroenterology, nutrition, education, neurology, and neuropsychology). Quantitative and qualitative analyses examined psychological needs, experiences, and satisfaction. The psychologist identified clinically significant symptoms and provided referrals in 49% of children. There were no significant differences by time since CD diagnosis. During the psychology consultation, families discussed emotional adjustment, impact on life and physical well-being, and management of the gluten-free diet. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction from the clinic visit. We identified frequent psychological needs in pediatric CD. The multidisciplinary approach may be a feasible model for specialized, optimal treatment in this population.

AB This study assesses the relationship of parental anger on children's anger and self-derogation from adolescence to young adulthood. We examine a life-course perspective and incorporate theories of emotion regulation and self-referent behavior. Using structural equation models and hierarchical growth curve models with the Kaplan Longitudinal and Multigenerational data, the results indicate that parental anger leads to anger in adolescence, supporting theories of learning through modeling in adolescence. In young adulthood, as predicted by self-referent behavior theory, parental anger contributes to increases in self-derogation. Interestingly, maternal anger, but not paternal anger, is correlated with child's anger and self-derogation.

AB Shame plays a central role in social and self-development, particularly throughout childhood and adolescence. Nonetheless, shame can also be harmful if it involves unbearable and persistent feelings of being inferior, inadequate, and worthless. Gender differences in endorsing either internalizing/externalizing symptoms may reflect different ways of coping with shame rather than differences in the experience of shame per se. Using a community adolescent sample (n = 368; 65.8% female), this study investigated the role of external shame and shame coping strategies in the endorsement of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, looking at the moderator role of gender. Although gender differences were found in the endorsement of shame coping strategies and psychological symptoms, results indicated that gender had no impact on the pathways linking external shame and shame coping strategies to psychological symptoms. By clarifying the routes linking external shame to psychological symptoms, current findings may contribute to better define appropriate interventions for adolescents.

AB Despite the burgeoning interest in the relationships between parental emotion socialization practices, emotion regulation (ER), and anxiety in youth, there is considerably less research focusing on the ways in which parental emotion socialization in childhood is associated with these variables in adulthood. A sample of 202 university students completed an online survey, which aimed to examine the relationships between retrospective reports of parental emotion socialization strategies in childhood, ER in adulthood, and trait anxiety. Adult perceptions of their parents' use of unsupportive emotion socialization strategies in childhood was related to lower levels of ER skills and greater use of maladaptive ER strategies in adulthood, while perceptions of parents' use of supportive strategies were related to higher levels of ER skills and greater use of adaptive ER strategies. Together, adult perceptions of unsupportive parental emotion socialization strategies in childhood and their ER skills and ER strategy use in adulthood predicted trait anxiety.

AB Introduction and Aims Patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) and experience measures (PREM) for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment exist for adults but have unknown relevance for adolescents. This study aimed to explore adolescents' perceptions of effective SUD treatment and possible barriers to completing PROMs and PREMs to guide efforts to adapt the South African Addiction Treatment Services Assessment (SAATSA) for adolescents. Design and Methods Five focus groups were conducted with 38 adolescent service users recruited from residential and outpatient SUD treatment facilities in South Africa. Group discussions explored perceptions of treatment components necessary for desired SUD treatment outcomes, treatment experiences that support engagement in care, and perceptions of PROM and PREM completion. Results Participants viewed treatment elements that enhance motivation for change, coping and emotional regulation; provide recreational alternatives to substance use; and improve family relationships and home environments as critical to positive treatment outcomes. They reflected that provider characteristics and developmentally and culturally appropriate services facilitated engagement in treatment. PROM and PREM completion seemed acceptable, with participants suggesting ways to enhance their appeal. Discussion and Conclusion Findings confirm that adult-oriented PROMs and PREMs require adaptation for adolescents. Service user inputs identified ways to expand the content of the SAATSA to better reflect adolescents' treatment priorities. These inputs have also guided changes to item formulation and administration procedures to enhance the SAATSA's acceptability for adolescents. Ensuring the SAATSA addresses treatment outcomes and experiences that matter to adolescents is vital for generating information to guide improvements to adolescent SUD services.

AB Using a daily diary design and actigraphy sleep data across 2 weeks among 256 ethnic/racial minority adolescents (M-age = 14.72; 40% Asian, 22% Black, 38% Latinx; 2,607 days), this study investigated how previous-night sleep (duration, quality) moderated the same-day associations between ethnic/racial discrimination and stress responses (rumination, problem solving, family/peer support seeking) to predict daily well-being (mood, somatic symptoms, life satisfaction). On days when adolescents experienced greater discrimination, if they slept longer and better the previous night, adolescents engaged in greater active coping (problem solving, peer support seeking), and subsequently had better well-being. Adolescents also ruminated less when they slept longer the previous night regardless of discrimination. Findings highlight the role of sleep in helping adolescents navigate discrimination by facilitating coping processes.

AB Background Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic metabolic condition requiring intensive daily self-care to avoid both high and low blood glucose levels. Self-care and glycemic outcomes are particularly problematic in adolescence, a period known for its increased risk of emotional problems. However, the true scope of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescents with T1D is unknown. Earlier studies are limited by a small sample size, lack of diagnostic interview data, a focus on depression only, non-adolescent specific estimates, lack of information about parental emotional problems and/or a cross-sectional design. Diabetes LEAP is a two-year prospective observational cohort study examining (a) the prevalence and course of depression and anxiety in adolescents with T1D and their parents/caregivers, (b) the risk factors predicting the presence of these emotional problems, (c) their longitudinal relation with diabetes outcomes, and (d) the psychosocial care currently in place. Methods Adolescents (12-18 years) from 8 Dutch pediatric diabetes clinics are interviewed using the DISC-IV to establish the presence of mood and anxiety disorders in the previous 4 weeks, the previous 12 months, and lifetime. They also complete questionnaires, including CDI-2, GAD-7, and PAID-T. Parents/caregivers complete PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PAID-PR. Follow-up assessments take place after 1 and 2 years. Discussion This longitudinal study with diagnostic interviews in a large cohort of adolescents with T1D in the Netherlands will provide much needed information regarding the prevalence and course of depression and anxiety in this group, thereby opening avenues for proper recognition, prevention and timely treatment.

AB Functional neuroimaging results need to replicate to inform sound models of human social cognition and its neural correlates. Introspection, the capacity to reflect on one's thoughts and feelings, is one process required for normative social cognition and emotional functioning. Engaging in introspection draws on a network of brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), middle temporal gyri (MTG), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Maturation of these regions during adolescence mirrors the behavioral advances seen in adolescent social cognition, but the neural correlates of introspection in adolescence need to replicate to confirm their generalizability and role as a possible mechanism. The current study investigated whether reflecting upon one's own feelings of sadness would activate and replicate similar brain regions in two independent samples of adolescents. Participants included 156 adolescents (50% female) from the California Families Project and 119 adolescent girls from the Pittsburgh Girls Study of Emotion. All participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while completing the same facial emotion-processing task at age 16-17 years. Both samples showed similar whole-brain activation patterns when engaged in sadness introspection and when judging a nonemotional facial feature. Whole-brain activation was unrelated to ERQ scores in both samples. Neural responsivity to task manipulations replicated in regions recruited for socio-emotional (mPFC, PCC, MTG, TPJ) and attention (dorsolateral PFC, precentral gyri, superior occipital gyrus, superior parietal lobule) processing. These findings demonstrate robust replication of neural engagement during sadness introspection in two independent adolescent samples.

AB Background Corticosteroid-induced psychiatric disorders (CIPDs) represent an adverse effect that can cause severe emotional and behavioral problems. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence and risk factors of CIPDs.
   Methods A retrospective analysis of 92 pediatric and young adult patients with hematologic malignancies was conducted.
   Results The incidence of CIPDs in patients receiving a treatment regimen with prednisolone or dexamethasone was 64.9% and 77.5%, respectively, both of which were significantly higher than that in patients not receiving corticosteroids. Independent risk factors and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) related to severe CIPD were 2.15 (1.11-4.18) for dexamethasone (using prednisolone as the reference) and 0.81 (0.75-0.87) for age, suggesting that the odds increase with decreasing age. Frequently observed symptoms, respectively in terms of behavioral and emotional problems were defiance, crying, psychomotor excitement, dysphoria, irritability, and depression. To our knowledge, this is the first report to mention the risk factors and characteristics for clinical symptoms of CIPDs during the developmental process.
   Conclusions Healthcare professionals should predict and prepare for psychiatric adverse events prior to chemotherapy in the clinical settings, especially in patients in younger age and receiving a treatment regimen with dexamethasone.

AB Objectives Previous research has focused on interviewing parents who had engaged or dropped out of preventive parenting programs for adolescent mental health about factors associated with overall engagement. However, it is unknown if these factors are similar for non-engaged parents in regards to their intention to enroll or if we require alternative strategies to increase initial enrollment. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the factors related to non-engaged parents' intention to enroll. Methods An iterative thematic qualitative approach was used. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 43 participants across three stakeholder groups: (1) non-engaged parents (parents of adolescents who were aware of the availability of a preventive parenting program and had not engaged; n = 17); (2) parenting program facilitators (n = 11); and (3) high school staff members who have referred parents to preventive parenting programs; n = 15). Participants were mostly female (86%; n = 37) and aged between 20 and 69 years. Transcriptions were analyzed using inductive and deductive methods. Results The findings are presented in four themes: (1) beliefs, attitudes, and concerns of parents; (2) attitudes and behaviors of significant others; (3) preventive parenting program-related factors; and (4) possible engagement solutions. Conclusions We found that parents' experiences of non-engagement were related to various personal, inter-personal and program-related factors. However, the increase of several key solutions, such as development of online programs, could increase non-engaged parents' intention to enroll.

AB Juvenile onset of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with increased likelihood of recurrent episodes of depression and more detrimental clinical trajectories. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of juvenile onset of MDD on emotion regulation as measured by self-report and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether juvenile onset impacted the association between rumination and depressive symptoms. Sixty-four individuals with at least three prior episodes of MDD were recruited and filled out self-report questionnaires measuring rumination and emotion regulation abilities. In addition, electrocardiographic assessments were used to calculate HRV. Based on self-reported age of MDD onset, individuals were divided in two groups: Juvenile onset of MDD (first MDD episode before the age of 18, n = 30) and adult onset of MDD (first MDD episode after the age of 18, n = 34). Results showed that individuals whose first depressive episode occurred in childhood and adolescence reported more rumination and less emotional clarity compared to individuals who had their first episode of MDD in adulthood. Moreover, the tendency to ruminate was strongly associated with depressive symptoms in the juvenile onset of MDD group, whereas no such association was found in the adult onset group. There was no significant group difference for HRV. The findings are discussed in light of existing literature, in addition to suggesting how our findings may inform clinical practice and future research. We conclude that juvenile onset of MDD may lead to difficulties in emotion regulation and that these difficulties may increase depressive symptoms and vulnerability for relapse in this particular subgroup.

AB Although prior research has demonstrated that switching schools poses a risk for academic and behavioral functioning among adolescents, relatively little is known about their emotional adjustment, or how it affects emotional well-being. Moreover, the cumulative effects of multiple risk and protective factors on their emotional well-being are even less covered in the existing literature. Guided by a risk and resilience ecological framework, the current study compared emotional well-being, operationalized as positive affect and negative affect, between Chinese adolescents who had switched schools and their non-switch counterparts, and examined the direct and interactive effects of teacher autonomy support and two facets of grit (i.e., perseverance and consistency) on emotional well-being in both groups. A propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the two groups in terms of sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and socioeconomic status). A total of 371 adolescents who had switched schools and 742 non-switch counterparts aged from 13 to 18 years were involved in this study. Results indicated that adolescents who had switched schools reported higher levels of negative affect than their non-switch counterparts. Moreover, for adolescents who had switched schools, those who possessed higher levels of perseverance had a significantly negative association between teacher autonomy support and negative affect; however, the corresponding association was independent of perseverance for their non-switch counterparts. The current findings indicate that switching schools is a disadvantage for adolescents' emotional states. However, teacher autonomy support and perseverance can protect adolescents who switch schools as critical stress-buffering factors against these negative feelings.

AB Objectives Parents' own emotion dysregulation and their socialization of emotions have been found to predict offspring's emotion dysregulation, but little is known about how these factors interact to predict young adults' emotion dysregulation. Thus, we aimed to examine whether each of three forms of parental responses to their offspring's negative emotions (i.e., supportive, harsh, distressed) predicted young adults' emotion dysregulation, particularly for young adults whose parents did not present emotional difficulties. Methods One hundred and twenty-two young adults (M-age = 22.37 years, SDage = 2.23, age range: 18-26 years) and their primary parents were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Young adults and their primary parents reported on their own emotion dysregulation, and primary parents reported their supportive, harsh, and distressed responses to young adults' negative emotions. Results For distressed parental responses and supportive emotion-related socialization, the interaction effect between emotion dysregulation and their emotion socialization strategies was significantly related to young adults' emotion dysregulation, Fs(6) = 6.70 and 6.58, ps < 0.001, for distressed responses and supportive socialization, respectively. When parents' harsh responses to negative emotions were examined, only the main effects of harsh responses and parents' own emotion dysregulation predicted young adults' emotion dysregulation, F(5) = 4.55, p < 0.001. Conclusions Results highlight that both specific socialization strategies and parents' own regulatory characteristics are important in young adults' emotional experience. Further, if parents are not well-regulated emotionally, changes in their responses to young adults' negative emotions may not be effective.

AB As American school districts become increasingly diverse, understanding the processes that promote positive intergroup relations is a critical task. The role of cross-ethnic friendships is one important factor, given the significance of these reciprocated peer relationships for social development. The current study examines the short-term longitudinal impact of cross-ethnic friendships on peer group attitudes and emotional adjustment. 524 student participants (54.8% female; M-age = 15.06 years, SD = 0.75; 47% Latino, 53% Asian-American) were followed for one year with two spring data collections. Students completed a self-report inventory assessing depressive symptoms and a peer nomination inventory assessed friendship, liking, disliking, popularity, and unpopularity. Cross-ethnic friendships were predictive of positive attitudes toward peers from other ethnic/racial groups and were also linked to declines in depressive symptoms for boys. Moreover, these positive effects did not come at a social cost, as cross-ethnic friendships were not associated with rejection by same-ethnic peers. Cross-ethnic friendships provide a unique environment that contributes to positive intergroup attitudes and beneficial socioemotional development for some youth.

AB Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are important characteristics for identifying severe patterns of conduct problems (CP). The current study focused on (a) identifying subgroups of young children displaying a combination of CP and CU behaviors and (b) examining the extent to which executive functioning (EF) and emotion regulation (ER) are associated with CU behaviors. Participants included 249 preschoolers (N =?249, 78% boys, M-age?=?4.95?years; 81% Latino/Hispanic) referred to treatment because of externalizing behavior problems. CU behaviors and CP were measured via a combination of teacher/parent rating scales. A multimethod approach was used to measure EF and ER including parent/teacher rating scales, neuropsychological, and observational tasks. Poorer ER as rated by parents/teachers and observed was associated with greater levels of CU behaviors. Latent profile analyses identified three subgroups of children displaying (a) low CU/low CP, (b) moderate CU/moderate CP, and (c) high CU/high CP. Children in the high CU/high-CP group were rated as having significantly poorer rated ER compared to all other groups and poorer observed ER compared to the low-CU/low-CP group. Exploratory analyses found that children in the high-CU/high-CP group displayed marginally lower levels of rated ER but significantly better EF performance on standardized neuropsychological tasks compared to children in a low-CU/high-CP group.Children with higher levels of reported CU behaviors and CP display poorer ER yet may display relatively better EF performance compared to children with lower levels of CU behaviors and CP.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not uncommon among adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Left untreated, transition to adulthood might be especially challenging and/or prolonged for AYAs. However, it is unclear whether AYAs are adequately represented in current PTSD treatment research and whether they benefit to the same degree as younger or older individuals. In the first part of the paper, we reflect on developmental considerations in the treatment of AYAs and give an overview of current age-specific results in PTSD treatment research. Furthermore, we review individual trauma-focused evidence-based treatments that were examined in AYAs over the last 10 years. In the second part, we present data from an uncontrolled feasibility trial evaluating cognitive processing therapy (CPT) with some age-adapted modifications and an exposure component (written accounts). We treated 17 AYAs (aged 14 to 21) suffering from posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). At posttreatment, participants had improved significantly with respect to clinician-rated PTSS severity (d = 1.32). Treatment gains were maintained throughout the 6-week and 6-month follow-ups. Results indicated that CPT, with only minor adaptations, was feasible and safe in AYAs. The recommendations for future research focus on the inclusion of young adults in trials with adolescents, more refined age reporting in clinical trials, and the encouragement of dismantling studies in youth. To conclude, clinical recommendations for caregiver involvement and the addressing of developmental tasks, motivational issues and emotion regulation problems are discussed.

AB During adolescence, interpersonal stressors such as peer rejection pose challenges to emotion regulation. Yet, very little is known about how these transactional processes unfold in adolescents' daily lives. This study investigated adolescents' (a) emotional reactivity to daily perceptions of peer rejection, which concerns concurrent changes in negative and positive emotions, and (b) emotional recovery from daily perceptions of peer rejection, which concerns subsequent changes in negative and positive emotions. Because depressive symptoms can compromise effectiveness of emotion regulation, it was investigated as a moderator for emotional reactivity and recovery to daily perceptions of peer rejection. The sample consisted of 303 adolescents (59% girls; M-age = 14.20, SD = 0.54; range 13-16 years) who reported depressive symptoms at baseline and completed ecological momentary assessments of emotions and perceived peer rejection at nine random time-points per day for six consecutive days. Results from multi-level modeling analyses showed that perceived peer rejection was related to emotional reactivity (i.e., higher levels of negative emotions and lower levels of positive emotions). This effect was stronger for those with higher depressive symptoms. For emotional recovery, perceived peer rejection had lasting effects on adolescents' negative emotions, but was not related to positive emotions. Depressive symptoms did not moderate effects of perceived peer rejection on emotional recovery. This study provides a more nuanced understanding of how depressive symptoms amplify the emotional impact of perceived peer rejection in adolescents' day-to-day lives.

AB Multi-family therapy for Bulimia Nervosa (MFT-BN) was developed in response to the modest outcomes following both Family Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy for adolescents with BN. BN impacts individuals and their family members with high levels of carer stress. MFT-BN targets barriers to treatment including low motivation to change, hostility and criticism, negative affect alongside emotion dysregulation and common comorbidities. MFT-BN enhances treatment, providing a community of support and acquisition of emotional regulation and interpersonal skills. The study describes the clinical characteristics of the group of participants to whom MFT-BN is offered and presents the outcomes of families who have participated in it. Prior to MFT-BN, adolescents who received it were more likely to have self-harmed and had elevated levels of eating disordered cognitions than those who did not receive MFT-BN. Following MFT-BN, parents report decreases in the negative experiences of caregiving and in their own symptoms of anxiety. Adolescents report reductions in anxiety and depression alongside improvement in emotion regulation. Improvements in symptoms of eating disorders include reductions in eating disorder cognitions and modest reductions in binge and purge symptoms after 14 weeks of treatment. Adolescents who participated in MFT-BN were less likely to drop out of outpatient treatment.

AB The study aimed to examine two constructs: general mentalizing processes and the specific component of affective mentalizing regarding self and others alongside the construct of affect regulation patterns in female adolescent and young adult inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 41), depression (n = 20) and controls (n = 53). We further examined the predictive ability of affect regulation to eating-disorder (ED) symptoms beyond that of the mentalizing variables, and their potential role in mediating between mentalizing, depression and ED symptoms. We used tools assessing reflective functioning (RF), complex emotion recognition and theory of mind (ToM), alexithymia, affect regulation, depression, and ED symptoms. The AN and depression groups exhibited lower general mentalizing and higher alexithymia, emotional reactivity, and emotional cutoff patterns than controls, but showed no greater disturbance in ToM. The two clinical groups did not differ on any of these variables. Elevated mentalizing and adequate affect regulation patterns separately predicted lower severity of ED symptoms. Nonetheless, affect regulation did not add to the predictive value of mentalizing variables. Specifically, elevated alexithymia, and depressive symptomatology, but not RF, predicted greater ED symptomatology. Moreover, alexithymia directly accounted for elevated ED symptoms and also indirectly connected with ED symptoms via emotional hyperactivation and elevated depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that deficiencies in mentalization and affect regulation are not unique to AN, but may rather associated with psychopathology in general. Nonetheless, alexithymia and depression may increase ED-related symptomatology. Affect regulation deficiencies are mainly related with depressive symptoms and emotional hyperactivation is indirectly related with AN via the depressive symptoms.

AB Background: In 2018, >75,000 children were newly affected by the diagnosis of advanced cancer in a parent. Unfortunately, few programs exist to help parents and their children manage the impact of advanced disease together as a family. The Enhancing Connections-Palliative Care (EC-PC) parenting program was developed in response to this gap. Objective: (1) Assess the feasibility of the EC-PC parenting program (recruitment, enrollment, and retention); (2) test the short-term impact of the program on changes in parent and child outcomes; and (3) explore the relationship between parents' physical and psychological symptoms with program outcomes. Design: Quasi-experimental two-group design employing both within- and between-subjects analyses to examine change over time and change relative to historical controls. Parents participated in five telephone-delivered and fully manualized behavioral intervention sessions at two-week intervals, delivered by trained nurses. Behavioral assessments were obtained at baseline and at three months on parents' depressed mood, anxiety, parenting skills, parenting self-efficacy, and symptom distress as well as children's behavioral-emotional adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, and anxiety/depression). Subjects: Parents diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer and receiving noncurative treatment were eligible for the trial provided they had one or more children aged 5-17 living at home, were able to read, write, and speak English, and were not enrolled in a hospice program. Results: Of those enrolled, 62% completed all intervention sessions and post-intervention assessments. Within-group analyses showed significant improvements in parents' self-efficacy in helping their children manage pressures from the parent's cancer; parents' skills to elicit children's cancer-related concerns; and parents' skills to help their children cope with the cancer. Between-group analyses revealed comparable improvements with historical controls on parents' anxiety, depressed mood, self-efficacy, parenting skills, and children's behavioral-emotional adjustment. Conclusion: The EC-PC parenting program shows promise in significantly improving parents' skills and confidence in supporting their child about the cancer. Further testing of the program is warranted.

AB Trauma research has traditionally focused on altered emotion regulation and its role in psychopathology, whereas mechanisms of social behavior remain comparatively unexplored, particularly among adolescents. It has been previously reported that adolescents with histories of interpersonal violence (IV) demonstrate disrupted social learning, and the degree to which they are impaired during social interactions requiring trustful behaviors may be associated with their levels of anxiety. In the present study, 52 adolescent females (n = 26 control; n = 26 IV-exposed) between ages of 11 and 17 completed a multi-round adaptation of the Trust Game in which they interacted with a confederate peer run by a computer program, alternating between the roles of investor and investee. The task was designed to operationalize the social behaviors of trust and trust reciprocity, where the magnitude of the participants' monetary investment in the confederate during the investor role represented trust while the proportion of investment returned to the confederate in the investee role represented trust reciprocity. IV-exposed and control participants did not differ in trust (i.e., as investors); however, IV-exposed participants without anxiety diagnoses demonstrated lower trust than those with anxiety diagnoses. For trust reciprocity (i.e., as investees), there were again no differences between IV-exposed participants and controls; however, IV-exposed participants with anxiety diagnoses had increased trust reciprocity compared with both other groups. Similarly, caregiver-reported anxiety symptoms were associated with trust reciprocity behaviors among the IV-exposed adolescents. Findings suggest that IV exposure and associated anxiety impacts adolescents' trust behaviors, demonstrating potential mechanisms for maladaptive social behavior among trauma-exposed youth.

AB Objectives This study is to investigate the role of cognitive emotion regulation in the relationship between parenting styles and health risk behavior in left-behind children. Methods Totally, 404 left-behind children were surveyed with the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran (EMBU), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Chinese Version (CERQ-C) and the Adolescent Health Related Risky Behavior Inventory (AHRBI). Results The results showed that: (1) The health risk behaviors of left-behind children were significantly negatively correlated with authoritative parenting styles (r = -0.46 to -0.26, P < 0.01) and positive cognitive emotion regulations (except Acceptance, r = -0.44 to -0.19, P < 0.01), and significantly positively correlated with authoritarian & permissive/neglecting parenting styles (r = 0.19-0.40, P < 0.01) and negative cognitive emotion regulations (except Self-blame, r = 0.25-0.52, P < 0.01). (2) Authoritative parenting styles were significantly positively correlated with positive cognitive emotion regulations (r = 0.13-0.47, P < 0.01), and significantly negatively correlated with negative cognitive emotion regulations (except Self-blame, r = -0.21 to -0.30, P < 0.01). Authoritarian & permissive/neglecting parenting styles were significantly negatively correlated with positive cognitive emotion regulations (r = -0.19 to -0.11, P < 0.05), and significantly positively correlated with negative cognitive emotion regulations (except Self-blame, r = 0.12-0.38, P < 0.05). (3) The structural equation models demonstrated that cognitive emotion regulation served as a partial mediator between authoritative, authoritarian and permissive/neglecting parenting styles and the health risk behaviors of left-behind children, accounting for the total effect from 7.55% to 66.92%. Conclusions The results suggests that parenting styles impact the health risk behaviors in left-behind children mainly via the mediating effect of cognitive emotion regulation.

AB Mindfulness-based interventions have previously been shown to have positive effects on psychological well-being. However, the time commitment, teacher shortage, and high cost of classic mindfulness interventions may have hindered efforts to spread the associated benefits to individuals in developing countries. Brief mindfulness meditation (BMM) has recently received attention as a way to disseminate the benefits of mindfulness-based interventions. Most existing BMM methods are adaptations of the classic approach. Few studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of BMM. We developed a 15-min BMM named JW2016, which is based on the core concepts of mindfulness, Anapanasati (breath meditation of Buddhist Vipassana), our practical experience, and the results of scientific reports on meditation. We investigated the effects of this BMM on mood and emotion processing in an effort to create an effective, convenient, safe, and standardized BMM method that could benefit individuals with limited time or money to devote to meditation. Forty-six healthy participants (aged 18-25 years) were randomly allocated to the BMM group (n = 23) or the emotional regulation education (ERE) control group (n = 23). Forty-two of the study participants cooperated fully in all measurements and interventions (one time daily for seven consecutive days). Mood was measured with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D) and the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI). Emotion processing was evaluated by assessing performance on an emotion intensity task, an emotional memory task, and an emotional dot-probe task. After intervention, the BMM group, but not the ERE group, showed a significant decreases in emotional intensity in response to positive as well as negative emotional stimuli, response time for emotional memory, and duration of attention bias toward negative emotional stimuli. Negative effects on mood state were found in the ERE group but not in the BMM group. This study demonstrated that BMM may improve aspects of emotion processing such as emotion intensity, emotional memory, and emotional attention bias. JW2016 BMM may be an effective, convenient, safe and standardized way to help practitioners remain focused and peaceful without any negative effect on emotion.

AB This study aimed to (1) investigate the variation in self ascription to gender roles and attitudes toward gender roles across countries and its associations with crying behaviors, emotion change, and beliefs about crying and (2) understand how the presence of others affects our evaluations of emotion following crying. This was a large international survey design study (N = 893) conducted in Australia, Croatia, the Netherlands, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Analyses revealed that, across countries, gender, self-ascribed gender roles, and gender role attitudes (GRA) were related to behavioral crying responses, but not related to emotion change following crying. How a person evaluates crying, instead, appeared to be highly related to one's beliefs about the helpfulness of crying, irrespective of gender. Results regarding crying when others were present showed that people are more likely both to cry and to feel that they received help around a person that they know, compared to a stranger. Furthermore, closeness to persons present during crying did not affect whether help was provided. When a crier reported that they were helped, they also tended to report feeling better following crying than those who cried around others but did not receive help. Few cross-country differences emerged, suggesting that a person's responses to crying are quite consistent among the countries investigated here, with regard to its relationship with a person's gender role, crying beliefs, and reactions to the presence of others.

AB To ameliorate the public health problem of adolescent suicide, it is imperative to go beyond simply establishing which factors increase risk. Multiple factors often interact in such a way that escalates suicide risk, and some combinations may be particularly perilous. Therefore, it is essential to examine the sequence and interplay of these various contributors to understand how they interact to confer risk. To enhance our understanding of this process, we used qualitative in-depth interviews with 20 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents who had recently made a suicide attempt to investigate the factors that contributed to their attempts. In this qualitative analysis we 1) identified 16 separate factors that contributed to their suicide attempts, and 2) focused on the sequence and interplay between these factors in order to better understand why adolescents attempt suicide, with specific attention to which factors facilitated the transition from suicide ideation to action. Findings demonstrated that the strain caused by historical, sociocultural, and interpersonal factors alone was not enough to result in adolescents attempting suicide. For all but two participants, it was the interaction of intrapersonal factors that appeared to distort cognitions and/or elevate emotions to the point where they became intolerable and suicide became a viable option. These intrapersonal factors appeared to be the catalyst in the process from suicide ideation to action. Our findings suggest the need for specific strategies that address cognitive distortions, emotion dysregulation, and feelings of invalidation and entrapment as potential targets for interventions and prevention practices with adolescents at risk for suicide.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and heterogeneous mental disorder that is known to have the onset in young age, often in adolescence. For this reason, it is of fundamental importance to identify clinical conditions of childhood and adolescence that present a high risk to evolve in BPD. Investigations indicate that early borderline pathology (before 19 years) predict long-term deficits in functioning, and a higher percentage of these patients continue to present some BPD symptoms up to 20 years. There is a general accordance among investigators that good competence in both childhood and early adulthood is the main predictive factor of excellent recovery in BPD patients. Some authors suggest that specific childhood personality traits can to be considered precursors of adult BPD, as well as some clinical conditions: disruptive behaviours, disturbance in attention and emotional regulation, conduct disorders, substance use disorders, and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Unfortunately, diagnosis and treatment of BPD is usually delayed, also because some clinicians are reluctant to diagnose BPD in younger individuals. Instead, the early identification of BPD symptoms have important clinical implications in terms of precocious intervention programs, and guarantees that young people with personality disorders obtain appropriate treatments. This review is aimed to collect the current evidences on early risk and protective factors in young people that may predict BPD onset, course, and outcome.

AB Background: Both depression and anxiety (two of the most common internalizing psychopathologies among youths) are associated with difficulties in emotion regulation (ER). Little is known about whether anxiety as a comorbid condition has an effect on the habitual use of different ER strategies in youngsters with depression histories. We aimed 1) to compare ER in adolescents with histories of childhood onset major depressive disorder (MDD) with and without comorbid anxiety and 2) to examine whether certain ER response clusters (Cognitive, Social, and Behavioral/Physical) characterize comorbid children and adolescents.
   Methods: We analyzed data on 217 youth (11-18 years old) with depression history: 85 subjects with lifetime anxiety comorbidity (comorbid group) and 132 without lifetime anxiety (non-comorbid group). Psychiatric diagnosis was established by a comprehensive Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV-based diagnostic procedure. ER strategies were examined via the self-rated "Feelings and Me" Child version questionnaire (FAM-C).
   Results: The comorbid group used maladaptive ER strategies significantly more frequently than the non-comorbid youngsters. The Behavioral/Physical and Social ER skills, especially those reflecting social withdrawal and self-harm, were responsible for the higher maladaptive scores.
   Limitations: Because our study is a cross-sectional analysis, we have no information about the development or the onset of maladaptive ER strategies. Therefore, we were unable to examine whether maladaptive ER was a risk factor or a consequence of the internalizing psychopathology and comorbidity.
   Conclusions: Comorbid anxiety worsens the impaired use of ER strategies in depression-prone youths. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore the causal role of dysfunctional ER in the development of internalizing psychopathology.

AB Background: Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) may have a stressful impact on the everyday life of children and parents, and it may represent a cumulative stress factor increasing feelings of "learned helplessness."
   Methods: The current study investigated parental stress in a group of parents (n = 330) of children affected by PMNE, compared to a group of parents (n = 330) of typical developing children (TDC). In addition, the study evaluated whether parents of PMNE children experience more emotional, social, and behavioral problems in their children, compared to parents of TDC. Finally, the study correlated frequency of enuresis with stress values and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) subscales and total stress with CBCL. Both groups were given The Parental Stress Inventory-Short Form (PSI-SF) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: Parents of PMNE children showed significantly higher stress level than parents of TDC. Nocturnal enuresis, as a demanding clinical condition difficult to control, represents a relevant stress factor. Mothers appeared as more vulnerable to stress than fathers. Parents of PMNE children reported higher behavioral and emotional problems, compared to reports of parents of TDC. PMNE children appeared to their parents as having lower competency in social activities, school performance, and social relationships than TDC. Moreover, they were rated as more withdrawn, anxious-depressed, more aggressive, inattentive, and withmore somatic complaints than healthy children. It was always the mother who rated a significantly higher number of emotional, social, and behavioral problems compared to fathers. Correlational analysis showed that the higher the frequency of enuresis, the greater the parental stress level, the lower the social activities, school performance and relational competencies and the higher the emotional, social and behavioral problems in children, according to the parents' evaluations. The greater the parental stress level, the lower the competencies rated and the higher the behavioral problems detected by parents.
   Conclusion: The physicians who deal with PMNE children have taken into account the stressful role and emotional dimensions of this clinical condition, both for children and mothers, in order to improve clinical management. Psychological support is needed for parents, and mothers especially, for a more functional stress management related to the PMNE.

AB Identifying the neural correlates of positive interactions between friendship dyads may provide insights into mechanisms associated with adolescent social development. Forty-eight 14- to 18-year-old typically developing adolescents were video-recorded discussing a shared positive event with a close friend and subsequently viewed clips during an fMRI scan of that friend during the interaction and of an unfamiliar peer in a similar interaction. Adolescents also reported on their positive affect in daily life while with friends using ecological momentary assessment. We used multivariate repeated measures models to evaluate how positive affect with friends in the laboratory and in daily life was associated with neural response to friend and stranger positive and neutral clips. Adolescents who exhibited more positive affect when with friends in the laboratory showed less dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to friend positive clips. More positive affect when with friends in daily life was associated with less bilateral anterior insula response to friend positive clips, but greater left anterior insula response to stranger positive clips. Findings provide information on the role of lateral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula in enjoyment of friendships during adolescence.

AB Over 20 years of research has shown that social exclusion is a pervasive and powerful form of social threat. Social exclusion causes a wide variety of negative outcomes including negative emotions and threats to fundamental human needs (i.e., self-esteem). Most importantly, experiencing exclusion during childhood or adolescence can provoke long-term negative effects such as depression and anxiety disorders. Despite the growing interest in this domain, only recent studies have started to examine possible coping strategies to contrast the negative effects of exclusion. In this article, we first review the empirical findings concerning the consequences of social exclusion in children and adolescent populations. Second, we focus on cognitive and socio-emotional strategies that children and adolescents can use to deal with exclusion when it has occurred. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Objectives Evidence of the acceptability and potential efficacy of mindfulness strategies with at-risk youth is mounting. Yet only a few studies have assessed these strategies among youth experiencing homelessness (YEH). Methods We conducted a mixed methods feasibility study of an adapted mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) with sheltered YEH. The MBI consisted of five 1.5-h sessions delivered at a youth homeless shelter over 2.5 weeks. A one-group pre/post-test design was utilized to collect quantitative assessments of real-time cognitions followed by qualitative inquiry to assess participants' experiences and perceptions of the intervention. Results Participants (N = 39) were between 18-21 years old with the majority identifying as male (56.4%), heterosexual (74.4%), Black (51.3%) and Hispanic (15.4%). Attendance was challenging for participants (2.2 sessions attended on average) who had varying work and school obligations. However, pre-post session survey data completeness was excellent (92% completion rate). Participants completed self-report surveys prior to and after each session that measured affect. Significant improvement in pre-post session outcomes were found for frustration, restlessness, stress, depression, boredom, and mindlessness. Participants reported high levels of acceptability of the curriculum content and delivery format. However, several substantial adaptations that youth identified may improve feasibility and acceptability among YEH. The results are limited by the small sample size and the use of a curriculum not developed with or for YEH. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential feasibility of using MBIs among YEH although adaptations to existing curricula are necessary to increase relevance, acceptability of, and access to MBIs among YEH.

AB BACKGROUND: Cyberbullying, has concerned professionals due to increased use of media over time and as predicted, this type of bullying is fairly common among adolescents. We aimed to define the prevalence of cyberbullying and cyber victimization, examine relationships between problematic smartphone (SP) use (PSU), psychiatric symptoms and emotion regulation difficulties in a clinical adolescent sample. Also, we aimed to predict risk factors of being an E-Victim and E-Bully.
   METHODS: One hundred and fifty adolescents have recruited the study. Demographic Information Form, Problematic Mobile Phone Usage Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, E-Victimization-E-Bullying Scale were filled out by adolescents.
   RESULTS: Our results indicated that the prevalence of cybervictimization and cyberbullying were 62.6% and 53.3%, respectively. BEVEB (Both E-Victim and E-Bully) group adolescents were older than NVB (Non-Victim/Bully) groups. Access internet via own SP, PSU, problems in strategies and impulse control and were significantly higher and "lack of awareness" scores were significantly lower in BEVEB group than others. In addition, when compared with OEV (only E-Victims) group, BEVEB group had also higher hostility scores. Logistic regression analysis revealed that high scores of "lack of awareness" and higher E-bullying scores increase the risk of being an E-Victim; and higher scores of hostility and E-victimization and lower scores of "lack of awareness" (in other words being more aware of feelings) increase the risk of being an E-bully.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to analyses, contrary to our expectations, PSU was important but not an independent predictor of being an E-Victim/E-Bully. Our results also demonstrated an interesting finding: lack of awareness is a risk factor for being an E-victim. We interpreted this result as could not be aware of feelings increase the victimization risk. On the other hand, E-Bullies have higher hostility and victimization while having lower "lack of awareness" scores. It could be speculated that, re-victimization and being aware of hostility feelings could increase the cyberbullying among adolescents. In addition being an E-Bully could be a consequence of being an E-victim and increasing hostility and awareness over time. These results should be re-examined in larger clinical samples.

AB hildhood trauma has been identified as a strong risk factor for non-suicidal self- injury (NSSI; Gratz, 2006). Existing literature suggests that the degree of betrayal involved in a traumatic experience may have an impact on NSSI behaviors (Gomez & Freyd, 2013), but little work has examined the potential relationship between betrayal trauma and NSSI. This cross-sectional study examined the association between history of high betrayal trauma and engagement in NSSI, as well as explored shame and emotion dysregulation as potential mediators of the association. A total of 100 adolescent offenders in Singapore were recruited from a probation setting, and administered measures assessing betrayal trauma, shame, emotion dysregulation, and NSSI behaviors. A history of high betrayal trauma was significantly associated with both lifetime and past-year engagement in NSSI. Mediation analysis using bootstrap resampling indicated that both shame and emotion dysregulation individually mediated the association between high betrayal trauma and frequency of past-year NSSI. In a multiple mediation analysis, emotion dysregulation emerged as a significant mediator of the association, whereas shame did not. The findings highlight the importance of betrayal trauma as a correlate of NSSI, and point to emotion dysregulation as a key mechanism underlying the relationship between betrayal trauma and NSSI.

AB In order to gain insight in empathic deficits in juveniles with severe antisocial problems and psychopathic traits, self-reported psychopathic traits and trait empathy were assessed in 416 detained male juveniles. State empathy was assessed by self-reported empathic and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to sad film clips. Psychopathic traits were significantly negatively correlated with empathy, although not with ANS responses. Individuals reporting no empathy showed significantly less heart rate withdrawal compared to individuals reporting higher empathy. This implies that physiological responses may be helpful in identifying juveniles with severely impaired empathic functioning, even in a severely antisocial sample.

AB This study examined the effects of sharing schadenfreude with friends on late adolescents' self-esteem. University students (242 men; 238 women) were presented with scenarios depicting a deserved failure of a superior rival classmate and sharing schadenfreude. Participants' state self-esteem was measured both before the rival's misfortune and after sharing schadenfreude and was compared with that of participants presented with the non-sharing scenario. Whereas experiencing schadenfreude enhanced late adolescents' state self-esteem regardless of the level of envy toward the rival, sharing schadenfreude with a best friend was not associated with further increases in self-esteem. When discussing the very well-deserved misfortune of others, the listener will likely react similarly to the expresser; thus, expressing schadenfreude may not bring about a sense of being understood and accepted by friends.

AB The current investigation examined the development of verbal display rule knowledge among three age groups (elementary school children, adolescents, and adults) from the U.S. and Japan (N = 183). Participants predicted verbal display rule behavior (i.e. regulating the verbal expression of emotion in alignment with social norms) and motives in response to two scenarios: a) a conflicting opinions scenario in which two peers hold conflicting opinions, and b) a welfare scenario in which expressing a true opinion is likely to cause emotional harm. Cultural differences in response to the conflicting opinions scenario emerged gradually over development, with Japanese adults endorsing greater emotion regulation than American adults; children and adolescents in both countries, however, endorsed similar degrees of emotion expression. In response to the welfare scenario, Japanese and Americans both endorsed the use of masking display rules to protect the welfare of others, with display rule endorsement increasing with age for both groups. Results contribute to a greater understanding of how display rule knowledge changes over the course of development in a manner that is both culturally variable and context-specific.

AB The current study examined several indicators of students' academic and emotional adjustment during the transition from primary (i.e., grade 6) to secondary school (i.e., grades 7 and 9). Specifically, the study investigated how students' engagement, achievement, and burnout, as well as student-teacher conflict, evolve together over time. A total of 356 adolescents (57.3% boys) filled out questionnaires about their burnout and their behavioral and cognitive engagement. Students' achievement was measured using standardized test scores. Conflict in the teacher-student relationship was assessed using teacher ratings. Cross-lagged models revealed bi-directional associations between behavioral and cognitive engagement. More teacher conflict related to less behavioral engagement, whereas higher achievement predicted more cognitive engagement one and two school years later. The results underscore that, despite the interrelatedness of behavioral and cognitive engagement during the transition from primary to secondary school, both show unique contextual and personal correlates.

AB ObjectiveSelf-harm remains a serious public health concern; however, identifying adolescents at risk is challenging. While self-harm has been linked with difficulties in emotional regulation postinjury, comparatively little is known about how such difficulties may impact on the future development of self-harm behavior.
   MethodsA total of 318 pupils aged 14-15 years completed measures on history of direct self-injurious behavior (D-SIB), emotional regulation, depression, and anxiety at two time points across a six-month period.
   ResultsOf 13% (42) of participants reported their first episode of D-SIB over the six-month period and reported increased difficulties with emotional regulation prior to initial D-SIB. Regression analyses found significant associations for emotional regulation and specifically lack of emotional clarity prior to first episode of D-SIB. Lack of emotional awareness and difficulties with impulse control was significantly associated in those with ongoing D-SIB.
   ConclusionsPrior to first episode of D-SIB, young people may experience difficulty regulating emotions, a difficulty which appears less pronounced following their engagement with D-SIB. Our findings implicate difficulties in the early evaluation and understanding of emotions which may later impair attempts at emotion modulation and increase risk of D-SIB. Such findings might help inform early identification of adolescents at risk of initial D-SIB.

AB Adolescence marks a key developmental window during which emotion dysregulation increases, along with risk for the onset of anxiety and other affect-related pathologies. Although emotion dysregulation and related pathologies normatively decline during the transition into adulthood, this does not occur for a sizable minority of individuals. Finally, sex differences in anxiety emerge during adolescence, with females developing a 2-fold increase in risk relative to males. Unfortunately, a neurobiological model of the mechanisms that cause these changes during adolescence has yet to be proposed. In the present work, we first provide brief reviews of relevant literature. Next, we outline a dual-mechanism model focused on (i) the influence of pubertal testosterone on key emotion-regulation circuitry (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex-amygdala coupling) and (ii) myelination of the fiber bundles connecting such circuitry (i.e., uncinate fasciculus). The proposed model offers a set of specific, testable hypotheses that will hopefully spur much needed cross-disciplinary research.

AB Purpose Emotional functions may play an important role in anorexia nervosa (AN). The onset of the disorder generally occurs during adolescence, which is a critical period of emotional development. However, most studies that evaluated emotional functions in AN were conducted in adult patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate emotion regulation, emotion recognition, and empathy skills in adolescent girls with AN by controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms, childhood traumatic experiences, and attachment security on emotional functions.
   Methods Thirty-two adolescent girls with AN and 32 healthy counterparts completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and the Child and Adolescent KA-SI Empathic Tendency Scale-Adolescent Form.
   Results The results revealed that adolescents with AN were found to have more difficulties in emotion regulation, higher alexithymic tendencies, and lower empathy skills compared with the control group. However, emotion recognition was not found to be significantly different between the two groups. These results were the same when controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms, childhood traumatic experiences, and attachment security except for empathy skills. Alexithymia and depressive symptoms were significantly related to emotion regulation difficulties in adolescents with AN.
   Conclusions Considering the results, it seems that emotion regulation and alexithymia may play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of AN. Accordingly, it is necessary to focus on the improvement of these skills during the treatment of AN. Furthermore, interventions promoting these skills during adolescence may be preventive.

AB Purpose This study examined the moderator role of gender in the relationship between negative affect and eating psychopathology as well as gender differences in these variables.
   Methods A community sample of 285 students (61.8% females), aged 13-25, was recruited in middle and high schools and universities. They filled instruments that assess negative affect and eating disordered symptoms (restraint, eating concern, shape concern, weight concern, and global scale).
   Results Females scored higher both in all subscales and the global scale of eating psychopathology. The restraint subscale was the only subscale showing non-significant differences between females and males. Controlling for BMI, moderation analyses revealed that gender moderated the relationship between negative affect and eating psychopathology, except for restraint behavior.
   Conclusions To deal with negative affect, females engage in more cognitive symptoms associated with disordered eating than males, but both endorse equally in eating restraint. These findings suggest that interventions focused on emotion regulation could help to reduce eating disordered symptoms among females and males.

AB Introduction: Both depressive symptomology and impulsivity are common during adolescence and are associated with various negative life outcomes. The potential sex-dependent nature of relationships between these constructs needs further exploration in order to understand their complexities. This cross-sectional study examined how levels of these constructs may differ by sex. Additionally, we investigated whether sex moderates relationships between adolescents' depression symptoms and different facets of impulsivity.
   Methods: 156 adolescents (M-age = 17.37, SD = 1.91, 59% female) completed self-report measures of their demographics, depression symptoms, and impulsivity. Multiple Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) assessed mean differences in depression symptoms and impulsivity by sex and race/ethnicity. Moderation analyses examined how sex may indirectly affect relationships between depression symptoms to predict attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsivity facets, as well as overall trait impulsivity.
   Results: Correlations between depression symptoms and impulsivity scores were significant. Baseline depression symptoms were significantly higher among females (M = 9.53) compared to males (M = 6.68). Moderation effects of sex were not significant for attentional, motor, or overall trait impulsivity. However, sex moderated relations between depression symptoms and non-planning impulsivity, such that adolescent males showed higher levels of non-planning impulsivity when they reported high levels of depressive symptoms (B = .32, p < .01). This relationship was not significant for females.
   Conclusions: While adolescent females may be more prone to depression, adolescent males may be more likely to experience non-planning impulsivity when experiencing symptoms of depression. The results of this study extend the literature regarding sex differences in vulnerabilities between these constructs. We suggest interventions targeting non-planning impulsivity may be especially salient for adolescent males reporting high levels of depressive symptoms.

AB Cross-sectional data from Fenning et al. (J Autism Dev Disord, 48:3858-3870, 2018) were used to examine age differences in processes related to the development of emotion regulation in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Forty-six children with ASD between the ages of 4 and 11 years and their primary caregivers participated in structured laboratory tasks from which parental scaffolding and child dysregulation were coded. Moderation analyses suggested increased internalization of parental co-regulatory support with age, as evidenced by more coherence in dysregulation across dyadic and independent contexts and a stronger inverse relation between parental scaffolding and independent dysregulation. Children's estimated mental age did not account for these effects. Implications for understanding and promoting the development of emotion regulation in children with ASD are discussed.

AB Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention to treat depressive disorders in youth. However, 50% of adolescents still have depressive symptoms after treatment, and 57% drop out during treatment. Online CBT interventions have proven to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and seem promising as a treatment for depressed adolescents. However, combining online programs with face-to-face sessions seems necessary to increase their effectiveness and monitor for suicide risk.
   Objective: In this study, we examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a blended CBT treatment protocol, a mixture of online and face-to-face CBT, as a treatment for clinically depressed adolescents.
   Methods: A pragmatic quasi-experimental controlled trial will be conducted to study the effectiveness of a blended CBT treatment protocol, in which blended CBT is compared with face-to-face CBT (n=44) and treatment as usual (n=44); the latter two were collected in a previous randomized controlled trial. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used: adolescents aged between 12 and 21 years, with a clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder, and referred to one of the participating mental health institutions. Assessments will be conducted at the same time points: before the start of the intervention, during the intervention (after 5 and 10 weeks), postintervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups.
   Results: The primary outcome is the presence of a depression diagnosis at 12-month follow-up. Several secondary outcomes will be measured, such as depressive symptoms, quality of life, and suicide risk. Costs and effects in both conditions will be compared to analyze cost-effectiveness. Further, moderating (age, gender, alcohol and drug use, parental depression, and other psychopathology) and mediating effects (negative automatic thoughts, cognitive emotion regulation, attributional style) will be analyzed. Also, treatment characteristics will be studied, such as characteristics of the therapists, treatment expectancy, and therapeutic alliance. Dropout rates and treatment characteristics will be measured to study the feasibility of blended CBT.
   Conclusions: This study will examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a blended CBT program in which depressed adolescents are treated in mental health care. Results of blended CBT will be compared with face-to-face CBT and treatment as usual, and implications for implementation will be reviewed.

AB Experiential avoidance (EA) is receiving attention as an emotion regulation strategy and critical factor in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Evidence suggests that EA explains co-varying relationships among topographically dissimilar problem behaviors. The transmission of emotion regulatory strategies is important to understanding the development of these problems. EA may be a learned response style. This conceptual framework was used to test parent EA as a predictor of young adult/older adolescent (offspring) EA, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and problem behaviors in a university context as well as to test the best predictors of these outcomes individually for parents and offspring. Two measures of experiential avoidance, the unwillingness to be in contact with distressing emotions, thoughts, and memories were used to predict the outcomes of interest. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) was the strongest and only statistically significant predictor of PTSS and problem behaviors for parents and offspring above and beyond trauma history, while the Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (MEAQ) remained non-significant. Implications regarding measurement discrepancies, PTSS, and harmful behavior trajectories are discussed.

AB This paper introduces a new measure to evaluate heart output from a dynamical systems approach. The measure is based on the time delay technique for two-dimensional state space reconstruction from time series of interbeat intervals. The system's trajectories within this space are depicted and the mean distance, as well as the total and maximum distances travelled by the system, are calculated in pixels. Preliminary data from adolescents with highly positive emotional regulation (HPER) style (n=10) and adolescents with highly negative (HNER) style (n=10) who underwent a protocol of stress induction show the usefulness of the new metrics to distinguish the dynamical behavior of the heart systems from these groups. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed that changes in all three distances across conditions (baseline, anticipation of stress, exposure to stress, and recovery) were significant in the HPER group but not in the HNER group. As to the physiological meaning of the new measure a correlational analysis revealed that associations with time-domain HRV measures were stronger than associations with frequency-domain HRV measures in both groups. Because of the small sample size, bootstrap resampling was used to obtain confidence intervals. Distances calculated with the new measure are sensitive to the ER-related cardiac flexibility under acute stress conditions. However, the physiological meaning of the new indices remains unclear.

AB A strong evidence base is critical for deepening our understanding of how drama therapy works, how practice might he improved and how to best support the growth of the profession. Building on a previous investigation, the authors reviewed available peer-reviewed, English language, empirical drama therapy research from 1945-2018 to answer the question: what are the prominent themes in drama therapy effectiveness research? Within an effectiveness context, the following themes emerged from this analysis: emotional and behavioural symptoms, social skills and social interactions, self-confidence and self-esteem, sense of self and identity, self-expression, well-being, emotional regulation, empathy, academic performance, language and linguistic performance, stigma, bodily awareness, empowerment and spontaneity. Emergent trends in the literature are discussed and a summation of findings is presented. In reference to the findings, the authors advance a rationale for increasing drama therapy quantitative research with validated and reliable measures.

AB Across industrialized nations, children and teens are a highly prized target for the advertising industry because young people have a tremendous influence on family purchases; however, media scholars have long suggested that young people are a fundamentally vulnerable audience because they lack the necessary developmental competencies to adequately process and protect themselves from advertising communications. Yet, the precise developmental mechanisms have not been clearly articulated nor is there a clear understanding of how these competencies extend across childhood contexts (e.g., developmental phase, cultures). The current study seeks to lend clarity to this matter by looking at the potential influence that children's executive function and emotion regulation have on the relationship between television exposure (as a proxy of exposure to advertising messages and other consumption-oriented media content) and consumer behavior across a broad range of ages from two wealthy industrialized countries. Mothers of young elementary school children (5-8 years) and early adolescents (9-12 years) in the Netherlands (N = 333, 51.7% female child) and the United States of America (N = 810, 49.6% female child) took part in an online survey to report on their child's cognitive/affective development, media use, and consumer behavior (i.e., purchase requests, purchase related conflict). The results showed that across ages, executive function via attentional shifting moderated the link between purchase requests and purchase conflict, whereas positively valenced emotion regulation moderated the same relationship but only for older children. Lastly, the findings revealed that while there are differences in reported behavior among children in these two countries, the developmental processes tend to work in the same manner. The discussion focuses on what these findings mean for children's consumer development as they approach adolescence and how researchers and child advocates should take these developmental factors into account when considering children's potential vulnerability as consumers.

AB This study researches the relationship between bullying in schools and empathy and prosocial behavior among children and adolescents. Participants: 278 students (162 girls and 116 boys), between the ages of 10 and 15, who attend public schools in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. Method: the existence of bullying, prosocial behavior and empathy was assessed through multidimensional questionnaires and the groups were compared in accordance with their participation in bullying. The results showed that those who abuse their schoolmates had low scores in emotional regulation and perspective-taking. When empathy and prosocial behavior were compared, differences were found among male assailants, who showed low levels. The prosocial interventions of the bystanders exhibited emotional self-regulation, affective response and revaluation of the other party.

AB Aggression is one of the most common Paediatric Psychiatric emergency problems presented in healthcare services with major public health impacts. The aim of this review is to determine the psychosocial predictors of adolescent aggression. Systematic review on observational study designs were conducted. Recent five years English published journal articles (2014-2018) were searched in three databases (Science Direct, PubMed and EBSCO) from April 2018 until May 2018. The final 15 articles (seven prospective cohort, eight cross-sectional studies) were included in the systematic review. Psychological predictors were mainly on the personality traits and emotional problems experienced by the adolescents including callous-unemotional traits, hostility, anger, and low empathy. Self-control was found to be protective against adolescent aggression. Social predictors that contribute to the aggression among adolescents according to the highest reported number of articles were peer influence, followed by school climate, substance use, neighbourhood influence, family, and parent factors. In conclusion, psychosocial predictors of adolescent aggression include both Psychological Factors; mainly personality traits and emotional problems, and Social Factors; mainly peer influence and substance use. This warrants for more holistic approach in dealing with aggressive adolescents that can be applied in more targeted and focused intervention strategy deliveries.

AB Previous studies have shown that students with ADHD symptoms are more likely to have problems in all aspects of adaptation. The aim of this study is to identify ADHD symptoms that predict maladjustment in the general population of students. Hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention were examined with respect to academic, social and emotional adjustment. Elementary school students (average age M = 12.72, SD = 1.62) participated in the study (N = 501). The instruments used were: Hyperactivity-Impulsivity-Attention Scale, Croatian version of Self-efficacy questionnaire for children, Emotional competence questionnaire, self-assessment of peer acceptance and school success. Inattention was a significant predictor of problems in all aspects of adaptation, i.e. academic (beta = -0.317; beta = -0.528; p < 0.001), social (beta = -0.269; beta = -0.430; p < 0.001) and emotional adjustment (beta = -0.225; beta = -0.367; p < 0.01). Impulsiveness was only a significant predictor of academic self-efficacy (beta = -0.187, p < 0.01), whereas hyperactivity was only significant for emotional competence (beta = -0.174, p < 0.05). Since inattention proved to be a dominant problem, it is recommended that experts working with children make an effort to increase attention and concentration as a prevention strategy for adaptation problems of all students.

AB Low family socioeconomic status (SES) is closely related to increased risk of emotional maladaptation among adolescents. Although previous studies have found that low family SES is a significant and common experience for most rural-to-urban migrant adolescents in China, little research has examined the association between family SES and emotional adaptation or identified the protective factors that may minimise emotional maladaptation among these adolescents. The present study examined the associations between family SES and three indices of emotional adaptation (emotion regulation, life satisfaction and depression) and the moderating effects of adolescents' resilience and parental positive emotion (PE) among 486 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents. The results suggest that family SES was significantly associated with migrant adolescents' emotional outcomes, to varying degrees. Moreover, both adolescents' resilience and PE moderated the associations between family SES and emotional outcomes, although the protective effects of the two moderators differed on the three emotional outcomes. These findings shed light into designing intervention and prevention programs to reduce emotional maladaptation among migrant adolescents.

AB There is a high prevalence of mental health concerns among youth in the United States. School-based mental health counselling interventions maybe one way of addressing the mental health concerns of youth. This study investigated changes in students' behavioural and emotional problems scores and discipline referrals for those who participated in a 5-week school-based mental health counselling intervention (SBMHCI) at three Title I elementary schools, located in Southeastern United States. The participants (N = 35) to participate had an active Individual Education Program (IEP). They then received the SBMHCI grounded in a Humanistic counselling approach. A single-group, pre-test-post-test design was used to examine change in participants' scores (internalizing and externalizing). There was no control group in place for this study therefore there was no comparisons made between participants and non-participants' outcomes. The researchers identified significant improvement over time on the parents' ratings of the students' internalizing problem scores and the teachers' ratings of the students' externalizing problem scores, and total problems scores per both parents and teachers' report. Furthermore, the number of office discipline referrals decreased significantly over time.

AB Objectives: This study investigated quality of life in Korean juvenile inmates with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the impact of behavioral and emotional problems on quality of life.
   Methods: In total, 200 inmates were evaluated using the Korean version of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (K-MINI) and the Korean version of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL-K). We extracted the inmates with ADHD and evaluated their quality of life, behavioral problems, and emotional problems with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Korean Youth Self Report (K-YSR) scale. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted.
   Results: Among the 200 total inmates, 68 were diagnosed with ADHD by the K-SADS-PL-K. Most of the correlations between PedsQL scores and K-YSR items were significant. Multiple regression analysis showed that PedsQL could be predicted by affective problems (among the DSM-oriented scales of the K-YSR) and attention problems (among the syndrome scales of the K-YSR).
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that, among juvenile inmates with ADHD, quality of life was negatively correlated with most behavioral and emotional problems. Meanwhile, the significant influence of affective and attention problems on inmates quality of life suggests the necessity of comprehensive treatments for this group.

AB Background: Although research on the developmental antecedents of sexual offending has tended to focus on sexual abuse, recent research in juveniles and adults who have sexually offended suggests that psychological abuse perpetrated by a male caregiver may be a particularly important factor in the development of problematic sexual interests and behaviors.
   Objective: This study aimed to extend previous findings by investigating the association between psychological abuse by a male caregiver and problematic sexual outcomes in a sample of adult males who had sexually offended.
   Participants: Participants were 529 adult males incarcerated for sexual offenses, 21% of whom were civilly committed.
   Methods: Childhood maltreatment and problematic sexual outcomes were assessed using the Multidimensional Assessment of Sex and Aggression, a contingency-based inventory that assesses domains related to sexual aggression. Hierarchical regressions were calculated examining the association between childhood abuse types and sexual outcomes.
   Results: Childhood sexual abuse was associated with child sexual (beta =.247, p < .001) and other paraphilic interests (beta = .189, p < .001). Male caregiver psychological abuse also emerged as marginally associated with child sexual interest (beta = .100, p = .059), even after controlling for other abuse types.
   Conclusions: These results partially replicate recent findings in a juvenile sample and challenge conventional developmental theories of sexual offending, by suggesting that male caregiver psychological abuse may play a role in the etiology of child sexual interest among males who have sexually offended. This study also suggests a possible gender symmetry effect moderating the developmental consequences of abuse.

AB Background: Maltreated youth are at an elevated risk for the development of problem behaviors. Coping with the death of a family member or close friend during adolescence, referred to as bereavement, is a stressful event that could potentiate risk linked to maltreatment. However, developmental research suggests that youth adjustment is a product of multiple risk and protective factors. Although maltreated youth who experience loss may be particularly vulnerable to behavior problems, personal and contextual factors may attenuate or exacerbate youths' risk for internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.
   Objective: The overarching goal of this study is to examine individual, family, and community-level protective factors for maltreated youth who experience bereavement. Specifically, we aim to examine the effect of age 12 bereavement on age 16 internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and to investigate the moderating role of multi-level protective factors at ages 14 and 16.
   Methods: The study consisted of a sample of 800 youth (52.4% female, 45.1% African-American) drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN), collected from 1998 to 2011.
   Results: Maltreated youth who experienced significant loss were at increased risk for externalizing symptoms, compared to non-bereaved maltreated youth (beta = 0.085, p < .05). Individual future orientation beta = 0.103, p < .05) family future orientation (beta = -0.120, p < .05), parental monitoring (beta = -0.123, p < .01), and neighborhood collective efficacy (beta = -0.126, p < .01) each significantly moderated the association between bereavement and externalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: These results have implications for future interventions aimed towards reducing problem behaviors in adolescents with a history of child maltreatment and who experience bereavement.

AB Co-morbid mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are extremely common in autistic adults. Vulnerability to negative life experiences such as victimisation and unemployment may be partially responsible for the development of these conditions. Here we measure the frequency of negative life experiences in autistic adults and explore how these are associated with current anxiety and depression symptoms and life satisfaction. We developed the Vulnerability Experiences Quotient (VEQ) through stakeholder consultation. The VEQ includes 60 items across 10 domains. Autistic adults with a clinical diagnosis and non-autistic controls completed the VEQ, screening measures for anxiety and depression, and a life-satisfaction scale in an online survey. Likelihood of experiencing each VEQ event was compared between groups, using binary logistic regression. Mediation analysis was used to test whether total VEQ score mediated the relationship between autism and (1) depression (2) anxiety and (3) life satisfaction. Autistic adults (N = 426) reported higher rates of the majority of events in the VEQ than non-autistic adults (N = 268). They also reported more anxiety and depression symptoms and lower life satisfaction. Group differences in anxiety, depression and life satisfaction were partially mediated by VEQ total score. This study highlights several important understudied areas of vulnerability for autistic adults, including domestic abuse, contact with social services (as parents) and financial exploitation and hardship. Improved support, advice and advocacy services are needed to reduce the vulnerability of autistic adults to negative life experiences, which may in turn improve mental health and life satisfaction in this population. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1516-1528. (c) 2019 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary This study investigated whether autistic adults are more vulnerable to certain negative life experiences, and whether these experiences are related to anxiety, depression and life satisfaction. We found that autistic adults are more vulnerable to many different negative life events, including employment difficulties, financial hardship and domestic abuse. Negative life experiences partially explained the higher rates of anxiety and depression symptoms and lower life satisfaction in autistic adults compared to non-autistic adults. Improved support services are required to reduce the vulnerability of autistic adults. Reducing vulnerability may improve mental health and increase life satisfaction in this population.

AB Objective: Previous research has established associations among childhood trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs), and adolescent nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). In fact, numerous studies have suggested that PTSSs may serve as a mechanism linking trauma exposure and NSSI. However, studies to date have not utilized newer models of PTSSs that differentiate between symptoms of overmodulation and undermodulation. This study investigated associations among interpersonal and noninterpersonal trauma exposure, posttraumatic overmodulation and undermodulation, and NSSI in a sample of justice-involved youth. Method: Participants were 566 youth (2 transgender youth, 142 girls, and 422 boys). On average, youth were 16 years old (SD = 1.27), and approximately half self-identified as an ethnic minority. Participants completed measures of lifetime trauma exposure and NSSI, and past-month PTSSs. Results: Structural equation modeling demonstrated that interpersonal trauma exposure was associated with symptoms of overmodulation (95% confidence interval [CI] [.180, .340]) and undermodulation (95% CI [.179, .338]) as well as NSSI (95% CI [.156, .572]). Additionally, symptoms of overmodulation were differentially associated with NSSI (95% CI [.158, .720]), and there was a significant indirect effect between interpersonal trauma exposure and NSSI via overmodulation (95% CI [.015, .095]). Conclusions: This study highlights the utility of conceptualizing posttraumatic stress disorder as a disorder of emotion regulation characterized by symptoms of overmodulation and undermodulation, and has clinical implications for mental health professionals who interact with youth in the justice system.

AB Eating disorders are of high clinical and societal relevance. They are among the most common chronic mental illnesses in adulthood, but show a high incidence rate and peak of disease onset even in adolescence. Eating disorders are associated with far-reaching costs, such as acute or chronic comorbidities and educational or professional attainment.
   Thus, from a public mental health perspective, it is essential to explore symptoms and risk factors of eating disorders and to monitor prevalence rates across time to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of prevention measures.
   In the present study, the recent prevalence of eating disorder symptoms among 11- to 17-year-old children and adolescents living in Germany is reported based on the Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS Wave 2, 2014-2017, N = 6599, 51.7% boys) and compared to the prevalence rates 10 years ago (KiGGS Baseline, 2003-2006, N = 6633, 51.5% boys). Moreover, we investigate a selection of risk factors for eating disorder symptoms.
   In KiGGS Wave 2, 19.8% of the children and adolescents showed eating disorder symptoms, a drop of 2.8 percentage points in the prevalence rate as compared to the KiGGS Baseline. The drop in the prevalence rate pertains to 11- to 13-year-old boys while the risk for 14- to 17-year-old adolescents and particularly among girls remained comparably high. Children and adolescents with emotional problems, low family cohesion, low self-efficacy, or who perceive themselves as too thick or thin, show an increased risk for eating disorder symptoms.
   Previous approaches and possible supplements for the prevention of eating disorders are discussed.

AB Deviant peer affiliation has long been recognized as a risk factor in determining adolescent further development, but scarce research has examined the developmental trajectories of deviant peer affiliation in at-risk youth. Guided by developmental psychopathology perspectives and differential association theory, this study aimed to: 1) identify heterogeneity in growth trajectories of adolescent deviant peer affiliation; 2) examine whether the growth trajectories differ by types of child abuse; and 3) investigate how the growth trajectories were associated with adolescent substance use. Drawing from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN), youth who completed at least one of the age 12, 14, and 16 assessments were examined. Latent class growth analyses indicated three distinctive developmental trajectories of deviant peer affiliation from age 12 to 16: a slightly ascending trajectory class (82.9%); a steep ascending trajectory class (12.9%), and a declining trajectory class (4.2%). Youth who had been emotionally abused were more likely to be in the steep ascending trajectory class, while sexual abuse predicted membership in the declining trajectory class. Additionally, the patterns of deviant peer affiliation trajectories predicted later adolescent substance use: youth who were in the steep ascending trajectory class were more likely to use alcohol and marijuana compared to youth in the other classes. However, tobacco use indicated a slightly different pattern: youth in both the steep ascending and the declining classes had higher likelihoods of tobacco use, compared to those in the slightly ascending trajectory class. Results suggest preventive interventions to improve positive peer relationships.

AB Background Research documents substantial adolescent health disparities by sexual orientation, but studies are confined to a small number of countries-chiefly the USA. We provide first-time evidence of associations between sexual orientation and adolescent health/well-being in a new country-Australia. We also add to knowledge by examining health/well-being outcomes not previously analysed in national samples, considering adolescents reporting no sexual attractions, and rank-ordering sexual-orientation health disparities by magnitude. Methods Data from an Australian national probability sample of 14/15 years old (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, n=3318) and regression models adjusted for confounding and for multiple comparisons were used to examine the associations between sexual attraction and 30 outcomes spanning multiple domains of health/well-being-including socio-emotional functioning, health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, health-related behaviours, social support, self-harm, suicidality, victimisation, self-concept, school belonging and global health/well-being assessments. Results Lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning adolescents displayed significantly worse health/well-being than their heterosexual peers in all outcomes (p<0.05). The magnitude of the disparities ranged between 0.13 and 0.75 SD, and was largest in the domains of self-harm, suicidality, peer problems and emotional problems. There were fewer differences between the heterosexual and no-attraction groups. Worse outcomes were observed among both-sex-attracted adolescents compared with same-sex-attracted adolescents, and sexual-minority girls compared with sexual-minority boys. Conclusions Consistent with the minority stress model and recent international scholarship, sexual-minority status is an important risk factor for poor adolescent health/well-being across domains in Australia. Interventions aimed at addressing sexual-orientation health disparities within Australian adolescent populations are urgently required.

AB Objective: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized with emotional, cognitive, behavioral disorders, and its manifestation becomes evident in adolescence or early adulthood. According to Linehan's biosocial theory, emotion dysregulation (ED) is a core feature of BPD. Self-esteem (SE) is known to be associated with borderline symptom severity and depression in BPD. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between ED, SE and negative affect. Methods: Twenty-six patients with BPD and 26 healthy controls were included. Sociodemographic data form, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were our evaluation tools. Results: No difference was found between the groups in terms of age, gender, education and marital status. The total and subscale scores of the DERS, the negative affect subscale of the PANAS (PANASn), the RSES were found to be significantly higher in BPD than healthy controls. Predictors of depression in the linear regression analysis were negative affect (PANASn), and predictors of SE (RSES) is depression. Emotion dysregulation (DERStotal) was the predictive vari-able of negative affect (PANASn). Conclusions: In our study, DDG was predictor of negative affect and it was observed that emotion dysregulation itself contributed to negative affect in addition to the innate emotional sensitivity. The predictive effect of ER on negative affect was thought to be triggered by dysregulating behavior. No relationship was found between ER and SE because of evaluating ER state and SE trait. It would be appropriate to evaluate whether DDG has an effect on self-esteem with large sample studies in the future.

AB Objective: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been the subjects of many studies. However, there is limited literature about the effects of parental mental health problems on the HRQOL of children with ASD. This study aims to compare HRQOL of ASD children and their mothers' emotional problems with healthy controls and to investigate the associations between ASD children's HRQOL and maternal psychiatric symptoms. Methods: The sample consisted of 81 ASD patients and 79 healthy controls, with an age range of 2-18 years, and an equal number of mothers. Childhood Autism Rating Scale was used to check severity of autistic symptoms, Kinder Lebensqualitatsfragebogen: Children's Quality of Life Questionnaire-revised (KINDL-R) was used to examine child HRQOL, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to evaluate maternal depressive symptoms, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (S-STAI, T-STAI) was used to assess maternal anxiety symptoms. Results: BDI and T-STAI total scores were significantly higher, KINDL-R total score, physical well-being, family, social, and school subscores were significantly lower in children with ASD than the control group. BDI total score was significantly higher, self-esteem and social subscores of KINDL-R were significantly lower in the severe ASD group. Self-esteem and school subscores of KINDL-R were significantly lower in ASD children with clinically anxious mothers. Among ASD children, family and school subscores of KINDL-R were negatively correlated with BDI total score. Conclusions: ASD patients have lower HRQOL than typically developing peers. Mothers of ASD children experience greater anxiety and depressive symptoms. Self-esteem and school performance in ASD children appear to be linked with maternal anxiety symptoms. Family and school problems in ASD children may be associated with maternal depressive symptoms.

AB Psychological abuse and sexual abuse, either alone or in combination, have been implicated as developmental antecedents of problematic sexual thoughts and behaviors in studies of sexually aggressive males (Jesperson, Lalumiere, & Seto, 2009; Knight & Sims-Knight, 2011; Levenson & Grady, 2016; Seto & Lalumiere, 2010). Recently, psychological abuse perpetrated by a male caregiver has emerged as strongly associated with subsequent hypersexuality in adult males who had sexually offended. In a study of 529 adult male sexual offenders, Kingston, Graham, and Knight (2017) found that male caregiver psychological abuse was the most prominent correlate of hypersexual thoughts and behaviors in adulthood, above and beyond the effects of other abuse types, such as physical abuse and sexual abuse. Consequently, we hypothesized that, among juveniles who had sexually offended, higher self-reported levels of childhood psychological and sexual abuse, in contrast to other types of childhood maltreatment experiences, would covary with higher subsequent levels of normophilic sexualized thoughts and behaviors. Consistent with Kingston et al., Male Caregiver Psychological Abuse accounted for a significant amount of the variance in subsequent reported hypersexuality in this juvenile sample. Furthermore, this factor also emerged as a significant correlate of deviant sexual behaviors and fantasies, such as paraphilic interests and pedophilic preference. Sexual Abuse was also found to be significantly associated with hypersexuality. These findings provide additional support for the demonstrated relation between psychological abuse by a male caregiver and subsequent problematic sexual thoughts and behaviors. These data are also consistent with other research that suggests a gender symmetry effect in the impact of parental discipline and the differential effect of male caregiver abuse on male children.

AB This study explored the growth of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) frequency over 2.5 years in a clinical sample of adolescent girls. Following a functional model of NSSI, the contribution of emotion dysregulation, peer victimization, and psychological maladjustment were evaluated as the predictors of NSSI trajectories. Participants of 99 girls (M-age = 16.03 years) were admitted for psychiatric hospitalization, who responded to questionnaires assessing NSSI, emotion dysregulation, relational and overt peer victimization, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. NSSI was also assessed at 6 months and 2.5 years following the baseline assessment. Linear mixed modeling estimated NSSI frequency over time. The findings highlight the stable nature of NSSI and the contribution of emotion dysregulation and internalizing symptoms to NSSI patterns. Peer victimization and externalizing behavior problems were not the significant predictors. Developing interventions targeting these NSSI predictors early in girls' development may prevent the emergence and maintenance of NSSI.

AB Objectives Impulsivity has been identified as an important construct in predicting the initiation and maintenance of substance use among at-risk populations. Interventions emphasizing mindfulness strategies appear particularly promising in reducing substance use and marking change in various aspects of impulsivity. Methods The current study used a rolling group mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) intervention for young adults in residential substance use disorder treatment. We examined change in impulsivity facets measured by the S-UPPS for youth randomly assigned to MBRP (n = 45) versus those assigned to treatment as usual plus 12 step/self-help (n = 34). We also examined how change in impulsivity mediated changes in substance use post-treatment. Results In general, results indicated that MBRP is effective at reducing facets of trait impulsivity in treatment-seeking individuals with SUDs. Only positive and negative urgency mediated the relation between treatment assignment and substance use. Conclusions MBRP is a viable and useful intervention for young adults in residential treatment for substance use disorders and can aid in marked change in facets of impulsivity. Both positive and negative urgency were significant mechanisms of change in reducing substance use following treatment. Results are discussed focused on the utility of MRBP as a clinical intervention for at-risk, marginalized, and young adults.

AB This study examined delay of gratification behaviors in preschool-aged children with and without autism spectrum disorder. Recent research has found that elementary-aged children with autism spectrum disorder showed challenges with delay of gratification and that there were individual differences in terms of children's behaviors during the wait. We extend this work to a younger sample of children with autism spectrum disorder to understand whether these difficulties emerge by the preschool years. Moreover, we assessed whether individual differences in other key self-regulatory capacities (i.e. effortful control, emotion regulation, executive function, and joint attention) were related to delay of gratification wait durations or behavioral strategies. Findings revealed that preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder waited for a shorter duration, demonstrated more temptation-focused behaviors, and expressed less positive affect than their typical peers during the delay of gratification task. At the full-sample level, individual differences in children's temptation-focused behaviors (i.e. visual attention and verbalizations focused on the temptation) were related to children's executive function, joint attention, and parents' ratings of emotion regulation. When we examined associations within groups, the associations were not significant for the autism spectrum disorder group, but for typically developing children, there was a positive association between temptation-focused behaviors and emotion regulation.

AB Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulties with social communication, with a preponderance in males. Evidence supports a relationship between metacognitive executive functions (e.g. planning, working memory) and social communication in autism spectrum disorder, yet relationships with specific metacognitive executive functions and how gender alters the expression of these relationships require further study. We used multiple regression to examine relationships between informant-based measures of metacognitive executive function and social communication in intellectually able (IQ > 85) female (n = 111; mean age = 10.2 +/- 2.8; 31 autism spectrum disorder) and male youth (n = 310; mean age = 10.5 +/- 1.9; 146 autism spectrum disorder) with and without autism spectrum disorder from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange-II database. Executive function-social communication relationships were different in females and males with autism spectrum disorder. Relationships between the entire metacognitive index and social communication were stronger in males with autism spectrum disorder than without; this pattern was also observed for metacognitive sub-indices 'monitor' and 'working memory'. These patterns were not observed in females. Relationships between executive function and social communication appear different for female and male youth with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. To better understand the nature of metacognitive contributions to social communication in autism spectrum disorder, future work should investigate the co-development of monitoring, working memory and social communication, while taking gender into account.

AB Parents play irreplaceable roles in the shaping of social-emotional competence in adolescents, particularly in economically disadvantaged families. By surveying a sample of 965 adolescents from Hong Kong, China, we found that the associations between parenting behaviors and the social-emotional competence of their children varied by gender; that is, the associations between parenting behaviors and the social-emotional competence of female were much stronger as opposed to male students. Specifically, the magnitude of the positive association between positive parenting behaviors and social-emotional competence in female adolescents was larger than that in male adolescents. Similarly, the magnitude of the negative association between negative parenting behaviors and social-emotional competence among female adolescents was also larger than that of male adolescents. This difference can be explained by different interpretations of social-emotional competence, along with different opportunities for social practice across genders in communities based on traditional Chinese culture.

AB Pre- and post-migratory factors have been implicated in refugee children's mental health. However, findings regarding their unique and joint roles are inconsistent or nonexistent. We examined the main and interactive relations of pre-migratory life stressors and post-migratory daily hassles and routines to emotion regulation-a key marker of mental health-in 5- to 13-year-old Syrian refugee children (N = 103) resettling in Canada. Mothers and children completed questionnaires assessing pre-migratory life stressors and post-migratory daily hassles. Mothers also reported their children's adherence to family routines and emotion regulation abilities (i.e., anger and sadness regulation) via questionnaire. Overall, children who more frequently engaged in family routines showed better anger regulation. Pre- and post-migratory factors also interacted, such that greater post-migratory daily hassles were associated with worse sadness regulation for children with lower levels of pre-migratory life stressors, but were unassociated with the sadness regulation of children who experienced higher levels of pre-migratory life stressors. Results suggest that pre- and post-migratory factors play unique and joint roles in refugee children's emotion regulation during resettlement.

AB Psychological distress and mental illness has been found to be elevated in migrant groups living in sovereign countries, as well as for indigenous people living under colonial or administrative rule. The north Pacific island of Guam is unusual in its ethnic composition as it has no majority ethnic group, has a large indigenous population and remains a territory of the U.S. This study aimed to identify ethnic differences in self-reported psychological distress between the main ethnic groups on Guam. The study uses a cross sectional design with data linkage methodology, drawing on the Guam Census and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System health survey for Guam. The results showed that the native Chamorro population had worse self-reported psychological distress (defined as a 'mental health condition or emotional problem') than White/Caucasians (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.52-2.87), particularly for severe distress (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.33-2.77). This relationship persisted even after adjusting for a wide range of socio-demographic and economic factors (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.15-5.76). Other Pacific Islanders also had higher psychological distress compared to White/Caucasians, but this association was largely explained by the adjusted factors. The findings are discussed in terms of social and economic disadvantage for Pacific Island peoples on Guam, as well as the impact of colonial administration, disaffection, and lack of autonomy for the Chamorro of Guam. Recommendations are made to improve psychiatric treatment for these groups by considering wider socio-political factors in assessment and treatment, as well as broader implications for the national dialogue on self-determination.

AB Emotion dysregulation has been associated with increased risks for psychopathology. During adolescence when the onset of mental illnesses peak, emotion dysregulation may be particularly problematic. In this study, we examined transactional associations between young adolescents' self-report of their emotion dysregulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression at three assessments over 3 years. Participants were 391 Australian students (56% female; 79% White/Caucasian) in Grades 6 to 8 followed until Grades 9 to 11. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), emotion dysregulation was a latent variable indicated by lack of emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior. A sixth aspect of emotion dysregulation, lack of emotional awareness, which was not correlated with the other five subscales, was examined separately in the SEM. Transactional associations over time were identified between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression, with adolescents higher in emotion dysregulation at Time 1 (T1) reporting higher social anxiety and depressive symptoms between T1 and Time 2 (T2), and T2 emotion dysregulation predicting increases in adolescents' depression, but not social anxiety, symptoms from T2 to Time 3 (T3), after controlling for baseline symptoms. In addition, earlier social anxiety, but not depressive, symptom level at T2 was significantly associated with later emotion dysregulation between T2 and T3, after baseline emotion dysregulation was controlled. Furthermore, girls were higher in emotion dysregulation, social anxiety, and depression than boys, but sex did not moderate temporal links between emotion dysregulation and symptoms.

AB Recent research has highlighted the influence of impulsivity on disorder-related information processing and food-related action competencies. This is in particular of interest among individuals with eating and weight disorders, and hence, impulsivity with its facets has become a potential target for treatment among this patient group. Currently, evidence is still scarce regarding the effectiveness of cuespecific inhibitory control trainings (ICT) and those that focus on emotion regulation. The present study investigates a combination of cognitive-behavioral training with a special focus on enhancing impulsivity-related behaviors and emotion regulation strategies (ImpulsE) and a computer-based food-specific ICT (Stop Signal task, SST) and compares this with a guideline-based treatment as usual (TAU). In total N = 31 overweight/obese individuals with binge eating disorder (BES) participated in the study (n = 22 ImpulsE, n = 9 TAU). Self-reported (UPPS Urgency) and performance-based impulsivity (SST), eating disorder pathology (EDE-Q), and weight were compared at baseline (T1), posttreatment (T2), and at the 1- or 3-month follow-up (FU). Results showed a reduction in both groups for eating pathology and inhibitory control ability (food-specific SST). Only for ImpulsE, the number of binge eating days decreased significantly from T0 to T1 and from T1 to T2. The reduction of binge eating days correlated highly significantly with the reduction of food-related inhibitory control ability. For TAU, a significant correlation between the reduction of the emotional facet of impulsivity, urgency, and reduction of global eating disorder pathology was found. The present study offers support for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral trainings with a special focus on impulsivity and emotion regulation. However, the evidence is preliminary and the benefit of the combination with a computer-based food-specific ICT remains unclear. Future research should perform dismantling studies to understand differentiating effects of the various modules. Despite the preliminary characteristic of the data, it seems reasonable to adapt the program to youth. Especially in the sensitive period of puberty, in which BES is often established and empirical evidence exists that deficits in inhibitory control and emotion regulation contribute to the maintenance, ImpulsE could make a valuable contribution to prevent early chronification and to avoid unfavorable weight development.

AB Sleep problems and insufficient sleep duration can lead to long-term and sustained impairment of psychological health. Disturbed sleep is a frequent phenomenon in childhood and adolescence. It is associated with lower academic achievement, attention difficulties, increased aggressive behavior, and depressive symptoms. Most studies focus on poor sleep quality in terms of sleep problems or insufficient sleep duration, indicating low sleep quantity to be related to psychosocial health. However, there is a scarcity of studies that consider the effects both of sleep quality and of sleep quantity at the same time. Moreover, gender may influence the relationship between disturbed sleep and psychopathology, but gender-specific studies are rare. Therefore, the present paper investigates whether boys and girls who report sleep problems and insufficient sleep duration have a higher risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. The current data represent secondary analyses of a large German epidemiological study (German Health Survey of Children and Adolescents, KIGGS). The data of 3,414 boys and 3,256 girls were separated into two age groups (11-13 years and 14-17 years) in order to analyze sleep duration, sleep problems, and psychiatric abnormalities, the later determined using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Boys and girls with sleep problems showed a higher risk probability of internalizing and externalizing symptoms (OR = 1.52-3.38) in both age groups. While the presence of sleep problems increased the risk probability of internalizing and externalizing problems in both genders, insufficient sleep duration did so only in girls. Insufficient sleep duration increased the risk of abnormal scores on the emotional problems scale (OR11-13 = 1.70, OR14-17 = 1.56) and for the total score (OR11-13 = 1.48, OR14-17 = 1.66) only in girls of both age groups. Older girls who reported insufficient sleep duration had a higher risk of abnormal scores on the peer problems scale (OR = 1.36) while younger girls showed a higher risk of abnormal scores on the hyperactivity / inattentiveness scale (OR = 1.64) and on the conduct problems scale (OR = 1.78). It can be concluded that there is an association between sleep problems and psychiatric symptoms in different areas in boys and girls and across a wide age range. Insufficient sleep duration, by contrast, only appears to be a risk factor for psychological abnormalities in girls. These gender differences should be taken into account in future studies. A limitation of the presented study was that sleep duration and sleep problems were only assessed using one question each and no sleep-related questionnaire was employed. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that disturbed sleep may be a warning sign for worsened mental health states and should therefore be addressed in pediatric and psychiatric care.

AB Changes in the adolescent brain underlie the development of executive functions (EFs) after the onset of puberty; however, adolescents that engage in deliberate self-harm (DSH) have impaired EFs in the areas of inhibition, emotion regulation, shifting, and interpersonal functioning. On the other hand, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been shown to be effective in treating adolescents with DSH. Moreover, the DBT skills of mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and "walking the middle path" are suited to treat these adolescents with impaired EFs. This single group pre-post study examined changes in adolescents' EFs who were enrolled in DBT. Ninety-three adolescents from a 16-week DBT program for DSH were administered the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Self Report (BRIEF-SR) at pre-treatment and post-treatment. Adolescents improved from the elevated to non-clinical range on the Emotional Control, Shifting, and Monitor scales in addition to the Global Executive Composite of the BRIEF-SR. Significant effects for funding type on shifting, interpersonal functioning, and overall EF were observed while a significant effect for previous history of psychiatric hospitalizations was observed for emotion regulation. DBT appears to be effective for improving the EFs of adolescents with DSH and for specific subgroups of this population. Knowledge of these adolescents' profile of EFs will assist clinicians in determining the type and level of intervention with DBT in order to shape positive behaviors during this important period of brain development.

AB Self-inflicted injury (SII) in adolescence is a serious public health concern that portends prospective vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, borderline personality development, suicide attempts, and suicide. To date, however, our understanding of neurobiological vulnerabilities to SII is limited. Behaviorally, affect dysregulation is common among those who self-injure. This suggests ineffective cortical modulation of emotion, as observed among adults with borderline personality disorder. In borderline samples, structural and functional abnormalities are observed in several frontal regions that subserve emotion regulation (e.g., anterior cingulate, insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). However, no volumetric analyses of cortical brain regions have been conducted among self-injuring adolescents. We used voxel-based morphometry to compare cortical gray matter volumes between self-injuring adolescent girls, ages 13-19 years (n = 20), and controls (n = 20). Whole-brain analyses revealed reduced gray matter volumes among self-injurers in the insular cortex bilaterally, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus, an adjacent neural structure also implicated in emotion and self-regulation. Insular and inferior frontal gyrus gray matter volumes correlated inversely with self-reported emotion dysregulation, over-and-above effects of psychopathology. Findings are consistent with an emotion dysregulation construal of SII, and indicate structural abnormalities in some but not all cortical brain regions implicated in borderline personality disorder among adults.

AB Emerging literature suggests fathers may contribute uniquely to child development and emotional health through play. In the present study, a multiple mediational model was analyzed using data from 476 families that participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. After accounting for infant-mother attachment, infant temperament, and family income and stability, a significant indirect effect from father-child play quality to adolescent internalizing symptoms was found through father-reported child emotional dysregulation, B = -.05, 95% confidence interval; CI [-.14, -.01]. Specifically, in first grade, dyads where fathers were rated highly on sensitivity and stimulation during play, and children demonstrated high felt security and affective mutuality during play, had children with fewer father-reported emotional dysregulation problems in third grade, B = -.23, 95% CI [-.39, -.06]. Children with fewer emotional dysregulation problems had lower self-reported internalizing symptoms at age 15, B = .23, 95% CI [.01, .45]. Mothers' ratings of children's emotional dysregulation were not a significant mediator. Results are discussed regarding the importance of father-child play for children's adjustment as well as the usefulness of inclusion of fathers in child developmental research.

AB Using a family systems perspective, we examined the trajectories of father-child and mother-child closeness and conflict across Grades 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and their associations with child depressive symptoms across middle childhood among 685 families in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Father-child and mother-child relationship conflict increased, whereas relationship closeness decreased from Grades 1 to 6. Girls with more slowly increasing father-child conflict, and more slowly decreasing father-child closeness, were at lower risk for depressive symptoms. Boys with more slowly increasing mother-child conflict were at lower risk for depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the important roles of both father-child and mother-child relationships in children's emotional adjustment during middle childhood.

AB There is increasing evidence for multiple pathways in the development of callous-unemotional (CU) features, including primary and secondary profiles. Understanding affect regulation strategies among variants may provide further insight to the development and treatment of CU features. This study evaluated whether profiles of CU features could be identified within a clinical sample of youth using measures of affect dysregulation, affect suppression, anxiety, and maltreatment. We also examined whether these profiles were consistent across gender. Participants (N = 418; 56.7% female) ranged in age from 12 to 19 years (M = 15.04, SD = 1.85) and were drawn from a clinical sample. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted using five indicators, including affect regulation, suppression, anxiety, CU features, and maltreatment. The best fitting model, a four-profile solution, included a low (low CU/dysregulation), anxious (low CU/high dysregulation), primary CU (high CU/low dysregulation), and secondary CU profile (high CU/dysregulation/maltreatment). LPAs found the same four-profile model when conducted separately for males and females. This is the first study to examine gender and include affect regulation strategies in the examination of primary and secondary profiles of CU.

AB Objective: Children living with parental cancer are vulnerable to distress and developmental disruption. This review aims to identify current interventions to support cancer patients' children and summarise how effective these are based on children's reports.
   Methods: Between 25 May 2015 and 6 August 2018, a broad search strategy was used to identify relevant references. Seven databases were searched, and grey literature was also vetted. This review was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Cochrane guidelines.
   Results: Eight studies evaluating six interventions were retained. Research designs and interventions were heterogenous, and study quality was low. A limited number of significant results were reported by studies. These evidenced improvement for PTSD symptoms, emotional regulation, and depression. However, overall current interventions do not appear effective among patients' children.
   Conclusion: Despite encouraging preliminary findings, interventions do not yet adequately support cancer patients' children. There is a need for more tailored and targeted interventions. A theoretical model conceptualising the impact of parental cancer may assist this.
   Practice implications: Findings will assist future intervention research by promoting standardised levels of care among cancer patients' children, that is empirically supported, effective, and meets principles of non-maleficence. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Limited published research has examined the relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms in Chinese school adolescents. We aimed to explore the effect of coping styles and sleep quality on anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, we investigated the interactions of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms.
   Methods: The survey was conducted in Jiangxi Province, China. The Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Chinese Secondary School Students Anxiety Scale were utilized to assess sleep quality, coping styles and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationships of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms.
   Results: A total of 3081 students participated in this study, 50.8% of whom were boys; the number of participants in grades 1, 2 and 3 were 979, 1085 and 1017, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 27.3%. Individuals with poor sleep quality were 3.558 (95% CI = 2.716-4.660) times as likely to have anxiety symptoms than those with good sleep quality. Higher negative coping style scores increased the prevalence of anxiety symptoms (OR = 2.101, 95% CI = 1.894-2.332), whereas higher positive coping style scores were related to reduced odds of anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.892, 95% CI = 0.800-0.995). Interactions of coping styles and sleep quality with anxiety symptoms were not found (all p > 0.05). The association between negative coping style and anxiety symptoms was mediated by sleep quality.
   Limitations: This study was cross-sectional and limited to Ganzhou City.
   Conclusions: The results of our study showed a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms compared with the result of a previous study in Chinese school adolescents. Negative coping style and poor sleep quality were associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety symptoms, whereas positive coping style was related to a decreased prevalence of anxiety symptoms. Sleep quality was a mediating factor between negative coping style and anxiety symptoms.

AB Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a trans-nosographical condition characterized by mood instability, severe irritability, aggression, temper outburst, and hyper-arousal. Pathophysiology of emotional dysregulation and its potential biomarkers are an emerging field of interest. A Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) profile, defined as Dysregulation Profile (DP), has been correlated to ED in youth. We examined the association between the CBCL-DP and indices of sympathetic arousal in children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and healthy controls.
   Method: The current study sought to compare the arousal level measured via electrodermal activity in response to emotional stimuli in three non-overlapping groups of children: (1) ODD + CBCL-DP (n = 28), (2) ODD without CBCL-DP (n = 35), and (3) typically developing controls (n = 25).
   Results: Analyses revealed a distinct electrodermal activity profile in the three groups. Specifically, children with ODD + CBCL-DP presented higher levels of sympathetic arousal for anger and sadness stimuli compared to the other two groups.
   Limitations: The relatively small sample and the lack of assessing causality limit the generalizability of this study which results need to be replicated in larger, different samples.
   Conclusion: The CBCL-DP was associated to higher levels of arousal for negative emotions, consistently with previous reports in individuals with depression and anxiety. Further work may identify potential longitudinal relationships between this profile and clinical outcomes.

AB Recent studies on food addiction (FA) provided a better understanding of this condition in various populations. Indeed, authors have shown that FA was nearly as prevalent in adolescents as in adults, and similar correlates were observed in both populations (disordered eating behaviors, depressive and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity). The aim of the present study was to characterize FA in adolescents, according to psychological symptoms and executive functioning difficulties. A sample of 969 adolescents, aged between 12 and 18 years old, was recruited in the Quebec City area. They completed a series of questionnaires, including the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 to measure FA symptoms, the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function to measure executive functioning difficulties, as well as other self-reported questionnaires assessing psychological symptoms (depressive and anxiety symptoms, impulsivity). Group comparisons showed that adolescents with a high level of FA symptoms reported significantly more psychological symptoms (binge eating, depression, anxiety, impulsivity), and more executive functioning difficulties. Finally, the relationship between FA symptoms and executive functioning difficulties was moderated by age and sex. More precisely, the previously mentioned relationship was stronger in young teen girls. The present work provides a preliminary framework in the developmental study of FA.

AB Food addiction (FA) describes a group of disordered eating behaviors. Childhood trauma has been associated with adult FA and trauma has known effects on the endocrine system, but it is unclear whether FA is associated with insulin resistance. We hypothesized that severity of childhood trauma will be associated with FA and higher insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in a sample of obese women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and that FA will mediate the association between childhood trauma and HOMA-IR. Women with a diagnosis of T2DM (N = 73; M-BMI = 35.86, SDBMI = 7.72; M-age = 50.59, SDage = 9.72) were recruited from a diabetes clinic at a county hospital. Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the Yale Food Addiction Scale. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 64 participants to assess plasma hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin and glucose (used to calculate HOMA-IR); Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) was performed to measure change in glucose and insulin secretion. 48% of the sample met diagnostic criteria for FA. Women with FA reported significantly higher HOMA-IR (F = 25.692, p < 0.001, df = 1,62), HbA1c (F = 4.358, p = 0.041, df = 1,62), and OGGT glucose (F = 5.539, p = 0.022, df = 1,62) as well as severity of childhood trauma (F = 10.453,p = 0.002, df = 1,71). In a hierarchical linear regression controlling for BMI, income level, and T2DM treatment, the severity of childhood trauma did not contribute to the prediction of HOMA-IR (beta = - 0.011, p = 0.942) whereas FA did (beta = 0.422, p = 0.007). In a bootstrapped mediation analysis, the association between childhood trauma and HOMA-IR was mediated by FA severity (b = 0.596,p = 0.020). Understanding the psychological factors that contribute to HOMA-IR in an underserved population of African American women may lead to more effective diabetes management and prevention strategies.

AB This study assessed the association between parenting quality at age 15 and 28 months and emotional eating (EE) at age 12 and 16 years through serial mediation by suppression of emotions and alexithymia at 12 years. The sample included 129 children and their parents. Lower parental quality in infancy was related to more suppression of emotions, which in turn was related to more difficulty identifying emotions, and in turn to higher EE in adolescence. This serial mediation model was significant for EE at 12 years, and for EE at 16 years. If future studies reveal converging findings, this knowledge points to the need for programs preventing the development of EE in adolescence through increasing the quality of parenting in infancy.

AB Childhood maltreatment experiences are closely related to aberrant emotional processing that may be associated with resilience. Although different stages of emotion processing, such as identification of emotion, selection of regulation strategies, and implementation of regulation strategies, can be affected by maltreatment experiences, it is still unclear which part of emotion processing is closely associated with the vulnerability the victims have. In this study, we investigated the effects of different emotion regulation strategies on psychological resilience. Among a total of 360 participants, 89 maltreatment and 112 no-maltreatment subjects were included in the analysis of a questionnaire survey. An additional cognitive reappraisal task was conducted in 25 maltreatment and 25 age-, gender-, and education-matched no-maltreatment subjects. The maltreatment group reported greater difficulties in identifying emotion, such as lack of emotional awareness or clarity. Moderation analysis revealed that lack of emotional awareness has a significant effect on the relationship between childhood maltreatment experiences and low psychological resilience. In the cognitive reappraisal task, the maltreatment subjects reported higher negative valence scores on ambiguous neutral pictures than the no-maltreatment subjects. Our results suggest that difficulties in emotional awareness, especially with ambiguous emotional cues, play a crucial role in low resilience in maltreatment victims.

AB Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the common types of birth defects. Children and young people (CYP) with CHD might exhibit behavioural and emotional changes related to undergoing different medical treatments and hospitalization. Therefore, a literature review was conducted from January 2000 to June 2017 that aimed to understand and evaluate current international literature focusing on CYP's behavioural and emotional status as patients with CHD. A comprehensive search of Medline, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases was undertaken. Eight quantitative studies were reviewed following strict eligibility criteria. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the reviewed studies. Parents provided proxy reports on their children's behaviour and emotions in all studies. Half of the reviewed studies presented the self-perceptions of children who were over seven years old. CYP with CHD exhibited internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems, withdrawal, depression, social, and attention problems. CYP with more severe CHD reported greater behavioural and emotional problems than CYP with less severe CHD. Moreover, younger children developed more problems than older children. Future more depth research using qualitative designs is required to explore the personal views of children younger than seven years old on the impact of CHD on their behaviour and emotions.

AB Background Social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adolescents may be associated with the use of maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies. The present study examined the use of maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies in adolescents with SAD. Methods 30 adolescents with SAD (CLIN) and 36 healthy adolescents for the control group (CON) aged between 11 and 16 years were assessed with the standardized questionnaires PHOKI (Phobiefragebogen fur Kinder und Jugendliche) for self-reported fears as well as FEEL-KJ (Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen) for different emotion regulation strategies. Results Compared to controls, adolescents with SAD used adaptive ER strategies significantly less often, but made use of maladaptive ER strategies significantly more often. There was a significant positive correlation between maladaptive ER and social anxiety in adolescents. Examining group differences of single ER strategy use, the CLIN and CON differed significantly in the use of the adaptive ER strategy reappraisal with CLIN reporting less use of reappraisal than CON. Group differences regarding the maladaptive ER strategies withdrawal and rumination, as well as the adaptive ER strategy problem-solving were found present, with CLIN reporting more use of withdrawal and rumination and less use of problem-solving than CON. Conclusions Promoting adaptive emotion regulation should be a central component of psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy-CBT) for social anxiety in adolescents from the beginning of the therapy process. These findings provide rationale for special therapy programs concentrating on the establishment of different adaptive ER strategies (including reappraisal). As an increased use of maladaptive ER may be associated with SAD in adolescents, it may be paramount to focus on reduction of maladaptive ER (for example withdrawal and rumination) from the beginning of the psychotherapy process. Incorporating more ER components into psychotherapy (CBT) could increase the treatment efficacy. Further investigations of the patterns of emotion regulation in specific anxiety groups like SAD in adolescents is needed to continue to optimize the psychotherapy (CBT) concept.

AB Researchers have recently begun to examine motivational factors as moderators of the relationship between self-control and offending behavior. The current study extends prior work by investigating whether three aspects of future orientation (aspirations, expectations, and the use of future-oriented cognitive and behavioral strategies) play such a role. Drawing on 7 years of data from the Pathways to Desistance study (N = 1,333), we use hybrid effects negative binomial regression models to assess how within-individual changes in future orientation and impulse control are independently and jointly related to the offending variety of serious young offenders. Although impulse control and three components of future orientation had significant main effects on offending, no interaction between these components emerged in our results. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB Sport coaches play an influential role in facilitating the development and transfer of life skills of their athletes. In individual sports this influence may be particularly prevalent given the frequency and nature of coach-athlete interactions, which are central to the development of life skills. Yet, studies examining the development of life skills have mainly focused on team sports in school settings and with male participants. Thus, examining individual sports in community settings with female coaches and athletes can provide a unique understanding of the development and transfer of life skills within a little explored setting. The purpose of the present study was to examine the experiences of figure skating coaches and their skaters regarding the development and transfer of life skills. A multiple-case study design was used with four cases, each composed of one coach and two of their athletes. The coaches averaged more than 30 years of coaching experience and skaters competed at the provincial or national level, practicing their sport for an average of 12 years. Two semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant. A content analysis revealed that skaters learned a wide range of life skills, including perseverance, goal setting, emotional regulation, and respect mostly because of their sports' demands. The transfer of these life skills occurred implicitly through changes in skaters' personality reinforced by explicit discussions with coaches, parents, and sport psychologists. These findings suggest that the complexity of life skills development and transfer requires an integrative approach between the key actors in the athlete's sport setting.

AB Background Diverse behaviour problems in childhood correlate phenotypically, suggesting a general dimension of psychopathology that has been called the p factor. The shared genetic architecture between childhood psychopathology traits also supports a genetic p. This study systematically investigates the manifestation of this common dimension across self-, parent- and teacher-rated measures in childhood and adolescence. Methods The sample included 7,026 twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). First, we employed multivariate twin models to estimate common genetic and environmental influences on p based on diverse measures of behaviour problems rated by children, parents and teachers at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 (depressive traits, emotional problems, peer problems, autism traits, hyperactivity, antisocial behaviour, conduct problems and psychopathic tendencies). Second, to assess the stability of genetic and environmental influences on p across time, we conducted longitudinal twin modelling of the first phenotypic principal components of childhood psychopathological measures across each of the four ages. Third, we created a genetic p factor in 7,026 unrelated genotyped individuals based on eight polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders to estimate how a general polygenic predisposition to mostly adult psychiatric disorders relates to childhood p. Results Behaviour problems were consistently correlated phenotypically and genetically across ages and raters. The p factor is substantially heritable (50%-60%) and manifests consistently across diverse ages and raters. However, residual variation in the common factor models indicates unique contributions as well. Genetic correlations of p components across childhood and adolescence suggest stability over time (49%-78%). A polygenic general psychopathology factor derived from studies of psychiatric disorders consistently predicted a general phenotypic p factor across development (0.3%-0.9%). Conclusions Diverse forms of psychopathology generally load on a common p factor, which is highly heritable. There are substantial genetic influences on the stability of p across childhood. Our analyses indicate genetic overlap between general risk for psychiatric disorders in adulthood and p in childhood, even as young as age 7. The p factor has far-reaching implications for genomic research and, eventually, for diagnosis and treatment of behaviour problems.

AB Identifying predictors of teenage alcohol use disorder (AUDs) is a major health initiative, with studies suggesting that there are distinct personality-related traits that underlie patterns of alcohol intake. As temperament is biologically based, identifiable early in life, and stable across time, it is considered the foundation of personality. As such, we hypothesized that neonatal temperament traits would predict anxiety-mediated adolescent alcohol consumption. To test this, N = 145 rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) infants (14 days of age), reared in a neonatal nursery (n = 82) or in a control condition with their mothers (n = 63) were assessed with a widely used standardized nonhuman primate testing battery, the Infant Behavioral Assessment Scale (IBAS), modeled after the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale, evaluating visual orienting, temperament, motor maturity and, more recently, sensory sensitivity. As adolescents (3-4 years of age), these same subjects were allowed unfettered access to a sweetened-alcohol solution for 1 hr/day, 4 days/week, over 5-7 weeks. Subjects were allowed to self-administer alcohol while housed alone (n = 70) or socially in their home cage (n = 55). Linear regressions showed that alcohol intake was predicted by neonatal orienting ability (beta = -.35; p = .01), state control (beta = -.19; p = .04), and motor maturity (beta = -.24; p = .01). Poor neonatal orienting, state control (ease of consolability), and motor maturity were associated with higher adolescent alcohol intake in rhesus monkeys. These findings suggest that neonatal temperament is predictive of patterns of adolescent alcohol intake. To the extent that these results generalize to humans, they provide evidence that early-life temperament and neurodevelopment may be important risk factors for adolescent AUDs and that the IBAS may be used as an assessment tool for identifying such risk.

AB Background: Emotional dysregulation, measured with face recognition tasks, is prevalent in alcohol use disorders (AUD), constituting a risk factor for alcohol use and relapse. It is not clear however whether emotional dysregulation is a by-product of alcohol consumption, or if it can act as a predisposing factor for AUD. Objective: Our aim was to examine early signs of emotional dysregulation in adolescent drinkers. Method: Twenty-four high-school students and 24 university students completed two tasks. On the first one, participants had to gradually increment the emotional content of different faces until they could perceive an emotional expression (emotion perception threshold task). We also examined the propensity to perceive fearful expressions in an emotion identification task. Participants were semantically primed with emotion words (i.e., "fear"), and they then had to indicate whether a neutral-fearful facial composite matched the prime. Results: Using repeated-measures ANOVAS, in the emotion perception threshold task, "happy" faces were the easiest to detect and "sad" ones the hardest. For high school students there was a differential response pattern depending on binge scores, such that High-binge drinkers found it easier to detect a sad face but harder to detect a happy one compared to Low-binge drinkers. In the facial emotion identification task, Low-binge drinkers observed more fearful expressions compared to High-binge drinkers. Conclusions: Differences in emotional processing in young adolescents depending on drinking habits point towards the relevance of emotional dysregulation as an early sign of AUD. These findings could help develop novel diagnostic and treatment tools for young populations.

AB BACKGROUND: Childhood adversity is strongly linked to negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety. Leveraging cognitive neuroscience to identify mechanisms that contribute to resilience in children with a history of maltreatment may provide viable intervention targets for the treatment or prevention of psychopathology. We present a conceptual model of a potential neurobiological mechanism of resilience to depression and anxiety following childhood adversity. Specifically, we argue that neural circuits underlying the cognitive control of emotion may promote resilience, wherein a child's ability to recruit the frontoparietal control network to modulate amygdala reactivity to negative emotional cues-such as during cognitive reappraisal-buffers risk for internalizing symptoms following exposure to adversity.
   METHODS: We provide preliminary support for this model of resilience in a longitudinal sample of 151 participants 8 to 17 years of age with (n = 79) and without (n = 72) a history of childhood maltreatment who completed a cognitive reappraisal task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS: Among maltreated youths, those who were better able to recruit prefrontal control regions and modulate amygdala reactivity during reappraisal exhibited lower risk for depression over time. By contrast, no association was observed between neural functioning during reappraisal and depression among youths without a history of maltreatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that children who are better able to regulate emotion through recruitment of the frontoparietal network exhibit greater resilience to depression following childhood maltreatment. Interventions targeting cognitive reappraisal and other cognitive emotion regulation strategies may have potential for reducing vulnerability to depression among children exposed to adversity.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factor structure and measurement invariance of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Brief version (BIS-Brief) in an archival sample of 315 adolescents (81% male; 63.5% Caucasian; M-age = 16.7 years) participating in a military-style residential program for at-risk youths. Additionally, correlations between BIS scores and external measures of impulsivity-related behaviors were examined. Results showed support for a previously described two-dimensional structure for the BIS-Brief, which was invariant across racial groups. Additionally, the BIS-Brief performed similarly to the total BIS-11 score in relation to external measures of impulsivity-related behaviors. However, the two dimensions exhibited some significant differences in their associations with other measures. This study supports the utility of the BIS-Brief as a brief measure of impulsivity and suggests that the dimensions of the BIS-Brief may be useful in distinguishing how different aspects of impulsivity relate to problem behaviors such as binge drinking and self-injury.

AB Non-obscene socially inappropriate behavior (NOSI) is recognized as part of the tic disorder spectrum but has received little attention from researchers to date. A study in 87 patients with Tourette syndrome showed that comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder were also associated with an increase in socially inappropriate behavior. This study used data from the Millennium Cohort Study to investigate the relationship between NOSI and emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and hyperactivity/inattention as assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 1,280 youths, aged 14 years. Furthermore, the relationship between NOSI and decision-making processes as assessed by the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) was investigated. Hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems were significantly associated with NOSI; emotional problems were not. Risk taking was significantly associated with misbehaving in lessons but not with being rude or noisy in public. The results replicate and confirm the association of NOSI with ADHD and conduct problems in a large sample, although it should be stressed that the size of the association was small. The results also suggest that some inappropriate behaviors are related to risk-taking behavior, while others are not.

AB Background: Personality traits and Emotional Intelligence abilities have gained a central place in the etiology of drug use, although understudied until recently. Objective: To examine the associations between personality traits and Emotional Intelligence in people that are in process of rehabilitation from drug misuse, to compare them with occasional users and non-users and to estimate the factors associated with the likelihood of drug misuse. Methods: 244 individuals (52.5% male) participated in the study. Sixty of them were suffering from drug misuse disorders, thirty-two were individuals that used drugs occasionally and 142 were non-users. Personality was assessed with the EPQ and Emotional Intelligence with the WEILS. Results: Results suggested that in drug misuse, emotional use and regulation are positively correlated with extraversion, and negatively correlated with neuroticism, whilst people that misuse drugs differ from occasional and non-users in emotional use and regulation, and in all personality traits except extraversion. Regression analyses proposed that a combination of sex, age, emotional regulation, and neuroticism contributes to the likelihood of a person abusing drugs, as opposed to occasional or no use. Conclusion: Our findings showcase that Emotional Intelligence and personality traits indeed play an important role in drug use, specifically when considering factors that protect from or drive towards misuse. Such results call for the implementation of preventive programs for occasional drug users and therapeutic interventions for people that misuse drugs, targeting the levels of neuroticism and enhancing the ability of regulating the negative emotions, to protect from drug misuse.

AB Background Impairment of executive function (EF), the goal-directed regulation of thoughts, actions, and emotions, drives negative outcomes and is common across neurodevelopmental disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A primary challenge to its amelioration is heterogeneity in symptom expression within and across disorders. Parsing this heterogeneity is necessary to attain diagnostic precision, a goal of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria Initiative. We aimed to identify transdiagnostic subtypes of EF that span the normal to impaired spectrum and establish their predictive and neurobiological validity. Methods Community detection was applied to clinical parent-report measures in 8-14-year-old children with and without ADHD and ASD from two independent cohorts (discovery N = 320; replication N = 692) to identify subgroups with distinct behavioral profiles. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to predict subgroup membership of unseen cases. Preliminary neurobiological validation was obtained with existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on a subsample (N = 84) by testing hypotheses about sensitivity of EF subgroups versus DSM categories. Results We observed three transdiagnostic EF subtypes characterized by behavioral profiles that were defined by relative weakness in: (a) flexibility and emotion regulation; (b) inhibition; and (c) working memory, organization, and planning. The same tripartite structure was also present in the typically developing children. SVM trained on the discovery sample and tested on the replication sample classified subgroup membership with 77.0% accuracy. Split-half SVM classification on the combined sample (N = 1,012) yielded 88.9% accuracy (this SVM is available for public use). As hypothesized, frontal-parietal engagement was better distinguished by EF subtype than DSM diagnosis and the subgroup characterized with inflexibility failed to modulate right IPL activation in response to increased executive demands. Conclusions The observed transdiagnostic subtypes refine current diagnostic nosology and augment clinical decision-making for personalizing treatment of executive dysfunction in children.

AB Grounded in Lazarus's (1999) cognitive motivational relational theory of emotions, this study aimed to explore longitudinal relationships between appraisals, everyday emotions related to the competitive environment and emotional regulation strategies during a competitive season. Forty adolescent soccer players (Mage = 15.8) involved in an intensive training centre from a professional club voluntarily participated to the study. A series of hierarchical linear modelling analyses were conducted upon the 9 measurement times to: (a) examine the relationships between appraisals (threat, challenge, loss), pleasant (happiness, excitement) and unpleasant (anxiety, dejection, anger) emotions, and emotional regulation strategies (adaptive and less adaptive); and (b) ascertain whether the relationships between appraisals and emotions were mediated by emotion regulation strategies. The results of the random coefficient regression models showed: (a) positive relationships between challenge appraisal, adaptive emotion regulation, and pleasant emotions as well as between threat and loss appraisals, less adaptive emotion regulation and unpleasant emotions; and (b) mediating effects of emotional regulation strategies in the appraisals - emotions relationships. As a whole, this study furthered knowledge base about the competitive environment in showing that appraisals, emotion regulation and emotions are intertwined psychological constructs in a dynamic relationship allowing athletes to continuously adjust to their constantly changing everyday demands.

AB Introduction: Impairments in emotion regulation are understood to be a transdiagnostic risk factor of suffering from compulsive and addictive behaviors. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of emotion regulation deficits in gambling disorder and to analyze these differences taking gender, age, and gambling activity preferences into account. Methods: The sample included n = 484 patients seeking treatment for gambling disorder at a specialized outpatient service. Main outcomes were sociodemographic variables, emotion regulation, and gambling severity. Results: Differences between sexes were found in non-acceptance of emotions. Older patients obtained higher levels in non-acceptance of emotions, lack of emotion regulation strategies, emotional clarity, and global emotion regulation scores. No differences were found in emotion scores considering gambling preferences (non-strategic versus strategic). Path analysis showed that emotion regulation scores and age had a direct effect on gambling disorder severity, while emotion regulation and gambling preference were not mediational variables in the relationships of gender and age with gambling severity. Conclusions: Emotion regulation impairments differ in patients seeking treatment for gambling problems. Early prevention and intervention programs should incorporate the different dimensions of this process, taking into account clinical phenotypes.

AB Objective Although many studies have shown that the corpus callosum (CC) may play an important role in bipolar disorder (BD) and suicide, the pathophysiological mechanism of BD underlying suicidal behavior is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the CC, and BD and suicidal ideation using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Method A total of 203 participants (47 BD patients with suicidal ideation, 59 with BD without suicidal ideation, and 97 healthy controls [HC]) underwent DTI scanning at a single site. We examined the white matter integrity of the CC in the three groups. Results A comparison among groups showed that BD patients with suicidal ideation had significant lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values than those of BD without suicidal ideation and HCs in the body and genu of the CC, and FA values of BD without suicidal ideation were significantly lower than those of HCs. However, in the splenium of corpus callosum, no difference was found between BD without suicidal ideation and HCs. Conclusions Our findings add to the evidence suggesting that the CC plays a key role in BD with suicidal ideation, especially with respect to the role of the genu and body of the CC subserving emotion regulation.

AB Teacher-child relationships and peer relationships are important predictors of children's loneliness. However, few studies have examined the potential and adverse relationship between teacher power and children's loneliness. Thus, we explicitly explored whether teacher power is related to children's loneliness and examined the potential moderating roles of interpersonal relationships (i.e., teacher-child relationships and peer relationships) in 888 Chinese children. Moreover, this study measured teacher power with children's figure drawings. The results showed that teacher power was significantly and positively related to children's loneliness, and both teacher-child relationships and peer relationships moderated the link between the two variables. Specifically, the adverse correlation between teacher power and children's loneliness was not significant among children with high-quality teacher-child relationships. Similarly, the negative effect of teacher power on children's loneliness was not found among children with a high level of peer relationships. Therefore, our results confirmed that the adverse relationship between teacher power and children's loneliness, and the protective roles of high quality of teacher-child relationships and high levels of peer relationships in this relationship. Potential implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB Self-control plays a significant role in positive youth development. Although numerous self-control challenges occur during adolescence, some adolescents control themselves better than others. Parenting is considered a critical factor that distinguishes adolescents with good self-control from those with poor self-control, but existing findings are inconsistent. This meta-analysis summarizes the overall relationship between parenting and self-control among adolescents aged 10 to 22 years. The analysis includes 191 articles reporting 1,540 effect sizes (N = 164,459). The results show that parenting is associated with adolescents' self-control both concurrently (r = .204, p < .001) and longitudinally (r = .157, p < .001). Longitudinal studies also reveal that adolescents' self-control influences subsequent parenting (r = .155, p < .001). Moderator analyses show that the effect sizes are largely invariant across cultures, ethnicities, age of adolescents, and parent and youth gender. Our results point to the importance of parenting in individual differences in adolescent self-control and vice versa.

Feasible interventions for COPMI aged 0-18 years are highly needed, as this is a large high-risk group in society. Reducing behavioral problems and enhancing wellbeing for families with parents affected by any mental disorder are important preventive initiatives. One key prevention strategy is to reduce the risk and expression of psychopathology in children and to promote wellbeing. The present model protocol offers an intervention for children of parents with mental disorders internationally based on a model already implemented in the Netherlands and Norway.
   Methods: Participants will be parents receiving treatment in mental health services in participating countries and their minor children aged 6-18 years. Participants should be randomized into an intervention group or control group. Data should be retrieved from electronic patient journals (demographics, DSM 5/ICD-10, SCID, MINI) as well as from assessment measures administered at baseline and follow-up, including the KIDSCREEN-27, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Parents' Evaluations of Developmental Status (PEDS), Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC), Resilience Scale for Adolescence (READ), Guilt and Shame Questionnaire for Adolescents of Parents with Mental Illness (GSQ-APMI), Mental Health Literacy Scale, and Parent-Child Communication Scale.
   Results: The hypothesis is that there will be improvements of child behavioral and emotional problems, and outcomes in the project will be reported in terms of parent's diagnosis, child behavioral and emotional problems, child wellbeing, family communication and functioning, as well as participants' satisfaction.
   Discussion: This multi-site international protocol will focus the attention of European scientific and policy makers toward COPMI. This young segment of the population is presently almost completely neglected in most European health policies, despite having a large burden of disability and being at risk of transgenerational transmission of psychopathology. We will further discuss the feasibility of a very brief intervention aiming at preventing mental disorders in young people.

AB The present investigation examined associations between low emotional clarity (the extent to which individuals are confused about the specific emotions they are experiencing) and suicidal ideation in a diverse sample of trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents, as well as the moderating role of distress tolerance (DT) in this association. Participants (N = 50; 52.0% female; M = 15.1 years, SD = .51; 44% White) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation/attempts, as well as a behavioral measure of DT. Controlling for age, gender, presence of mood disorder, and past history of attempts, results revealed a significant interaction between DT and low emotional clarity in relation to suicidal ideation. Specifically, lower emotional clarity was related to suicidal ideation at higher, but not lower, levels of DT. Findings suggest that presence of suicidal ideation among traumatized youth with low emotion clarity is most likely when these emotional deficits are coupled with a high tolerance for cognitive/psychological distress. Given that the ability to withstand distress is arguably a key factor in transitioning individuals from ideation to lethal suicidal behavior, attention to the presence of this construct in the context of clinical practice may be warranted.

AB Background: Previous studies revealed that female adolescents are more likely than males to engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) to regulate negative emotions; however, the dimensions of emotion regulation that are associated with NSSI behavior in adolescents require further examination. The present study aimed to identify Taiwanese female adolescent clusters with NSSI engagement frequency and to evaluate the association of specific forms of emotion dysregulation with NSSI. Methods: The participants were 438 female adolescents (mean age = 15.23 years, SD = 1.24, range between 13 and 18) recruited from 11 high schools. Self-report questionnaires assessing NSSI, difficulties in emotion regulation, and positive and negative affect were administered, and 37% of respondents reported a history of NSSI. Results: The analysis of NSSI frequency yielded three groups: severe, moderate, and non-NSSI. High negative affect, low positive affect, and difficulties in all aspects of emotion regulation differentiated female adolescents in the severe NSSI group from their counterparts in the non-NSSI group. The moderate and severe NSSI groups were further distinguished by age of onset, negative affect, emotion regulation strategies, and impulse control. Adolescents classified in the severe group reported earlier onset of NSSI, higher negative affect, less emotion regulation strategies, and more difficulty with impulse control. Conclusions: The results indicate that assessments of NSSI and emotion regulation should be incorporated in youth mental health screening. The clinical implications of NSSI behavior intervention require further discussion.

AB This narrative review examines the effects on children of stigma by association with an HIV-positive parent. It expands on previous reviews by including all HIV-affected children, whether orphaned or living with a parent with HIV, and considers the broad effects of stigma-by-association (SBA), including but not limited to the psychological impact. Studies met the following criteria - sample included children, ages 6-19 years old, who were not HIV-positive but were currently living with or had lived with a parent who was HIV-positive (i.e., AIDS orphans). Study findings included children's perspectives on stigma and were available in English. Studies for inclusion were identified by searches in Psychinfo, Proquest, and PubMed from 1996 through 2016. This review substantiates that children across countries and cultures experience HIV SBA. SBA is associated with psychological or emotional problems, disrupted peer and adult relationships, and poor school outcomes for children. Orphans were more likely than children living with positive parents to experience negative outcomes, which can have a long-term impact. Felt stigma was as prevalent as enacted stigma and may become the focus of intervention as HIV disease increasingly becomes a concealable disease. The review findings also point to the complexity of relationships between SBA and variables such as poverty and mental health and the bi-directional relationship between SBA and depression. We adapt a stigma framework developed for people living with HIV (PLWHIV) to structure the results of this review. With these findings, we can develop interventions that support stigma reduction with children and their parents, responding to the wide range of stigma consequences and customized to the children's family and cultural context.

AB Objective: To analyze the prosocial tendencies and their relationship with empathy and self-efficacy beliefs for the regulation of affection in adolescents detached from illegal armed groups belonging to the Tutor Substitute Home modality in the city of Manizales, Colombia. Methodology: quantitative, non-experimental design of transversal type; the study was of descriptive-correlational scope. Sample: Non-probabilistic on availability, made up of 35 adolescents detached from armed groups, who are in the rights restoration program in the Tutor Substitute Home modality of the ICBF in Manizales (Caldas, Colombia). Instruments: The prosocial trend scale, revised version (PTM-R), the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) and the self-efficacy for affect regulation scale (RESE) were used. Results: The affective components, in terms of empathic concern and emotional self-efficacy, had a greater predictive effect of prosocial behaviors. The findings show that emotional factors, especially in emergencies, obedience or complacency, are related to the prosocial expressions presented by adolescents detached from armed groups that were part of this study.

AB This research investigates the self-reported perceptions, readiness and psychological wellbeing of 15 male primary school students prior to transitioning to a secondary boarding school (S1) located away from home and family. A mixed-methods approach was used (i.e., online questionnaire and focus group), and findings indicate that while participants were apprehensive about expectations, study and encountering new technology at boarding school, all viewed the impending transition to S1 as a positive opportunity in their educational journey. Participants reported academic motivation and self-regulation above the norm; however, both questionnaire and focus group data indicated their academic self-perception was low. Levels of reported psychological distress were low, with symptoms associated with emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, prosocial behaviour and overall total difficulties all found to be within the normal range. Indicators of life satisfaction and protective factors associated with resilience were similarly found to be within the normal range. Four major themes and eight subthemes emerged from the qualitative data, including: (1) enthusiasm (i.e., confidence, sadness); (2) opportunity (i.e., new experiences and choices, friendships); (3) anchor points (i.e., older siblings, orientation); and (4) expectations (i.e., study, technology). The findings of this study add to the literature encouraging staff in boarding schools to view transition through the lens of the early to mid-adolescence developmental period and the emergence of co-occurring innate psychological needs - in particular, the desire for competence, autonomy and relatedness. Strengths and limitations of this study are presented.

AB Objectives The current study investigated the mediating role of emotion regulation and empathy between attachment styles and dark personality traits.
   Methods In total, 350 teenage students from Bushehr schools were selected based on convenience sampling method in the academic year of 2017-18. Then, dark traits test, emotional dysregulation, attachment styles, and empathy were distributed among research participants to respond. Collected data were analyzed by correlation indicators and path analysis in LISREL software.
   Results There was a significant correlation between the components of dark personality traits, empathy, emotional dysregulation, and attachment styles (P<0.05). Moreover, path analysis modeling indicated the mediating role of emotional dysregulation and empathy in the relationship between attachment styles and dark traits (P<0.05).
   Conclusion The obtained results supported the hypothesis that attachment styles lead to dark traits tendencies and emotional dysregulation. Furthermore, empathy can have a moderating role in this regard.

   REGULATION
AB Somewhat surprisingly, social anxiety has been linked with aggressive behavior in adults. Among youth, this connection has been demonstrated with anxiety symptoms more broadly. This review extends previous work by evaluating this association specifically with social anxiety in the child and adolescent literature. Given the complexities of aggressive behavior, the review is organized by its various forms (relational and physical) and functions (reactive and proactive). Findings from sixteen identified studies are suggestive of links between social anxiety and reactive and relational forms of aggression. Albeit more tenuous, there appear to be associations with physical aggression as well. Overall, though suggestive of connections between social anxiety and aggression, confidence in the findings is attenuated by the relatively small number of relevant studies combined with inconsistent gender findings. Before suggesting directions for further study, we propose putative dysfunctional biological, emotional, and cognitive processes as factors that may underlie associations between social anxiety and these particular forms of aggression. Future research should target differences in age, gender, relationship type, and anxiety subtype. Determining the extent to which these associations may be attributable to comorbid pathology such as depression or a broader internalizing syndrome is also important.

AB We examined whether perceived control predict recovery and stress states during an ecological tapering period of 2-weeks that led to the target competition of the year for 39 expert adolescent swimmers (13 women and 26 men; Mage = 17.56; SD = 2.09 years). Swimmers completed quantitative measures (RESTQ-36-R-Sport; Perceived control; A -SAGS) before (Pre_Tapering) and after (Post_Tapering) the tapering period in order to monitor their recovery and stress states, perceived control and goal attainment. Regression analyses integrated perceived control and goal attainment as explicative variables, and Pre_Tapering covariates were included to the model. One of the main finding of this study is that perceived control predict both recovery and stress states. Complementary, goal attainment was a mediator of both the perceived control-recovery and stress states relations and provides support to better understand the cognitive process that underlies recovery-stress balance during tapering periods.

AB Background: Suicide ideation and attempt are alarmingly prevalent in adolescents, and even more so for youth in psychiatric settings. Interpersonal factors have been emphasized as important in the etiology and maintenance of suicide ideation and attempt in adolescents. Evaluating social cognitive deficits offers important insight into processes underlying interpersonal problems associated with suicide ideation and attempt; however little social-cognitive research has been conducted in this area. The aim of the current study was to explore the relation of theory of mind (ToM) impairments and suicide ideation and attempt among adolescent inpatients.
   Methods: A sample of 391 adolescent inpatients completed measures on ToM, suicidal ideation and attempt, clinical symptoms and sociodemographics.
   Results: Binary logistic regression analyses revealed significant relations between excessive ToM (hypermentalizing) and two suicide outcome variables (suicide ideation in the past four weeks, suicide attempt in the past year), while covarying for sociodemographics and multiple clinical symptom scales.
   Conclusions: Excessive ToM, or over-attributing the mental/emotional states of others, appears to share a salient relation to recent suicidal thoughts and behavior in adolescent inpatients. Current findings may indicate that interventions incorporating social cognitive components (e.g., Mentalization Based Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) may be of promise to treating youth with suicidal thoughts and behaviors and excessive ToM.
   Limitations: The current study uses cross-sectional data and discrepancies exist in time periods assessed by primary measures.

AB IMPORTANCE Few data are available to inform the associations and timing of the associations between adversity, caregiver support, and brain outcomes. Consideration of timing has important public health implications to inform more precise prevention strategies.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the timing and regional specificity of the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and caregiver support to structural development of limbic and striatal brain regions in middle childhood and adolescence.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 15-year developmental, neuroimaging cohort study included 211 children and their caregivers screened from day care centers and preschools in the St Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area during the preschool period, with an additional 4 waves of neuroimaging at school age through adolescence from November 14, 2007, to August 29, 2017. The cohort was oversampled for preschoolers with elevated symptoms of depression using a brief screener. Data analysis was performed from March 19, 2019, to July 26, 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Volumes in adolescence and developmental trajectories of volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, subgenual cingulate, and insula during 4 waves of scanning; ACEs and observed caregiver support at preschool and school age; and volumes of amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and subgenual cingulate during 4 waves of scanning.
   RESULTS A total of 211 children (107 [50.7%] male) completed at least 1 scan. At preschool (mean [SD] age, 5.5 [0.8] years), ACE data were available for 164 children (84 [51.2%] male) and maternal support data for 155 children; at school age (mean [SD], 8.3 [1.2] years), ACE data were available for 172 children and maternal support data for 146 children. Unique patterns of the association between ACEs and support were found, with an association between the interaction of preschool ACEs and school-age support and the development of the hippocampus (t = -2.27; P=.02) and amygdala (t = -2.12; P=.04). A buffering hypothesis was not confirmed because high caregiver support was more strongly associated with the development of these regions only in the context of low ACEs. In contrast, preschool ACEs (t = -2.30; P=.02) and support (t = 2.59; P=.01) had independent associations with the development of the caudate.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that there are unique regional associations of support and adversity with key brain structures important for emotional regulation. Results may inform the timing and potential targets of preventive action for the range of poor developmental outcomes.

AB Ambulatory assessment (AA) offers one of the most exciting approaches for opening the dynamic "black box" of adolescents' daily lives. In this introduction, we spotlight AA's surprisingly restricted market share within adolescent scholarship. We describe thorny challenges these intense methods can pose when conducting adolescent research "in situ" and underscore that capturing quality AA data means placing adolescents' developmental stage at the forefront. The novel research reported in this special section speaks to these challenges and underscores the promise of AA for conducting developmentally salient science. The nine articles included in the section span multiple disciplines (Sociology, Psychology, Public Health) and reflect diverse viewpoints, approaches, and theories. All provide multiple novel best-practice strategies for conducting AA scholarship with adolescents.

AB Scholars have long-called for researchers to treat coping as a process that is measured over an arc of time. Ambulatory assessment (AA) offers an appealing tool for capturing the dynamic process of adolescent coping. However, challenges in capturing the coping process are not altogether circumvented with AA designs. We conducted a scoping review of the AA literature on adolescent coping and draw from 60 studies to provide an overview of the field. We provide critiques of different AA approaches and highlight benefits and costs associated with various types of measurement within AA. We also speak to considerations of participant burden and compliance. We conclude with recommendations for developmental scholars seeking to deploy AA to capture this quintessential process among adolescents.

AB Objectives. - This research aims to compare coping strategies (strategies developed to cope with stress) and temperamental dimensions used by children and adolescents have not been maltreated and those who have been. The aim of these analyzes is to identify the effects of age as well as vulnerabilities and resources for children and adolescents who have been maltreated.
   Materials and methods. - A total of 232 children and adolescents aged 7 to 16 years participated in this study including 115 who have never been maltreated (control group) and 117 have been maltreated and are living in foster care (placed group). Each young people responded to a scale measuring the frequency of coping strategies (Kidcope) as well as a questionnaire of temperament (questionnaire d'auto- et d'hetero-evaluation du temperament en sept facteurs pour l'enfant d'age scolaire et l'adolescent).
   Results. - An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for each coping strategy and temperamental dimension to evaluate the consequence of maltreatment on the emotional regulation, according to the slice of age. The age-based comparison of control and placed groups reveals major differences in the use of certain coping strategies as well as in the temperamental dimensions of maltreated children and adolescents. This confirms that the child's life experience influences his way of understanding his environment and affects his individual resources.
   Conclusions. - The results show vulnerabilities of emotional regulation for children and adolescents who have been maltreated. These aspects underline the importance to think about supports in order to promote the development of some coping strategies and to reduce the stressors. These points will be discussed with preventive and therapeutic used to improve coping skills and emotional regulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Prior work has suggested that individuals with deficits in emotion regulation skills are prone to compulsive behaviour and to following maladaptive coping strategies, such as smartphone overuse, to manage negative moods. Adolescence is a vulnerable developmental stage for deficits in emotion regulation, and these are linked to excessive smartphone use. The present study is the first to examine the links between the use of specific cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies and problematic smartphone use in a sample of adolescents. A total of 845 Spanish adolescents (455 females) completed the Spanish versions of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Smartphone Addiction Scale, along with a socio-demographic survey. The adolescents were divided into two groups: Non-problematic smartphone users (n = 491, 58.1%) and problematic smartphone users (n = 354, 41.9%). Significant group differences were found, with the problematic users reporting significantly higher scores for all maladaptive CER strategies, including higher self-blame, rumination, blaming of others and catastrophising. The results from logistic regression analyses show that rumination, catastrophising and blaming of others were the most important variables for distinguishing between the two groups, along with gender and parental control outside the home. In summary, these findings suggest the importance of specific maladaptive CER strategies in problematic smartphone use and provide insight for relevant targets for intervention designs.

AB A substantial body of research confirms that trauma exposure predicts adolescent involvement in the justice system, although the mechanisms accounting for this association are not well understood. The most recent revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013, Washington, DC) diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder introduced a new symptom, that of "self-destructive or risky behavior," which may have particular relevance to understanding posttraumatic reactions in the adolescent period and the processes by which trauma becomes associated with offending. The present article reviews evidence supporting the link between trauma exposure and self-harming or recklessness and outlines theories that propose biological and psychological functions of these behaviors, which can be understood as representing the proposed construct of posttraumatic risk-seeking. Implications for future research and interventions with traumatized youth are discussed.

AB Objectives Migrant youths endure many challenges. Such challenges can be stressful and lead to psychological difficulties. We investigated the relationship between migration, psychopathology and stressful events in children and adolescents. We hypothesised that migrant youths would show higher levels of psychopathology and more stressful life events than non-migrant youths. Method Using the Child cohort (Cohort '98) of the 'Growing up in Ireland' study we investigated psychopathology, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) at age 9 and 13 and stressful life events in migrant and non-migrant youths. Results There was no significant difference between the proportion of migrant and non-migrant youths reporting psychopathology in childhood (p>0.05) or adolescence (p>0.05). Analysis of the SDQ subscales revealed that a significantly greater proportion of migrant youths had hyperactivity problems in childhood (p = 0.04) but a greater proportion of non-migrant youths had emotional problems in early adolescence (p = 0.04). We found that migrant youths experienced significantly more stressful life events than their non-migrant counterparts (p<0.01), however, once 'Moving house/country' was removed as a stressor, there was no difference between the groups (p>0.27). Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed that there were few differences between migrant and non-migrant youths in the levels of psychopathology. Migrant youths experienced a greater number of stressful life events, however, this was attributable to stressors relating to moving. An increased understanding of the factors promoting resilience, as demonstrated by the migrant youths, could aid health professionals and policy makers to effectively tailor interventions for mental health promotion.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have powerful consequences for health and well-being throughout the life course. We draw on evidence that exposure to ACEs shapes developmental processes central to emotional regulation, impulsivity, and the formation of secure intimate ties to posit that ACEs shape the timing and context of childbearing, which in turn partially mediate the well-established effect of ACEs on women's later-life health. Analysis of 25 years of nationally representative panel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY79; n = 3,893) indicates that adverse childhood experiences predict earlier age at first birth and greater odds of having a nonmarital first birth. Age and marital status at first birth partially mediate the effect of ACEs on women's health at midlife. Implications for public health and family policy aimed at improving maternal and child well-being are discussed.

AB The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) comprising 36 items has been widely used across age, gender, psychopathology, language, and culture. Recently several alternative abridged forms have been introduced, namely, the DERS-16 (Bjureberg et al. 2016), the DERS-SF (Kaufman et al. 2016), and the DERS-18 (Victor and Klonsky, 2016), each composed of 16 or 18 items, to provide researchers and clinicians with a shorter measure of emotion dysregulation. However, no study to date has directly compared the psychometrics of these alternative forms. In the present study, using confirmatory factor analysis we first examined the factor structure of the four models of the DERS in two inpatient samples of 636 adolescents in the age-range of 12-17 years (M = 15.33, SD = 1.43), and 1807 adults in the age-range of 18-76 years (M = 34.86, SD = 14.63) with severe mental illness. Next, measurement invariance was tested comparing the two age groups across the four models of DERS. Only the DERS-SF established metric and scalar measurement invariance. Findings suggest that the factor structure of the original and the abridged models of DERS have acceptable fit, however only DERS-SF had equivalence of factor loadings and item intercepts across adolescents and adults.

AB The objective of the study was to analyze the personal and family variables of cyberbullies. and identify variables that predict cyber-aggression. The sample comprised 3,026 participants from the Basque country, aged 12 to 18 years. Using a predictive design, 8 assessment instruments were administered. The results of the analysis of variance and post-hoc analysis confirm that, compared to those who had not performed any cyberbullying behavior (non-cyberbullies) in the last year, cyberbullies (severe and occasional) had been significantly more frequently bully victims and bullies, as well as cybervictims. and they showed less empathy, friendliness, responsibility, and self-esteem, and higher neuroticism, antisocial behavior, and school problems. Moreover, their parents had a low level of acceptance/involvement in their children's lives. Severe cyberbullies (compared to occasional cyberbullies and non-cyberbullies) had significantly less emotion regulation and social adaptation, and more problems (shyness-withdrawal. psychopathological and psychosomatic symptoms), and their parents used high levels of coercion/imposition, and discipline. Linear regression analysis identified having been a cybervictim as a predictor variable of cyberbullying perpetration in both sexes. In addition, in boys, low empathy, low emotional regulation. high openness and extraversion, as well as having a mother with a high level of coercion/discipline predicted cyber-aggression. In girls, having been a bully and having suffered few bullying behaviors were predictors of the probability of becoming a cyberbully. The study identifies relevant personal and family variables to establish strategies to prevent and reduce cyberbullying from the school and family.

AB Super Skills for Life program is a cognitive behavioral intervention protocol based on the transdiagnostic approach. It is aimed at children 6 to 12 years showing symptoms of anxiety and / or depression and consists of 8 weekly intervention sessions. In addition to the components that have usually shown their effectiveness in reducing emotional problems, it includes components such as behavioral activation, social skills training and video-feedback with prior cognitive preparation, which represent an added benefit. Although it was initially created as an indicated prevention program for Anglo-Saxon children, it has been translated and adapted to be administered to the Spanish child population. The efficacy studies that have been carried out with Spanish children show that the program is capable of reducing short and long-term emotional symptoms, and that it reduces other symptoms, such as attention problems and hyperactivity, behavior problems or problems in social relationships. The program is been evaluating to prove its effectiveness in other application formats and with other samples showing promising results.

AB Emotional intelligence allows for the recognition and regulation of emotions in the self and others, making it critical for healthy social and emotional development. Research has shown that the parent-child relationship and family environment are influential in the development of emotion regulation, one key component of emotional intelligence. However, the neurobiological processes underlying this relationship have yet to be fully explored. This review examines perspectives from several disciplines to further understand the influence of parent-child interactions on the neurocircuitry shaping emotion regulation. Our proposed model demonstrates how parent-child interactions and parents' emotion regulation neurocircuitry may influence the development of children's own emotion regulation neurocircuitry, with a specific focus on associations among prefrontal regions, the anterior insula, and the amygdala.

AB Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to experience difficulties with emotion regulation (ER). Treatments designed to address ER difficulties in individuals with ASD are emerging. The authors review cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based treatments that have focused on ER difficulties in youth and young adults with ASD. In general, these treatments addressing ER skills have included awareness of emotions/psychoeducation about emotions, frustration tolerance, and ER skills, as well as practice and use of these skills during group therapy that sometimes includes caregivers. The results from these interventions are encouraging for individuals with high-functioning ASD because ER skills tend to improve following treatment. The inclusion of ER in other ASD treatments is discussed.

AB Individuals on the autism spectrum experience difficulties in social relationships and emotion regulation. The aim of the present exploratory research study was to develop and explore the effectiveness of a manualized emotion regulation group intervention for autistic adults to improve emotion regulation and social communication. The group participants included seven young adults (age > 18 years) on the autism spectrum. Primary outcome measures were the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). Group participants reported significant improvements on the Social Communication and Interaction subscale (SCI; t = 2.601, p = .041), the Social Awareness (AWR; t = 3.163, p = .019), and the Social Cognition (COG; t = 4.861, p = .003) subscales of the SRS-2: Self Report. Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of a group treatment approach that focuses on emotion regulation to improve social interactions for young adults on the autism spectrum.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the sociodemographic, behavioural, and psychological characteristics of students who reported using cannabis in the school-year preceding cannabis legalization in Canada.
   Methods: Data were derived from 36,884 students attending 122 schools that participated in year 6 (2017-2018) of the COMPASS Study, a large, prospective cohort study that administers questionnaires annually in high schools across Canada. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of past-year cannabis use among students. Predictor variables used in the models included indicators of mental health and disorder, other substance use, movement, and students' sociodemographic characteristics. We tested themoderating effects of polysubstance use with interactions between binge-drinking, cigarette use, and e-cigarette use.
   Results: One in 4 students reported past-year cannabis use. Factors associated with higher odds of cannabis use included higher grade, more spending money, identifying as indigenous, use of other substances (binge-drinking, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and opioid use), presence of depressive symptoms, and greater emotional dysregulation. Factors associated with lower odds of cannabis use included increased flourishing, recreational screen time of < 2hours per day, and adequate sleep time of 8 or more hours per night. Significant interactions between concurrent use of other substances on cannabis use were detected.
   Conclusions: Cross-sectional results suggest that students reporting greater psychological wellbeing and engagement in healthy behaviours are less likely to use cannabis. Future longitudinal research should investigate these associations as protective factors, and how the identified correlates may influence changes in student cannabis use patterns postlegalization.

AB Background: Adolescent suicidality is a growing public health concern. Although evidence supports a link between anxiety and suicidality, little is known about risk associated with specific anxiety disorders. Aims: This study examined the prevalence of anxiety disorders in a sample of adolescents with depression and suicidal ideation and the associations between specific anxiety disorders and suicide ideation severity and attempt history. Method: The sample consisted of 115 adolescents (M-age =14.96 years; 55.8% African American) entering a clinical trial for suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. Prior to treatment, adolescents completed self-report and interview measures. Results: In all, 48% of the sample met criteria for an anxiety disorder, 22% met criteria for social anxiety disorder (SAD), and 40% met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). SAD was uniquely associated with more severe suicidal ideation. Limitations: Findings may not generalize to all suicidal adolescents, and non-measured variables may account for the observed relationships. Conclusion: Future research should examine whether targeting social anxiety would improve treatment response for suicidal adolescents.

AB Purpose: Consumption of high calorie/low nutrition (HCLN) foods, as well as high levels of sedentary behavior (SB), may play a substantial role in the development of childhood overweight and obesity. However, the choice to engage or not engage in this behavior may be impacted by limits in executive functioning (EF) - a set of higher order functions related to decision making, planning, and inhibitory processes.
   Methods: The present study, as part of a large multiple health risk behavior trial designed to prevent substance use and obesity, evaluated the relationship between specific subdomains of EF and long-term patterns of HCLN food consumption and SB among a population of elementary school students (n = 709).
   Results: Utilizing a form of mixture modeling based on a latent transition analysis framework, subdomains of EF were found to influence the probability that students would report high levels of HCLN food consumption and SB over a thirty-month period. Gender and socioeconomic status further influenced the likelihood that students with poor EF would repeatedly engage in these unhealthy behaviors.
   Conclusions: HCLN food consumption and SB in childhood can lead to an increased risk of becoming overweight or obese. Findings suggest that long term EF training, as well as the creation of environments that support appropriate decision-making, could be an important focus of future health promotion and education.

AB Peer relationship plays an important role in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, little is known about how and in what conditions peer relationship may influence NSSI. By integrating multiple theories (i.e., attachment theory, the emotional regulation model of self-compassion and NSSI, and the differential-susceptibility theory), the current study investigated two potential mediators (i.e., self-compassion and depressive symptoms) and one potential moderator (i.e., behavioral impulsivity) of the relation between peer acceptance and NSSI. Participants were 813 Chinese adolescents (43% female; Mage at Wave 1 = 13.15 years) from a two-wave longitudinal study with data spanning one year. The results revealed that the indirect pathways linking peer acceptance and NSSI were conditioned on the level of behavioral impulsivity. Specifically, for adolescents with lower levels of impulsivity, a higher level of peer acceptance was related to fewer depressive symptoms directly or indirectly through self-compassion; fewer depressive symptoms, in turn, were linked to fewer NSSI behaviors longitudinally. For adolescents with higher levels of behavioral impulsivity, peer acceptance was related to fewer NSSI behaviors only through self-compassion. Results indicate that increasing peer acceptance is important in reducing adolescent NSSI. Interventions designed to reduce adolescent NSSI may also be effective if they focus on promoting adolescent self-compassion, particularly for adolescents with higher levels of behavioral impulsivity.

AB Emotional inertia represents the extent to which individuals' emotions tend to carry over from one time point to the next. High emotional inertia indicates low emotion regulation ability and has been associated with psychological maladjustment and mood disorders. However, the extent of genetic influence on emotional inertia, particularly in adolescents, is largely unknown. The current study examined genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in emotional inertia. This study followed a sample of 447 17-year-old same-sex UK twins (41% males) with an innovative intensive longitudinal daily diary design that captured their intra-individual emotion fluctuations over one month. Adolescents reported their positive and negative emotions once a day consecutively for up to 40 days. Time series analyses were used to construct emotional inertia and classical twin analyses were used to disentangle its genetic and environmental influences. The results showed that inertia for positive emotion was only modestly heritable and inertia for negative emotion showed no heritability at all. Both measures showed predominantly non-shared environmental influences. These findings highlight the importance of unique environmental influences in shaping individual differences in how well adolescents regulate their emotions and how easily they move from one emotional state to another in daily life. The importance of identifying specific environmental influences on emotional inertia is discussed, and suggestions of what those influences might be are offered.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience high rates of temperamental negative affect and comorbid internalizing and externalizing pathology. The current study explored the role of emotion-specific regulation in accounting for the link between temperamental negative affect and psychopathology among children with ADHD. Forty parents of children ages 8-11 (N =29 males, N =11 females) completed measures of child temperament, emotion-specific dysregulation (i.e., anger dysregulation, sadness dysregulation), and psychopathology. Children completed a measure of emotion-specific dysregulation. Results revealed that anger dysregulation fully statistically accounted for the relationship between temperamental negative affect and concurrent externalizing problems. Sadness dysregulation did not account for the relationship between temperamental negative affect and internalizing problems. These novel findings implicate the robust role of anger dysregulation in explaining the link between temperamental negative affect and concurrent externalizing pathology. The results of this study have significant implications for the treatment of emotionally driven externalizing behavior among children with ADHD.

AB Recent increase in children's screen activities has raised concerns that screen time may replace face-to-face interaction, and hence impair children's development of emotion understanding. This longitudinal community study of 960 Norwegian 4-year-olds, followed up at ages 6 and 8, examined bidirectional relations between screen use and emotion understanding. Results revealed that more screen time at age 4 predicted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 6. In addition, television in children's bedroom at age 6 forecasted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 8. The effect of TV watching on emotion understanding was gender moderated, with stronger effects of TV watching observed among girls, but no significant effects detected among boys. In contrast, gaming forecasted lower level of emotion understanding in boys, not girls. Results are discussed in the light of the importance of face-to-face interaction to preserve the development of social-emotional competence among young children. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject?
   We know that children's screen activities correlate with poorer social competence and with decrease of the quantity and quality of interaction with parents and siblings. The capacity to understand emotions in others is primarily learned through interaction with primary caregivers, but little is known how children's screen use influences development of emotion understanding. What the present study adds?
   We found that more TV watching among girls at age 4 predicted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 6. Furthermore, TV in child's bedroom at age 6 forecasted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 8.

AB Literature circles undoubtedly foster literacy, but successful participation in literature circles requires students' social and emotional competence. The author presents findings from a study of a fifth-grade student who demonstrated socioemotional growth while participating in literature circles. Specifically, growth in intrapersonal and interpersonal skills such as self-management, social awareness, social metacognition, and empathy were evident. These findings suggest that literature circles foster not only literacy but also socioemotional learning.

AB Purpose: Behavior studies have found that exercise addiction is associated with high impulsivity. In other addictions, neural mechanisms of impulsivity reflect abnormalities in the reward and inhibition systems. In this study, we determined whether abnormalities existed in the reward and inhibition systems of exercise addicts. Methods: Three groups of male participants (15 exercise addicts, 18 regular exercisers, and 16 exercise avoiders) completed the Mini International Personality Item Pool (Mini-IPIP), the classic go/no-go task, and the exercise-related go/no-go task. Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded during the go/no-go tasks, and correctly performed trials were analyzed. Results: Exercise addicts scored lower for extraversion and higher for neuroticism, reflecting a poor capacity for emotional regulation and impulse control, and had larger N2 and P3d amplitudes during the exercise-related go/no-go task. Exercise addicts and exercise avoiders demonstrated impaired accuracy in the exercise-related go/no-go task and had larger N2 amplitudes compared with regular exercisers during the letter-digit go/no-go task. Exercise addicts and regular exercisers showed larger Go-N1 and Go-P2 amplitudes compared with exercise avoiders during the exercise-related go/no-go task. Exercisers (exercise addicts and regular exercisers) demonstrated higher activation in response to exercise-related stimuli as reflected by larger N1 and P2, and addicts (exercise addicts) demonstrated poorer inhibition as reflected by larger N2 and P3d amplitudes. Go-N1 and Go-P2 were significantly correlated with no-go accuracy in exercise-related task. Conclusions: Exercise addicts scored higher for the neuroticism personality trait and exhibited overactivation of the reward system and underactivation of the inhibition system. Overactivation of the reward system may be related to long-term exposure to exercise. Underactivation of the inhibition system may be a crucial factor in exercise addiction.

AB Background: There is increasing evidence that people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are impaired in emotion regulation, but psychophysiological and functional MRI data on emotion processing in adult patients with ADHD are scarce. We investigated the neural correlates of reappraisal as one of the most efficient emotion-regulation strategies. Methods: We included 30 adult patients with ADHD and 35 healthy controls in our study. We applied a well-established reappraisal paradigm in functional MRI and assessed behavioural emotion-regulation strategies with standardized questionnaires. We hypothesized that patients with ADHD would demonstrate impaired reappraisal related to reduced activations in the frontoparietal cognitive control network. Results: Despite our hypothesis, we found no significant activation differences in the neural reappraisal network between patients with ADHD and controls. As well, both groups revealed similar reappraisal success on the immediate behavioural ratings in the scanner. Interestingly, patients with ADHD revealed significantly increased activations in the dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared with controls when viewing negative > neutral pictures. These ACC activations were significantly correlated with the prevalence of habitual use of reappraisal in patients with ADHD only. Limitations: Patients withdrew medication only 24 hours before the experiment; we investigated negative, but not positive, emotion processing and regulation. Conclusion: Although emotion dysregulation is regarded as a core symptom of ADHD, explicit reappraisal does not seem to be impaired in adult patients. However, increased activation of the ACC implies stronger implicit emotion regulation induced by negative stimuli. This might be explained by emotional hyperresponsivity in patients with ADHD compared with controls.

AB Objective Nearly 2.5 million service members have served on a deployment with a child at home since 2001. While deployment and reintegration (i.e., when the service member returns home) can negatively impact parenting practices, mindfulness strategies offer a new approach for coping with the stress and uncertainty associated with the deployment cycle. The objective of this paper is to further expand professionals' understanding of how mindfulness can assist military parents. This paper explores the link between mindfulness practices and positive parenting outcomes, and uses the military reintegration period as a context for suggestions as to how professionals can incorporate mindfulness in their work with military families. Methods This comprehensive literature review outlines the research supporting the effectiveness of mindfulness techniques as they apply to parenting. Results This literature review offered key practices of mindful parenting (i.e., listening with full attention, nonjudgmental acceptance of self and child, compassion for self and others, self-regulation in the parenting relationship, and emotional awareness of self and child). This information was then applied within the context of three challenges military parents' encounter during reintegration: renegotiating family roles and responsibilities, reconnecting with children, and managing changes in mental health. Conclusion Military families live both on and off bases throughout the USA and internationally. It is critical that those professionals who work with these families understand the unique contexts that these families encounter and continue to incorporate new tools and resources (e.g., mindfulness) that best serve each of these families.

AB Objectives The current study evaluated the use of MYmind, a concurrent mindfulness program in which youth with autism and their parents simultaneously receive group specific mindfulness training. Youth with autism can experience emotional and behavioral challenges, which are associated with parental stress. Mindfulness-based programs are emerging as a promising support for these challenges, for both children and parents. While two studies have documented the use of concurrent parent-child programs, neither involve control conditions. Methods Using a within-subject repeated measures design with a baseline component, 23 parent-child dyads were assessed on mindfulness, mental health, and youth emotion regulation and autism symptoms. Participants also rated their perceived improvement on a social validity questionnaire. Results There was improvement in youth autism symptoms, emotion regulation, and adaptive skills, and in parent reports of their own mindfulness following the program. There was also some indication of a waitlist effect for parent mental health, but not for other outcome variables. Participant feedback was mainly positive. Conclusions MYmind has the potential to contribute to emotion regulation and adaptability in youth with autism, and mindfulness in parents, though more rigorous controlled trials are needed.

AB While emotional and behaviorial problems increase risks to youth development, resilience helps youth adapt and overcome adversity. Research has discussed factors related to youth resilience, emotional problems, and behaviorial problems; however, existing literature excludes non-western sociocultural contexts and has not explored the potential relations among mindfulness and life skills. This study examines the effects of mindfulness and life skills on resilience, emotional problems, and behaviorial problems of adolescents in China. Our data come from a group-administered survey among 60 adolescents from a school for behaviourally delinquent students in Beijing, China, in 2017. The regression results indicate that mindfulness is associated with reduced adolescent emotional and behaviorial problems, whereas life skills are associated with increased resilience. The findings suggest the importance of adolescent interventions that incorporate concepts from both mindfulness and life skills training.

AB This quantitative synthesis of 448 independent studies including 480,830 families revealed small positive associations (rs = .13 to .23) between parents' naturally occurring involvement in children's schooling and children's academic adjustment (i.e., achievement, engagement, and motivation) that were maintained over time. Parents' involvement was also positively related to children's social (r = .12) and emotional adjustment (r = .17) and negatively related to their delinquency (r = -.15), concurrently. Analyses focusing on children's academic adjustment revealed that different types of involvement (e.g., parents' participation in school events and discussion of school with children) were similarly positively associated with such adjustment. The only exception was that parents' homework assistance was negatively associated with children's achievement (r = -.15), but not engagement (r = .07) or motivation (r = .05). There was little variation due to age, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status in the links between different types of involvement and children's academic adjustment.

AB In the past several decades, research on emotional development has flourished. Scientists have made progress in understanding infants', children's, and adults' abilities to recognize, communicate, and regulate their emotions. However, many questions remain unanswered or only partly answered. We are poised to move from descriptions of aspects of emotional functioning to conceptualizing and studying the developmental mechanisms that underlie those aspects. The gaps in our knowledge provide numerous opportunities for further investigation. With this special issue of Developmental Psychology, we aim to stimulate such progress, especially among colleagues at the beginning of their careers. The articles in this issue are intended to challenge our concepts and take research on emotional development in new directions. Toward this end, this special issue includes empirical studies, theoretical articles, novel conceptualizations, methodological innovations, and invited commentaries from scholars across a range of disciplines. In this introductory essay, we briefly review the history of research on emotional development and provide an overview of the contributions of this special issue with thoughts about the current state of the developmental science and areas in which further advancement on emotional development must be made. These include understanding the nature of emotion itself, identifying the mechanisms that produce developmental changes, examining emotion regulation within differing social contexts, and creating measures of culture that acknowledge globalization, historical change, and within-culture differences.

AB Variability is a fundamental feature of human brain activity that is particularly pronounced during development. However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8 to 17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional MRI. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.

AB In recent years, an increased interest in the importance of children's ability to regulate emotions in socially adaptive ways has driven considerable research on the development of emotion regulation. A widely studied emotion regulation strategy known as expressive suppression (ES), in which a person attempts to conceal emotion-expressive behavior, has been the focus of several recent studies of child and adolescent emotion regulation. Like much of the literature on children's emotion regulation strategies in general, this literature lacks a theoretical framework for organizing the findings, understanding their implications, and guiding future research (Cole, Martin, & Dennis, 2004). In the present review, we integrate theory and data on ES in childhood and adolescence using the process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 2015), a framework that is widely used in research with adults, to organize and interpret the findings. Specifically, the process model is used to understand what factors contribute to children's use of ES in a given context and when and why ES might be associated with negative emotional, social, cognitive, and physiological costs. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research, noting major gaps in current knowledge, offering novel ways of thinking about ES in childhood, and highlighting new directions for moving the field forward. Research illuminating the developmental course and correlates of expressive suppression in early life can contribute to a deeper understanding of this emotion regulation strategy and can inform intervention efforts to improve outcomes across the life span.

AB An individual's emotions system can be conceived of as a synchronized, coordinated, and/or emergent combination of physiology, experience, and behavioral components. Together, the interplay among these components produce emotional experiences through coordinated excitatory positive feedback (i.e., the mutual amplification of emotion concordance) and/or inhibitory negative feedback (i.e., the damping of emotion regulation) processes. Different system configurations produce differential psychophysiological reactivity profiles, and by implication, differential moment-to-moment emotional experience and long-term development. Applying dynamic systems models to second-by-second psychophysiological and experience time-series data collected from 130 adolescents (age 12.0 to 16.7 years) completing a social stress-inducing speech task, we describe the configuration of adolescents' emotion systems, and examine how differences in the dynamic outputs of those systems (psychophysiological reactivity profile) are related to individual differences in trait anxiety. We found substantial heterogeneity in the coordination patterns of these adolescents. Some individuals' emotion systems were characterized by negative feedback loops (emotion regulation processes), many by unidirectionally connected or independent components, and a few by positive feedback loops (emotion concordance). The reactivity dynamics of respiratory sinus arrhythmia were related to adolescents' level of trait anxiety.

AB Despite much research and progress in understanding the development of emotion regulation over the past 3 decades, there is still much to be understood about how developing individuals modulate their affect as they go about their daily life. The papers in this special issue highlight context and dynamics as 2 important intersecting foci for future developmental research on emotion regulation. Ecological momentary assessment, passive sensing, and other ambulatory methods offer exciting new tools for capturing contextual features of the environment that may influence the selection of emotion regulation strategies and the effectiveness of specific strategies in different contexts. New interdisciplinary, methodological, and quantitative approaches also offer new tools for better characterizing the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation, including a focus on the coregulation of affect between parents and children. The next generation of emotion regulation researchers will require advanced interdisciplinary, quantitative, and technological skills to be able to leverage new tools that can better characterize the fine-grained dynamics of emotion regulation processes and the precise ways in which social contextual features modulate these processes.

AB Objective: Different domains of internalizing symptoms (somatic, anxiety, depressive) often occur concurrently, suggesting that they may share common etiology. In longitudinal analyses of internalizing among youth, anxiety is often found to precede depression. However, relatively few studies have also assessed how somatic problems, the third symptom domain, are involved in longitudinal patterns of internalizing. In addition, temporal relations among internalizing symptom domains may vary by cultural group as somatic symptoms are posited to be a more culturally-normative way of communicating or experiencing distress in non-Western, interdependent cultures. Thus, the present study examined longitudinal relations among these three internalizing symptom domains in three ethnocultural adolescent samples.
   Methods: 304 European American, 420 Vietnamese American, and 717 Vietnamese adolescents' self-reported internalizing symptoms (somatic, anxiety, depressive) were assessed at three time points, spaced three months apart, using multigroup cross-lagged path analysis.
   Results: Anxiety symptoms consistently predicted increases in depressive symptoms in European American adolescents. In contrast, for Vietnamese and Vietnamese American adolescents, the most consistent relation was with somatic complaints predicting increases in anxiety. Anxiety and depressive symptoms bidirectionally predicted each other among the Vietnamese and Vietnamese American adolescents.
   Conclusions: Cultural group differences were evident in the temporal course of internalizing symptoms. The pattern of results have implications for culturally relevant intervention targets, during a developmental period of risk for internalizing disorders.

AB Dispositional mindfulness is often linked to higher positive affect and lower negative affect, and coping with stress has been hypothesized to mediate these links. However, few studies have explicitly tested the ways in which stress appraisals, coping strategies, or coping flexibility (i.e., fit of coping to controllability appraisals) uniquely relate to mindfulness and well-being. Drawing on a stress and coping framework, the present study tested the degree to which (a) lower stress appraisals mediate mindfulness' effects on daily positive and negative affect; (b) daily coping mediates mindfulness' impact on daily positive and negative affect, above and beyond the effects of stress appraisals; and (c) coping flexibility mediates mindfulness' impact on positive and negative affect, above and beyond the effects of stress appraisals and average daily coping. Participants were 157 undergraduate students (mean age = 17.81; 79% women), completing daily diary questionnaires regarding stress appraisals, coping, and affect for 1 week. Results demonstrate that lower average stress appraisals mediated 19% of mindfulness' effects on negative affect; further, average use of some "mindful" emotion-focused coping strategies (i.e., non-self-blame and acceptance) independently mediated 3%-13% of mindfulness' effects on positive and negative affect. Although mindfulness was associated with greater "fit" of problem-focused versus acceptance coping to high controllability appraisals, coping flexibility did not appear to mediate mindfulness' effects on either positive or negative affect. Thus, mindfulness-based stress management interventions may be most effective by promoting mindful coping to complement, rather than replace, problem-focused coping.

AB Attachment relationships serve as contexts within which children develop emotional capacities. This meta-analytic review assessed the strength of associations of parent-child attachment patterns with the experience and regulation of emotion in children under age 18 years. In a series of meta-analyses (k = 72 studies, N's ranged from 87 to 9,167), we examined children's positive and negative affective experiences (assessed either globally or elicited in specific contexts), emotion regulation ability, and coping strategies. More securely attached children experienced more global positive affect and less global negative affect, expressed less elicited negative affect, were better able to regulate emotions, and more often used cognitive and social support coping strategies. More avoidantly attached children experienced less global positive affect, were less able to regulate emotions, and were less likely to use cognitive or social support coping strategies. By contrast, more ambivalently attached children experienced more global and more elicited negative affect, and were less able to regulate emotions. More disorganized children experienced less global positive affect and more global negative affect. These robust findings provide evidence that attachments to parents have implications for children's emotional development, although more research is needed on whether insecure attachment patterns are associated with distinct emotion profiles.

AB Previous factor-analytic studies identify significant comorbidity between interpersonal-callous (IC) traits and low prosocial behavior (LPB), which, in turn, is associated with high levels of childhood risk exposure and psychopathology. Longitudinal associations between IC, LPB, or their combination, and early-adult health and social functioning have not been investigated, however. Extending a previously-identified bifactor model within a prospective birth cohort, this study applied latent path analysis to test direct and indirect pathways (via adolescent delinquency, substance use, and physical activity) between these general and specific factors (age 13) and (i) emotional problems (age 18), (ii) physical health problems (age 18), and (iii) classification as 'not in education, employment, or training' (NEET; age 20). All models controlled for childhood adversity and IQ. Bifactor-specific estimates indicated that the residual IC factor did not reliably denote unique variance over and above a general factor (IC/LPB). IC/LPB itself was directly associated with NEET classification, while the residual LPB factor was associated with better emotional and physical health. IC/LPB also indirectly associated with emotional problems via greater adolescent delinquency, and with physical health problems via lower physical activity. In contrast, residual LPB variance was either non-significantly or negatively related to these adolescent domains. Findings indicate that the shared variance underlying IC and LPB confers an increased risk for poor health and functional outcomes in emerging adulthood, and highlight delinquency and physical inactivity as potential adolescent treatment targets that may mitigate the risk for health difficulties at high levels of this IC/LPB construct.

AB We examined one-month reliability, internal consistency, and validity of ostracism distress (Need Threat Scale) to simulated social exclusion during Cyberball. Thirty adolescents (13-18 yrs.) completed the Cyberball task, ostracism distress ratings, and measures of related clinical symptoms, repeated over one month. Need Threat Scale ratings of ostracism distress showed adequate test-retest reliability and internal consistency at both occasions. Construct validity was demonstrated via relationships with closely related constructs of anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and emotion dysregulation, and weaker associations with more distal constructs of state paranoia and subclinical psychosis-like experiences. While ratings of ostracism distress and anxiety were significantly attenuated at retest, most participants continued to experience post-Cyberball ostracism distress at one-month follow-up, which indicates that the social exclusion induction of Cyberball persisted despite participants' familiarity with the paradigm. Overall, results suggest that the primary construct of ostracism distress is preserved over repeated administration of Cyberball, with reliability sufficient for usage in longitudinal research. These findings have important implications for translating this laboratory simulation of social distress into developmental and clinical intervention studies.

AB The current study examined the moderating role of friendship quality on the relation between maternal anxiety and internalizing symptoms in a 3-year prospective study of adolescent development. Participants included 177 adolescents (M-age = 16.05, SDage = 0.91) and their mothers. Mothers reported their own levels of anxiety; youth completed self-reports of internalizing symptoms and friendship quality. Positive friendship quality moderated the relation between maternal anxiety and initial levels of internalizing symptoms. Maternal anxiety was associated with steeper increases in internalizing symptoms over time, but only for those with greater negative peer interactions. Findings underscore the important role of both parental and peer relationships in the development of internalizing symptoms and highlight specific avenues for clinical interventions.

AB Purpose To investigate, in adolescents referred for psychiatric services, the associations of initial self-esteem and family functioning with level and change of quality of life (QoL) over a 3-year period, over and above the effect of their emotional problems. Methods Of 1648 eligible 13-18 years old patients attending the child and adolescent psychiatric clinic (CAP) at least once, 717 (54.8% females) were enrolled at baseline (a response rate of 43.5%). Self- and parent reports on the McMaster Family Assessment Device were obtained. Adolescents reported self-esteem on the Rosenberg Scale, and emotional problems on the Symptom Check List-5. Adolescents completed the Inventory of Life Quality in Children and Adolescents (ILC). After 3 years, 570 adolescents again completed the ILC, and for 418 adolescents parent information was available. The longitudinal analysis sample of 418 adolescents was representative of the baseline sample for age, gender, emotional problems, and QoL. We used modified growth-model analysis, adjusted for SES, age, gender and time of contact with CAP, where residual variances for ILC at baseline and follow-up were fixed to 0. Results A poorer family functioning at baseline, reported by parents, was significantly associated with worsening QoL during the 3 years follow-up period (p = 0.001). Conclusions Parents have important knowledge about their families that may reflect long-term influences on QoL development in adolescent psychiatric patients. Health care providers and policy makers should optimize treatment outcomes by addressing family functioning in adolescents with emotional problems.

ID FAMILIES; SCALE
AB Background Dialectical behaviour therapy for adolescents (DBT-A) is an intervention with a growing evidence base for treating adolescents with emotional and behavioural dysregulation. Previous studies have reported on varying lengths of treatment, however, and optimal treatment duration has not yet been identified. While the treatment developers initially proposed a 16-week programme, they have more recently recommended an extension to 24 weeks. This study compares outcomes for adolescents and parent/guardians who participated in 16- and 24-week DBT-A programmes in a community setting. Methods Eighty-four adolescents and 100 parent/guardians participated in 16-week DBT-A, while 68 adolescents and 67 parent/guardians participated in the 24-week programme. Outcome measures for adolescents included the presence and frequency of self-harm, suicidal ideation and depression; and for parents were burden, grief and parental stress. Outcomes were assessed at pre- and postintervention. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the treatment duration effect (24-week vs. 16-week) utilising all available data at pre- and postintervention. Results Data analyses showed a reduction in the presence and frequency of self-harm at postintervention for adolescents in both programmes. Both adolescent and parent participants in the 16- and 24-week programmes also showed changes indicating significant improvement on all self-report outcome measures (p < .05). A treatment duration effect was identified with adolescents in the 24-week programme reporting greater gains on measures of suicidal ideation and depression (p < .05). However, drop-out rates were higher for the 24-week programme. Conclusions The findings of the current study indicate that 24-week DBT-A may have additional benefits in comparison to 16-week DBT-A in terms of further reductions in suicidal ideation and depression. Given the nature of this study, it was not possible to explore a potential time effect, however, so these results should be interpreted with caution. Further research will assist in determining an optimal programme duration of DBT-A.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to compare children with ADHD with children without ADHD on frustration tolerance and to examine the role of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in frustration tolerance within the sample. Method: Participants included 67 children ages 10 to 14 years-old with (n = 37) and without (n = 30) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) ADHD who completed the Mirror Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT), a validated computerized behavioral measure of frustration tolerance. Results: Children with ADHD were more likely to quit this task than children without ADHD, demonstrating lower levels of frustration tolerance. There were no differences in frustration tolerance between children with ADHD + ODD and those with ADHD - ODD. Moreover, ODD did not moderate the relationship between ADHD and frustration tolerance. Conclusion: Our results suggest that low frustration tolerance is directly linked to ADHD and not better accounted for by ODD. This research highlights specific behavioral correlates of frustration in children with ADHD.

AB There is sound evidence that increased level of peer support is linked negatively with youth vulnerably to internalizing and externalizing problems. Conversely, victimization by peers is associated positively with youth adjustment difficulties. The current study examines the mediating role of victimization in the association between classmates' support and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and the moderating role of gender in that association. The study is based on a sample of 243 7th grade Canadian adolescents. The results show that classmates' support has a unique contribution to reduced adolescents' internalizing behaviors above and beyond the effects of parental and teachers' support. This association was partially mediated by youth victimization. Classmates' support was a stronger predictor of internalizing behaviors among females compared to males. With respect to externalizing behaviors, the results indicated that while classmates' support has no direct association with that outcome, parental support plays a central role in predicting externalizing behaviors. The association between classmates' support and externalizing behavior was fully mediated by youth victimization. The current study highlights the importance of support by peers, with whom they interact on a regular basis, to adolescents' well-being and functioning. The results also indicate that parents are still significant figures in adolescents' lives. Those facts should be taken into account when intervening with young people.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often experience higher rates of emotion regulation deficits and peer victimization relative to unaffected children; however, few studies have examined the extent to which emotion regulation is associated with peer victimization among children with ADHD. The current study proposed a model whereby ADHD was directly and indirectly related to peer victimization through emotion regulation, and that emotion regulation directly predicted peer victimization above and beyond the effect of ADHD. Two hundred ten children (133 ADHD, 77 non-ADHD) enrolled in the present study. Parents completed measures to assess ADHD diagnostic status, and parents and children completed measures of emotion regulation and peer victimization. Model testing strongly supported the direct association of emotion regulation on peer victimization for children with and without ADHD, and also provided support for an indirect effect of ADHD on peer victimization through emotion regulation. Using a multi-informant approach, the current study demonstrated that emotion regulation directly effects peer victimization among children with and without ADHD and indirectly effects the relation between ADHD and peer victimization. For all children, the inability to regulate and cope with emotions appears to play a powerful role in the frequency with which they experience peer victimization, and for children with ADHD, increased rates of peer victimization are likely attributable to co-occurring deficits in emotion regulation.

AB Adolescent involvement in bullying as a victim or perpetrator has been associated with negative health outcomes, including emotional distress and substance use. Whether negative affect and substance use are acute responses to bullying involvement or whether they develop over time is unknown. Such knowledge is needed to understand the conditions under which bullying contributes to adverse outcomes, as well as to inform the development of appropriate interventions. This study examined the daily-level associations among bullying, negative affect, and substance use (i.e., alcohol, cigarettes, electronic-cigarettes, marijuana) among a community sample of adolescents (N = 204) ages 13-16 years (55% female, 81% European American, 13% African-American) who had reported bully victimization or perpetration in the past 6 months. Participants completed a brief on-line survey every day for 56 consecutive days, reporting on their experiences with bully victimization, bully perpetration, mood, and substance use for that day. Consistent with hypotheses, being bullied on a given day was associated with reporting greater than average levels of sadness (b= 0.279, 95% CI= [0.172, 0.387]), anger (b= 0.354, 95% CI= [0.242, 0.466]), and cigarette use (OR= 1.453, 95% CI= [1.006, 2.099]) on that day; however, it was not associated with alcohol, electronic-cigarette, or marijuana use. Perpetration was not associated with same day negative affect or substance use. Results of the current study suggest that negative affect and cigarette use may be acute responses to bully victimization. Bully perpetration does not appear to be proximally linked to mood or substance use after accounting for victimization.

AB Background Little is known about genetic and environmental influences on the components of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), tonic irritability (i.e., irritable mood) and phasic irritability (i.e., temper outbursts). This study examined prevalence, stability, and heritability of tonic irritability, phasic irritability, and a DMDD proxy (pDMDD) based on DSM-5 criteria. Methods pDMDD was derived using data from clinical interviews of parents and their twins (N = 1,431 twin pairs), ages 8-17, participating in Waves 1 and 2 of the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development. Biometrical modeling was used to compare a common pathway model (CPM) and an independent pathway model (IPM), and heritability estimates were obtained for pDMDD using the symptoms of irritable mood (tonic irritability; DMDD Criterion D), intense temper outbursts (phasic irritability; DMDD Criterion A), and frequent temper outbursts (phasic irritability; DMDD Criterion C). Results Lifetime prevalence of pDMDD was 7.46%. The stability of DMDD symptoms and the pDMDD phenotype across approximately one year were moderate (.30-.69). A CPM was a better fit to the data than an IPM. Phasic irritability loaded strongly onto the pDMDD latent factor (.89-.96) whereas tonic irritability did not (.28). Genetic influences accounted for approximately 59% of the variance in the latent pDMDD phenotype, with the remaining 41% of the variance due to unique environmental effects. The heritability of tonic irritability (54%) was slightly lower than that of frequent and intense temper (components of phasic irritability; 61% and 63%, respectively). Conclusions Compared to tonic irritability, phasic irritability appears to be slightly more stable and heritable, as well as a stronger indicator of the latent factor. Furthermore, environmental experiences appear to play a substantial role in the development of irritability and DMDD, and researchers should seek to elucidate these mechanisms in future work.

AB Youth violence in high schools is a pervasive and persistent problem in the United States. Students engage in physical fights, experience bullying and teen dating violence (TDV), are threatened with weapons, and miss school due to safety concerns. However, despite theoretical support, research has not sufficiently addressed the relationship between students' fear and fighting at school. This secondary analysis used data from the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (n = 13,583) to examine the relationship between fear at school, victimization, and engagement in fighting at school among high school students. We created a 3-item composite fear variable, conducted logistic regression to examine likelihood of fighting, and multinomial regression to examine risk for multiple fights, and stratified all models by gender. Findings indicate that both male and female students who experienced fear were more likely to engage in fights at school than peers who did not experience fear, even when controlling for other factors. Likewise, the more fear incidents a student experienced, the more at risk they were for engaging in multiple fights. Findings on victimization indicate that the relationship with fighting is more straightforward for male students than for female students. For males, being bullied and experiencing multiple incidents of physical and sexual TDV were all associated with fighting at school. For females, however, only one type of victimization was associated with fighting at school: experiencing multiple incidents of physical TDV. Overall, findings suggest that fear may be more than merely a by-product of fighting, but rather-as the extant research supports-fear also can be generalized across situations and displayed through patterns of aggression. Findings support the need for interventions aimed at skill-building in areas of communication, emotion regulation, conflict resolution, and healthy relationships to help youth-particularly those in younger grades-negotiate interpersonal relationships without the use of violence.

AB Transgender adolescents may require for inpatient psychiatric care, and have unique healthcare needs and can face barriers to quality care. This study sought to address limited understanding of the inpatient experience of transgender adolescents. This study uses qualitative methods to gain insight into the experience of transgender adolescents and psychiatric care providers on an adolescent inpatient psychiatric unit in the northeast United States. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients (9 total, ages 13-17) and unit care providers (18 total). These interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Patients and providers generally reported a supportive inpatient environment. Factors that contributed to this environment were efforts by care providers to respect patients regardless of gender identity, to use patient's preferred identifiers, and to acknowledge mistakes in identifier use. Barriers to consistently supportive interactions were also identified, including a lack of consistent identification of a patient's transgender identity in a supportive manner during the admission intake, challenges associated with the presence of birth-assigned name and gender within the care system (e.g. in the electronic medical record, identifying wristbands, attendance rosters), and a lack of formal training of care providers in transgender cultural competency. Interviews also provided insight into how providers grapple with understanding the complexities of gender identity. Findings suggest that gender-affirming approaches by providers are experienced as supportive and respectful by transgender adolescent patients, while also identifying barriers to consistently supportive interactions that can be addressed to optimize care.

AB Purpose: Incorporating the resource-oriented music therapy framework, the present study aims to examine the effectiveness of a designed protocol, integrating positive psychology, and elements of music therapy, in increasing the sense of hope and enhancing emotional competence, hence decreasing anxiety and increasing subjective happiness of the adolescents with anxiety symptoms. Method: Adopting a two-arm randomized controlled trial, 106 Grade 8 to Grade 9 students were recruited from three secondary schools in Hong Kong and randomized into experimental groups and no-treatment control groups. Results: Students in the experimental groups had significant increases in scores of hope, emotional competence, subjective happiness, and significant decrease in anxiety symptoms. Changes in hope were a significant mediator in the relationship between the intervention and decrease in anxiety symptoms and increase in subjective happiness. Discussion: The study provides evidence that integrating positive psychology and music therapy is effective in alleviating psychopathology and enhancing well-being of adolescents.

AB Background Subsyndromal emotional symptoms in adolescence may represent precursors for full-blown emotional disorders in early adulthood. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that drive this development is essential for prevention. Aims Self-referential processing and emotion regulation are remodelled substantively during adolescence, therefore this study examined integration of key neural networks involved in these processes. Method At baseline, clinical and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected for 88 adolescent girls (mean age 15 years), and 71 of these girls underwent repeat clinical assessment after 2 years. These 71 girls were then partitioned into two groups depending on the presence (ES+) or absence (ES-) of emotional symptoms, and differences in dynamic functional network connectivity were determined and correlated with clinical variables. Results The two groups displayed a differential pattern of functional connectivity involving the left lateral prefrontal network (LPFN). Specifically, in the ES+ group this network displayed positive coupling with the right LPFN but negative coupling with the default mode network, and the inverse of this pattern was found in the ES- group. Furthermore, the coupling strengths between left and right LPFN at the irst time point predicted follow-up depression and state anxiety scores. Conclusions Our findings suggest that in adolescent girls, emotional symptoms may emerge as a result of impaired integration between networks involved in self-referential information processing and approach-avoidance behaviours. These impairments can compromise the pursuit of important goals and have an impact on emotion processing and finally may lead to the development of emotional disorders, such as anxiety and depression in adulthood. Declaration of interest None.

This study analyses a large-scale community-based dataset of 28 160 adolescents to explore school-based prevalence of mental health problems and characteristics that predict increased odds of experiencing them. Findings indicate the scale of mental health problems in England is much higher than previous estimates, with two in five young people scoring above thresholds for emotional problems, conduct problems or hyperactivity. Gender, deprivation, child in need status, ethnicity and age were all associated with increased odds of experiencing mental health difficulties.

AB This paper investigates the role that socioeconomic inequality in postnatal depression might play in intergenerational transmission of inequality. Infants' development is thought to be particularly sensitive to mothers' mental health at this time, suggesting that greater early-life exposure to maternal depression among disadvantaged groups might be a root of later socioeconomic inequalities. Heightened contact with health services during this period presents opportunities for intervention, but higher unmet need for treatment of postnatal depression among the disadvantaged might be widening inequalities. The aim of this study is to quantify the potential contribution of postnatal depression to socioeconomic inequalities in adverse childhood health and development outcomes. Regression-based decomposition of the concentration index is used to explore the association between income inequality in postnatal depressive symptoms and income inequality in children's outcomes. Four problems of early adolescence are explored: emotional and conduct problems, special educational needs, and low self-assessed health. Data are taken from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, with a sample of 4359 mothers and children with complete data on outcomes and covariates, and a second sample of 5441 when missing covariates are filled using multiple imputation. The key finding is that socioeconomic inequality in maternal postnatal depression is a significant contributor to inequalities in special educational needs, emotional problems, and low self-assessed health for children at age 11 years, even after accounting for a range of other factors that might explain such associations. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the impact of postnatal depression interventions on inequalities, and the downstream influence on children's outcomes. Addressing inequalities in mothers' postnatal depression might be an avenue for reducing early-life disadvantage for children.

AB Objective We examined if the links between adolescents' parental attachment and depressive symptoms are mediated by emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and identified which mediator has a stronger mediation effect. Method The Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the "Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale" were distributed to 1955 Chinese adolescents (about 50% boys; 49% in senior high school; aged 10-20 years, M = 14.85 +/- 2.86 years) from seven provinces. Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, regression analyses, and mediation analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Results The results showed that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression partially mediated the associations between paternal and maternal attachment and depressive symptoms after controlling for grade and sex. Further, the indirect effects of parental attachment through cognitive reappraisal were stronger than those through expressive suppression. Conclusions These findings suggest that adolescents with secure parental attachment (vs. insecure) have a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms and that increasing use of cognitive reappraisal and decreasing use of expressive suppression may help adolescents reduce their depressive symptoms.

AB The purpose of this narrative review was to synthesize the existing literature on the impact of sleep on daytime functioning in both typically developing (TD) children and children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Correlational studies in children suggest that insufficient sleep and impaired daytime functioning are significantly associated; however, this does not address the causal relationships between sleep and daytime functioning. The review results indicated that there is limited experimental sleep manipulation research in children. In the eight studies that employed experimental methods to examine sleep restriction, the consequences of insufficient sleep were greatest for attention and inconsistent for other domains, such as cognition and emotion regulation. Despite the significant co-occurrence of ADHD and sleep problems, the experimental sleep research focused on the daytime impact of shorter sleep in children with ADHD is extremely limited and as such more research is needed.

AB Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is regarded as one of the most effective treatments for children who have experienced trauma and is rapidly being disseminated. To best ensure efficacy, even among treatment refractory symptoms, a better understanding of the factors that lead TF-CBT to be more or less effective for some children is warranted. One major factor that has not been systematically considered is the role of caregiver psychopathology. Therefore, this systematic review of 18 empirical studies examined how TF-CBT has incorporated caregiver psychopathology into the treatment of childhood trauma and how it is related to treatment outcomes. The results of this review provide preliminary support for TF-CBT decreasing caregiver psychopathology, in terms of symptoms of depression, PTSD, and emotional distress related to the child's experience of trauma, as well as partial support for caregiver depression, rather than caregiver PTSD or distress, influencing child treatment outcomes. It also illuminates the strong need for future TF-CBT studies to routinely measure caregiver psychopathology. Several recommendations are provided to ensure that the emerging research base can inform clinical practice guidelines on how to incorporate caregivers who exhibit psychopathology and potentially develop modifications to the existing treatment to address trauma and symptoms in both members of the caregiver-child dyad, when needed.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are reported to have greater levels of anger rumination than typically developing children. This study examined anger rumination in children with ASD in comparison to children with disruptive behavior disorder without ASD. We also tested if anger rumination is associated with aggression and the core ASD symptoms of restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). This study included three groups of children aged 8-16years: 63 had ASD (ASD group), 79 had disruptive behavior disorder (DB group), and 40 healthy controls (HC). ASD and DB groups showed greater anger rumination relative to the HC group. Anger rumination was associated with RRBs in children with ASD, suggesting the link to core ASD symptoms.

AB The recently developed short form of the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised Child version (ECR-RC) is a promising tool to assess anxious and avoidant attachment in children and adolescents. Yet, evidence concerning its validity in middle childhood is limited. This study aimed to test the psychometric properties of the 12-item ECR-RC for both mother and father forms in a sample of 448 Italian children (50.2% girls) aged between 8 and 13 years. The scale was adapted by changing the response format to make it more understandable for young children. Psychometric proprieties of the brief ECR-RC were investigated by testing its factor structure and internal consistency, invariance across middle childhood and early adolescence, and concurrent and convergent validity. A series of confirmatory factor analyses provided support for the two-factor structure (i.e., anxiety and avoidance) of the ECR-RC, and multi-group confirmatory factor analyses supported its invariance across middle childhood and early adolescence. Older children reported significantly higher latent mean values in avoidant attachment to both parents compared to their younger counterparts. Furthermore, the questionnaire showed evidence of concurrent and convergent validity. Our results indicate that the 12-item version of the ECR-RC is a psychometrically robust instrument to assess avoidance and anxiety toward mother and father among Italian children and early adolescents.

AB Atypical frontal alpha asymmetry is associated with the approach/withdrawal and affective processes implicated in many psychiatric disorders. Rightward alpha asymmetry, associated with high approach, is a putative endophenotype for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, findings are inconsistent, likely because of a failure to consider emotional heterogeneity within the ADHD population. In addition, how this putative risk marker interacts with environmental factors known to increase symptom severity, such as parenting practices, has not been examined. The current study examined patterns of alpha asymmetry in a large sample of adolescents with and without ADHD, including the moderating role of negative affect and inconsistent discipline. Resting-state EEG was recorded from 169 well-characterized adolescents (nADHD = 79). Semi-structured clinical interviews and well-validated rating scales were used to create composites for negative affect and inconsistent discipline. The relationship between alpha asymmetry and ADHD diagnosis was moderated by negative affect. Right asymmetry was present only for those with ADHD and low levels of negative affect. In addition, greater right alpha asymmetry predicted severity of ADHD symptoms for those with the disorder, but only in the context of inconsistent parenting practices. Results confirm right alpha asymmetry is a possible endophenotype in ADHD but highlight the need to consider emotional heterogeneity and how biological risk interacts with child environment in order to fully characterize its relationship to disorder liability and severity.

AB The current study identified profiles of trait mindfulness in a sample of 514 early Chinese adolescents (mean age = 10.54 years), and examined their associations with emotion regulation. Latent profile model was built on five facets of mindfulness (observing, non-judging, acting with awareness, describing, and non-reactivity). Results showed negative correlations of the five facets among the four identified profiles: Judging & High Mindfulness (Profile 1, 43.1%), Non-reacting Observing (Profile 2, 6.7%), Non-judging & Low Mindfulness (Profile 3, 20.4%), and Non-judgmental Awareness (Profile 4, 29.7%). Judging & High Mindfulness and Non-reacting Observing profile used significantly more reappraisal than the other profiles. Besides, Non-reacting Observing applied significantly more behavioral suppression than the other profiles. The result indicated diverse patterns of trait mindfulness among the early adolescents, and the associations of trait mindfulness with emotion regulation should be considered comprehensively with all facets, rather than separately.

AB Objective: Recent research has documented cultural differences in the extent and manner in which various forms of emotion regulation are linked with psychological well-being. Most of these studies, however, have been cross-sectional, nor have they directly examined the values underlying the use of emotion regulation. The present study examined emotion restraint values and their interactions with life stress in predicting internalizing symptoms across time among Vietnamese American and European American adolescents. The study focused on adolescence as a critical developmental period during which life stress and internalizing symptoms increase significantly. Method: Vietnamese American (n = 372) and European American (n = 304) adolescents' levels of emotion restraint values, internalizing symptoms, and stress were assessed at two timepoints six months apart. Results: Results indicated differential associations between emotion restraint values, stress, and symptoms over time for the two groups. For Vietnamese American adolescents, emotion restraint values did not predict depressive, anxiety, or somatic symptoms. For European American adolescents, emotion restraint values predicted higher somatic symptoms but buffered against the effects of interpersonal stress on anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These results provide increased understanding of the role of values related to emotion restraint in shaping adolescent internalizing symptoms and responses to stress across cultural groups. Implications of the findings for guiding intervention efforts are discussed.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the severity of certain communication disorders (CD) in a sample of Syrian refugee children. There are a limited number of studies about CD among refugee children. Design/methodology/approach Over a period of 22 months, 161 cases of CD - not caused by motor or structural disorders - were seen at a Mental Health Clinic in Beqaa, Lebanon. The authors calculated descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) and bivariate statistics to identify relationships between CD, demographics and school enrollment among cases. Findings Ages ranged between 3 and 16 years with a mean of 6.91. Male to female ratio was 1.6:1. The most prevalent category of CD was speech, followed by expressive language, then receptive language. Parents reported behavioral or emotional problems in 38 percent of the cases; emotional problems, mainly anxiety, were much more common than behavioral problems. Enrollment in school was associated with a lower number of impairments and less severe speech and language impairments. Originality/value The results highlight the importance of early detection and intervention among Syrian refugee children. Schools can alleviate some psychological issues that compound CD by enhancing resilient behaviors and providing social support. They can also implement measures for detection and intervention.

AB Statement of Purpose: Residential Immersive life skills (RILS) programs are unique programs for youth with disabilities. These programs enable youth to develop adaptive behaviors required to navigate adulthood. This study explored the emergence of emotional literacy development for youth who attended RILS programs. Methods: This study draws on twenty-five qualitative interviews that were conducted with nine youth who attended RILS programs. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, aligned to a phenomenological approach. Results: The themes reflecting emotional literacy development in youth were: (1) Enhanced intrapersonal development; (2) Shifts in emotional regulation and emotional responses; (3) Realized potential and self-actualization. Conclusions: The opportunities and experiences offered in the RILS programs have the potential to facilitate emotional literacy development in youth with disabilities. The findings contribute towards the research evidence on the importance of emotional literacy development in young people with disabilities and the development and mobilization of evidence-based life skills programs.

AB Inconsistencies exist regarding the relation between physical activity (PA) and internalizing symptomology in early adolescence, and there is need for investigation of potential moderators that may account for these discrepancies. The current study utilized a Self-Determination Theory Framework to investigate the main effects of five key motivations to exercise and their moderating effects between PA and internalizing problems in an underserved sample of adolescents (n = 167; mean age = 12.19 years; 73% African American). Analyses showed that intrinsic motivations were negatively related to internalizing problems and extrinsic motivations were positively related. PA was only protective against internalizing problems when intrinsic motivations were high and had iatrogenic effects when these were low. Exploratory analyses further delineated the unique effects of motivational orientations. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB The present study examined the health promotion intervention needs of Latinx immigrant farmworker families residing in Oregon. Grounded theory qualitative procedures were used to analyze the needs assessment data from 31 Latinx immigrant farmworker residents and key informant interviews as well as four focus groups with resident youth and parents. A theoretical model of how key family-based health behaviors can both confer risk for and protection against negative physical, mental, and social health outcomes among Latinx farmworking communities emerged. Six primary areas of concern emerged from these data, leading to the identification of primary health promotion intervention needs with three foci: (a) the provision of sustainable supports and resources, (b) skill development so that individuals could successfully negotiate identified challenges, and (c) greater community efficacy. Findings underscore the importance of social support and resource accessibility for Latinx immigrant populations.

AB As they respond to children's emotions, mothers socialize children's emerging emotion regulation. Mothers' own autobiographical narratives likely reflect in part habitual ways of expressing and managing emotions-ways that may in turn influence the way mothers respond to their children's emotions. We examined features of mothers' narratives about parental pride and regret experiences, and assessed whether these were associated with parental socialization of emotion and the emotion regulation repertoire of their children. Two hundred thirty-seven mothers with children ranging from 8 to 17 years of age provided two narratives about parental pride and parental regret experiences. Parental emotion socialization and children's emotion regulation were assessed via self- and informant-report using a multi-measure, multi-observer approach. We found that features of the way mothers narrated their experiences with a particular child related to their parenting of that child, and that child's emotion regulation. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for emotion-related parenting, and the potential importance of parent narratives.

AB Difficulties with emotion regulation have been identified as an underlying mechanism in mental health. This pilot study aimed at examining whether group skills training in emotion regulation for adolescents and parents as an add-on intervention was feasible in an outpatient child and adolescent psychiatric clinic. We also investigated if the treatment increased knowledge and awareness of emotions and their functions, increased emotion regulation skills and decreased self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Six skills training groups were piloted with a total of 20 adolescents and 21 adults. The treatment consisted of five sessions dealing with psychoeducation about emotions and emotion regulation skills training. Paired-samples t test was used to compare differences between before-and-after measures for adolescents and parents separately. The primary outcome measure, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, showed significant improvement after treatment for both adolescents and parents. For adolescents, measures of alexithymia were significantly reduced. Also, emotional awareness was significantly increased. Measures of depression and anxiety did not change. In conclusion, group skills training as an add-on treatment can be feasible and effective but further studies are needed.

AB Objective: ADHD and depression co-occur at higher than chance levels in adolescence, but moderators of this association are not well understood. Consistent with a developmental-transactional framework, one such moderator may be maternal emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Using latent growth curve modeling, the current study examined the independent and interactive effects of adolescent ADHD symptoms and maternal ER difficulties on the trajectory of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Method: This study included a community sample of 247 adolescents (M-age = 13.06 years) assessed annually over a 6-year period. Results: Findings suggested that youth with greater ADHD symptoms whose mothers evidenced more ER difficulties demonstrated steeper increases in depressive symptoms over time relative to their peers with lower ADHD symptoms or whose mothers reported fewer ER difficulties. Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of maternal ER difficulties in predicting the trajectory of depressive symptoms among adolescents with ADHD symptomatology.

AB Background Survivors of childhood brain tumors are prone to sleep and neurocognitive problems. Effective interventions to improve neurocognitive functioning are largely lacking. In general, sleep problems are negatively related to neurocognitive functioning, but this relationship is unclear in survivors of childhood brain tumors. Therefore, the occurrence of sleep problems, potential risk factors, and the relation between sleep and executive functioning were evaluated. Procedure Baseline data of a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of neurofeedback were used. Childhood brain tumor survivors 8-18 years of age with parent-reported neurocognitive complaints >= 2 years after treatment were eligible. Parents completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Executive functioning was assessed by parents and teachers (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine sociodemographic and medical characteristics and emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) as potential risk factors for sleep problems, and to assess the association between sleep and executive functioning. Results Forty-eight percent of survivors (n = 82, 7.0 +/- 3.6 years post diagnosis, age 13.8 +/- 3.2 years) had sleep problems and scored significantly worse than the norm on the subscales Initiating and Maintaining Sleep, Excessive Somnolence, and the total scale (effect sizes 0.58-0.92). Emotional problems and/or hyperactivity/inattention were independent potential risk factors. Sleep problems were associated with worse parent-reported executive functioning. Conclusions Sleep problems occur among half of childhood brain tumor survivors with neurocognitive problems, and are associated with worse executive functioning. Future studies should focus on the development of sleep interventions for this population, to improve sleep as well as executive functioning.

AB Background: Prevention of depression and anxiety disorders early in life is a global health priority. Evidence on risk and protective factors for youth internalizing disorders indicates that the family represents a strategic setting to target preventive efforts. Despite this evidence base, there is a lack of accessible, cost-effective preventive programs for parents of adolescents. To address this gap, we recently developed the Partners in Parenting (PiP) program-an individually tailored Web-based parenting program targeting evidence-based parenting risk and protective factors for adolescent depression and anxiety disorders. We previously reported the postintervention outcomes of a single-blinded parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which PiP was found to significantly improve self-reported parenting compared with an active-control condition (educational factsheets).
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the PiP program on parenting risk and protective factors and symptoms of adolescent depression and anxiety using data from the final assessment time point (12-month follow-up) of this RCT.
   Methods: Parents (n=359) and adolescents (n=332) were recruited primarily from secondary schools and completed Web-based assessments of parenting and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, postintervention (3 months later), and 12-month follow-up (317 parents, 287 adolescents). Parents in the PiP intervention condition received personalized feedback about their parenting and were recommended a series of up to 9 interactive modules. Control group parents received access to 5 educational factsheets about adolescent development and mental health. Both groups received a weekly 5-min phone call to encourage progress through their program.
   Results: Intervention group parents completed an average of 73.7% of their intended program. For the primary outcome of parent-reported parenting, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement from baseline to 12-month follow-up compared with controls, with a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72). When transformed data were used, greater reduction in parent-reported adolescent depressive symptoms was observed in the intervention group (Cohen d=-0.21; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.01). Mediation analyses revealed that these effects were mediated by improvements in parenting (indirect effect b=-0.08; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01). No other significant intervention effects were found for adolescent-reported parenting or adolescent depression or anxiety symptoms. Both groups showed significant reductions in anxiety (both reporters) and depressive (parent reported) symptoms.
   Conclusions: PiP improved self-reported parenting for up to 9 months postintervention, but its effects on adolescent symptoms were less conclusive, and parent-reported changes were not perceived by adolescents. Nonetheless, given its scalability, PiP may be a useful low-cost, sustainable program to empower parents of adolescents.

AB Research conducted with violent offenders demonstrates an overwhelming tendency for individuals in this population to frame their violent acts as tuned responses to perceived slights ranging from verbal insults to ostensibly nonviolent physical actions. To date, no review has characterized and categorized specific situational cues that are associated with interpersonal violence/ideation. Here, literature addressing attitudes, attributions, and triggers around reactive forms of violence and perspectives on violence deservedness was thematically and narratively reviewed using a theoretical framework focused on shame and threatened social bonds. Of the 29 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 11 statistically assessed relationships between attributions, attitudes, or triggers and subsequent violence/ideation, with 10 (90.1%) demonstrating, in subgroup analysis, statistically greater attitudes endorsing violence when shame or a threat to a social bond manifested. Overall, three primary axes of attribution, attitudes, or triggers toward interpersonal violence emerged from the review: (1) generalized intrapersonal justifications, (2) environmental and social group triggers, and (3) jealousy and triggers in the context of romantic relationships. These dynamics, both inside and outside of the United States, are reviewed, and a conceptual intervention model is presented. Findings illustrate that behavioral interventions specifically targeting individual- and community-level pathways to shame manifestation and emotion regulation represent an underutilized yet auspicious approach to curbing violence ideation and perpetration.

AB Patient-centered care includes efforts to align treatment with patient preferences to improve outcomes and has not been studied in adolescent depression prevention. Within a school-based randomized trial, we examined the effects of offering a preference between two evidence-based preventive interventions for youth at risk of depression, Learning to BREATHE (L2B) and Interpersonal Therapy-Adolescent Skills Training. We examined the effects of 3 preference factors (assignment condition [preference vs. random], receipt of preferred program, and baseline program preference) on outcomes in a diverse sample of 111 adolescents (Mage = 15.18 years, SD = .86): 81 (73%) girls, 45 (41%) White, 40 (36%) Asian American, 8 (7%) Latinx, 1 (1%) African American, and 17 (15%) multiracial or other race/ethnicity. Findings revealed little evidence that receiving a preferred intervention or being given a choice of interventions was linked to greater improvement or initial engagement. Further, analyses did not indicate that adolescents with baseline indications for a specific intervention would benefit more from that intervention; rather, adolescents with generally lower baseline functioning improved more regardless of the intervention received. However, receipt of L2B and a baseline preference for L2B were associated with greater improvements in about half of the outcomes examined, with effect sizes ranging from R-2 = 0.04 to 0.14. There was little support for the need to match interventions to adolescent preferences in school-based prevention efforts. Rather, the more scalable mindfulness-based intervention had stronger effects than the interpersonal intervention and may hold promise for diverse adolescents.

AB Background: An abnormal interaction between cognition and emotion may contribute to the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Aims: In this study, we aimed to evaluate theory of mind and emotion regulation skills in adolescents diagnosed with OCD. In addition, the results were evaluated in accordance with patients' insight levels. Methods: This study was conducted with 50 patients, who were aged between 11 and 16 and who were newly diagnosed with OCD and 50 healthy individuals. The Turkish version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime was used to diagnose OCD and other comorbidities. The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were used for clinical evaluation. The intelligence levels were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Short Form. Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was used in patients. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale was also used to evaluate the skills of regulating emotions. Results: Patients with OCD had lower ability with regard to reading minds in the eyes and emotion regulation than the healthy individuals. Patients with OCD, who had a poor insight, had more difficulty in reading minds in the eyes and emotion regulation than those with good insight. Conclusions: This study supports the idea that OCD is related to deficits in theory of mind and emotion regulation skills. Thus, further studies are required to confirm the findings of this study.

AB The study examined the effectiveness of PRERAYMI (Promoting Responsiveness Emotion Regulation and Attachment in Young Mothers and Infants) attachment-based intervention programme aimed at adolescent mother-infant dyads. The intervention used video-feedback and developmental guidance to promote maternal mind-mindedness and sensitivity. 32 adolescent mother-infant dyads in the intervention group were compared to 12 adolescent mother-infant dyads in the control group. Maternal mind-mindedness and maternal/infant styles of interaction were evaluated, at the pre-treatment (infant 3 months) and at the post-treatment (infant 9 months). The results indicated the effectiveness of the intervention in enhancing mind-mindedness, with more mind-related comments and fewer non-attuned mind-related comments, maternal sensitivity and infant cooperative behaviour, and in reducing maternal controlling behaviour, in the intervention group. Changes in mother/infant interaction styles or in mind-mindedness in the control group were not detected. The attachment based medium term intervention helped to improve adolescent mother-infant relationship, which is otherwise potentially at risk.

AB Identifying factors for the prediction of depression is a long-standing research topic in psychiatry and psychology. Perceived stress, which reflects the tendency to appraise one's life situations as stressful and overwhelming, has emerged as a stable predictor for depressive symptoms. However, the neurobiological bases of perceived stress and how perceived stress influences depressive symptoms in the healthy brain remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated these issues in 217 healthy adolescents by estimating the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs) via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A whole-brain correlation analysis showed that higher levels of perceived stress were associated with greater fALFF in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG), which is a core brain region for cognitive control and emotion regulation-related processes. Mediation analysis further indicated that perceived stress mediated the link between the fALFF in the left SFG and depressive symptoms. Importantly, our results remained significant even when excluding the influences of head motion, anxiety, SFG gray matter structure, and school environment. Altogether, our findings suggested that the fALFF in the left SFG is a neurofunctional marker of perceived stress in adolescents and revealed a potential indirect effect of perceived stress on the association between the SFG spontaneous activity and depressive symptoms.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit significant difficulties with emotion regulation and reactivity, which may be linked to underlying psychophysiology. The present study examined associations between autonomic nervous system activity and individual differences in externalizing behavior problems in children with ASD. A multisystem approach was adopted to consider the interplay between markers of sympathetic (electrodermal reactivity-EDA-R) and parasympathetic reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity-RSA-R) in relation to behavioral challenges. Fifty-two children with ASD ages 6-10 years contributed complete psychophysiological data. Measures of EDA-R and RSA-R (RSA withdrawal) were obtained in response to a laboratory challenge task and parents reported on child externalizing behavior problems using a standardized questionnaire and a structured clinical interview. An equifinality model was supported, with two distinct psychophysiological pathways linked to heightened externalizing behavior problems. Greater RSA-R was associated with more externalizing problems in the context of higher levels of EDA-R, and lower EDA-R was associated with increased externalizing problems at lower levels of RSA-R. Findings underscore the importance of considering the role of psychophysiology in the unfolding of comorbid externalizing problems in children with ASD. Potential implications for tailoring coregulatory supports are discussed. Autism Res 2019, 00: 1-15. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit elevated rates of challenging behavior. This study identified specific psychophysiological profiles (low sympathetic-low parasympathetic reactivity, and high sympathetic-high parasympathetic reactivity) that may place these children at greater risk for behavior problems. Findings have implications for better understanding behavioral challenges in children with ASD, and for tailoring supports to address underlying psychophysiology.

AB The aim of the study was to examine sex differences in self-reported psychological distress, behavioural and emotional problems, and substance use in young people living in out-of-home care (OoHC). One hundred seventy-six young people aged 12-17 years (females 53.4%) in OoHC in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, were interviewed. Participants completed self-report measures: Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test-Youth Version. Girls had more OoHC placement instability over the past year compared with boys (p = .019). Compared with boys, the girls had significantly higher levels of distress (p < .001) (p = .007), were more likely to have self-reported emotional symptoms (p < .001) and peer relationship problems (p = .043) and were more likely to use sedatives (p = .004). Girls had more psychological distress, behavioural disturbance, and sedative abuse; placement instability might contribute to these problems. Greater integration across OoHC, mental health, and substance use sectors is required. Girls in OoHC may benefit from interventions targeting problems with peer relationship and substance use and supporting prosocial behaviour; such targets may reduce distress and emotional symptoms and possibly prevent longer term problems.

AB Anxiety is a common and impairing problem in children with autism spectrum disorder, but little is known about it in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder. This article reports on the characteristics of anxiety symptoms in young children with autism spectrum disorder using a parent-completed rating scale. One hundred and eighty children (age 3-7 years) participated in a clinical trial of parent training for disruptive behaviors. Anxiety was measured as part of pre-treatment subject characterization with 16 items from the Early Childhood Inventory, a parent-completed scale on child psychiatric symptoms. Parents also completed other measures of behavioral problems. Sixty-seven percent of children were rated by their parents as having two or more clinically significant symptoms of anxiety. There were no differences in the Early Childhood Inventory anxiety severity scores of children with IQ < 70 and those with > 70. Higher levels of anxiety were associated with severity of oppositional defiant behavior and social disability. Anxiety symptoms are common in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder. These findings are consistent with earlier work in school-age children with autism spectrum disorder. There were no differences in anxiety between children with IQ below 70 and those with IQ of 70 and above. Social withdrawal and oppositional behavior were associated with anxiety in young children with autism spectrum disorder.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the psychosocial problems, quality of life and parenting styles in children with hearing impairment. A total of 84 children (42 children with hearing impairment and 42 healthy children) and their parents were included. The emotional, behavioural, peer and school-related problems were significantly higher, and self-esteem levels were significantly lower in the case group compared to the healthy children. We also determined that the parents of children with hearing impairment had overprotective and authoritarian parenting styles compared. The findings showed that there was a significant correlation between the emotional problems of children and the overprotective and authoritarian parenting style. These findings indicated that the intervention should not focus solely on the existing disabilities of these children. It also pointed at the importance of the parental attitudes in both the treatment and protection of mental health.

AB Background: A secure attachment style could promote more intimacy in romantic relationships, while an insecure attachment style could be correlated with less positive romantic relationships in adulthood. Numerous studies have noted that a secure attachment to parents was correlated with lower levels of aggression, whereas insecure attachments were associated with higher levels of aggression. We aimed to investigate the role of the attachment system as a mediator of the expression of aggressiveness during adolescence. Specifically, we considered that the attachment to parents and peers could influence one's attachment to a romantic partner.
   Methods: We empirically tested whether there were relationships of parent and peer attachment on aggressiveness mediated by romantic attachment style. Participants of the study included 411 students.
   Results: Results indicated that for males an insecure father-child attachment style seems to be associated with higher levels of anxiety and avoidance in romantic attachments and then with aggressiveness. For females, an insecure mother-child attachment style seems to be associated with higher levels of aggressiveness.
   Conclusion: The attachment to parents and to peers plays a key role in defining romantic attachment according to gender, and these dimensions in turn tend to affect the levels of aggressiveness.

AB Objective: This study examined psychosocial distress and substance use in young adults with asthma (A), obesity (O), comorbid asthma and obesity (AO), or neither (controls). Participants: Eight hundred eighty-one young adults were included in the A, O, AO, or control group. Methods: ANCOVA and logistic regression analyses were performed to compare responses to screeners for psychological distress and substance use among the four groups. Results: Levels of depressive symptoms, worry, nonsuicidal self-injury, emotion dysregulation, and chronic pain symptoms differed across groups, with the A and AO groups showing greater psychological distress than the O and control groups. The AO group exhibited the highest levels of cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, while the O group exhibited the least frequent binge drinking behaviors. Conclusions: Individuals with asthma or comorbid asthma and obesity appear to experience the poorest psychosocial functioning and highest use of tobacco products. Potential mechanisms and implications of these relationships are discussed.

AB Adolescence has been noted as a period of increased risk taking. The literature on normative neurodevelopment implicates aberrant activation of affective and regulatory regions as key to inhibitory failures. However, many of these studies have not included adolescents engaging in high rates of risky behavior, making generalizations to the most at-risk populations potentially problematic. We conducted a comparative study of nondelinquent community (n=24, mean age=15.8 years, 12 female) and delinquent adolescents (n=24, mean age=16.2 years, 12 female) who completed a cognitive control task during functional magnetic resonance imaging, where behavioral inhibition was assessed in the presence of appetitive and aversive socioaffective cues. Community adolescents showed poorer behavioral regulation to appetitive relative to aversive cues, whereas the delinquent sample showed the opposite pattern. Recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, and tempoparietal junction differentiated community and high-risk adolescents, as delinquent adolescents showed significantly greater recruitment when inhibiting their responses in the presence of aversive cues, while the community sample showed greater recruitment when inhibiting their responses in the presence of appetitive cues. Accounting for behavioral history may be key in understanding when adolescents will have regulatory difficulties, highlighting a need for comparative research into normative and nonnormative risk-taking trajectories.

AB Childhood maltreatment is associated with increased risk for most forms of psychopathology. We examine emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking maltreatment with general psychopathology. A sample of 262 children and adolescents participated; 162 (61.8%) experienced abuse or exposure to domestic violence. We assessed four emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal, attention bias to threat, expressive suppression, and rumination) and emotional reactivity. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed concurrently and at a 2-year longitudinal follow-up. A general psychopathology factor (p factor), representing co-occurrence of psychopathology symptoms across multiple internalizing and externalizing domains, was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis. Maltreatment was associated with heightened emotional reactivity and greater use of expressive suppression and rumination. The association of maltreatment with attention bias varied across development, with maltreated children exhibiting a bias toward threat and adolescents a bias away from threat. Greater emotional reactivity and engagement in rumination mediated the longitudinal association between maltreatment and increased general psychopathology over time. Emotion dysregulation following childhood maltreatment occurs at multiple stages of the emotion generation process, in some cases varies across development, and serves as a transdiagnostic mechanism linking child maltreatment with general psychopathology.

AB Introduction Compromised integrity of the brain due to paediatric acquired brain injury (pABI) has been associated with cognitive impairment, particularly executive dysfunction, in addition to somatic and emotional symptoms and reduced everyday function. Goal Management Training (GMT) is a cognitive rehabilitation intervention for improving executive function (EF) that has received empirical support in studies of adults with ABI. The purpose of the present study is to determine the efficacy of a recently developed paediatric version of GMT (pGMT) for children and adolescents with ABI and reported executive dysfunction.
   Methods and analysis This study protocol describes a parallel randomised controlled trial including allocation concealment and assessor blinding. Eighty survivors after pABI, aged 10-17 years at the time of intervention, will be recruited. Participants will be randomly allocated to either pGMT (n=40) or a psychoeducative control intervention (n=40; paediatric Brain Health Workshop). Both interventions consist of seven group sessions for participants and parents, followed by external cueing and telephone counselling. The study also includes involvement of teachers. Assessments will be performed at baseline, immediately postintervention and at 6 months' follow-up. Primary outcome measure will be changes in daily life EF as reported by parents (The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function). Secondary outcomes include other assessments of EF (neuropsychological tests and questionnaires). Furthermore, we aim to assess generalisation effects of pGMT on other cognitive functions, as well as emotional, behavioural, adaptive and family function, academic performance, fatigue and quality of life.
   Ethics and dissemination Results from this study will be disseminated to relevant research, clinical, health service and patient communities through publications in peer-reviewed and popular science journals, in addition to presentations at scientific conferences. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration and the Ethical Research Involving Children (ChildWatch International and Unicef). In accordance to Good Clinical Practice our study includes safety and quality monitoring guarantees in compliance with research ethics and safety. The trial will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 statement and Standard Protocol Items for Reporting in Trials recommendations, in addition to being registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study has been approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics Norway (2017/772).

AB The present research was conducted by the aim of investigating the role of early maladaptive schemas, social adjustability, and emotional regulation in expression of aggression among students of University of Tehran. The study sample included 375 students of University of Tehran who were selected via cluster sampling method. The research design was correlation, and the data analysis was conducted through Pearson correlation coefficient and concurrent regression analysis in SPSS-20. The findings suggested that early maladaptive schemas had a significant and positive relationship with aggression, and also, two schemas of distrust and abstinence explained a considerable part of variance in aggression in university students. The research findings implicated the importance of educational and therapeutic interventions in relation to reconstruction of the maladaptive schemas for the purpose of reducing aggression among the university students.

AB Study Objectives: To evaluate the association between depressive symptoms, sleep patterns (duration and quality), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and physical activity (PA) in adolescents with narcolepsy.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included adolescents (ages 10-18 years) with narcolepsy attending a tertiary care facility (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Adolescents with narcolepsy completed questionnaires evaluating depressive symptoms (Children's Depression Inventory-2nd edition [CDI-2]), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), EDS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), and PA (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire). Wrist-based actigraphy was worn by adolescents for 1 week to measure total sleep time (over 24 hr) and sleep efficiency percentage.
   Results: Thirty adolescents with narcolepsy (mean age = 13.8 +/- 2.2 years, 76.7% male) participated. In this cohort of adolescents with narcolepsy, 23.3% had CDI-2 total scores in the elevated range. Greater CDI-2 total scores were associated with poor sleep quality (rho = 0.571; p = 0.02), EDS (rho = 0.360; p = 0.05), and lower self-reported PA levels (rho = -0.512; p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Adolescents with narcolepsy report experiencing depressive symptoms, which are associated with poor sleep quality, EDS, and low PA levels. Strategies to improve nocturnal sleep quality and symptoms of EDS as well as promoting increased PA levels in adolescents with narcolepsy may provide an opportunity to improve depressive symptoms in this population. Multidisciplinary care with mental health and sleep specialists for adolescents with narcolepsy is needed.

AB ObjectivesWe aimed to compare obese children and their non-obese counterpart on children's negative emotionality, emotion regulation and maternal parenting styles and to examine the joint contribution of children's temperament and maternal styles to children's obesity.MethodsA total of 200 mothers were involved in this study, 100 with children diagnosed with obesity (49 boys, 51 girls; the age ranged from 6 to 12 years), and 100 with children with a normal weight (49 boys, 51 girls; the age ranged from 6 to 12 years). Mothers completed self-report measures on children's emotionality, emotion regulation, and parenting styles.ResultsThe comparison between the two groups showed that obese children, compared with their non-obese counterpart, had higher levels of negative emotionality and emotional lability and a lower level of emotion regulation; they also had more authoritarian and permissive mothers than non-obese counterpart. Logistic regressions showed a joint contribution of the authoritarian parenting style and emotional lability to obesity, so that both at lower and higher levels of emotion lability, children's obesity tended to be lower when authoritarian style was low and to be higher when authoritarian style was high.ConclusionsUnderstanding the mechanisms through which parenting styles and characteristics of children are associated to obesity risk may lead to the development of more-comprehensive and better-targeted interventions.

AB Objective The current study compares the measures of sleep quality and intensity of insomnia based on the clustering analysis of variables including dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, experiential avoidance, personality traits of neuroticism, and complications with emotion regulation among the individuals struck by an earthquake in Kermanshah Province. Methods This study is a cross-sectional study that was carried out among earthquake victims of Kermanshah Province (western Iran) in 2017. Data were gathered starting 10 days after the earthquake and lasted for 2 weeks; of 1,200 standard questionnaires distributed, 1,001 responses were received, and the analysis was performed using 999 participants. The data analysis was carried out using a cluster analysis (K-mean method). Results Two clusters were identified, and there is a significant difference between these two clusters in regard to all of the variables. The cluster with higher mean values for the selected variables shows a higher intensity of insomnia and a lower sleep quality. Conclusions Considering the current results, it can be concluded that variables of dysfunctional attitudes and beliefs about sleep, experiential avoidance, the personality traits of neuroticism, and complications with emotion regulation are able to identify the clusters where there is a significant difference in regard to sleep quality and the intensity of insomnia.

AB Background
   An association has been found between lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) and emotional and behavioral problems, particularly in cases of urinary incontinence. Other associated symptoms and the coexistence of functional constipation require further investigation.
   Objective
   To assess whether emotional and behavioral problems are more common in children and adolescents with LUTD.
   Study design
   A multicenter, cross-sectional, population-based study conducted in public places. Parents answered questions on urinary and psychological symptoms in their children aged 5-14 years. Children/adolescents with neurological problems or anatomical urinary tract abnormalities were excluded. The Dysfunctional Voiding Scoring System was used for assessing urinary symptoms, the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for evaluating bowel symptoms, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for evaluating emotional and behavioral problems.
   Results
   Of the 806 children/adolescents included, 53% were female. The mean age was 9.1 +/- 2.7 years. The prevalence of LUTD was 16.4%. Overall, 26.2% had abnormal scores in the overall SDQ scale, 29.2% in the emotional problems subscale, and 30% in the conduct problems subscale. Of the children with LUTD, 40.5% screened positive for emotional/behavioral problems, with a significant association being found for the overall SDQ scale (P < 0.001) and for the emotional problems (P < 0.001), conduct problems (P < 0.001), and hyperactivity (P = 0.037) subscales. Urinary urgency, urinary incontinence, and voiding postponement were significantly associated with a greater prevalence of abnormalities in the overall SDQ score (P = 0.05; P = 0.004, and P = 0.012, respectively). Bladder and bowel dysfunction was an aggravator of emotional and behavioral problems, with more intense symptoms, both in the overall SDQ scale and in the subscales. In the multivariate analysis, the factors independently associated with the presence of emotional and behavioral problems were LUTD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91), constipation (OR = 1.7), studying in a government-funded school (OR = 2.2), and poor education of the head of the family (OR = 1.9).
   Conclusions
   Children and adolescents with LUTD have more emotional and behavioral problems, with bladder and bowel dysfunction being an aggravating factor for this association.

AB This meta-analysis of adolescent mental health interventions identifies successful program components across those promoting positive mental health, preventing depression and anxiety, and preventing risk behaviors.
   CONTEXT: Although adolescent mental health interventions are widely implemented, little consensus exists about elements comprising successful models. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify effective program components of interventions to promote mental health and prevent mental disorders and risk behaviors during adolescence and to match these components across these key health outcomes to inform future multicomponent intervention development. DATA SOURCES: A total of 14 600 records were identified, and 158 studies were included. STUDY SELECTION: Studies included universally delivered psychosocial interventions administered to adolescents ages 10 to 19. We included studies published between 2000 and 2018, using PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase, and Applied Social Sciences Index Abstracts databases. We included randomized controlled, cluster randomized controlled, factorial, and crossover trials. Outcomes included positive mental health, depressive and anxious symptomatology, violence perpetration and bullying, and alcohol and other substance use. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 3 researchers who identified core components and relevant outcomes. Interventions were separated by modality; data were analyzed by using a robust variance estimation meta-analysis model, and we estimated a series of single-predictor meta-regression models using random effects. RESULTS: Universally delivered interventions can improve adolescent mental health and reduce risk behavior. Of 7 components with consistent signals of effectiveness, 3 had significant effects over multiple outcomes (interpersonal skills, emotional regulation, and alcohol and drug education). LIMITATIONS: Most included studies were from high-income settings, limiting the applicability of these findings to low- and middle-income countries. Our sample included only trials. CONCLUSIONS: Three program components emerged as consistently effective across different outcomes, providing a basis for developing future multioutcome intervention programs.

AB Introduction We examined sexual harassment, alongside other forms of peer victimization, as correlates of self-worth, depression, and anxiety (emotional adjustment). In addition, we investigated joint moderating effects of gender and age in the relationship between sexual harassment and emotional adjustment.
   Methods: Participants were 277 high school and 492 university students (12-24 years, 60% female) residing in Australia. All completed a survey to report sexual harassment experiences, as well as in-person and online/social media appearance-related peer victimization, global self-worth, and social anxiety and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Age was positively associated with sexual harassment, as well as with general and social media victimization; males and females did not differ. Participants who reported more sexual harassment reported poorer adjustment, but only the association with depressive symptoms remained significant after controlling for other forms of peer victimization. When gender and age were tested as moderators, the positive association between sexual harassment and depression was significant for all groups but younger males and there was a positive association between harassment and anxiety among only younger females and older males.
   Conclusion: Sexual harassment was commonly reported, but rather weakly and intermittently associated with emotional health, after controlling for appearance-related peer victimization. Future research should examine when and why youth seem fairly resilient to negative emotional effects that could follow sexual harassment. It is possible that messages about the cause of sexual harassment are being heard and this aids youth to avoid self-blame and emotional maladjustment.

AB Introduction: Youth of color (e.g., Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic) are over-represented in the juvenile justice system and experience greater health disparities compared to non-Hispanic White youth. Ethnic/racial discrimination (ERD) is a risk marker for poor mental health and behavioral outcomes among youth of color, and traumatic stress and emotion dysregulation have been implicated in these pathways. Despite the relevance of these factors for justice-involved youth of color, understanding of their interrelations within this demographic is lacking.
   Methods: Participants were 173 recently arrested adolescents (86% African American; 45% girls; ages 13-18) on probation in a large Midwest city in the United States. Participants completed surveys assessing ERD, traumatic stress, emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. Using linear regression and path analysis, this study tested the cross-sectional links among two types of ERD (i.e., interpersonal experiences and perceptions of group experiences), traumatic stress symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors.
   Results: Interpersonal ERD (e.g., hearing racial insults) was associated with increased internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors; for internalizing symptoms, the relation was stronger for girls than boys. Gender differences were partially accounted for by traumatic stress symptoms and emotion dysregulation.
   Conclusions: This study offers new insights into ERD experiences among juvenile justice-involved youth of color, gender differences in ethnic/racial discrimination experiences, and the potential value of gender-sensitive and culturally responsive programming in strengthening youths' ability to cope with ERD.

AB Introduction: Depressive symptoms and non-suicidal self-injury not only increase in prevalence during adolescence, but they can also occur together. Both psychological problems seem to have similar precipitating conditions, suggesting they have transdiagnostic conditions-personal or contextual characteristics that contribute to co-occurrence. We sought to understand when these two problems co-occur and what is related to their co-occurrence.
   Methods: Using a pattern-centered approach and two waves of longitudinal data collected annually, we examined latent profiles of depressive symptoms and self-injury among a Swedish sample of adolescents aged 12 to 16 (M-ageT1 = 13.65 years, SD = 0.64), 53.7% boys and 47.3% girls. Most of the adolescents were Swedish (89%), with parents who were married or cohabitating (68%). We also examined the transitions between profiles over time.
   Results: Our results suggest that during this time frame, depressive symptoms and self-injury tend to emerge and stabilize or abate together. We also examined a broad array of predictors, including individual characteristics, emotion dysregulation, experiences with friends, parents' negative reactions to behavior, and school stress. The significant unique predictors suggest that adolescents who reported being subjected to relational aggression, having negative experiences while drinking, and low self-esteem had a greater probability of moving from moderate to high levels or maintaining high levels of depressive symptoms and self-injury, compared to adolescents classified in the other statuses.
   Conclusions: Focusing on negative interpersonal experiences and selfesteem as transdiagnostic conditions may guide research and aid clinicians in supporting adolescents who feel depressed and engage in self-injury.

AB Objective: This study sought to examine whether anxiety sensitivity was associated with eating disorder (ED) symptom severity among patients with severe EDs, and to determine whether this relationship was mediated by experiential avoidance.
   Method: Adolescent and adult females (N = 625) seeking residential ED treatment completed self-report measures of anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, and ED psychopathology. Linear regression evaluated the cross-sectional association between ED symptom severity and three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (social, physical, and cognitive). Regression-based mediation analysis with bootstrapping tested the associations among the three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity and ED symptom severity through experiential avoidance.
   Results: The social dimension of anxiety sensitivity was positively associated with severity of ED psychopathology. Experiential avoidance mediated this association.
   Discussion: ED symptoms in this sample were more severe among patients who endorsed greater concern about appearing nervous or anxious to others. The current results indicate that this relationship was driven by a tendency to avoid experiences that evoke emotional discomfort. If replicated, these findings suggest that targeting both social anxiety sensitivity and experiential avoidance may improve ED treatment outcomes. Further study of the mechanistic relationships among social anxiety sensitivity, experiential avoidance, and ED psychopathology, is warranted.

AB Purpose: This study evaluated the pathways between developmental language disorder (DLD), psychosocial risk factors, and the development of emotional difficulties from ages 3 to 11 years within the Millennium Cohort Study.
   Method: A total of 14,494 singletons (49.4% female) from the Millennium Cohort Study were evaluated within this study. Risk of DLD (rDLD) was defined as age 5 parent-reported language problems and/or -1.5 SDs on a Naming Vocabulary subtest at the age of 5 years. Children without rDLD formed the general population comparison group. Psychosocial risk factors included 9-month temperamental traits, parental psychological distress, and maternal attachment as well as age 3 emotional regulation abilities, parent-child relationship, and peer problems. The parent report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Emotional Difficulty subscale at 3, 5, 7, and 11 years of age was the outcome variable. The trajectory of emotional difficulties was evaluated within a variable-centered approach and a person-centered approach, using growth mixture modeling.
   Results: Children with rDLD (n = 884) had increased levels of emotional problems when compared to the general population group (n = 13,344). Psychosocial risk factors were increased in children with rDLD, fully mediated the increased emotional difficulties at 3 years, and partially mediated the increased emotional difficulties at 11 years. Children with rDLD were more likely to be included in emotional trajectory subgroups with an increasing pattern of emotional problems. rDLD was an additional risk factor for lower levels of emotional self-regulation and increased peer problems when controlling for the emotional difficulties trajectory subgroup.
   Conclusion: This article indicates that the increased emotional difficulties found in children with rDLD are likely a function of early language difficulties influencing other domains of development, specifically social interactions (parent and peer) and emotional self-regulation abilities. Clinically, this reiterates the importance of early identification and treatment of children with language delays or clinical level language disorders.

AB Purpose of review
   Mindfulness, the practice of paying attention to the present moment, purposefully and nonjudgmentally, has been gaining popularity as adjunct treatment for adolescents with a range of physical and mental health problems. Research conducted in adults and emerging research conducted in adolescents has shown that mindfulness-based interventions can improve outcomes in several areas. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent research on the effects of mindfulness and suggest exercises that primary care clinicians can offer to their adolescent patients.
   Recent findings
   Research has shown positive effects of mindfulness across several health conditions commonly encountered during adolescence. Mindfulness-based Interventions can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. The application of mindfulness can help with the prevention and treatment of binge eating, over-eating, and restrictive eating disorders. In the treatment of substance use disorders, mindfulness can improve emotion regulation and reduce symptoms of withdrawal and craving. Mindfulness can also lead to improvement in overall quality of life for patients suffering from chronic pain. Lastly, mindfulness can be useful for adolescents with ADHD, sleep problems, chronic illness, and stress related to performance sports.
   Summary
   Although research in adolescents remains limited, mindfulness holds promise in the treatment of a range of health conditions in adolescents.

AB Developmental research documents that anhedonia, or diminished interest in usual activities, is associated with a diverse array of emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. Meanwhile, official nosologies desginate anhedonia as a more specific characteristic of major depressive disorder. Using a quantitative model of the internalizing domain, we compared the strength of transdiagnostic versus diagnosis-specific pathways from anhedonia to major depression (and other internalizing conditions) during adolescence. We recruited 241 youth ages 14-17 who completed semistructured interviews of anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as several self-report surveys of trait anhedonia and neuroticism. Confirmatory factor analysis of diagnostic correlations revealed good fit for a unidimensional model of the 10 internalizing conditions we assessed. This overarching internalizing dimension was statistically significantly correlated with trait anhedonia (r= 0.17) and neuroticism (r= 0.59). In contrast, anhedonia was virtually unrelated to major depression (r = -0.02), net the internalizing dimension. Thus, in this sample, the connection between anhedonia and major depression was explained by a transdiagnostic dimension presumed to underlie all internalizing problems. Compared to neuroticism, however, anhedonia had a more limited association with internalizing, consistent with established personality models of anxiety and depression. We conclude that these data are consistent with conceptualizing anhedonia predominantly as a transdiagnostic correlate of internalizing conditions, rather than a specific marker of major depression, in developmental psychopathology research and clinical interventions for young people.

AB Objective Emotion dysregulation has been consistently linked to suicide ideation and attempt, but an explanatory model for this relationship has not been adequately investigated in adolescents. This study examined the concurrent relationship among emotion dysregulation, variables from the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), and suicide risk (operationalized as a continuous variable that increases in intensity from nonspecific to active suicide ideation to suicide ideation with a plan) in a clinical adolescent sample. Method A total of 151 adolescents (aged 12-17) were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to determine whether the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by the variables of perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness, and capability for suicide, as proposed by the IPTS. Results As hypothesized, the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by PB and capability for suicide. Depressive symptoms had an independent relationship with suicide risk after controlling for IPTS variables. Conclusions The results from this study suggest that effective treatment strategies that reduce negative cognition tied to PB and depressive symptoms would address the most proximal variables related to suicide risk in adolescents. Enhancing emotion management would serve to maintain low levels of proximal influences on risk.

AB Objective In this study, we reexamine the mental pain-suicidality link in adolescence, by focusing on mental pain tolerance as a critical factor in explaining youth suicidal behavior. Method In a series of three studies, participants completed measures of mental pain (tolerance and intensity), emotional regulation, depression, and suicidality. Study 1 included a nonclinical sample of 183 Israeli adolescents. Study 2 included a nonclinical sample of 139 Israeli adolescents, who completed additional measures of self-esteem, optimism, mindfulness, meaning in life, positive affectivity, and life satisfaction. Study 3 included suicidal psychiatric inpatients (N = 24), nonsuicidal psychiatric inpatients (N = 24), and nonclinical adolescents (N = 24). Results In Study 1, mental pain tolerance was significantly associated with depression, suicidality, and emotion-regulation skills. In Study 2, mental pain tolerance was significantly associated with measures of psychological resources. In Study 3, we found that suicidal psychiatric inpatients reported significantly lower levels of mental pain tolerance than nonsuicidal psychiatric inpatients and nonclinical adolescents. No significant group difference was found in the reported intensity of mental pain. Conclusions Findings imply that mental pain tolerance may be a better indicator for suicidal behavior during adolescence than reported pain intensity.

AB Trauma-informed care is recommended to improve the quality of group home services for youth. Youth exposure to trauma and associated symptoms are important factors involved in making the clinical impression that determines treatment services. This study considered three dimensions of trauma (exposure, symptoms, and clinical impression) to determine associations with behavioral incidents of youth in trauma-informed group homes and how trauma was related to changes in psychopathology from intake to discharge. Archival records of youth (N = 1,096), age 9-18 (M = 15.7 years) who received services from January 2013 to December 2017, and departed the program were used. Statistical procedures included hierarchical linear modeling and analysis of covariance. Results indicated trauma symptoms predicted emotional problems and self-injurious behavior. Youth in high- and low-trauma groups both showed decreases in behavioral incidents and psychopathology, but clinical impression of trauma moderated the change in emotional problems from intake to discharge. Youth deemed by clinicians to have lower trauma (based on history of maltreatment and expression of trauma symptoms) had greater decrease in emotional problems from admission to discharge. Limitations and implications for further research on implementation and effectiveness of trauma-informed models are discussed.

This study investigates whether preceding physiological and motion data measured by a wrist-worn biosensor can predict aggression to others by youth with ASD. We recorded peripheral physiological (cardiovascular and electrodermal activity) and motion (accelerometry) signals from a biosensor worn by 20 youth with ASD (ages 6-17 years, 75% male, 85% minimally verbal) during 69 independent naturalistic observation sessions with concurrent behavioral coding in a specialized inpatient psychiatry unit. We developed prediction models based on ridge-regularized logistic regression. Our results suggest that aggression to others can be predicted 1 min before it occurs using 3 min of prior biosensor data with an average area under the curve of 0.71 for a global model and 0.84 for person-dependent models. The biosensor was well tolerated, we obtained useable data in all cases, and no users withdrew from the study. Relatively high predictive accuracy was achieved using antecedent physiological and motion data. Larger trials are needed to further establish an ideal ratio of measurement density to predictive accuracy and reliability. These findings lay the groundwork for the future development of precursor behavior analysis and just-in-time adaptive intervention systems to prevent or mitigate the emergence, occurrence, and impact of aggression in ASD.

Lay Summary Unpredictable aggression can create a barrier to accessing community, therapeutic, medical, and educational services. The present study evaluated whether data from a wearable biosensor can be used to predict aggression to others by youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results demonstrate that aggression to others can be predicted 1 min before it occurs with high accuracy, laying the groundwork for the future development of preemptive behavioral interventions and just-in-time adaptive intervention systems to prevent or mitigate the emergence, occurrence, and impact of aggression to others in ASD.
