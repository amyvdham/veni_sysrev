AB The present study tested whether individual differences in autonomic nervous system functioning interact with environmental risk factors to predict adolescents' psychosocial functioning. The authors assessed skin conductance and respiratory sinus arrhythmia at rest and during laboratory stressors in 110 14-year-olds. Subsequently, adolescents and their mothers provided both questionnaire and daily diary data (over 10 days) on emotional and interpersonal functioning. The authors found stronger associations between environmental risk factors (having a single-mother household or a mother with high internalizing problems) and psychosocial outcomes (externalizing problems, daily negative affect, and daily interaction quality) among youths with specific patterns of tonic and stress-induced sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity, but the pattern of moderating effects differed between boys and girls. The findings support the notion that individual differences in autonomic functioning index variation in youth's susceptibility to environmental risk factors.

AB Anecdotally, burn camp has been reported to be a positive developmental and rehabilitative experience for attendees; there is little empirical data to support this belief. This study sought to explore whether burn camp either directly or indirectly elicits positive development outcomes in pediatric burn survivors or increases their psychosocial well-being and achievement. The Youth Experience Survey 2.0, a 66-item self-report inventory designed to measure developmental experiences in an organized youth activity, was administered to children aged 11 to 18 years attending summer burn camp. One hundred and ten burn-injured youth, 58 male and 52 female, reported that burn camp had positively impacted their lives through improved identity exploration, goal-setting and problem-solving abilities, increased physical activity, communication, emotional regulation, and time management skills (P < .0001). Participants reported more positive experiences than the norm group and higher mean scores on 90% (48) of the 53 positive items. Attendance at burn camp for more than 5 years resulted in greater improvement. Study results support the burn camp experience as a far-reaching and positive developmental activity. Participants credited the camp experience with helping them with identity formation and reflection, improved social interactions, and increased initiative; all positive developmental outcomes for youth. Results suggest that burn camp participation not only helps burn-injured youth to deal with their burns but also assists them in the development of social and basic life skills, which will allow them to navigate the transition from youth to adulthood, more effectively and successfully.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of conduct problems in a well-documented sample of Barbadian adolescents malnourished as infants and a demographic comparison group and to determine the extent to which cognitive impairment and environmental factors account for this association.
   Methods: Behavioral symptoms were assessed using a 76-item self-report scale in 56 Barbadian youth (11-17 years of age) with histories of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) limited to the first year of life and 60 healthy classmates. Group comparisons were carried out by longitudinal and cross-sectional multiple regression analyses at 3 time points in childhood and adolescence.
   Results: Self-reported conduct problems were more prevalent among previously malnourished youth (P < 0.01). Childhood IQ and home environmental circumstances partially mediated the association with malnutrition. Teacher-reported classroom behaviors at earlier ages were significantly correlated with youth conduct problems, confirming the continuity of conduct problems through childhood and adolescence.
   Discussion: Self-reported conduct problems are elevated in children and adolescents with histories of early childhood malnutrition. Later vulnerability to increased conduct problems appears to be mediated by the more proximal neurobehavioral effects of the malnutrition on cognitive function and by adverse conditions in the early home environment.

AB This study analyzes the influence of gender and the role played variables (bully, victim and witness) in the perception of peer bullying. The sample included 2295 Spanish adolescents (54.3% boys and 45.7% girls) aged 12 to 16 years (M = 13.8, SD = 1.4). Data were collected using a questionnaire designed and validated for this study. The results reveal that the aggressors use primarily imbalance of power criteria to define the types of abuse studied. The victims resort to the intention of hurting criteria. Boys interpret diverse forms of bullying as mechanisms of social peer interaction, whereas the girls attributed to these same behaviors the intention to harm and imbalance power.

AB We examined independent and interactive associations linking preadolescents' socially anxious feelings and peer victimization experiences with their social behaviors (rated by parents and teachers) and psychophysiological arousal during lab simulations of salient peer stress situations in preadolescence (peer evaluation and peer rebuff). Sixty-three preadolescents and one parent per preadolescent participated. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), skin conductance level (SCL), and heart rate (HR) were assessed during peer stress situations. Preadolescents provided reports of social anxiety; preadolescents and parents reported on peer victimization; and parents and teachers rated prosocial and aggressive behaviors. Peer victimization moderated associations between social anxiety and both physiological arousal and social-behavior problems. As hypothesized, social anxiety was more strongly associated with lower RSA, higher HR, and higher aggressive behavior among preadolescents who experienced higher levels of peer victimization, compared to preadolescents who experienced lower levels of peer victimization.

AB Familial emotion socialization practices relate to children's emotion regulation (ER) skills in late childhood, however, we have more to learn about how the context and structure of these interactions relates to individual differences in children's ER. The present study examined flexibility and attractors in family emotion socialization patterns in three different conversational contexts and their relation to ER in 8-12 year olds. Flexibility was defined as dispersion across the repertoire of discrete emotion words and emotion socialization functions (emotion coaching, dismissing, and elaboration) in family conversation, whereas attractors were defined as the average duration per visit to each of these three emotion socialization functions using state space grid analysis. It was hypothesized that higher levels of flexibility in emotion socialization would buffer children's ER from the presence of maladaptive attractors, or the absence of adaptive attractors, in family emotion conversation. Flexibility was generally adaptive, related to children's higher ER across all contexts, and also buffered children from maladaptive attractors in select situations. Findings suggest that the study of dynamic interaction patterns in context may reveal adaptive versus maladaptive socialization processes in the family that can inform basic and applied research on children's regulatory problems.

AB Compromised respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, i.e., low cardiac vagal control) frequently characterizes clinically depressed adults and also has been detected in infants of depressed mothers; however, its existence has not been established in older at-risk offspring. We investigated developmental patterns of RSA in a sample of 163 5- to 14-year-old children, who were either at high risk for depression (due to having a parent with a childhood-onset mood disorder) or low-risk for depression. We hypothesized that high-risk children have lower resting RSA than do low-risk children, which could reflect atypical developmental trajectories. Children's RSA was assessed during resting baseline periods on multiple occasions, typically 1-year apart. Linear growth modeling indicated a group by age interaction. Low-risk children (but not the high-risk children) exhibited a significantly increasing trajectory in resting RSA with age. Mood disorders in offspring did not account for the Group X Age interaction effect. Our study provides new evidence that children at high risk for depression have an atypical developmental trajectory of RSA across late childhood. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

AB This study examined adolescents' patterns of beliefs about aggression, and how these patterns relate to aggressive and prosocial behavior, and to risk factors associated with aggression. A sample of 477 sixth graders from two urban schools and a school in a nearby county completed measures of beliefs, behavior, and individual, peer and parental factors associated with aggression. Teacher ratings of participants' behavior and emotion regulation were also obtained. The urban sample was 84% African American; the county school was in a rural fringe area with a student population that was 45% Caucasian and 40% African American. Latent class analysis of items on a beliefs measure supported hypotheses predicting three groups: (a) a Beliefs Against Fighting (BAGF) group that opposed the use of aggression (31% of the sample); (b) a Fighting is Sometimes Necessary (FSNEC) group that endorsed beliefs that fighting is sometimes necessary or inevitable (41%), and (c) a Beliefs Supporting Fighting (BSUPF) group that supported aggression across multiple contexts (28%). Differences across groups were found on race/ethnicity and family structure, but not on gender. Significant differences were also found such that the FSNEC group fell between levels of the BAGF and BSUPF groups on most measures. In contrast, the FSNEC and BAGF groups both differed from the BSUPF group, but not from each other on measures of empathy, perceived effectiveness of nonviolence and aggression, and parental messages supporting nonviolence. These differences suggest the need for tailoring prevention approaches for subgroups of adolescents who differ in their patterns of beliefs.

AB There is a paucity of evidence concerning the patterns of multi-informant agreement in populations with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This study compared ratings of behaviour and emotional problems and social functioning provided by 45 adolescents aged 12-18 years, with Autistic or Asperger's Disorder with ratings by their parents and teachers. Behaviour and emotional problems were measured using the Child Behaviour Checklist and social functioning was measured with the Social Skills Rating System. Moderate agreement was found between adolescent and parent ratings of psychopathology and social functioning. In general, parent and teacher ratings and adolescent and teacher ratings differed significantly. These findings suggest that behaviour varies across environmental contexts. Patterns of agreement between multiple informants observed in the current study frequently differed from those previously found in non-ASD populations. Clinicians and researchers need to consider a multi-informant approach to obtain a detailed picture of behaviour and emotional problems in adolescents with autism and Asperger's Disorder.

AB Examined autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) symptoms in a clinically referred, non-ASD sample (N = 1160: ages 6-18) with and without oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Mothers and teachers completed DSM-IV-referenced symptom checklists. Youth with ODD were subdivided into angry/irritable symptom (AIS) or noncompliant symptom (NS) subtypes. Two different classification strategies were used: within-informant (source-specific) and between-informant (source-exclusive). For the source-specific strategy, youth were classified AIS. NS, or Control (C) according to mothers' and teachers' ratings separately. A second set of analyses focused on youth classified AIS according to mother or teacher report but not both (source-exclusive) versus both mother and teacher (cross-informant) AIS. Results indicated the mother-defined source-specific AIS groups generally evidenced the most severe ASD and SSD symptoms (AIS > NS > C), but this was more pronounced among younger youth. Teacher-defined source-specific ODD groups exhibited comparable levels of symptom severity (AIS, NS > C) with the exception of SSD (AIS > NS > C; younger youth). Source-exclusive AIS groups were clearly differentiated from each other, but there was little evidence of differential symptom severity in cross-informant versus source-exclusive AIS. These findings were largely dependent on the informant used to define the source-exclusive groups. AIS and NS groups differed in their associations with ASD and SSD symptoms. Informant discrepancy provides valuable information that can inform nosological and clinical concerns and has important implications for studies that use different strategies to configure clinical phenotypes.

AB Objectives: We aimed to examine social-contextual correlates of players' developmental experiences in an elite youth soccer context. Specifically, we hypothesized that player perceptions of team cohesion and coach rapport would be positively associated with psychological need fulfillment. In turn, psychological need satisfaction was proposed to be positively related to adaptive developmental experiences in youth soccer (i.e., opportunities for leadership, emotional regulation, and goal setting), and negatively related to social exclusion.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Method: 133 male elite soccer players, aged between 11 and 18 years old, completed a self-report questionnaire assessing the variables of interest.
   Results: Using path analysis and bootstrapping methods, we found support for the overall model fit of the hypothesized conceptual framework and specific study hypotheses.
   Conclusions: This study utilizes strong theoretical foundations to underscore the role of the coach and team environment in facilitating positive youth outcomes, and highlights a potential mechanism that may explain these processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective:To examine the demographic and clinical correlates of nonsuicidal self-injury.
   Method:This is a cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal cohort study of the familial transmission of suicidal behavior, conducted at referral centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York. Participants included 291 probands with DSM-IV mood disorder, one-half of whom had attempted suicide, and 507 of their offspring. The primary outcome assessed was nonsuicidal self-injury in offspring. Psychosocial correlates of nonsuicidal self-injury were determined by comparing personal, parental, and familial characteristics of offspring with and without nonsuicidal self-injury, assessed using a variety of interview and self-report measures at study entry. Data were collected between August 1998 and August 2007.
   Results: Of 507 offspring, 7.7% (n = 39) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury. The most salient correlates of nonsuicidal self-injury on multivariate logistic regression were diagnosis of depression (OR = 3.78, P < .001) and greater aggression (OR = 1.07, P = .01), depressive symptoms (OR = 1.59, P = .009), and suicidal ideation (OR = 1.24, P = .004). Parental history of abuse, as well as family histories of suicide attempt and nonsuicidal self-injury, was noncontributory.
   Conclusions: Nonsuicidal self-injury is associated with the presence and severity of depression, suicidal ideation, and behavioral dysregulation. On multivariate analysis, only individual predictors remained significant; this result is distinct from that for correlates of suicide attempt reported in this sample, for which familial variables played a significant role.

AB Background: Prevention and treatment of youths' mental disorders are important, not just for to diminish their present problems but to improve their functions in adulthood. This study was performed to evaluate the mental health status of 6-18 years old youths in a community-based sample using the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ).
   Methods: Parent of 2000 youths (6-18 years old) were selected from 250 clusters from different municipality areas of Isfahan, Iran and they responded to extended version of SDQ parent's form. The mean score in each subscale and prevalence of symptom and relation with some demographic features were determined.
   Results: The total score of SDQ was 26%, means that 26% of youth had psychiatric problems. By determining the subscale score, it reveals that conduct disorder (34.7%) was the most common problem in youth followed by peer relationship problems (25.4%), emotional problems (24.5%), hyperactivity (23%) and impairment of prosocial behavior (5.7%).
   Conclusion: Our findings showed that mental health of youth population in Isfahan especially the conduct problem needs more attention.

AB Frequent somatic complaints are not only a problem in themselves but also related to other difficulties. So far, no conclusive findings have been reported about the prevalence of and factors underlying these complaints in children and adolescents who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH). Such information would be valuable for prevention and intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of somatic complaints and their relation with emotional functioning in DHH youngsters, as compared with hearing youngsters. This was established by assessing how somatic complaints, mood states, and sense of coherence were experienced by 186 Dutch participants (mean age = 11;07 years). DHH and hearing groups were compared using multivariate analysis of variance and structural equation modeling. The results showed that somatic complaints were reported equally often for both groups, but that the pathways leading to these complaints were partly different. Only in DHH participants were feelings of fear associated with more somatic complaints. The results suggest that DHH children and adolescents would benefit from support in the regulation of fear and its causes. Other aspects affecting adjustment outcomes of DHH youngsters were education type and communication mode.

AB The dual-systems model of a ventral affective system, whose reactivity confers risks and liabilities, and a prefrontal control system, whose regulatory capacities buffer against these vulnerabilities, is an intuitive account that pervades many fields in the cognitive neurosciences - especially in the study of populations that differ from neurotypical adults, such as adolescents or individuals with affective or impulse regulation disorders. However, recent evidence that is inconsistent with dual-systems models illustrates the complexity of developmental and clinical variations in brain function. Building new models to account for this complexity is critical to progress in these fields, and will be facilitated by research that emphasizes network-based approaches and maps relationships between structure and function, as well as brain and behavior, over time.

AB Emotion awareness, the ability to reflect upon the own emotions, is assumed to contribute to better mental health. However, empirical support for this relationship has only been cross-sectional. In this study we examined the extent to which individual differences in changes in emotion awareness over time can explain individual differences in changes in symptoms of internalising problems (depression, fear, worrying and ruminative thoughts). Children and young teenagers (368 boys and 295 girls) were asked four times to fill out self-report questionnaires, with a 6-month time interval between each time. The mean age was 10 years during the first data collection. Longitudinal multilevel analyses showed that the variance in emotion awareness trends was highly predictive for the variance in trends for internalizing problems over time. The ability to differentiate discrete emotions was a strong predictor and negatively contributed to all internalising symptoms. In addition, a diminished tendency to address and value emotions contributed to more depressive symptoms; whereas hiding the own emotions contributed to more worrying and ruminative thoughts. The outcomes show that individual differences in emotion awareness over time make a strong, and, above all, negative contribution to the prediction of the individual differences in various internalizing symptoms. The fact that several aspects of emotional (dys)functioning are uniquely related to different kinds of internalizing problems gives valuable and useful information not only theoretically but also clinically about the distinctive nature of these problems.

TI Development and Preliminary Validation of a Behavioral Task of Negative

AB Background A long line of theoretical and empirical evidence implicates negative reinforcement as a process underlying the etiology and maintenance of risky alcohol use behaviors from adolescence through emerging adulthood. However, the bulk of this literature has relied on self-report measures, and there is a notable absence of behavioral modes of assessments of negative reinforcement-based alcohol-related risk-taking. To address this clear gap in the literature, the current study presents the first published data on the reliability and validity of the Maryland Resource for the Behavioral Utilization of the Reinforcement of Negative Stimuli (MRBURNS), which is a modified version of the positive reinforcement-based Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Methods Participants included a convenience sample of 116 college freshmen ever regular drinkers (aged 18 to 19) who completed both behavioral tasks; self-report measures of negative reinforcement/avoidance constructs and of positive reinforcement/appetitive constructs to examine convergent validity and discriminant validity, respectively; and self-report measures of alcohol use, problems, and motives to examine criterion validity. Results The MRBURNS evidenced sound experimental properties and reliability across task trials. In support of convergent validity, risk-taking on the MRBURNS correlated significantly with negative urgency, difficulties in emotion regulation, and depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. In support of discriminant validity, performance on the MRBURNS was unrelated to risk-taking on the BART, sensation seeking, and trait impulsivity. Finally, pertaining to criterion validity, risk-taking on the MRBURNS was related to alcohol-related problems but not heavy episodic alcohol use. Notably, risk-taking on the MRBURNS was associated with negative reinforcement-based but not with positive reinforcement-based drinking motives. Conclusions Data from this initial investigation suggest the utility of the MRBURNS as a behavioral measure of negative reinforcement-based risk-taking that can provide a useful complement to existing self-report measures to improve our understanding of the relationship between avoidant reinforcement processes and risky alcohol use.

AB Objective: To examine the prevalence/predictors of mental health (MH) problems and services use in 12- to 36-month-old children who had been investigated for maltreatment. Method: Data came from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), a longitudinal study of youth ages 0 to 17.5 years referred to U.S. child welfare agencies. These analyses involved 1117 children 12 to 36 months of age. Sociodemographic, social services, developmental and health data were collected on the children and caregivers. Outcomes were scores over the clinical cutoffs on the Brief Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) Scales for 12- to 18-month-olds and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for 19- to 36-month-olds. Results: In all, 34.6% of 12 to 18 month-olds scored high on the Problem Scale of the BITSEA, and 20.9% on the Competence Scale, whereas 10.0% of 19- to 36-month-olds scored over the CBCL clinical cut-off. Children of black ethnicity were less likely to have elevated scores on the BITSEA Problem Scale, whereas children who lived with a never-married caregiver were five times more likely to have elevated scores. Competence problems were associated with prior child welfare history. Elevated CBCL scores were associated with living with a depressed caregiver. Few children with identified MH problems, 2.2%, received an MH service. When we added parenting skills training that might be related to the treatment of child problems, 19.2% received a service. Conclusions: Identifiable MR problems are common, but few children receive services for those problems. The lack of services received by these young, multi-challenged children is a services systems and social policy failure. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2012;51(6):572-581.

AB Losing a close relationship is highly stressful and a robust predictor of major depression in adolescents. The current study examined relationships between attachment insecurity, parasympathetic nervous system activity, indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and adolescent adjustment to the loss of a close social partner. Adolescents with more attachment anxiety to their mother at age 14 were more likely to report poorer adjustment to a subsequent loss than adolescents with less attachment anxiety. Attachment avoidance interacted with stress-induced changes in RSA to predict loss adjustment. Among adolescents with higher RSA in response to the stressor, those with more attachment avoidance reported better loss adjustment, whereas among adolescents with lower RSA in response to the stressor, those with more attachment avoidance reported poorer loss adjustment. In sum, the combination of attachment insecurity and stress-induced changes in RSA predicted how well adolescents adjusted to a loss.

AB A well-documented finding in developmental psychopathology research is that different informants often provide discrepant ratings of a youth's internalizing and externalizing problems. The current study examines youth- and parent-based moderators (i.e., youth age, gender, and IQ; type of psychopathology; offense category; psychopathic traits; parental education, income, and stress) of informant discrepancies in a sample of young offenders and compares the utility of youth and caregiver reports against relevant clinical outcomes. Results indicate that gender moderated the discrepancy between informant reports of somatic complaints, while parenting stress moderated the discrepancies across reports of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Variables unique to the forensic context (e.g., offense category) were found to moderate cross-informant discrepancies in reports of internalizing and extemalizing psychopathology. Further, youth self-reports of internalizing symptoms predicted a clinician-generated diagnosis of a mood disorder, while caregiver reports of aggressive behaviors predicted the presence of an externalizing diagnosis. Results highlight the importance of assessing informant agreement in the context of forensic assessment and raise questions surrounding the optimal use of informant data in this setting.

AB Background: Ineffective emotion regulation and abnormal amygdala activation have each been found in adolescent-onset major depressive disorder. However, amygdala activation during emotion regulation has not been studied in adolescent-onset major depressive disorder.
   Method: Fourteen unmedicated adolescents diagnosed with current depression without comorbid psychiatric disorders and fourteen well-matched controls ages 13 to 17 years underwent an emotional regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. During this task, participants viewed negatively-valence images and were asked to notice how they were feeling without trying to change it and maintain their emotional reaction ("Maintain") or to interpret the image in such a way as minimize their emotional response ("Reduce").
   Results: Imaging analyses demonstrated that adolescents with depression showed: (1) greater right amygdala activation during the maintain condition relative to controls, (2) less connectivity during the maintain condition between the amygdala and both the insula and medial prefrontal cortex than controls, and (3) a significant positive correlation between amygdala-seeded connectivities during maintenance of emotion and psychosocial functioning.
   Limitations: The current study is a cross-sectional comparison and longitudinal investigations with larger sample sizes are needed to examine the association between amygdala reactivity and emotion regulation over time in adolescent MDD.
   Conclusions: During the maintain condition, adolescents with depression showed a heightened amygdala response and less reciprocal activation in brain regions that may modulate the amygdala. A poorly modulated, overreactive amygdala may contribute to poor emotion regulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective The aim was to investigate the concurrent and longitudinal associations of chronic pain with behavioral and emotional problems in toddlers, as it is not known which comes first in life. Methods The study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a prospective population-based cohort study. Parents of 3,751 toddlers completed questionnaires of their child's health and development. Behavioral and emotional problems were measured at 1.5 and 3 years, chronic pain was measured at 2 and 3 years. Results There were concurrent associations between chronic pain and internalizing problems, e.g. anxiety/depression symptoms. However, chronic pain did not precede the development of new behavioral and emotional problems. Also, behavioral and emotional problems did not precede new-onset chronic pain, except for somatic symptoms, which increased the likelihood of chronic pain. Conclusions Chronic pain was associated with concurrent internalizing problems. Somatic complaints were not only concurrently related to pain but also predicted new-onset pain.

AB Tested hypotheses from social action theory that (a) implicit and explicit measures of agonistic (social control) motives and transcendence (self-control) motives differentially predict cardiovascular risk; and (b) implicit motives interact with everyday self-regulation behaviors to magnify risk.
   Implicit/explicit agonistic/transcendence motives were assessed in a multi-ethnic sample of 64 high school students with the Social Competence Interview (SCI). Everyday self-regulation was assessed with teacher ratings of internalizing, externalizing, and self-control behaviors. Ambulatory blood pressure and daily activities were measured over 48 h.
   Study hypotheses were supported: implicit goals predicted blood pressure levels but explicit self-reported coping goals did not; self-regulation indices did not predict blood pressure directly but interacted with implicit agonistic/transcendence motives to identify individuals at greatest risk (all a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.05).
   Assessment of implicit motives by SCI, and everyday self-regulation by teachers may improve identification of youth at risk for cardiovascular disease.

AB Contemplative science is a transdisciplinary project aimed at understanding the effects of various kinds of mental and physical training (such as mindfulness meditation and tai chi) on the body, brain, and mind at different stages of the lifespan. As such, the goals of contemplative science are to create new knowledge regarding human plasticity and to generate new forms of human services that optimize development. This Special Section introduces readers to new applications of contemplative science in the areas of child development and education. Collectively, the articles explore the prospects for designing age-appropriate forms of secular contemplative trainings that scaffold the development of executive function, emotion regulation, empathy, and compassion in children, adolescents, and the adults who serve them in educational settings alike.

AB This article draws on research in neuroscience, cognitive science, developmental psychology, and education, as well as scholarship from contemplative traditions concerning the cultivation of positive development, to highlight a set of mental skills and socioemotional dispositions that are central to the aims of education in the 21st century. These include self-regulatory skills associated with emotion and attention, self-representations, and prosocial dispositions such as empathy and compassion. It should be possible to strengthen these positive qualities and dispositions through systematic contemplative practices, which induce plastic changes in brain function and structure, supporting prosocial behavior and academic success in young people. These putative beneficial consequences call for focused programmatic research to better characterize which forms and frequencies of practice are most effective for which types of children and adolescents. Results from such research may help refine training programs to maximize their effectiveness at different ages and to document the changes in neural function and structure that might be induced.

AB Seasonal and nonseasonal depression symptoms often emerge during adolescence, although it is unclear if these two issues differ on key adolescent cognitive vulnerability and peer relation variables. This study compared eating attitudes, cognitive coping styles, and peer victimization among adolescents with symptoms of seasonal and nonseasonal depression. A sample of 311 adolescents (mean age = 15.37 years, 57% female) was categorized as experiencing symptoms of seasonal depression ( = 64) and nonseasonal depression ( = 87), as well as controls ( = 160). Self-report measures of seasonality, depression symptoms, eating attitudes, coping styles, and peer victimization were completed. Results suggested that a belief in rigid weight regulation was associated with seasonal depression symptoms. Catastrophizing and rumination were associated with seasonal and nonseasonal depression symptoms, while a lack of planning was associated with nonseasonal depression symptoms. Peer victimization was associated with both seasonal and nonseasonal depression symptoms. Study implications are provided.

AB Background: A critical issue in devising effective interventions for the treatment of childrens behavioral and emotional problems identifying genuine family environmental factors that place children at risk. In most twin and family studies, environmental factors are confounded with both direct genetic risk from parents and the indirect effect of genes influencing parents ability to provide an optimal rearing environment. The present study was undertaken to determine whether parental psychopathology, specifically parental antisocial behavior (ASP), is a genuine environmental risk factor for juvenile conduct disturbance, depression and hyperactivity, or whether the association between parental ASP and childrens behavioral and emotional problems can be explained as a secondary consequence of the intergenerational transmission of genetic factors. Methods: An extended children of twins design comprised of data collected on 2,674 adult female and male twins, their spouses, and 2,454 of their children was used to test whether genetic and/or family environmental factors best accounted for the association between parental antisocial behavior and childrens behavioral problems. An age-matched sample of 2,826 juvenile twin pairs from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development was also included to examine developmental differences in gene expression by partitioning child-specific transmissible effects from those effects that persist into adulthood. The fit of alternative models was evaluated using the statistical program Mx. Results: We found distinct patterns of transmission between parental antisocial behavior and juvenile conduct, depression and hyperactivity. Genetic and family environmental factors accounted for the resemblance between parents ASP and childrens conduct disturbance. Family environmental factors alone explained the association between child depression and parental ASP, and the impact of parental ASP on hyperactivity was entirely genetic. Conclusions: These findings underscore differences in the contribution of genetic and environmental factors on the patterns of association between parental antisocial behavior and juvenile psychopathology, having important clinical implications for the prevention and amelioration of child behavioral and emotional problems.

Functional neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder: structure, function, and connectivity in an amygdalaanterior paralimbic neural system. ?Bipolar Disord 2012: 14: 340355. (c) 2012 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objectives: In past decades, neuroimaging research in bipolar disorder has demonstrated a convergence of findings in an amygdalaanterior paralimbic cortex neural system. This paper reviews behavioral neurology literature that first suggested a central role for this neural system in the disorder and the neuroimaging evidence that supports it. Methods: Relevant articles are reviewed to provide an amygdalaanterior paralimbic cortex neural system model of bipolar disorder, including articles from the fields of behavioral neurology and neuroanatomy, and neuroimaging. Results: The literature is highly supportive of key roles for the amygdala, anterior paralimbic cortices, and connections among these structures in the emotional dysregulation of bipolar disorder. The functions subserved by their more widely distributed connection sites suggest that broader system dysfunction could account for the range of functionsfrom neurovegetative to cognitivedisrupted in the disorder. Abnormalities in some components of this neural system are apparent by adolescence, while others, such as those in rostral prefrontal regions, appear to progress over adolescence and young adulthood, suggesting a neurodevelopmental model of the disorder. However, some findings conflict, which may reflect the small sample sizes of some studies, and clinical heterogeneity and methodological differences across studies. Conclusions: Consistent with models derived from early behavioral neurology studies, neuroimaging studies support a central role for an amygdalaanterior paralimbic neural system in bipolar disorder, and implicate abnormalities in the development of this system in the disorder. This system will be an important focus of future studies on the developmental pathophysiology, detection, treatment, and prevention of the disorder.

AB This article provides an ecological framework for understanding adolescent-initiated parent abuse. We review research on adolescent-initiated parent abuse, identifying sociodemographic characteristics of perpetrators and victims (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [SES]). Bronfenbrenner's [1] ecological systems theory is applied, which examines the risk and protective factors for adolescent-initiated parent abuse within micro- (maltreatment, domestic violence, parenting behavior and disciplinary strategies), meso- (peer influence), exo- (media influence), macro- (gender role socialization), and chronosystem (change in family structure) levels. Findings from our review suggest that older and White children are significantly more likely to abuse their parents. Females are selective in the target of their aggression, while males target family members in general. Mothers are significantly more likely to be abused than fathers. However, researchers also report variations in the association between SES and parent abuse. Domestic violence and child maltreatment are risk factors, while findings on parenting behavior and disciplinary strategies are mixed. Peer influence, exposure to media violence, gender role socialization, and change in family structure can potentially increase the risk of parent abuse. Practice and research implications are also discussed. An ecological systems framework allows for an examination of how various contexts interact and influence parent abuse behavior, and can provide needed directions for further research.

AB There is an increasing evidence that prenatal and early postnatal stressors have life long impacts on physical and mental health problems. Animal studies have shown that this could include enduring changes to brain serotonin neurotransmission. In the present study, we tested whether perinatal adversity in humans has a long-term impact on brain serotonin neurotransmission in adulthood. Twenty-six healthy males, recruited from a 27-year longitudinal study, underwent a positron emission tomography scan with the tracer alpha-[C-11]methyl-L-tryptophan (C-11-AMT), as an index of serotonin synthesis capacity. The trapping constant is taken as a proxy for the regional 5-HT synthesis. Birth complications, especially a delivery where the fetus showed signs of physiological distress, predicted lower C-11-AMT trapping in the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Lower C-11-AMT trapping in the medial orbitofrontal cortex was also predicted by maternal smoking and lower birth weight. There were no effects of childhood or recent adversity. This is the first human study reporting associations between perinatal adversity and adult C-11-AMT trapping in the hippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. The associations suggest that limbic serotonin pathways may be particularly vulnerable to environmental challenges during the period when they undergo the most prominent neurodevelopmental changes. In combination with other risk factors, perinatal stressors may contribute to increased vulnerability for psychiatric disorders in which serotonin plays a major role. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

AB We examined the direct relationships between parent and child emotion regulation (ER) strategy use during the transitionary and understudied developmental periods of middle childhood through to adolescence. Three hundred and seventy-nine participants aged between 9 and 19 years, completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents. In addition, 358 of their mothers and 207 of their fathers completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Providing partial support for the hypothesis, maternal use of the ER Expressive Suppression strategy was significantly predictive of their child's use of Suppression. However, paternal ER strategy use was unrelated to their child's ER strategy use. Child age did not moderate the relationships investigated. These findings suggest that children's ER during middle childhood and adolescence is more closely related to the ER of their mother than their father. It is proposed that this may be accounted for by emotion socialization processes.

AB Background: Many disorders in childhood and adolescence were already present in the preschool years. However, there is little empirical research on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in young children. A true community study using structured diagnostic tools has yet to be published. Methods: All children born in 2003 or 2004 in the city of Trondheim, Norway, who attended the regular community health check-up for 4-year-olds (97.2% of eligible children) whose parents consented to take part in the study (N = 2,475, 82.0%) were screened for behavioral and emotional problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A screen-stratified subsample of 1,250 children took part in a furthermore comprehensive study including a structured diagnostic interview (the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment, PAPA), which 995 parents (79.6%) completed. Results: The estimated population rate for any psychiatric disorder (excluding encopresis 6.4%) was 7.1%. The most common disorders were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1.9%), oppositional defiant disorder (1.8%), conduct disorder (0.7%), anxiety disorders (1.5%), and depressive disorders (2.0%). Comorbidity among disorders was common. More emotional and behavioral disorders were seen in children whose parents did not live together and in those of low socioeconomic status. Boys more often had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depressive disorders than girls. Conclusions: The prevalence of disorders among preschoolers was lower than in previous studies from the USA. Comorbidity was frequent and there was a male preponderance in ADHD and depression at this early age. These results underscore the fact that the most common disorders of childhood can already be diagnosed in preschoolers. However, rates of disorder in Norway may be lower than in the USA.

AB Objective: Children who are prenatally exposed to drugs may be at risk for emotion dysregulation, including childhood anxiety/depression and aggression, potentially increasing their risk for peer victimization. The objectives of this study were to investigate how prenatal drug exposure relates to adolescent peer victimization and the mediating effects of childhood anxiety/depression and aggression. Methods: Seventy-six prenatally drug exposed (PDE) and 38 nonexposed (NE) adolescent-caregiver dyads followed since birth and middle childhood, respectively, participated in an evaluation during adolescence. In middle childhood, caregivers reported on their child's anxiety/depression and aggression, and children reported on violence exposure. In adolescence, caregivers and adolescents responded to a parallel single-item measure of peer victimization. Analyses were conducted using multivariate linear and logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates, including violence exposure. Results: One-third (33.3%, n = 35) of the sample endorsed peer victimization: 40.8% PDE and 17.6% NE, p = .01. In middle childhood, PDE youth had more aggressive behaviors (11.92 vs 7.45, p < .01) and anxiety/depression symptoms (3.43 vs 1.76, p < .01) than NE youth. Anxious/depressed behavior during childhood mediated the association between prenatal drug exposure and adolescent peer victimization. Aggression was not a significant mediator. Conclusions: The consequences of prenatal drug exposure extend into adolescence. Prenatal drug exposure may interfere with emotion regulation, resulting in anxious/depressed behavior during childhood and significantly increasing the risk for peer victimization during adolescence, even in the presence of violence exposure. Strategies to reduce anxious/depressed behavior among children with a history of prenatal drug exposure may reduce adolescent peer victimization.

AB Despite the recognized importance of emotion regulation (ER) for healthy psychological development, ER research has focused predominantly on the developmental periods of infancy, early childhood, and adulthood, while the middle childhood to adolescence years have been relatively neglected. An obstacle to ER research during these periods is the paucity of valid age-appropriate measures. This study reports on the psychometric evaluation of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA), a revision of the adult measure. The ERQ-CA was evaluated with a sample of 827 participants aged between 10 and 18 years. Results indicate sound internal consistency as well as stability over a 12-month period. Sound construct and convergent validity are also demonstrated. It is concluded that the ERQ-CA is a valid age-appropriate measure for investigating the use of 2 specific strategies of ER during the childhood and adolescence developmental periods.

AB From childhood into adolescence, the child's brain undergoes considerable changes in both structure and function. Twin studies are of great value to explore to what extent genetic and environmental factors explain individual differences in brain development and cognition. In The Netherlands, we initiated a longitudinal study in which twins, their siblings and their parents are assessed at three year intervals. The participants were recruited from The Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) and at baseline consisted of 112 families, with 9-year-old twins and an older sibling. Three years later, 89 families returned for follow-up assessment. Data collection included psychometric IQ tests, a comprehensive neuropsychological testing protocol, and parental and self-ratings of behavioral and emotional problems. Physical maturation was measured through assessment of Tanner stages. Hormonal levels (cortisol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, testosterone, and estrogens) were assessed in urine and saliva. Brain scans were acquired using 1.5 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which provided volumetric measures and measures of cortical thickness. Buccal swabs were collected for DNA isolation for future candidate gene and genome-wide analysis studies. This article gives an overview of the study and the main findings. Participants will return for a third assessment when the twins are around 16 years old. Longitudinal twin-sibling studies that map brain development and cognitive function at well-defined ages aid in the understanding of genetic influences on normative brain development.

AB The current study examined the influence of the placement on academic outcomes in youth receiving out-of-home care. A two-level multilevel model was used to partition variance in youth in care's academic success scores into placement and child-specific levels of influence. Associations between caregiver involvement and academic success in youth in care were also examined. Assessment and Action Record (AAR) data from the Ontario Looking after Children (OnLAC) project were analyzed. The sample included data from 687 youth between 10 and 15 years of age (M age = 12.99 years, SD = 1.68), with slightly more boys (n = 389) than girls (n = 298). While individual differences in academic success were primarily attributable to child-specific effects (85%), 15% of the variance can be attributable to differences between placements. Results also suggested that caregivers who provided more academic support at home and a more positive literacy environment were also more likely to care for youth with higher levels of academic success. Surprisingly, caregiver school-based involvement was not significantly associated with academic achievement in youth in care. Lastly, higher levels of caregiver expectations within the placement and youth's own differential experience were both associated with more academic success. These results suggest that academic outcomes of youth in care may be influenced by the placement in which they live. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Describing co-occurring symptom patterns among children in nonwestern contexts may have important implications for how emotional and behavior problems are defined, conceptualized, studied, and ultimately prevented. A latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted on the co-occurring psychiatric symptoms of 196 Chinese children living in poverty. Child depression, anxiety, aggression, and self-esteem scores were used as indicators in the LPA. Three classes of symptoms best described the symptom presentations of children in this study. Ninety-one percent of the youth in the sample were assigned to a class without clinically significant elevations on any symptom index Six percent fell into an externalizing class, and 3% were assigned to a class with elevated internalizing symptoms. The three classes met empirical criteria for distinctiveness and were validated against parent- and child-rated family characteristics and resources. Children in the externalizing class were more likely to experience harsh and neglectful parenting and their parents were more likely to report avoidant coping styles. In addition to some parenting behaviors (overprotection and low parental support), internalizing symptoms were uniquely associated with low levels of education, housing, economic, and social resources. Implications for preventive interventions are discussed.

AB Objectives The aim of the present study was to examine discrepancies between Turkish mothers and adolescents reports in terms of adolescents difficulties in emotion regulation. In addition, the mediating role of mothers own emotion regulation difficulties between mothers psychological symptoms and the discrepancy on reports of adolescents difficulties in emotion regulation was examined. Method A total of 595 first-year high school students (300 females and 295 males) whose ages ranged between 14 and 17 years participated in the study. In addition, 365 mothers (61.34%) completed the questionnaires. Mean age of mothers was 41.86 years (standard deviation = 5.02) ranging from 32 to 61 years. Results The results revealed that adolescents tended to report higher levels of difficulties in emotion regulation for themselves as compared with mothers report, and girls reported more difficulties for their emotion regulation than boys. It was also found that mothers' own emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relation between mothers psychological symptoms and discrepancy on reports of adolescents emotion regulation difficulties. Conclusions Mothers may be less likely to endorse their children's emotion regulation difficulties since they cannot observe various aspects of their children's emotion regulation. On the other hand, the mothers perception of their children's emotion regulation could be affected from their own emotion regulation difficulties, which could be a result of their psychological problems.

AB This study examined associations among several measures of emotion regulation, and their links to depressive symptoms, in a sample of children ages 10-12 years old (N = 87). Both temporal features of emotion regulation and regulation processes involved in the evaluation, monitoring, and modification of emotion were assessed through parent and child report and behavioral observation. Children also completed a self-report measure of depressive symptoms. Children with more depressive symptoms were reported by mothers and rated by observers as having higher levels of negative affect intensity. Regarding emotion regulation processes, children with more depressive symptoms reported more biased interpretations of emotionally charged situations, less awareness of their emotions, and their mothers reported that they utilized less problem-focused coping and positive reframing when coping with upsetting events. Findings suggest that children with depressive symptoms experience a wide range of difficulties with emotion regulation.

AB Introduction: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a relatively short instrument developed to detect psychosocial problems in children aged 3-16 years. It addresses four dimensions: emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention problems, peer problems that count up to the total difficulties score, and a fifth dimension; prosocial behaviour. The validity and reliability of the SDQ has not been fully investigated in younger age groups. Therefore, this study assesses the validity and reliability of the parent and teacher versions of the SDQ in children aged 5-6 years in the total sample, and in subgroups according to child gender and parental education level.
   Methods: The SDQ was administered as part of the Dutch regularly provided preventive health check for children aged 5-6 years. Parents provided information on 4750 children and teachers on 4516 children.
   Results: Factor analyses of the parent and teacher SDQ confirmed that the original five scales were present (parent RMSEA = 0.05; teacher RMSEA = 0.07). Interrater correlations between parents and teachers were small (ICCs of 0.21-0.44) but comparable to what is generally found for psychosocial problem assessments in children. These correlations were larger for males than for females. Cronbach's alphas for the total difficulties score were 0.77 for the parent SDQ and 0.81 for the teacher SDQ. Four of the subscales on the parent SDQ and two of the subscales on the teacher SDQ had an alpha <0.70. Alphas were generally higher for male children and for low parental education level.
   Discussion: The validity and reliability of the total difficulties score of the parent and teacher SDQ are satisfactory in all groups by informant, child gender, and parental education level. Our results support the use of the SDQ in younger age groups. However, some subscales are less reliable and we recommend only to use the total difficulties score for screening purposes.

AB Inter-individual differences in the circadian period of physical and mental functions can be described on the dimension of morningness/eveningness. Previous findings support the assumption that eveningness is related to greater impulsivity and susceptibility to stress than morningness. Heart rate variability (HRV) serves as a physiological correlate of self- and emotional regulation and has not yet been investigated in relation to chronotypes. The study explores differences in HRV and other cardiovascular measures in morning- and evening-types at rest and under stress at different times of day (8-11 a.m. or 4-7 p.m.). Students (N=471) were screened for chronotype and n = 55 females (27 morning- and 28 evening-types) were recruited for testing. These participants performed a mental arithmetic task while heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were recorded. Spectral components and a time-domain measure of HRV were calculated on HR data from resting and mental stress periods. Evening-types had significantly higher HR and systolic BP. but lower HRV than morning-types both at baseline and during stress. Stress induced in the evening had a significantly stronger impact on absolute and baseline corrected physiological measures in both chronotypes. The interaction of chronotype and testing time did not reach the level of significance for any of the dependent variables. The enhanced physiological arousal in evening-types might contribute to increased vulnerability to psychological distress. Hence, previous behavioral findings are supported by the physiological data of this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is debate among researchers regarding the most appropriate conceptual model of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Some argue that NSSI is best viewed within an addictions framework. Because craving of substances is a key concept in the addictions literature, we sought to compare the nature of craving in NSSI and substance use. Measures of NSSI, substance use, and craving were administered to a sample of adolescents (n = 58) receiving psychiatric treatment. It was found that total craving scores were significantly lower for NSSI than for substances. Item-level analyses suggested that substances are craved in a variety of contexts, whereas NSSI is typically craved in the context of negative emotions. The pattern of results remained the same when analyses were limited to patients who engaged in both NSSI and substance use. Thus, findings appear to be due to differences in the nature of the behaviors themselves rather than to individual differences between those who engage in NSSI or use substances. We conclude that, while both behaviors have powerful reinforcement contingencies, NSSI appears to be almost exclusively maintained by negative reinforcement (e.g., the reduction of aversive emotions). Findings are more consistent with emotion regulation than addiction models of NSSI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HONOSCA; ROUTINE; ALPHA
AB The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) have been implemented as performance and research measures for youth mental health services in the UK and elsewhere. However, the factor structure of this instrument has not yet been reported. Clinician ratings from a representative sample of 1335 young people seen by community-based Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services were randomised into exploratory and confirmatory datasets. Parallel analysis followed by an exploratory factor analysis was performed on the former ratings. The potential structures elicited were tested using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). The resulting structures were evaluated in the confirmatory dataset. On CFA a five-factor model with one cross-loading item provided the best fit to the data. However, the internal reliability consistency of some of the postulated subscales was poor. We conclude that the HoNOSCA is a multidimensional measure with a three-factor structure possibly providing the optimum compromise between fit and internal reliability. Thus, it may be most appropriate to summarise clinical outcomes using two symptom subscores, relating to behavioural and emotional problems, rather than using the total scores, as is current practice. Such subscales may be more sensitive to change than total summed scores. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Adolescence is a critical developmental period regarding exposure to substances. Therefore, it is important to be able to identify those adolescents who are most vulnerable to substance abuse in the (near) future. The JOiN study was specifically designed to examine two endophenotypes of adolescent substance use in a normal risk (NR) and high risk (HR) sample of adolescents: (1) behavioural disinhibition, and (2) individual differences in stress sensitivity.
   Methods: The NR adolescents were part of a longitudinal general population study at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands of children and adolescents initially aged 6 to 18 years old. Three assessment waves have been nearly completed, and data are available of N = 711 participants for stress sensitivity measures, and of a subsample of N = 110 for electroencephalography (EEG) measures. Added to this study, HR adolescents who had at least one parent with a substance use disorder and who were treated by an outpatient clinic of a primary addiction care provider were approached via their parent(s). In total, N = 83 adolescents formed this HR sample. NR and HR adolescents participated in standardized stress procedure and EEG procedures in our laboratory. Questionnaires were filled out on background variables, behavioural and emotional problems, and substance use, and a diagnostic interview was conducted with adolescents and parents to assess psychopathology symptoms. DNA was collected through saliva or blood samples.
   Discussion: The design of the JOiN study is optimal for examining the predictive role of endophenotypes of adolescent substance use. The combination of different methods, i.e. stress physiology, electrophysiology, genetics, and questionnaire data from several informants on a range of behaviours and environmental factors enables the investigation of the multifactorial nature of adolescent substance use.

AB To enhance the positive adjustment of youths with high incidence disabilities, a better understanding of the factors that influence their use of effective responses in challenging situations is needed. In this qualitative study, adolescents described individual and peer factors that would influence their use of effective nonviolent or aggressive responses. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 74 adolescents (61% boys) with high incidence disabilities (71% with a learning disability, 15% with an intellectual disability, and 14% with an emotional or behavioral disorder). Individual themes included values and beliefs, emotion regulation and problem-solving, positive self-image and confidence, perceived effectiveness of responses and potential consequences, and attributions about others or the situation. Peer factors included peer support, peer models for nonviolent responses, peer victimization, and protecting image, status, and reputation with peers. Identification of these themes has important implications for youth violence prevention efforts.

AB Introduction. South African children and adolescents face serious challenges. Over the past decades children have been exposed to rapid and stressful changes in their environment, including increased crime and violence.
   Aim of study The aim of the study was to determine the profile of stress factors leading to mental disorders in children and adolescents referred to the Child and Adolescent Unit at the Free State Psychiatric Complex, Bloemfontein, from January 2006 to December 2007.
   Methods. A total of 669 children (0- 12 years) and adolescents (13 - 18 years) referred to the unit for evaluation and treatment were included in the study.
   Results. Thirty per cent were diagnosed with attention deficit and disruptive behaviour disorders, followed by major depressive disorders (22.7%), anxiety disorders (18.5%), conduct disorders (16.1%), mild mental retardation (15.7%), adjustment disorders (9.6%), elimination disorders (8.8%), developmental disorders (7.6%) and bereavement (7.0%). Social stressors were identified in 64.1% of participants, and psychological stressors in 19%.
   Conclusions. Stress plays an important role in the lives of children and adolescents, which could lead to emotional problems if not well managed. The functioning of children and adolescents should be monitored continuously. Schools are in a favourable position to identify stressors affecting children and adolescents. Educators therefore need training and opportunities to consult on mental health matters. Furthermore, religious organisations should be enlisted to identify stressors manifesting as spiritual dysfunction. School health services can play a role in the recognition of biological stressors such as epilepsy, pregnancy, enuresis, illness, speech problems and sensory dysfunction.

AB Although gender and mothering are critical factors in the development of infants exposed to intimate-partner violence (IPV), the majority of research has focused on school-age and adolescent populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between motherinfant interaction and infant development in families of IPV. Maternal report was used to measure infants' cognitive and social functioning while motherinfant interaction quality was assessed through an observational measure. Participants consisted of 44 mothers and their infants (443 months of age). While male infants showed poorer fine motor, problem-solving, and personal-social skills than did their female counterparts, comparable gross motor and communication skills were demonstrated. Moderator analysis for gender indicated that the association among maternal cognitive growth fostering and gross motor skills was significantly stronger for boys than it was for girls. No other moderator effects were detected. Analysis examining age, gender by age, and infant competencies did not reveal significant effects. Implications for clinical practice are considered, with special attention paid to women as mothers.

AB Perceived racial discrimination, self-control, anger, and either substance use or use cognitions were assessed in 2 studies conducted with samples of African American adolescents. The primary goal was to examine the relation between discrimination and self-control over time; a 2nd goal was to determine whether that relation mediates the link between discrimination and substance use found in previous research. Study 1, which included a latent growth curve analysis with 3 waves of data, indicated that experience with discrimination (from age 10 years to age 18 years) was associated with reduced self-control, which then predicted increased substance use. Additional analyses indicated anger was also a mediator of this discrimination to use relation. Study 2, which was experimental, showed that envisioning an experience involving discrimination was associated with an increase in substance-related responses to double entendre words (e.g., pot, roach) in a word association task, especially for participants who were low in dispositional self-control. The effect was again mediated by reports of anger. Thus, the "double mediation" pattern was discrimination -> more anger and reduced self-control -> increased substance use and/or substance cognitions. Results are discussed in terms of the long-term impact of discrimination on self-control and health behavior. Implications for interventions aimed at ameliorating the negative effects of discrimination and low self-control on health are also discussed.

AB A significant literature suggests that youth diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for later depression relative to youth without ADHD. Youth with co-occurring ADHD and depression experience more serious impairments and worse developmental outcomes than those with either disorder alone, including increased rates of suicidal ideation and suicide completion. Despite these very serious outcomes, few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying the relationship between ADHD and depression in youth. The present study examined emotion regulation (ER) as a mediator of the relationship between ADHD and depressive symptoms in 69 youth between the ages of 10 and 14, with (n = 37) and without (n = 32) ADHD. Parent and youth ratings of depressive symptoms and ER were collected. Youth with ADHD reported significantly more depressive symptoms and poorer ER ability relative to youth without ADHD. ER fully mediated the relationship between ADHD and depressive symptoms. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed.

AB This study examined the significance of childhood Big Five personality traits for competence and resilience in early adulthood. Resilience was defined in terms of adaptive success in age-salient developmental tasks despite significant adversity throughout childhood/adolescence. The Project Competence Longitudinal Study tracked 205 young people from childhood (around age 10) to emerging adulthood (EA, age 20) and young adulthood (YA, age 30; 90% retention). Multimethod composites were created for personality traits, adversity exposure, and adult outcomes of academic achievement, work, rule-abiding conduct, friendship, and romantic relationships. Regressions showed significant main effects of childhood personality predicting adult outcomes, controlling for adversity, with few interaction effects. In person-focused analyses, the resilient group in EA and YA (high competence, high adversity) showed higher childhood conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness and lower neuroticism than the maladaptive group (low competence, high adversity). The competent (high competence, low adversity) and resilient groups showed similar childhood traits. Turnaround cases, who changed from the maladaptive group in EA to the resilient group in YA, exhibited higher childhood conscientiousness than persistently maladaptive peers. Findings suggest that children on pathways to success in adulthood, whether facing low or high adversity, have capacities for emotion regulation, empathy and connection, dedication to schoolwork, and mastery and exploration.

AB The goal of this study was to examine how different types of social experiences in kindergarten relate to Grade 1 academic achievement, while controlling for possible genetic and shared environmental influences through the use of the monozygotic (MZ) twin difference method. Social experiences in kindergarten included relationship quality with the larger peer group (i.e., rejection and victimization), relationship quality with one's best friend, and relationship quality with the teacher. Control variables included parental hostility coercion, child cognitive skills and externalizing problems, and equivalent social experiences in Grade 1. Participants consisted of 223 MZ twin pairs ages 6 years at Time 1 (T1) and 7 years at Time 2 (T2). Results showed that within-pair differences in peer rejection and in poor teacher child relationship quality at T1 uniquely predicted differences in MZ twins' academic achievement at T2. Mechanisms that could account for the possible causal role of these social experiences in regard to children's school achievement are discussed.

AB Aim: To examine the rate of Internet victimization in a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 1417 and to analyze predictors and protective factors for victimization.
   Methods: Data were collected for 3707 pupils in Danish schools in 2008, using a multimedia computer-based self-interviewing programme. Family characteristics, alcohol and drug abuse, exposure to physical / sexual abuse, emotional problems, social conduct and own risky Internet behaviour were included in the analyses.
   Results: Any online victimization was reported by 27% of the adolescents, most frequently a rumour spread online (9% of boys and 15% of girls) and sexual solicitation (5% of boys and 16% of girls). Parental surveillance of adolescents' Internet use significantly reduced their risk of online victimization. Roughly half of the adolescents had met Internet acquaintances face to face, with few instances resulting in forced sex (five boys and nine girls). Female gender, parental physical violence, previous exposure to sexual abuse, alcohol abuse in the family, self-reported emotional problems and antisocial behaviour and high Internet use were all weakly and risky online behaviour strongly associated with online victimization.
   Conclusions: Danish adolescents are generally aware of the principles of ` safe chatting'; however, online harassment is relatively frequent, but offline victimization based on Internet acquaintances is rare.

AB Harvey and Evans (2003) have proposed that teachers' emotional skills, as required in the classroom, can be organized into a five-dimensional model. Further research is necessary to validate this model and evaluate the importance of each dimension of teacher emotion competence for educational practice. Using a statistical method for mapping psychological constructs, teachers' emotional practices were transformed into a 'map' with three spatial dimensions, which was supported by comparative validity checks. The nature of emotional practice was further investigated by administering a Q-Sort of emotional practice items to 100 teachers. Ten highly applicable clusters of emotional behavior across six profile patterns with teachers were identified. Authors' model and the applicability of emotions were generally supported.

AB Introduction: This study sought to identify factors associated with health service utilisation by individuals with mental disorders in a Canadian catchment area.
   Methods: To be included in the study, participants had to be aged between 15 and 65 and reside in the study location. Data was collected randomly from June to December 2009 by specially trained interviewers. A comprehensive set of variables (including geospatial factors) was studied using the Andersen's behavioural health service model. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were carried out.
   Results: Among 406 individuals diagnosed with mental disorders, 212 reported using a mental health service at least once in the 12 months preceding the interviews. Emotional problems and a history of violence victimisation were most strongly associated with such utilisation. Participants who were middle-aged or deemed their mental health to be poor were also more likely to seek mental healthcare. Individuals living in neighbourhoods where rental accommodations were the norm used significantly fewer health services than individuals residing in neighbourhoods where homeownership was preponderant; males were also less likely to use services than females.
   Conclusions: Our study broke new ground by uncovering the impact of longstanding violence victimisation, and the proportion of homeownership on mental health service utilisation among this population. It also confirmed the prominence of some variables (gender, age, emotional problems and self-perceived mental health) as key enabling variables of health-seeking. There should be better promotion of strategies designed to change the attitudes of males and youths and to deal with violence victimisation. There is also a need for initiatives that are targeted to neighbourhoods where there is more rental housing.

AB Adolescence is a time of dramatic physical, cognitive, emotional, and social changes as well as a time for the development of many social-emotional problems. These characteristics raise compelling questions about accompanying neural changes that are unique to this period of development. Here, we propose that studying adolescent-specific changes in face processing and its underlying neural circuitry provides an ideal model for addressing these questions. We also use this model to formulate new hypotheses. Specifically, pubertal hormones are likely to increase motivation to master new peer-oriented developmental tasks, which will in turn, instigate the emergence of new social/affective components of face processing. We also predict that pubertal hormones have a fundamental impact on the reorganization of neural circuitry supporting face processing and propose, in particular, that, the functional connectivity, or temporal synchrony, between regions of the face-processing network will change with the emergence of these new components of face processing in adolescence. Finally, we show how this approach will help reveal why adolescence may be a period of vulnerability in brain development and suggest how it could lead to prevention and intervention strategies that facilitate more adaptive functional interactions between regions within the broader social information processing network.

AB While major depressive disorder has been shown to be a significant mental health issue for school-age children, recent research indicates that depression can be observed in children as early as the preschool period. Yet, little work has been done to explore the neurobiological factors associated with this early form of depression. Given research suggesting a relation between adult depression and anomalies in emotion-related neural circuitry, the goal of the current study was to elucidate changes in functional activation during negative mood induction and emotion regulation in school-age children with a history of preschool-onset depression. The results suggest that a history of depression during the preschool period is associated with decreased activity in prefrontal cortex during mood induction and regulation. Moreover, the severity of current depressed mood was associated with increased activity in limbic regions, such as the amygdala, particularly in children with a history of depression. Similar to results observed in adult depression, the current findings indicate disruptions in emotion-related neural circuitry associated with preschool-onset depression. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between parental behavior of both parents, and emotional regulation and internalizing and externalizing problems of young adolescents. Specifically, the mediating role of emotional regulation in relation between parental behavior and adjustment of young adolescents, were tested. The study was conducted on a sample of 261 subjects (139 girls and 122 boys), average age of 13 years. Using path analysis, direct and indirect effects (via emotional regulation) of parental behavior on internalizing and externalizing problems were examined. The results indicate that emotional regulation fully mediated the associations between internalizing problems and children's perceptions of maternal acceptance, paternal rejection and control. Furthermore, emotional regulation partially mediated the relationship between internalizing problems and paternal acceptance. Children's perceptions of maternal control and paternal acceptance had direct effects on internalizing problems, and externalizing problems were directly related to perception of maternal control and acceptance, as well as paternal acceptance.

AB Taxonomies of socially unacceptable behavior differentiate youth with late- and early-onset. Youth with early onset are considered riskier. Research showed that parents behavior is more important for onset, and peers for continuation of risk behavior in the early-onset group. Peers are more important for the late-onset group. The present research investigated differences in the intensity of socially unacceptable behavior and risk factors among early-onset and late-onset adolescents, and in the intensity of different risk factors (e.g. siblings riskiness, behavioral and emotional problems, parental behavior and peer factors). Participants were 661 male adolescents from Osijek and Zagreb. They were in three groups: group with low level of socially unacceptable behavior (N = 227), group with late-onset (N = 231), and group with early-onset (N = 203). Results suggest that groups with early- and late-onset differ in the intensity of their socially unacceptable behavior. Three groups differ in characteristics of their peer group (early-starters have the riskiest peers and are most influenced by peers), but they don't differ in the intensity of other risk factors.

AB In order to more fully understand the abnormalities in emotional responding associated with adolescent depression we examined clinically depressed and non-depressed adolescents' physiological responses to their parents' negative emotional behavior, as indexed by their heart rate responses to parental angry and dysphoric behavior during laboratory-based interactions. Maternal angry and dysphoric behavior predicted heart rate deceleration amongst non-depressed adolescents, a response that was not observed in depressed adolescents. Fathers' angry behavior predicted significant heart rate acceleration in depressed (but not non-depressed) adolescents, whereas fathers' dysphoric behavior predicted heart rate deceleration amongst depressed but not amongst non-depressed adolescents. These findings are interpreted within the framework of orienting and defense cardiac responses, and suggest that reactivity in adolescent depression is characterized by the absence of a normative orienting response toward aversive maternal behaviors, and a defensive physiological response to aggressive paternal behavior.

AB This study examined effects of the autonomy-connectedness components sensitivity to others, self-awareness and capacity for managing new situations on anger experience versus anger expression in adolescent boys and girls. One hundred thirty-one high school students were randomly assigned to an anger-inducing or neutral condition using the Dictator Game. Whereas after anger induction boys experienced and expressed anger independent of autonomy-connectedness, girls' anger experience depended on the level of sensitivity to others: girls experienced increased anger only when they scored high on sensitivity to others. However, girls' expression of anger did not depend on the level of sensitivity to others. Effects of self-awareness and capacity for managing new situations were found when anger was not induced. This study contributed to emotion regulation research by showing differences in anger experience and anger expression as a function of autonomy-connectedness in boys and girls.

AB Childhood exposure to victimization is prevalent and has been shown to contribute to significant immediate and long-term psychological distress and functional impairment. Children exposed to interpersonal victimization often meet criteria for psychiatric disorders other than posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, this article summarizes research that suggests directions for broadening current diagnostic conceptualizations for victimized children, focusing on findings regarding victimization, the prevalence of a variety of psychiatric symptoms related to affect and behavior dysregulation, disturbances of consciousness and cognition, alterations in attribution and schema, and interpersonal impairment. A wide range of symptoms is common in victimized children. As a result, in the current psychiatric nosology, multiple comorbid diagnoses are necessarybut not necessarily accurateto describe many victimized children, potentially leading to both undertreatment and overtreatment. Related findings regarding biological correlates of childhood victimization and the treatment outcome literature are also reviewed. Recommendations for future research aimed at enhancing diagnosis and treatment of victimized children are provided.

AB The role of rejection sensitivity as a critical diathesis moderating the link between adolescent relational stressors and depressive symptoms was examined using multi-method, multi-reporter data from a diverse community sample of 173 adolescents, followed from age 16 to 18. Relational stressors examined included emotional abuse, maternal behavior undermining adolescents' autonomy and relatedness, and lack of support from close peers. As hypothesized, multiple relational stressors were found to predict the future development of depressive symptoms, but as hypothesized predictions existed primarily for adolescents who were highly rejection sensitive. Results are discussed in terms of a diathesis-stress model of depression and suggest that though relational stressors have previously shown consistent modest links to depressive symptoms, understanding pre-existing intrapsychic vulnerabilities of the adolescent may be critical to identifying the processes by which such stressors lead to depressive symptoms.

AB Prior research has provided substantial evidence that child maltreatment and exposure to physical intimate partner violence (IPV) are associated with increased externalizing behavior problems among children and adolescents. However, little is known about the effects of exposure to psychological IPV and exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling. Using a total sample (N = 2,572) and subsample (n = 441) of children ages 3-18 years old, the purpose of this study was to assess whether cumulative types of family violence lead to higher mean externalizing behavior scores and to examine the effects of single types of indirect and direct family violence on children's mean externalizing behavior scores. Results confirmed that children who experienced any type of family violence victimization had higher mean externalizing behavior scores compared to children with no history of family violence; however, few differences in externalizing behavior scores were found as the number of family violence types increased. Children who experienced indirect types of family violence (e.g., exposure to the physical abuse of a sibling) had higher externalizing behavior scores than children who experienced direct maltreatment (e.g., child physical abuse). Findings from this study suggest that researchers and service providers should adopt a broader conceptualization of family violence victimization and increase the amount of services provided to children who are indirectly victimized.

AB The association between self-regulation and various adaptive outcomes has become a topic of growing interest to researchers. Yet, there is not much research on predictors of self-regulation in children. Using a cross-sectional design and an array of psychometrically sound scales and measures from multiple informants, this study examined whether maternal characteristics, namely maternal mental health, substance abuse, parenting practices, and child monitoring predicted self-regulation in children. Participants included a culturally diverse group of 155 youths (ages 8-17) and their mothers, all of whom were part of a larger investigation of low-income families in a mid-sized Northeastern city in the United States. Results showed that maternal substance abuse, parenting practices and parental monitoring independently predicted children's self-regulation, accounting for 23% of the variance. Additional analyses indicated that parenting practices may partly mediate the effect of maternal mental health on children's self-regulation. Implications for intervention and practice, especially those aimed to mitigate the detrimental effects of maternal mental health problems on children's self-regulation, are discussed. Further research, both longitudinal and experimental, is warranted in order to extend this line of investigation.

AB Aims: This study examines whether individual differences in impulsivity and emotional problems in adolescent smokers are related to initial smoking characteristics of participants, acceptance, retention and outcome of a school-based smoking cessation program.
   Design: The data was obtained from a feasibility study of a youth-specific, cognitive-behavioral and motivation enhancing program at 22 schools with 139 participating teenage smokers in Germany. A one-group-pre-posttest design was realized.
   Measurement: Impulsivity levels were assessed by use of the impulsivity scale of the IVE ("Inventar zur Erfassung von Impulsivitat, Risikoverhalten und Empathie", Stadler, Janke, & Schmeck, 2004). To evaluate the extent of emotional problems, the corresponding 5-items scale of the SDQ-Deu ("Strength and difficulties questionnaire", 'Klasen et al., 2000) was applied. Smoking behavior and acceptance of the program were assessed by students' self-reports.
   Findings: Acceptance and retention did not differ with regard to impulsivity and emotional problems, but initial smoking status did. Cessation rates varied with level of impulsivity: compared to non-impulsive participants, impulsive adolescents succeeded in quitting smoking less often. Emotional problems were not related to the rate of quitting.
   Conclusions: Impulsive adolescents were similarly compliant to the offered cessation intervention as less impulsive smokers. In spite of their general positive evaluation, impulsive adolescents seem to benefit less from a smoking cessation program than their non-impulsive counterparts. Specific elements supporting impulsive teenage smokers in their goal to quit should be incorporated into youth-specific cessation programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the protective nature of youth reports of family interactions in relation to perceived exposure to violence and anger regulation in 84 children and early adolescents (mean age of 10.5; 7 15 years old) primarily from ethnic minority groups and living in high-risk communities in a large southwestern city. Path analysis and bootstrapping methodology indicated that overall family system variables were primarily associated with anger regulation and exposure to violence through parenting behaviors. Specifically, perceptions of family cohesion and adaptability were indirectly associated with anger regulation through a positive association with parental support. Family cohesion and adaptability were indirectly associated with anger regulation and exposure to violence through parental supervision in different ways. Family cohesion was positively associated with parental supervision, whereas family adaptability was negatively associated with parental supervision. Implications are discussed for intervention and prevention programs aimed at youth residing in areas with economic disadvantage.

AB For this special issue about child and adolescent depression, the authors were asked to describe contextual emotion regulation therapy as an example of a developmentally informed psychosocial intervention. The article begins with the authors' definition of the elements that should comprise such an intervention. A succinct summary of this contextual emotion regulation therapy is then provided, including its explanatory paradigm of depression, followed by an exposition of how it addresses the various definitional criteria of a developmentally informed intervention. The article concludes with a brief overview of the challenges of implementing a developmentally sensitive psychotherapy for depressed children and adolescents.

AB Emotional inertia refers to the degree to which a person's current emotional state is predicted by their prior emotional state, reflecting how much it carries over from one moment to the next. Recently, in a cross-sectional study, we showed that high inertia is an important characteristic of the emotion dynamics observed in psychological maladjustment such as depression. In the present study, we examined whether emotional inertia prospectively predicts the onset of first-episode depression during adolescence. Emotional inertia was assessed in a sample of early adolescents (N = 165) based on second-to-second behavioral coding of videotaped naturalistic interactions with a parent. Greater inertia of both negative and positive emotional behaviors predicted the emergence of clinical depression 2.5 years later. The implications of these findings for the understanding of the etiology and early detection of depression are discussed.

AB Objective: We examined whether severity scores (1 SD vs 2 SDs) of a unique profile of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) consisting of the Anxiety/Depression, Aggression, and Attention (AAA) scales would help differentiate levels of deficits in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Study Design: Subjects were 197 children with ADHD and 224 without ADHD. We defined deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) as an aggregate cutoff score of > 180 but < 210 (1 SD) on the AAA scales of the CBCL (CBCL-DESR) and Severe Dysregulation as an aggregate cutoff score of >= 210 on the same scales (CBCL-Severe Dysregulation). All subjects were assessed with structured diagnostic interviews and a range of functional measures. Results: Thirty-six percent of children with ADHD had a positive CBCL-DESR profile versus 2% of controls (p < .001) and 19% had a positive CBCL-Severe Dysregulation profile versus 0% of controls (p < .001). The subjects positive for the CBCL-Severe Dysregulation profile differed selectively from those with the CBCL-DESR profile in having higher rates of unipolar and bipolar mood disorders, oppositional defiant and conduct disorders, psychiatric hospitalization at both baseline and follow-up assessments, and a higher rate of the CBCL-Severe Dysregulation in siblings. In contrast, the CBCL-DESR was associated with higher rates of comorbid disruptive behavior, anxiety disorders, and impaired interpersonal functioning compared with other ADHD children. Conclusion: Severity scores of the AAA CBCL profiles can help distinguish 2 groups of emotional regulation problems in children with ADHD. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 33: 236-243, 2012)

AB Emotion Regulation (ER) is a fundamental aspect of healthy psychological functioning. A sample of 682 children and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years, participated in this study, which examined the roles of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality and parental attachment in the use of the ER strategies of Reappraisal and Suppression. Higher scores on Extraversion and Openness predicted more Reappraisal use, while higher scores on all FFM variables predicted less Suppression use, with the exception of Neuroticism which was positively related to Suppression use. Regarding attachment, higher Communication predicted more Reappraisal and less Suppression use while higher Alienation predicted less Reappraisal and more Suppression use. The current findings contribute to our understanding of factors underlying the use of specific ER strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective!: Obesity and overweight have shown an increasing trend in most developing countries. Childhood obesity would impose numerous health-related problems. This study was conducted to determine the correlation of obesity and overweight with emotional-behavioral problems in primary school age girls.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 300 primary school girls (aged 7-11 years) were selected using a multi-staged sampling method, including randomized cluster and stratified method. For all students body mass index was measured and then based on BMI for age and sex, from each grade (1-5), 20 students were selected for each group of normal weight, overweight and obese. The emotional-behavioral problems were evaluated using child behavior checklist that consists of 113 items for childhood behavioral problems.
   Findings: Total behavioral problems were seen in 17%, 27%, and 2% in obese, overweight, and normal weight children, respectively. Internalizing problems (including Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, and Somatic Complaints) were seen in 11%, 15%, and 2% and externalizing problems (including Aggressive and Delinquent Behaviors) were observed in 8%, 17%, and 2% in obese, overweight, and normal weight children, respectively. The mean scores in all scales were higher in obese and overweight children in comparison with normal weight children and the emotional-behavioral problems had significant positive correlation with obesity and overweight (P<0.01).
   Conclusion: Despite the cultural differences between east and west, yet there are similarities in the most of the emotional-behavioral problems related to overweight and obesity. Also, it seems that the risk of behavioral-emotional problems in overweight girls is more than in obese girls. Overweight and Obesity prevention may be a primary preventive step for these problems in children.

AB Background and Aim: In Germany the risk for relative poverty has increased profoundly during the last 15 years, especially among single parent families. As poverty is often associated with bad health we examined the physical and mental health as well as health-related behaviour, housing and environmental conditions in children with lone mothers versus children in couple families.
   Study Population and Methods: In 3 cross-sectional surveys conducted during 2004-2007 in 3 cities and 3 rural areas in Bavaria data on 19039 pre-school children (47% female) were collected. Health, behaviour and exposure assessment was based on parental reports. The 18327 cases with complete information on family status were analysed. 10% of the children grew up with single mothers.
   Results: Single mothers evaluated the general state of health of their children more often as moderate to very poor than couple parents (OR [95% CI]: male: 1.37 [1.07-1.77], female 1.77 [1.33-2.35]). Sons with single mothers were more often obese (1.44 [1.09-1.90]). They scored significantly higher in the SDQ total difficulties score (1.94 [1.44-2.62]), on the emotional problem scale (1.91 [1.40-2.59]) as well as on the hyperactivity scale (1.82 [1.35-2.47]) compared to boys from couple families. No difference was found in prosocial behaviour. Girls with single mothers revealed more often conduct problems 1.36 [1.02-1.81] compared to those from couple families. They also showed a significantly higher prevalence of asthma (2.06 [1.29-3.30]). Children living with their single mothers were less often members of sports clubs and the boys were less physical active. No difference was found regarding the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Single mother family was associated with children's environmental tobacco smoke exposure at home (2.03 [1.79-2.29]). Single mothers perceived higher environmental exposures to noise and air pollution, suffered more often from a lack of accessible green spaces in the neighbourhood and reported a higher traffic load on the residential street.
   Conclusion: Children with single mothers reveal increased health risks and live under significantly poorer housing and environmental conditions. Further analyses are necessary to identify the mediating factors.

AB Children who engage in physical risk taking experience more injuries. In the present study children 7-12 years completed laboratory tasks and standardized questionnaires to explore inter-relations between measures of risk taking and to determine if the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a valid index of physical risk taking. Emotion regulation skills also were assessed to determine if poorer skills are associated with greater risk taking, and what measures of risk taking show these relations. Results revealed that general measures of risk taking propensity predicted both BART performance and physical risk taking. Similarly, poorer emotion regulation skills were associated with greater risk taking scores for both the BART and physical risk taking task. Measures of physical risk taking related to one another, however, none of these scores related to performance on the BART. Implications for measuring physical risk taking and exploring emotional links to risk taking in future research are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parental input has been described as influential in early childhood stuttering yet the exact nature of this influence remains equivocal. The present study aimed to examine whether quantitative measures of parenting styles, parent and peer attachment patterns, and parent- and self-reported child behaviour could differentiate between school-aged children who stutter (CWS) (n = 10) and their fluent peers (n = 10). In addition, qualitative individual semi-structured interviews with all CWS were conducted to gain insight into their life experiences and reflections in relation to stuttering. The interviews were classified into ancillary themes of school, peers and parents. Quantitative findings revealed that CWS perceived their parents with significantly lower attachment, particularly in relation to trust, and parents of CWS perceived their children with significantly higher maladjustments than fluent counterparts. Qualitative themes emerged pertaining to attitudes, perceptions and relationships with teachers, peers and parents, with consistent experiences of teasing and bullying reported as a consequence of the stutter. The majority of participants recounted frustration with the nature in which their parents attempted to remediate their stuttering. Collectively, these findings highlight imperative management considerations for school-aged CWS and their parents. The usefulness of quantitative and qualitative research paradigms is also emphasised.
   Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to: (1) identify themes associated with the impact a childhood stutter has on parent and peer relationships; (2) identify how the quality of the parent child relationship is influenced by parenting styles and attachment; and (3) discuss the clinical implications of the results for children who stutter and their families.

AB How do people learn to trust or distrust others? In a repeated trust game setting, we investigated the development of trust within repeated interactions. We assessed the development of relation-specific trust across different age groups, ranging from late childhood to young adulthood. The results demonstrated that within relations the older participants showed lower levels of negative reciprocity. Additionally, with increasing age both the anger towards, and punishment of, noncooperative players decreased. Further analyses showed that the differential willingness to punish violations of trust was mediated by feelings of anger. Overall, the data provide initial evidence for the role of emotion regulation in the development of interpersonal trust.

AB This study examined the psychometric properties of a Chinese adaptation of the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS; Simons & Gaher. Motivation and Emotion, 29, 83-102, 2005) among 5,423 (2,857 boys) Chinese adolescents. Results of the confirmatory factor analyses supported a hierarchical model encompassing four first-order factors: Tolerance, Absorption, Appraisal and Regulation, and one second-order factor, General Distress Intolerance, which was comprised of the first three first-order factors. Acceptable levels of internal consistency and 6-month test-retest reliability were demonstrated in the second-order and all first-order factors. The Chinese DTS also displayed good convergent and discriminant validity with negative emotion, emotion reactivity and maladaptive impulsive coping behaviors. Chinese adolescent girls possessed lower distress tolerance ability than their boy counterparts. Additionally, the strength of associations between distress tolerance and negative affectivity was larger in girls than in boys. This study suggests that the Chinese DTS appears to be a psychometrically sound measure of distress (in)tolerance among adolescents.

AB Background: Accurate identification of nonverbal emotional cues is essential to successful social interactions, yet most research is limited to emotional face expression labeling. Little research focuses on the processing of emotional prosody, or tone of verbal speech, in clinical populations. Methods: Using the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy, the current study examined whether youths with pediatric-onset bipolar disorder (BD) and/or those with chronic and severe irritability (i. e. the severe mood dysregulation phenotype) are impaired in their ability to identify the emotional prosody of a spoken sentence with neutral content. Results: Youths with severe mood dysregulation (n = 67) performed more poorly than healthy comparison children (n = 57), even when the sample was limited to unmedicated patients. Medicated BD youths (n = 52) exhibited impairment relative to healthy comparison children. No interactions between group and emotion were observed, suggesting that emotional prosody labeling problems may represent a general deficit in chronically irritable youths and in medicated youths with BD. Conclusion: In concert with previously documented facial emotion labeling deficits, difficulties ascertaining the correct emotional tone of a spoken sentence may contribute to emotion dysregulation in chronically irritable children, and possibly also in youths with BD.

AB High rates of behavior and emotional problems have been consistently reported in children and adolescents with autism. Elevated rates of mental health problems have also been reported in adults with autism. Little is known, however, about the longitudinal development of behavior and emotional problems in autism. This study followed a cohort of children and adolescents over 18 years. Outcomes were evaluated in terms of behavior and emotional problems and autism symptomatology. The role of childhood factors (age, gender, IQ, behavior, and emotional problems) and the environment (socioeconomic disadvantage) were considered in terms of adult outcomes. Overall, improvements in comorbid behavior and emotional problems and autism symptomatology were observed. However, rates of comorbid behavior and emotional problems in adulthood remained high.

AB For many decades, the Middle East has been troubled with numerous long-standing armed conflicts and wars. Children and adolescents were not spared the trauma and its consequences. Exposure to traumatic events can result in mental, behavioural and emotional problems in children and adolescents. To date, this is the first paper that aims to systematically review the literature on the mental health of children and adolescents living in areas of armed conflict in the Middle East, specifically Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq. It explores factors that mediate between exposure to armed conflict and mental, behavioural and emotional problems and places them in a cultural context. Pubmed was searched and papers were identified using specific inclusion criteria. Seventy-one eligible studies were included. The main findings are that children and adolescents living in these conflict zones are exposed to high levels of traumatic experiences. Number of conflict-related traumatic experiences correlates positively with prevalence of mental, behavioural and emotional problems. Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents is estimated to be 58% in Israel, 2370% in Palestine and 1030% in Iraq (insufficient data for Lebanon). The main determining factors identified were level and type of exposure, age, gender, socio-economic adversity, social support and religiosity. These findings bring to light the pressing need to provide children and adolescents living in conflict areas with help. They are useful in designing new interventions to strengthen child and adolescent resilience in areas of conflict worldwide. Specific recommendations are included.

AB This study examines the effects of the Roots of Empathy (ROE) program on children's social-emotional competence. ROE is a theoretically derived universal preventive program that focuses on decreasing children's aggression and facilitating the development of their social-emotional understanding and prosocial behaviors. The program has as its cornerstone monthly visits by an infant and his/her parent(s) that serve as a springboard for lessons on emotion understanding, perspective taking, caring for others, and infant development. The study included a quasi-experimental control-group pretest-posttest, multi-informant design with 585 4th- to 7th-grade children from 28 classrooms. Outcome measures included self-reports of understanding of infant distress, empathy, and perspective taking, and peer and teacher reports of prosocial and aggressive behaviors. Measures assessing implementation were also included. Children in the ROE intervention classrooms showed significant improvement across several of the domains assessed: self-reports of causes for infant crying, peer nominations of prosocial behaviors, and teacher reports of proactive and relational aggression. Self-reported empathy and perspective taking showed no significant changes. According to ROE instructors' diaries assessing implementation, students in the experimental condition were exposed to all or most of the ROE curriculum. These findings support and extend recent research examining the positive impacts of classroom-based social and emotional learning (SEL) programs on children's social development and behavioral adjustment.

   resiliency programme; self-appraisal
ID PREVENTION
AB Children moving from middle childhood to adolescence experience challenges that require effective skills to cope with the increasing complexity of life. This is particularly true in South Africa where the exposure to violence, poverty and ongoing socio-economic transformation leads to high levels of stress. Accordingly, children need to be resilient to cope with stress and trauma. The goal of this investigation was to develop, implement and evaluate a resiliency programme for 12-year-old children. A total of 161 participants was selected from four schools in the Bloemfontein area and divided into experimental and control groups. The Solomon Four Group Design was used. The following measuring instruments were used to assess the participants' resilience: the Behavioural and Emotional Rating Scale, Resiliency Scales for children and adolescents, and the Fortitude Scale. The intervention programme consisted of 15 sessions presented over a period of three weeks and focused on activities promoting emotional regulation, stress management, interpersonal skills, and problem solving. Two post-test evaluations were conducted: three weeks after the intervention programme and a follow-up three months later. Findings indicated that intrapersonal characteristics such as emotional regulation and self-appraisal increased significantly after the children had been exposed to the resiliency programme; while interpersonal skills and external resources such as family and general social support did not increase significantly. The content of the resiliency programme and the recommendations for interventions are discussed in the article.

AB This paper describes the treatment of an adolescent girl (age 16) who received the ACT with RAGE-Control intervention during her treatment in an urban inpatient psychiatry unit. ACT with RAGE-Control utilizes five traditional Cognitive Behavioral techniques combined with an active biofeedback videogame designed to strengthen a patient's self-regulatory capacities while facing simulated stress in a virtual environment. The treatment is delivered as daily individual psychotherapy sessions over five consecutive days of an inpatient psychiatric admission. The following case illustrates the theory and techniques of the ACT with RAGE-Control intervention.

AB Many transformations that occur in adolescence are related to emotion and emotion regulation, yet very little is known about the autonomic underpinnings of these changes. The aim of the study was to document age-related differences in autonomic responses to social stress and relations to emotion regulation. Ninety-nine female adolescents engaged in a paced breathing and a spontaneous speech task while electrocardiography measurements were taken. Spectral decomposition of the heart period data was used to create measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Results revealed a positive correlation between age and sympathetic activity and a negative correlation between age and parasympathetic activity. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the age-related norms of cardiac variability across adolescence. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 54:207-214, 2012.

AB Objective: In patients with congenital heart disease quality of life is only marginally associated with exercise capacity. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life and exercise capacity.
   Patients and methods: From November 2007 to October 2009 a total of 767 patients (352 female, 14-67 years) with various congenital heart diseases (37 palliated/native cyanotic, 57 Fontan, 74 Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) after atrial switch, 50 other TGA, 136 Fallot, 38 Ebstein, 47 Pulmonic stenosis/regurgitation, 68 aortic coarctation, 103 aortic stenosis, 90 isolated shunts, 67 other) completed the health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36 and the German translation of the "Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale" (CES-D) to assess depressive symptoms. Afterwards a cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed.
   Results: Only 66 patients (8.6%) showed depressive symptoms fulfilling the CES-D definition for depression. The total prevalence of depression was lower than in the general population (Wilcoxon test, p<0.001) and did not differ substantially in between the diagnostic subgroups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.195). CES-D score was correlated to all of the nine dimensions of quality of life (r=-0.170 to r=-0.740, p<0.001) and less pronounced to exercise capacity (r=-0.164, pb0.001). Correlation of peak oxygen uptake to quality of life was weaker than the CES-D scores in all subscales of life quality.
   Conclusions: Patients with congenital heart disease are rarely depressive. However, even minor depressive symptoms have a stronger impact on quality of life than limited exercise capacity as seen in many patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Structural alterations in brain morphology have been inconsistently reported in children compared to adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We assessed these differences by performing meta-analysis on the data from 19 voxel-based morphometry studies. Common findings across the age groups were grey matter reduction in left putamen and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and grey matter increases in the lateral PFC, while white matter decreases were seen mainly in the children in frontostriatal pathways. In the ASD sample, children/adolescents were more likely than adults to have increased grey matter in bilateral fusiform gyrus, right cingulate and insula. Results show that clear maturational differences exist in social cognition and limbic processing regions only in children/adolescents and not in adults with ASD, and may underlie the emotional regulation that improves with age in this population.

AB There is considerable evidence that various psychiatric conditions can be prevented through the implementation of effective evidence-based interventions. Since a large proportion of lifetime mental illness starts before adulthood, such interventions are particularly important during childhood and adolescence. Prevention is important for the sustainable reduction of the burden of mental disorder since once it has arisen, treatment can only reduce a relatively small proportion of such burden. The challenge for clinicians is to incorporate such interventions into non-clinical and clinical practice as well as engaging with a range of other service providers including public health. Similar strategies can be employed in both the European and global contexts. Promotion of mental well-being can prevent mental disorder but is also important in the recovery from mental disorder. This guidance should be read in conjunction with the EPA Guidance on Mental Health Promotion. This guidance draws on preparatory work for the development of England policy on prevention of mental disorder which used a wide range of sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The presence of emotional problems may trigger drug abuse. Aim: To determine the association between illicit drug use and severity of depression symptoms among students of public secondary schools in Santiago, Chile. Material and Methods: A probabilistic sample of 2,597 adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (45% women), attending first year in public high-schools in Santiago, answered self-report questionnaires about consumption, during the last 30 days,of alcohol, tobacco and marihuana, and the Beck Depression Inventory - II. Logistic regression models were used to study the association between drug use and severity of depression symptoms, adjusting by sex. Results: Tobacco and marihuana use was reported by 38 and 13% of students, respectively. Frequency of consumption was significantly higher among women. Mild, moderate or severe depressive symptoms were found among 16%, 14% and 9% of students, respectively. Depressive symptoms were more common among women. There was a significant association between drug use and severity of depression among participants of both genders. Conclusions: The association between depressive symptoms and drug use should be considered on the design of treatment guidelines for these health problems in Chile.

   SAMPLE
AB Attitudes towards the body have been largely overlooked as a potential risk factor for adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) despite theorizing that a negative body image may play a critical role in the development of this behavior. The current study used structural equation modeling to evaluate the fit of a theoretical model specifying body image as a mediator between negative affect and NSSI in a combined clinical and non-clinical sample of 284 adolescents. The data supported the model, accounted for 21.6% of the variance in NSSI, and body image significantly mediated the relationship between negative affect and NSSI. These findings provide essential preliminary evidence that body image may represent a necessary but not sufficient risk factor for NSSI in adolescents and that treatment for NSSI should consider targeting body-related pathology in addition to emotion regulation. The findings also support including body image within developing etiological models of NSSI. (C) 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To confirm factor structure of the teacher Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and to compare teacher and student reports in Russian youth.
   Method: The SDQ and psychopathology measures were completed by teachers in a representative sample of urban adolescents (N = 528). The factor structure was examined on two randomly selected split-halves of the sample, and using a gender split. The functional impairment score was predicted by the SDQ problem scales.
   Results: The fit for all models was acceptable. The fit did not decrease when applying increasing constraints in the random-split model, but became significantly worse for the gender model, suggesting lack of measure invariance. SDQ problem scales explained 37% of functional impairment variance. Significant scale interaction (emotional problems peer problems and conduct problems*hyperactivity) suggest that combination of these problems produces an additional impact on functioning.
   Conclusions: The SDQ teacher report may represent a potentially useful screener for children and youth. (C) 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study analyzes descriptive data among a clinical sample of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youths receiving mental health services in a large California metropolitan area. Among 118 urban AI/AN youths, mood disorders (41.5%) and adjustment disorder (35.4%) were the most common mental health diagnoses. Alcohol (69.2%) and marijuana (50.0%) were the most commonly used substances. Witnessing domestic violence (84.2%) and living with someone who had a substance abuse problem (64.7%) were reported. The majority of patients demonstrated various behavior and emotional problems. Enhancing culturally relevant mental health and substance abuse treatment and prevention programs for urban AI/AN youth is suggested.

TI Real-World Affect and Social Context as Predictors of Treatment Response

AB Objective: Response to treatment in child and adolescent affective disorders is variable, with limited ability of any one treatment to improve outcome across patients. Unfortunately, we know little about the factors that explain this variability in treatment response. Individual differences in the social and affective dynamics of daily life could help to elucidate the characteristics of youth who respond to treatment.
   Methods: We used ecological momentary assessment of negative affect, positive affect, and companions in natural settings over 4 days in a sample of young people with depressive and anxiety disorders who participated in an 8-week open trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or a combination of the two. Clinicians rated participants' clinical severity at five time points, and participants reported their symptoms before and after treatment. Latent growth curve models were used to predict rate of change in clinical severity from pretreatment affect in natural settings.
   Results: Participants with high positive affect (PA), low negative affect (NA), and a high PA: NA ratio at baseline had lower severity, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment. Lower posttreatment symptoms were associated with spending more time with fathers and less time with peers before treatment. Although baseline affect was not associated with initial symptom severity, high NA and low PA: NA at baseline were related to slower rate of decline of severity during treatment. When baseline symptoms were included in models, NA and PA: NA predicted rate of decline in severity during treatment, whereas self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline did not.
   Conclusion: A more typical profile of baseline affective functioning in natural settings-that is, lower NA and higher PA and time with fathers, could provide a foundation for treatment response in children and adolescents. Affective and social dynamics in natural settings could ultimately help investigate which young people might benefit from current treatments.

AB This study examined the relations of school-age children's depressive symptoms, frontal EEG asymmetry, and maternal history of childhood-onset depression (COD). Participants were 73 children, 43 of whom had mothers with COD. Children's EEG was recorded at baseline and while watching happy and sad film clips. Depressive symptoms were measured using parent-report of Children's Depression Inventory. The key findings are the interaction effects between baseline and film frontal EEG asymmetry on child depressive symptoms. Specifically, relative right frontal EEG asymmetry while watching happy or sad film clip was associated with elevated depressive symptoms for children who also exhibited right frontal EEG asymmetry at baseline. Results suggest that right frontal EEG asymmetry that is consistent across situations may be an marker of depression-prone children.

AB Chronic pain disorders represent a significant public health concern, particularly for children and adolescents. High rates of comorbid anxiety and unipolar mood disorders often complicate psychological interventions for chronic pain. Unified treatment approaches, based on emotion regulation skills, are applicable to a broad range of emotional disorders and suggest the possibility of extending these interventions to chronic pain and pain-related dysfunction. This case report describes the use of a unified protocol for treatment of an adolescent boy with chronic daily headache and social anxiety and an adolescent girl with whole body pain and depression. Following weekly, 50-minute individual treatment sessions, the boy demonstrated notable improvement in emotional symptoms, emotion regulation skills, somalization, and functional disability. The girl showed some improvement on measures of anxiety and depression, although there appeared to be a worsening of pain symptoms and somatization. However, both patients demonstrated improvement over follow-up. This case study illustrates the potential utility of a unified treatment approach targeting pain and emotional symptoms from an emotion regulation perspective in an adolescent population.

AB Purpose: The aim of the present work was to examine the correlated eight-syndrome model of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) proposed by Ivanova et al [1], using a confirmatory factor analysis for ordinal data. Likewise, we explored the measurement invariance of the YSR across gender and age using multigroup comparisons, and checked whether there were differences in the latent means.
   Methods: The sample was made up of 4,868 nonclinical adolescents (47.6% males), with a mean age of 14.6 years (SD = 1.6).
   Results: The correlated eight-syndrome model proposed by Ivanova et al [1] showed a reasonable fit to the data, both for the total sample and by participants' gender and age. Moreover, the factor-equivalence analysis showed that the hypothesized dimensional model was invariant across gender and age. Statistically significant differences were found when comparing latent means between the groups.
   Conclusions: These results coincide with those found in the literature and are in support of the replicability, generalizability, and consistency of the eight-syndrome model of the YSR, as well as its measurement invariance across gender and age. Future studies should explore the measurement invariance of this model through multigroup comparisons across cultures. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Reviews summarizing hundreds of studies cite parent management training (PMT) and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) as some of the most effective interventions for aggressive youth. However, studies continue to report variability in outcomes, and researchers have yet to understand why certain interventions only produce behavior change in some children. Using a clinical sample of 57 children (53 boys, 4 girls; mean age = 9.33, standard deviation = 1.16) and their mothers enrolled in a combined PMT/CBT program, the current study examined the relation between changes in real-time mother child interactions, and children's externalizing outcomes from pre- to posttreatment. Results showed that dyads who were regulated in their interactions over time reported greater reductions in externalizing symptoms from pre- to posttreatment as compared with dysregulated dyads. Changes in mean levels of affective content (e.g., negativity) were not associated with externalizing outcomes. Findings suggest that dyadic regulation may be an important process associated with treatment success for aggressive youth.

AB Justification of violence as a mediator between exposure to violence and aggressive behavior in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mediating role of the justification of violence schema in the relationship between exposure to violence and reactive and proactive aggressive behavior. We differentiated between direct and indirect exposure in four contexts: home, neighborhood, school and TV. A total of 675 children, aged between 8 and 12 years, participated in the study. They answered questionnaires about exposure to violence, justification of violence, and proactive and reactive aggressive behavior in two waves six months apart. The results showed that witnessing violence at home and on TV predicted aggressive behavior, and this relationship was mediated by the justification of violence. Victimization in all contexts predicted aggressive behavior and this relationship was generally mediated by the justification of violence.

AB Background: Reviews have highlighted anxious youths affective disturbances, specifically, elevated negative emotions and reliance on ineffective emotion regulation strategies. However, no study has examined anxious youths emotional reactivity and regulation in real-world contexts. Methods: This study utilized an ecological momentary assessment approach to compare real-world emotional experiences of 65 youth with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or social phobia (ANX) and 65 age-matched healthy controls (CON), ages 9-13 years. Results: Hierarchical linear models revealed that ANX reported higher levels of average past-hour peak intensity of nervous, sad and upset emotions than CON youth but similar levels during momentary reports of current emotion. As expected, ANX youth reported more frequent physiological reactions in response to a negative event; however, there were no group differences in how frequently they used cognitive-behavioral strategies. Avoidance, distraction and problem solving were associated with the down-regulation of all negative emotions except nervousness for both ANX and CON youth; however, group differences emerged for acceptance, rumination and physiological responding. Conclusions: In real-world contexts, ANX youth do not report higher levels of momentary negative emotions but do report heightened negative emotions in response to challenging events. Moreover, ANX youth report no differences in how frequently they use adaptive regulatory strategies but are more likely to have physiological responses to challenging events. They are also less effective at using some strategies to down-regulate negative emotion than CON youth.

AB This study examined empathy-related responding in male adolescents with disruptive behavior disorder (DBD), high or low on callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Facial electromyographic (EMG) and heart rate (HR) responses were monitored during exposure to empathy-inducing film clips portraying sadness, anger or happiness. Self-reports were assessed afterward. In agreement with expectations, DBD adolescents with high CU traits showed significantly lower levels of empathic sadness than healthy controls across all response systems. Between DBD subgroups significant differences emerged at the level of autonomic (not verbal or facial) reactions to sadness, with high CU respondents showing less HR change from baseline than low CU respondents. The study also examined basal patterns of autonomic function. Resting HR was not different between groups, but resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was significantly lower in DBD adolescents with high CU traits compared to controls. Results support the notion that CU traits designate a distinct subgroup of DBD individuals.

AB Background: Maternal depression is known to be a risk for abnormal child development. Girls and boys have been found to respond differently to maternal depression. Although prenatal and postnatal depression has been widely studied, longitudinal studies of adolescent outcome are still rare.
   Methods: The original sample of 349 mothers in this longitudinal study was collected in 19891990 in Tampere, Finland. At the latest stage, of the 327 contacted in 2006, 191 mothers and 192 adolescents aged 16 to 17 years participated in the study. Maternal depressive symptoms were screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) prenatally, postnatally and at the latest stage. Adolescent outcome was examined using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self Report (YSR).
   Results: Maternal concurrent depressive symptoms were associated with adolescent behavioral and emotional problems in both genders. Maternal prenatal depressive symptoms were associated with Externalizing Problems in the YSR and boys' lower Social Competence in both the CBCL and YSR. Maternal postnatal depressive symptoms were associated with boys' lower Social Competence both in the CBCL and YSR and Externalizing Problems in the YSR.
   Limitations: Being a longitudinal normal population sample, the number of symptomatic mothers and adolescents is relatively small and the number of drop-outs is relatively high. Clinical evaluation of mothers and adolescents is also lacking.
   Conclusions: Maternal prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms are a risk to adolescent boys' wellbeing and concurrent depressive symptoms a risk for both girls' and boys' well-being. This long-term influence should be noted when treating women with depressive symptoms throughout motherhood. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its treatment have the potential to disrupt school functioning. Some research suggests that youth with IBD may have increased absences, but little is known about other areas of school functioning or related factors. This study examined school functioning (absences, achievement, grade retention, special education, and school-related quality of life) in adolescents with IBD compared with healthy adolescents and investigated demographic, disease, and psychosocial variables as predictors. Methods: Participants were 92 adolescents 11 to 17 years (50 with IBD and 42 healthy) and parents who completed questionnaires assessing psychosocial and school functioning. Report cards and school absence information were obtained from schools. Results: Youth with IBD had poorer school functioning in all areas, although only absences were significantly different between groups. Among those with IBD, internalizing problems predicted absences, income and externalizing problems predicted grade point average, and parent marital status and somatic complaints predicted school quality of life. Disease factors, including but not limited disease activity, were not significant predictors. Conclusions: Adolescents with IBD are at risk for school difficulty, and demographic and psychosocial factors are better predictors than disease factors. Interventions aimed at improving behavioral/emotional problems may improve school functioning.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the mediational effect of perceived affective self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between youth sport participants' perceived caring climate and their mental well-being. Three hundred and 95 participants (mean age = 11.80 +/- 1.54 years) from a National Youth Sport Program were recruited for the study. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires including demographic information, the Caring Climate Scale, the Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy measure, and measures of psychological well-being (i.e., depression, hope, sadness, and happiness). Results from the structural equation model analysis of the proposed mediational model revealed that both positive and negative affective self-regulatory efficacy mediated the relationship between the perceived caring climate and mental well-being. Findings from this study call attention to the importance of creating a caring climate in youth sport programs to foster positive mental well-being in young athletes via their affective self-regulatory efficacy.

AB Understanding the functions of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has important implications for the development and refinement of theoretical models and treatments of NSSI. Emotional and social vulnerabilities associated with five common functions of NSSIemotion relief (ER), feeling generation (FG), self-punishment (SP), interpersonal influence (II), and interpersonal communication (IC)were investigated to clarify why individuals use this behavior in the service of different purposes. Female participants (n = 162) with a history of NSSI completed online measures of self-injury, emotion regulation strategies and abilities, trait affectivity, social problem-solving styles, and interpersonal problems. ER functions were associated with more intense affectivity, expressive suppression, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies. FG functions were associated with a lack of emotional clarity. Similar to ER functions, SP functions were associated with greater affective intensity and expressive suppression. II functions were negatively associated with expressive suppression and positively associated with domineering/controlling and intrusive/needy interpersonal styles. IC functions were negatively associated with expressive suppression and positively associated with a vindictive or self-centered interpersonal style. These findings highlight the specific affective traits, emotional and social skill deficits, and interpersonal styles that may render a person more likely to engage in NSSI to achieve specific goals.

AB In recent years, attachment theory, which was originally formulated to describe and explain infant-parent emotional bonding, has been applied to the study of adolescent and adult romantic relationships and then to the study of psychological processes, such as interpersonal functioning, emotion regulation, coping with stress, and mental health. In this paper, we offer a brief overview of the attachment perspective on psychopathology. Following a brief account of attachment theory, we go on to explain how the study of individual differences in adult attachment intersects with the study of psychopathology. Specifically, we review research findings showing that attachment insecurity is a major contributor to mental disorders, and that the enhancement of attachment security can facilitate amelioration of psychopathology.

AB There have been rapid advances in understanding a broad range of changes in brain structure and function during adolescence, and a growing interest in identifying which of these neurodevelopmental changes are directly linked with pubertal maturation-at least in part because of their potential to provide insights into the numerous emotional and behavioral health problems that emerge during this developmental period. This review focuses on what is known about the influence of puberty on white matter development in adolescence. We focus on white matter because of its role in providing the structural architectural organization of the brain and as a structural correlate of communication within complex neural systems. We begin with a review of studies that report sex differences or sex by age interactions in white matter development as these findings can provide, although indirectly, information relevant to puberty-related changes. Studies are also critically reviewed based on methodological procedures used to assess pubertal maturation and relations with white matter changes. Findings are discussed in light of their implications for the development of neural systems underlying the regulation of emotion and behavior and how alterations in the development of these systems may mediate risk for affective disorders in vulnerable adolescents.

AB This review integrates cognitive, socioemotional, and neuroimaging perspectives on self-development. Neural correlates of key processes implicated in personal and social identity are reported from studies of children, adolescents, and adults, including autobiographical memory, direct and reflected self-appraisals, and social exclusion. While cortical midline structures of medial prefrontal cortex and medial posterior parietal cortex are consistently identified in neuroimaging studies considering personal identity from a primarily cognitive perspective ("who am I?"), additional regions are implicated by studies considering personal and social identity from a more socioemotional perspective ("what do others think about me, where do I fit in?"), especially in child or adolescent samples. The involvement of these additional regions (including tempo-parietal junction and posterior superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, anterior insula, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, middle cingulate cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) suggests mentalizing, emotion, and emotion regulation are central to self-development. In addition, these regions appear to function atypically during personal and social identity tasks in autism and depression, exhibiting a broad pattern of hypoactivation and hyperactivation, respectively.

AB Self-Regulation in Eating Disorders and Obesity Implications for the Treatment Research has shown that the treatment of certain eating disorders as e. g. anorexia nervosa and inappropriate eating behavior in obesity is of limited efficacy and that an elevated psychopathology also persists after treatment. This necessitates the identification of other etiological and maintaining factors that, when changed, could improve the efficacy of the treatment. Based on actual findings, the present narrative review aims to illustrate the role of the ability to regulate emotions and impulses in the development and maintenance of disordered eating. There is some evidence that the eating disorders anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and obesity are associated with a reduced ability of emotion and impulse regulation in childhood, adolescence, and in adulthood. Furthermore, a reduced ability of self-regulation in childhood predicts later obesity. Up to now, there are no controlled studies about the efficacy of the inclusion of such components in the treatment of eating disorders. However, there are promising results regarding the efficacy of unspecific prevention approaches for the improvement of self-regulation.

AB The ability to refuse unprotected sexual behavior is a skill that could prevent a number of negative health outcomes, including HIV/AIDS infection and transmission. The present study uniquely adds to the extant literature by investigating the effects of stress reactivity (indexed by cardiac reactivity) and emotion dysregulation on self-efficacy in avoiding potentially risky sexual behaviors among women. Participants were a sample of 60 women age 1825 years, oversampled for a history of childhood maltreatment (40 women reported a history of physical, emotional and/or sexual abuse or neglect). Findings indicated that emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between severity of childhood maltreatment and self-efficacy for avoidance of sexual activities, but only for women who also showed high stress reactivity. These results suggest that women with a history of childhood maltreatment, and in particular those who are highly reactive to stress, would potentially benefit from prevention programs for risky sexual activities that aim to reduce emotion dysregulation.

AB Identification of Early Childhood Behavioral Disorders by German Preschool Medical Examinations
   Increasing prevalence of behavioral disorders among preschool children, such as ADHD, conduct and emotional disorders, has led to growing interest in research concerning prevention measures and early identification of children at risk. This paper gives an overview of prevalence data and characteristics of behavioural disorders in preschool children and their influence on the children's quality of life. The necessity of diagnostic measures in early childhood is discussed and German prevention programmes for preschoolers are reviewed for their ability to identify children at risk.

AB Based on the developmental theory presented by Gagne (2009), we examined the factors perceived to influence the development of elite youth football players at a critical stage in their progression to the professional level. Transcribed interviews with ten expert development coaches were inductively and deductively content analysed. Conceptualisation of the data revealed six interrelated higher-order categories that represented the factors perceived to either positively or negatively influence player development. These were: awareness (e. g. self-awareness, awareness of others); resilience (e. g. coping with setbacks, optimistic attitude); goal-directed attributes (e. g. passion, professional attitude); intelligence (e. g. sport intelligence, emotional competence); sport-specific attributes (e. g. coachability, competitiveness); and environmental factors (e. g. significant others, culture of game). In this investigation, awareness emerged as a fundamental and mediating element for understanding how young players are able to transition to the professional level. Collectively, the findings underline the multidimensional nature of talent development and suggest that an intricate combination of stage-specific factors must manifest for gifted young players to translate their potential into excellence. Mechanisms by which academies could be helped to shape the characteristics and conditions associated with effective development are discussed.

AB Previous research has found relationships between higher levels of emotional intelligence (EI) and academic success in both adolescents and adults. This study examines the relationship between overall EI and specific EI competencies in 135 undergraduate psychology students in the UK. EI was measured at the start of a psychology degree course using the Emotional Competence Inventory-University Edition (ECI-U II). Performance was assessed using retention statistics and students' final average percentage mark (APM) at the end of their degree course. Results showed that there were no differences in overall EI or specific EI competencies in those students who graduated compared to those who failed to graduate. Whilst global EI did not significantly predict final APM, specific EI competencies (conscientiousness, adaptability, empathy, organisational awareness, and building bonds) significantly predicted APM after controlling for gender. Recommendations for the implementation of EI training in higher education institutions are considered.

AB Introduction: School anxiety has become a common problem in children and adolescents. Despite numerous studies, it is difficult to definitely identify the cause of neurotic disorders in school-age children. The objective of the presented study was to assess the prevalence of neurotic disorders in rural schoolchildren and the role of physical activity as a method to support their treatment.
   Material and methods: The study consisted of 123 girls and 117 boys living in rural areas of Wielkopolska. A questionnaire was provided evaluating family status, family relationships, school situation, somatic symptoms related to being at school, and the frequency of physical activity.
   Results: It was found that over the 50% of children considered the relations with siblings as correct, but also acknowledged that there were a conflict situations in their relationship. Nearly 25% of children indicated an emotional irrelevance with their parents. About 20% of the young people did not like going to school or were afraid to stay there. Over the 50% of children declared somato-emotional problems associated with the being at school. The symptoms of neurotic disorders were more strongly expressed and more common in girls. Analysis of physical activity indicated that only a small group of young people practiced sport regularly, and an even smaller percentage of children exercised with their parents and/or peers.
   Conclusions: The development of somatic and emotional disturbances in children may be associated with irregular family and school relationships and low physical activity. It was found that gender had a significant influence on most of the studied parameters.

AB Children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at particular risk for psychological disturbance. Little is known about the mental health status of children on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A hospital-based cross-sectional study of 318 children aged 6-14 on HAART in Addis Ababa was conducted. Behavioral and emotional problem was assessed using the child behavior check list (CBCL/6-18). Logistic regression analysis was done to select the best subset of predictor variables and determine their association with behavioral and emotional problems. Of the 318 caregivers of children aged 6-14 on HAART, 39.3% of the children had behavioral and emotional problems. Low family monthly income (AOR, 3.44, 95% CI, 1.89-6.25), older age (AOR, 2.27, 95% CI, 1.34-3.83), and parental loss (AOR, 1.89, 95% CI, 1.10-3.25) were found to be determinants of behavioral and emotional problems in the multivariate logistic regression. There is high prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems in children on HAART in Addis Ababa. More support is needed to children from families of low income and those who lost their parents. Further research should be carried out to enhance better understanding and appropriate response to behavioral and emotional problems.

   Since 2010 trends outlined in diagnosis and therapy in the German speaking countries in the area of externalizing disorders (ADHD, conduct disorder) are presented. In particular, publications of children and adolescent psychiatry and clinical psychology have been examined. It turns out that in the German-speaking countries, the concern with conduct disorder (including psychopathy) increased compared with the discussion of the significance of ADHD. This development reflects the important therapeutic challenge of conduct disorders.

AB Is the use of music in everyday life a culturally universal phenomenon? And do the functions served by music contribute to the development of music preferences regardless of the listener's cultural background? The present study explored similarities and dissimilarities in the functions of music listening and their relationship to music preferences in two countries with different cultural backgrounds: India as an example of a collectivistic society and Germany as an example of an individualistic society. Respondents were asked to what degree their favorite music serves several functions in their life. The functions were summarized in seven main groups: background entertainment, prompt for memories, diversion, emotion regulation, self-regulation, self-reflection, and social bonding. Results indicate a strong similarity of the functions of people's favorite music for Indian and German listeners. Among the Indians, all of the seven functions were rated as meaningful; among the Germans, this was the case for all functions except emotion regulation. However, a pronounced dissimilarity was found in the predictive power of the functions of music for the strength of music preference, which was much stronger for Germans than for Indians. In India, the functions of music most predictive for music preference were diversion, self-reflection, and social bonding. In Germany, the most predictive functions were emotion regulation, diversion, self-reflection, prompt for memories, and social bonding. It is concluded that potential cultural differences hardly apply to the functional use of music in everyday life, but they do so with respect to the impact of the functions on the development of music preference. The present results are consistent with the assumption that members of a collectivistic society tend to set a higher value on their social and societal integration and their connectedness to each other than do members of individualistic societies.

AB This study examined the role of emotion regulation (ER) strategies and emotional disposition in problem drinking of adolescent offenders (n = 303) and non-offending peers (n = 287) from South Korea. The participants completed a questionnaire assessing problem drinking, positive and negative emotion, emotional intensity, and use of problem solving, support seeking, and avoidant ER strategies. Problem drinking was positively associated with negative emotion, emotional intensity, and support-seeking ER in both groups, and avoidant ER among offenders only. Support-seeking ER accounted for the association between positive emotion and drinking in both groups, and avoidant ER further accounted for the association between positive emotion and drinking among offenders. Only among female offenders was the association between emotional intensity and drinking explained by support-seeking ER. The results imply that intervention to improve ER effectiveness, taking into account emotional disposition, delinquency differences, and gender, may help lessen problem drinking among adolescents.

AB Recent neuroimaging studies have uncovered much about the specific neural deficits in adult bipolar disorder (ABD), but despite promising results, neuroimaging research for pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is still developing. The neuroimaging literature is highly heterogeneous, varying in the paradigms used and in participants' mood states and medication status. Despite this variability, several dominant patterns emerge. In response to emotional stimuli, both ABD and PBD show limbic hyperactivity coupled with hypoactivity in ventral prefrontal emotion regulation systems. This pattern occurred most robustly in response to negative incidental stimuli and was especially apparent in manic PBD. ABD showed more variability in ventral prefrontal activity, possibly due to maturational and medication factors. On numerous cognitive paradigms, PBD showed dorsal prefrontal hypoactivity linked to ventral dysfunction, whereas ABD showed compensatory frontal, parietal, and temporal activity with paradigm-specific variations. In emotion-cognition interaction paradigms, patients show dysregulation in regions interfacing between cognitive and emotional brain systems (e.g., ventral prefrontal and cingulate cortices), which expend extra effort to process emotional stimuli effectively and recruit additional posterior attention systems to cope with affective instability. In addition, novel functional connectivity techniques have uncovered connectivity deficits between frontal and limbic regions in ABD and PBD at rest and during active emotional and cognitive tasks. Finally, the neuroimaging literature currently lacks cross-sectional studies comparing PBD with ABD and longitudinal studies following children and adolescents with BD into adulthood. Such studies would provide important insights into patients' prognosis and would determine targets for early interventions in the evolving illness diathesis.

AB Anticipatory Grief in Adolescents and Young Adults Coping with Parental Cancer By the current state of research, it cannot be answered clearly how adolescents experience anticipatory grief and if and to which extent this process differs from anticipatory grief of adults. The present study will fill this gap by providing both a quantitative and a qualitative description of anticipatory grief processes. Therefore, 74 adolescents and young adults (11-21 years), whose parents have suffered from cancer, completed an adapted version of the "Trauerfragebogen" (Weiser u. Ochsmann, 2002). Additionally a subsample of n = 38 took part in a qualitative guided interview. Based on these interviews, 16 categories were formed, that were assigned to two types of stressors. Beside communication and prioritization of family, different symptoms of grief were the central category in the loss-oriented type, where fears of loss, compassion and concern were of crucial importance. Also categories of the restoration-oriented type were strongly present. Thus, it seems that young people generally manage to accept their new role in the stressful family situation and they have a series of coping mechanisms available to do so. This was also reflected in the quantitative data, were the subscale "Inner Strength" reached the highest value. In the counselling of adolescents with cancer-diseased parents, both loss-oriented and restoration-oriented processes should equally be recognized and encouraged.

AB Background: The main aim of this study was to use proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to identify brain biomarkers for emotional dysregulation in youth as measured by subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Methods: We measured glutamate (Glu) concentrations in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) of 37 pediatric subjects (aged 6-17 years) using high field (4.0 Tesla) proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Subjects were grouped based on combined T scores on three subscales (Anxiety/Depression, Aggression and Attention) of the CBCL previously associated with deficits in the regulation of emotion. Subjects were stratified into those with high (>180) (N=10) and low (<180) (N=27) scores.
   Limitations: Limitations include small sample size, wide age range studied, focus on Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) only, and that some subjects received psychopharmacological treatments.
   Results: We found a statistically significant correlation between Glu levels in the ACC and CBCL dysregulation profile scores among subjects with high dysregulation profile scores.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that glutamatergic dysregulation in the ACC may represent a useful bio-marker of emotional dysregulation in youth. Further investigation into the causality, time line and utility as a predictive metric is warranted.

AB A few years ago the Bremer Adolescent Study revealed that affective disorders are frequent mental disorders in adolescence (Essau, Karpinski, Petermann & Conradt, 1998). Currently, studies that use a categorical approach to the measurement of mental disorders and that can thus provide comprehensive data about the distribution of affective disorders are lacking. In the present study, standardized clinical interviews were administered to 333 students between 12 and 17 years of age in Bremen (Northern Germany) to measure lifetime prevalence of mental disorders. In addition, a comprehensive questionnaire surveyed general psychological functioning. Initial results show that 14.4 % of the students received the diagnosis of an affective disorder (7.5 % major depression, 5.4 % dysthymia, 1.5 % bipolar disorders and hypomania). The findings are comparable to earlier estimates of prevalence rates of affective disorders in adolescents and emphasize the need for early prevention and intervention.

AB A growing body of literature discusses the role of emotion regulation as a significant predictor for mental disorders. In early childhood and adolescence anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders, in which the influence of emotion regulation is still not specified. Based on the generally cross-sectional studies that are not focused on the type of anxiety disorder and analyze the relation between emotion dysregulation and anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, we propose a model that identifies the critical dimensions of emotion dysregulation, like attention shifting or cognitive strategies, and presents peer acceptance as a specific mechanism through which emotion dysregulation exerts its influence. This model of emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence can purposefully guide hypothesis for future research.

AB The co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) is associated with greater risk for suicidal behavior than either disorder alone. Research highlights the relevance of PTSD symptoms in particular to suicide risk within this population. Research has also provided support for an association between distress tolerance (DT) and both PTSD symptoms and suicidal behavior. This study examined the role of DT in the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and suicidal behavior in a sample of 164 SUD inpatients with a history of Criterion A traumatic exposure. Results indicated that DT moderated the relationship between PTSD symptoms (overall, re-experiencing, and hyperarousal) and medically attended suicide attempts, with the magnitude of the relationship increasing at higher levels of DT.

AB The relationship between morningness/eveningness, sleep, and psychological problems is well documented in adults as well as in adolescents. However, research on the circadian orientation and its concomitants in younger children is scarce. The authors investigated the distribution of morningness/eveningness and its connection to sleeping and psychological problems in 91 children and 151 adolescents in Austria. The authors found that morning (M) types had less sleep-related and psychological problems than intermediate (I) and evening (E) types, respectively. Among children, M-types suffered less from daytime sleepiness (females: chi(2)((2)) = 8.1, p = .017; males: chi(2)((2)) = 14.8, p = .001). Among adolescents, M-types showed fewer sleep-wake problems (females: chi(2)((2)) = 17.5, p < .001; males: chi(2)((2)) = 19.8, p < .001), and female M-types showed less externalizing (chi(2)((2)) = 8.7, p = .013) as well as internalizing problem behavior (chi(2)((2)) = 9.0, p = .011). In conclusion, these findings indicate that morningness may act as a protective factor against the development of sleep-related problems in childhood and sleep-related and psychological problems in adolescence, especially in females.

AB We know very little about the development of rumination, the tendency to passively brood about negative feelings. Because rumination is a risk factor for many forms of psychopathology, especially depression, such knowledge could prove important for preventing negative mental health outcomes in youth. This study examined developmental origins of rumination in a longitudinal sample (N = 337; 51% girls) studied in preschool (ages 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 years) and early adolescence (ages 13 and 15 years). Results indicated that family context and child temperament, assessed during the preschool period, were risk factors for a ruminative style in adolescence. Specifically, early family contexts characterised by over-controlling parenting and a family style of negative-submissive expressivity predicted higher levels of later rumination. These associations were moderated by children's temperamental characteristics of negative affect and effortful control. Further, the interaction of these temperament factors exerted an additional influence on later rumination. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.

AB The current study examined mechanisms through which trait negative affectivity (NA) and effortful control (EC) prospectively predict increases in depressive symptoms in a community sample of 110 adolescents (mean age = 16.40 years) in a 9-week, multi-wave diary study. We hypothesised youth with high NA and low EC would experience greater increases in depressive symptoms because they generate more maladaptive cognitive responses to stress. NA predicted greater event-specific rumination and negative cognitive style across the study period. After controlling for trait cognitive vulnerabilities, only event-specific rumination mediated the effect of NA on subsequent depressive symptoms, suggesting that high-NA youth are more likely to ruminate about stressful events, which then predicts increases in depressive symptoms. EC did not moderate the effects of NA on either depressive symptoms or cognitive responses to stress. Results are discussed in terms of vulnerability-stress models linking temperament and depressive symptoms in adolescence.

AB This study aims at evaluating how minor and serious delinquency relates to cognitive and emotional functioning in high-risk adolescents, taking problematic substance use into account. In 80 high-risk adolescent males (13-19 years), the frequency of minor and serious offences committed over the last year was predicted, in multiple regression analyses, from problematic substance use, intellectual efficiency, trait impulsivity, alexithymia (inability to express feelings in words), and cognitive coping strategies. Both minor and serious delinquency were more frequent in adolescents with more problematic substance use and higher intellectual efficacy. Minor delinquency was further related to a tendency to act out when experiencing negative emotions, and difficulties in focusing energy on instrumental action when under stress; while serious delinquency was predominantly and strongly related to rigid and dichotomous thinking. The results underline the heterogeneous nature of delinquency, minor offences being primarily associated with emotional regulation deficits, while major offences are related with a lack of cognitive flexibility.

AB Adolescence is a critical period for long-term physical and mental health. The aim of the current study was to examine if the constructs stress and emotion regulation in an adolescent sample predict the risk for the development of an eating disorder especially in girls. A sample of 360 adolescents participated in a survey concerning individual stress experience, emotion regulation strategies, emotion-induced and restrictive eating behaviour and the risk of developing an eating disorder. The results revealed gender specific outcomes in stress experience, emotion regulation und eating behaviours. Furthermore school types differed in extend of restricted eating and emotion regulation strategies. Only in students of secondary school the degree of expressive suppression predicted next to BMI and increased probability of chronic stress the restrictive eating behaviour. These results imply that especially girls from secondary school will notably benefit from prevention programs that focus on the promotion of constructive self-regulation strategies.

AB The study examined: (1) the intergenerational concordance between parents and their adolescent sons using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) categories and state-of-mind scales; and (2) the contribution of parents' state of mind with respect to attachment to their sons' adjustment during a stressful separation, as well as the possibility that sons' AAI mediates the associations between parents' AAI and sons' adjustment. Eighty-eight adolescents and their parents were interviewed using the AAI during the son's senior year in high school. Approximately a year later, during the first phase of compulsory military service, the adolescents and their peers reported on the sons' adjustment. Results demonstrated AAI correspondence between mothers' (but not fathers) and sons' categories (autonomous versus non-autonomous) and associations between mothers', fathers' and sons' AAI state-of-mind scales. The adjustment of sons of non-autonomous mothers (in particular, preoccupied mothers) was inferior to the adjustment of others. Mothers' and fathers' state of mind scales were associated with sons' adjustment, but sons' AAI did not mediate this association. The uniqueness of adolescence, the importance of parents' state of mind and the differences between mothers and fathers are discussed.

AB As the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased, attention has shifted toward consideration of ASDs in adolescence and adulthood, as well as public health repercussions for this population. Since the social and emotional deficits within ASDs may be salient during incidents of unintended criminal or violent behavior, one arc:a of focus is involvement of adolescents and young adults with ASD in the criminal justice system. Without a thorough understanding of how and why individuals with ASDs may exhibit criminal behavior, judicial and legislative state systems have begun to develop policies lacking a substantial evidence base. In this article, we attempt to synthesize the literature on one type of ASD (high functioning) and criminal behavior. Three specific deficits characteristic of individuals with ASDs (theory of mind, emotion regulation, and moral reasoning) are examined as potential confluent forces leading to criminal behavior among individuals with ASDs. Legal and policy recommendations are presented.

A non-concurrent multiple baseline design was used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. A sample of five adolescents, aged 11 to 14 years, participated; all five families completed the protocol. Results indicated that symptoms of oppositionality were significantly reduced. Moreover, maternal ratings suggested significant improvements in emotion regulation in their children and cohesion in the family. However, symptoms of depression showed little improvement. Results of this study have implications for improving treatment outcomes for youth with these comorbid conditions and may lead to increased conceptual understanding of these comorbid problems.

AB The present study compared psychological adjustment of 158 adolescents with vision impairment and 158 sighted adolescents with a matched-pair design using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Adolescent self-reports and teacher reports on emotional problems, peer problems, and total difficulties showed higher scores in students with vision impairment than in sighted students. However, the size of between-group differences was small, and adolescents who are blind and their peers with low vision showed similar levels of psychological adjustment. In addition, older students reported more emotional problems than younger students. Furthermore, differences between self-reported emotional problems of students with and without vision impairment were stronger in older participants. In both groups, girls showed more emotional problems and less conduct problems than boys. We conclude that most students with vision impairment are well adjusted but a minority may benefit from psychological interventions.

AB Little is known of the possible relationship between a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and sexually offensive behavior in adolescents. Our aim was to understand how adolescents with ADHD who had sexually offended described their childhood experiences and spoke about their diagnostic symptoms. The boys' early lives and relations were unpredictable, and emotional, physical, and sexual limits had been crossed. However, many boys saw themselves or their diagnosis, rather than their parents, school, or "society,"as the underlying cause of their behavior. They used different strategies, for example repressing memories or regarding traumatic experiences as normal, to manage their lives. Most boys had difficulty with emotions and expressed sadness or frustration through anger. They spoke of being inattentive and restless in school and impulsive before and during their sexual offenses. The psychiatric assessment was described as a "messy"experience that strengthened their belief that something was wrong with them. Some had incorporated neuropsychiatric language into otherwise limited vocabularies and tended to use their diagnostic symptoms to excuse their offenses. The focus in the assessment on the boys themselves and their behaviors may darken their understandings of themselves, their experiences of abuse, and the offenses they have committed. Further research is needed into the possible consequences of a diagnosis of ADHD on adolescents' self-image and sense of self-control.

AB The concept of emotional competence as a positive youth development construct is reviewed in this paper. Differences between emotional intelligence and emotional competence are discussed and an operational definition is adopted. Assessment methods of emotional competence with an emphasis on its quantitative nature are introduced. In the discussion of theories of emotional competence, the functionalist and developmental perspectives and the relationships with positive youth development are highlighted. Possible antecedents, especially the influence of early child-caregiver, and expected outcomes of emotional competence are examined. Practical ways to promote emotional competence among adolescents, particularly the role of parents and teachers, and the future direction of research are also discussed.

AB This study explored the anger-regulation strategies of bicultural individuals who are brought up with two distinct cultures that might carry contradictory demands about how to regulate emotions. With a sample of 525 adolescents in the Netherlands and Morocco, we found that bicultural Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' anger regulation in response to hypothetical peer conflict were largely similar to those of their Dutch peers. In fact, both the Dutch and the Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' anger regulation differed in the same ways from the Moroccan group, with greater acting out and less calm verbalisation, reflection, and diversion in the former than in the latter. Additionally, our findings indicate that Moroccan-Dutch adolescents' identification with the Dutch as well as with the Moroccan culture is related to more anger verbalisation and less externalising anger regulation. These results are interpreted in light of the complex cultural position faced by bicultural adolescents.

AB The present study examined associations among perceived parenting, separation-individuation, and emotional adjustment in a convenience sample of college students in Belgium (N = 350; 68% female; aged 18 to 26). In line with a conceptual model advanced in the literature, factor analysis supported the distinction between three dimensions of separation-individuation: overdependence and healthy separation (both of which had already been described in earlier research) and a new dimension, labeled excessive autonomy. Path analysis findings were consistent with a mediational model in which lower quality of perceived parenting predicted more excessive autonomy, which in turn predicted poorer emotional adjustment. In addition, healthy separation predicted superior emotional adjustment, whereas overdependence was not associated with this particular type of adjustment. Implications for current understanding of the process of separation-individuation in college students and of excessive autonomy, in particular, are discussed.

AB Using a retrospective survey, we studied a sample of 1,679 college women to determine whether reports of prior forgetting of childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and other traumas could be explained by trauma severity and individual differences in the use of defensive emotion-regulation reactions (i.e., repressive coping, dissociation, and fantasy proneness). Among victims of physical abuse (but not sexual abuse or other types of trauma), those who experienced severe abuse and used defensive reactions were sometimes more likely to report temporary forgetting of abuse but other times less likely to report forgetting. We also found unanticipated main effects of trauma severity on temporary forgetting. Our results provide an understanding of victims' experiences of forgetting by demonstrating the importance of considering unique effects of trauma type, different aspects of trauma severity, and victims' defensive reactions to trauma.

AB The present study aims at presenting psychometric properties, factor structure, and convergent validity of the German version of the Parent Rated Life Orientation Test of Children (PLOT) to measure optimism and pessimism in 4- to 6-year old children. Parents of 145 preschool children (77 girls; Age: M = 5.0, SD = 0.6 years) rated the children's optimism and pessimism as well as their emotion regulation. Moreover, the children's problem behavior (parent and caregiver report) was assessed. In agreement with studies on school children and adolescents, a two-dimensional structure with an optimism and a pessimism factor could be revealed. Consistent with theoretical reasoning results indicate relations of optimism/pessimism with problem behavior and emotion regulation. The reported reliability and validity of the PLOT point at its applicability in preschool children. The new measure may contribute to a better understanding of dispositional optimism and pessimism among preschoolers and can be useful as a screening instrument to identify children at risk.

AB In a prospective longitudinal study the authors examined the associations between parent locus of control of reinforcement (LOCR), measured before the birth of a child, and behavioral-emotional outcomes in that child at age 7 years. A total of 307 couples completed questionnaires regarding their emotional status and LOCR at their first prenatal care appointment. When their children turned 7 years old, teachers completed questionnaires regarding each participating child's behavior. Findings indicate significant associations between fathers' prenatal LOCR and child outcomes, particularly hyperactivity in sons. Hyperactivity and behavioral-emotional problems in girls, in contrast, were better predicted by maternal prenatal emotional distress. Results provide evidence that paternal and maternal characteristics that predate the birth of a child relate to later behavioral outcomes in that child. Implications for prevention of child psychopathology are discussed.

AB Objective: Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) reflects shifts in conceptualizing bipolar disorder among children and adolescents since the mid-1990s. Since then, PBD diagnoses, predominantly in the United States, have increased dramatically, and the diagnosis has attracted significant controversy. During the same period, psychiatric theory and practice has become increasingly biological. The aim of this paper is to examine the rise of PBD in terms of wider systemic influences. Method: In the context of literature referring to paradigm shifts in psychiatry, we reviewed the psychiatric literature, media cases, and information made available by investigative committees and journalists. Results: Social historians and prominent psychiatrists describe a paradigm shift in psychiatry over recent decades: from an era of "brainless psychiatry," when an emphasis on psychodynamic and family factors predominated to the exclusion of biological factors, to a current era of " mindless psychiatry" that emphasizes neurobiological explanations for emotional and behavioral problems with limited regard for contextual meaning. Associated with this has been a tendency within psychiatry and society to neglect trauma and attachment insecurity as etiological factors; the " atheoretical" (but by default biomedical) premise of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd and 4th eds.); the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in research, continuing medical education, and direct-to-consumer advertising; and inequality in the U. S. health system that favors "diagnostic upcoding." Harm from overmedicating children is now a cause of public concern. Conclusion: It can be argued that PBD as a widespread diagnosis, particularly in the United States, reflects multiple factors associated with a paradigm shift within psychiatry rather than recognition of a previously overlooked common disorder.

AB Background: Children with Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) suffer from an intractable, burdensome skin disease that may result in cognitive as well as social and emotional problems.
   Patients: To assess cognitive problems in patients with EB, we investigated 20 affected children and adolescents, 6-17 years of age (mean: 10.8 years; SD: 3.4 years), and 24 healthy controls (6-15 years, mean: 10.9 years; SD: 3.0 years) for cognitive abilities. Additionally, parents were asked to assess social and emotional problems of their children.
   Methods: Patients and controls were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Parents completed Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), a parent-report measure on emotional and behavioural symptoms in children.
   Results: The mean scores of the young patients tested with WISC-R and WAIS-R showed no significant left shift if compared to healthy controls. Analyzing the subtypes of EB, however, considerable cognitive deficits were associated with recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB), severe generalized. Less social competence and more social and emotional problems were reported for the entire patient group.
   Conclusions: Functional rehabilitation is required to increase not only the physical but the cognitive development of the severely affected children with RDEB. Children and adolescents with all subtypes of EB require therapeutic support regarding their social and emotional life.

AB The adverse impact on recovery of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been demonstrated in returned veterans. The study assessed this effect in children's health outcomes following TBI and extended previous work by including a full range of TBI severity, and improved assessment of PTSD within a longitudinal design. There were 205 children and adolescents (6 to 15 years of age) who experienced a TBI that were assessed at 2, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months following the TBI. Severity of TBI was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. After controlling for the impact of the severity of TBI, premorbid behavioral and emotional problems and executive function, children with TBI and PTSD did not experience as much psychosocial recovery as those without PTSD. Furthermore the level of psychosocial function was no better than that experienced by children with a severe TBI. In contrast, severe TBI was predictive of a poorer physical recovery in the first 6 months, after which recovery was equivalent across all severity levels.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in youth involved in delinquency, but it is often not effectively treated. A randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing the outcomes of an emotion regulation therapy (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy, or TARGET) with a relational supportive therapy (Enhanced Treatment as Usual, or ETAU) with 59 delinquent girls (age 13-17 years) who met criteria for full or partial PTSD. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated generally large effects for pre-post change in PTSD symptoms for both therapies but not in emotion regulation. Both therapies had small to medium effect size changes in anxiety, anger, depression, and posttraumatic cognitions. Treatment x Time interactions showed small to medium effects favoring TARGET for change in PTSD (intrusive reexperiencing and avoidance) and anxiety symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions, and emotion regulation, and favoring ETAU for change in hope and anger. Results provide preliminary support for TARGET as a potentially efficacious therapy for PTSD with delinquent girls. Relational therapies such as ETAU also may be beneficial for delinquent girls with PTSD, particularly to enhance optimism and self-efficacy and reduce anger.

AB Multiple studies have documented elevated rates of emotional problems such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders among youth with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, no known study has investigated factors associated with these psychological difficulties. The extent to which presence of emotional problems was predicted by health insurance coverage, parent involvement in care, symptom severity, family economic impact, and adolescence was investigated in a sample of 779 children with DM. Results showed that adolescent status, symptom severity, and financial problems resulting from DM care were significant risk factors associated with the presence of an emotional problem within this sample of children with diabetes. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

AB There is increasing evidence that interpersonal risks and resources can modulate the impact peer victimization has on children's socio-emotional adjustment. The current study contributes to this research by examining links between parents' victimization-related beliefs and children's psychosocial functioning. Data were collected on 190 3rd- and 4th-grade children (92 boys) and their parents. After controlling for earlier levels of socio-emotional adjustment, parents' normative beliefs predicted greater overt victimization and aggression among boys and, for boys and girls, amplified links between peer victimization and subsequent psychosocial maladjustment. Avoidance beliefs predicted positive behavioral development among low victimized youth, but compromised adjustment among highly victimized youth. Sex-specific findings emerged, and results were stronger for overt than relational victimization. These findings underscore the need for parent education components within anti-bullying interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about bicultural adolescents emotional competence. The aim of the present study was to examine anger communication by comparing thirty-eight 16-year-old Moroccan-Dutch adolescents with 40 Dutch and 40 Moroccan peers using hypothetical anger-eliciting vignettes. Findings show that although Moroccan and Dutch adolescents were equally likely to feel angry, they differed in their anger communication in accordance with their cultural models: Moroccan adolescents were more likely to express their anger indirectly than their Dutch counterparts, whereas Dutch adolescents were more likely to react directly or aggressively. Critically, the anger communication styles of the Moroccan-Dutch youngsters fell in between the two monocultural groups.

AB We tested associations among empathic responsiveness, attachment style, and vagal tone (a physiologic index of emotion regulation) in 103 motheradolescent dyads. Dyads discussed positive and negative topics and then separately reviewed a videotape of the interaction and rated their own and the other person's affect at one-minute intervals. We used multilevel modeling to analyze the association between one's rating of the other person's affect and the other person's affect (empathic sensitivity), and the association between one's rating of the other person's affect and one's own affect (perceived concordance). Adolescents empathic responsiveness was predicted by attachment style, vagal tone, and interactions between them. Adolescents with the greatest empathic responsiveness had low levels of attachment insecurity and high levels of vagal tone.

AB The present study examines the effects of the JobFit-Training for adolescents (JFT, Petermann & Petermann, 2010) based on a sample of 87 eighth-graders. Data was collected from the students 2 months prior to the training and again immediately before the start, as well as following the training. The students were asked to complete questionnaires regarding their social skills and learning behaviour. The analyses of the data showed no significant differences in the students' self reports in the two measurements preceding the training. Comparing both of these measurements with the results following the training showed significant improvements with effects classed as medium to high in several subscales of social competence. The JobFit-Training provides an effective school-based method of improving social competences in adolescents.

AB This study focuses on sex differences in the use of coping strategies in early adolescence. In addition to the adolescents' reports on their use of coping strategies they were also asked to report about expected sex differences. The coping strategies used by the adolescents and the sex-role conformity of their expectancies were related to adjustment problems. Two-hundred-and-sixty adolescents with a mean age of 13.7 years (SD = 1.9) participated in this study. The results regarding the use of coping strategies revealed only few strategies with sex differences, although more differences were expected by the adolescents. Coping strategies classified as maladaptive were related to increased emotional and behavioral adjustment problems in both girls and boys. Coping strategies classified as adaptive were associated with decreased emotional problems in boys. Seeking social support showed associations with psychological adjustment in girls. The inclusion of the sex-role conformity of the adolescents' expectations increased explained variance in psychological adjustment. This is, however, restricted to girls and may be explained by the impact of sex role stereotypes, which may influence the reports on coping strategies as well as the reports on adjustment problems. This influence may generate common variance and thus be responsible for the increased explained variance.

AB Deficient adaptive regulation of emotion in children with ADHD
   Objectives: The current study investigates whether children with and without ADHD differ in their implementation of emotion-regulation strategies. In addition, it explores whether the regulation patterns of ADHD children are related to co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems. Methods: A group of 21 children with ADHD and a group of 20 children without ADHD (ages 10-13) completed the Questionnaire on Emotion Regulation in Children and Adolescents (FEEL-KJ, Grob & Smolenski, 2005). Furthermore, we employed the parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Woerner, Becker & Rothenberger, 2004) to assess the socioemotional problems of ADHD children. Results: Self-reports revealed group differences in terms of adaptive emotion regulation, though no group differences were found in terms of maladaptive emotion regulation. Specifically, children with ADHD reported less frequently applying the strategies "Cognitive Problem Solving," "Problem-Oriented Acting," "Mood Enhancement," "Reevaluation," and "Distraction." Children with ADHD also reported seeking social support less frequently than the controls. Moreover, significant negative correlations were found between adaptive coping and co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems. Conclusions: Children with and without ADHD specifically differ in their application of problem-oriented emotion-regulation strategies, especially those ADHD children suffer from co-occurring problems who particularly infrequently apply adaptive emotion regulation strategies.

AB The current study examined specific emotional, behavioral, and cognitive variables that may distinguish obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SoP), and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in youth. Youth with OCD (n = 26) and other anxiety disorders (ADs; n = 31), aged 7-12 years (56.1% males), and their parents participated. The study compared the two anxious groups on levels of emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning, as well as impairment associated with the disorder. Results indicated that in comparison to youth with GAD, SoP, or SAD, youth with OCD were found to have poorer emotion regulation skills, as well as greater oppositionality, cognitive problems/inattention, and parent impairment associated with the disorder. The findings suggest that there are unique characteristics of OCD that may differentiate this disorder from other ADs in youth. Potential clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB The purpose of the present study was to determine the relations among negative life events, social support, coping and anxiety symptoms in 709 Caucasian and African-American youth between 11 and 14 years of age. Results indicated that more negative life events, less social support, more coping efforts, and African-American status were related to more anxiety symptoms. Additionally, although active coping moderated the relationship between negative life events and anxiety, these relations were qualified in separate analyses for the African-American and Caucasian youth. Negative life events were related to anxiety symptoms only for the African-American participants. When these findings were explored further for males and females of each racial group, negative life events remained significant for African-American males but not African-American females. Implications of these findings are examined and future directions for research to understand the processes underlying these relations with both Caucasian and African-American youth are addressed.

AB The present study examined predictors of treatment outcome among children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-five participants (8-13 years) participated in a 12-session cognitive behavioral group treatment (CBT). Potential predictors were the pre-treatment severity of anxious symptoms assessed from both the child's and parent's perspective as well as depressive symptoms (child report only) and general emotional distress in parent (parent self-report). Furthermore, the relationship between treatment outcome and child's self-reported pre-post changes in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation was investigated. Pre-treatment level of social anxiety reported by the child was a significant predictor for outcome, i.e. children with higher levels of social anxiety at pretreatment reported a greater reduction in social anxiety at post-treatment. Reduction in self-consciousness and maladaptive anxiety regulation both predicted reduction in social anxiety, although not independently. The results suggest that tailoring intervention to include strategies for emotion regulation of anxiety may improve treatment outcome. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives This study utilized e-diaries to evaluate whether components of emotion regulation predict daily pain and function in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods 43 children ages 8-17 years and their caregivers provided baseline reports of child emotion regulation. Children then completed thrice daily e-diary assessments of emotion, pain, and activity involvement for 28 days. E-diary ratings of negative and positive emotions were used to calculate emotion variability and to infer adaptive emotion modulation following periods of high or low emotion intensity. Hierarchical linear models were used to evaluate how emotion regulation related to pain and function. Results The attenuation of negative emotion following a period of high negative emotion predicted reduced pain; greater variability of negative emotion predicted higher pain and increased activity limitation. Indices of positive emotion regulation also significantly predicted pain. Conclusions Components of emotion regulation as captured by e-diaries predict important health outcomes in children with JIA.

AB Muscle dysmorphia is a recently identified psychiatric condition, whose relationship to the eating disorders remains unclear. This case describes an adolescent male who met diagnostic criteria for both an eating disorder not otherwise specified and muscle dysmorphia, allowing the first examination of read muscle dysmorphia presentations. This case suggests that muscle dysmorphia may present inclusive of episodes of binge eating and purging in addition to compulsive exercise, which may serve an emotional regulation function. We suggest that the assessment of muscle dysmorphia include a comprehensive assessment of all eating disorder features including bulimic symptoms, and that treatment address these features. Clinical implications for the conceptualization of muscle dysmorphia are discussed. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

AB School is a rich environment for cultivating academic skills, but also for developing metacognitive skills such as executive functioning and emotional regulation. However, the hours students spend in school are often guided by familiar practices rather than contemporary findings about how the brain best learns and grows. This article describes biological conditions favorable to brain development, psychological skills associated with effective school functioning, and school practices associated with academic and interpersonal success. The aim is that schooling might be shaped with regard to children's and adolescents' brain development needs rather than social custom.

AB The present study develops and validates a Turkish adaptation of the coping scales from the German Stress and Coping Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (SSKJ 3-8; Lohaus, Eschenbeck, Kohlmann, & Klein-Hessling, 2006). In a Turkish sample of 473 children and adolescents from grades 4 to 8 (220 girls, 253 boys, age range: 9-15 years), the factor structure of the original German version was confirmed for the six subscales: seeking social support, problem solving, avoidant coping, palliative emotion regulation, anger-related emotion regulation, and media use. All six subscales showed good internal consistency. Correlations between these subscales and indicators of psychological adjustment as well as replication of gender differences for the subscales also demonstrated high correspondence between the original German version of the SSKJ 3-8 coping scales and the Turkish adaptation.

AB Both theory and empirical evidence support possible associations between two candidate genetic polymorphisms (SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR l/s and COMT Val(158)Met -rs4680 variants) and emotion-regulation difficulties. One particular form of emotion-regulation difficulty, distress intolerance, has been measured using a behavioral assessment in youth; data indicate a relationship with poor psychological functioning. No prior study has investigated genetic influences on emotion-regulation difficulties in youth. As part of a larger longitudinal study on adolescent risk behaviors, 218 10-14 year-old youths from the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area completed a measure of distress intolerance, the Behavioral Indicator of Resilience to Distress (BIRD), and provided saliva samples for DNA extraction and geno-typing. Results indicate that those with one or two copies of the s allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were more likely to perform poorly on the task (i.e., choose to quit) than were those homozygous for the I allele. Participants who were Val allele carriers of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism were also more likely to quit the task compared to Met homozygotes. A summative risk allele score was created to combine the two polymorphisms, and each risk allele was associated with a 1.75 fold increased likelihood of quitting the task. Exploratory analyses revealed that emotional abuse moderated the relationship between the 5-HTTLPR and BIRD performance, as well as the genetic risk allele and the BIRD. This is the first investigation of genetic predictors of a behavioral measure of tolerance to distress. Results suggest that distress tolerance is at least partially regulated by specific genetic variants. Implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Excessive anxiety is associated with impairments in academic achievement. However, not all children with elevated anxiety share an equal risk for academic difficulty. The current study investigated whether individual differences in emotional self-efficacy - confidence in one's ability to regulate negative emotions - protected against anxiety-related impairments in a standardized math exam in a sample of elementary school youth (N=139). Results indicated that anxiety negatively predicted math test performance only for children with low levels of emotional self-efficacy. Students reporting high levels of emotional self-efficacy did not show anxiety-related decrements on the test performance. Emotional self-efficacy appears useful in managing negative effects of anxiety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The way that parents express their emotions during interactions with their adolescent children is important for adolescent adjustment, and predicts adolescent emotional problems such as depression. In the current study, we assessed whether adolescent depressive symptoms were associated with neural activity during exposure to their mother's affective behavior. Thirty adolescents (18 females, mean age 17.35, s.d. 0.43) participated in an fMRI task that used digitized video segments of their own mother's, as well as an unfamiliar mother's affective behavior as stimuli. Exposure to one's own (compared to an unfamiliar) mother's positive (compared to neutral) behavior was associated with activation in the anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, exposure to positive behavior across own and an unfamiliar mother (controlling for neutral behavior) was associated with superior temporal sulcus, occipital pole, amygdala and striatum activity. Adolescent depressive symptoms were associated with reduced rostral anterior cingulate activity during exposure to one's own (compared to an unfamiliar) mother's positive behavior, and reduced striatal activity during exposure to positive behavior in general. This study represents an important step in furthering our understanding of the neural basis of affective processing in adolescents. Further, the results support a disruption of reward function in depression.

We hypothesized that peer interaction reduces the activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is required for self-regulation of reward-driven behavior. We also expected that mPFC activity would be reduced more in those with greater surgency, a composite trait of behavioral approach, sensation seeking and positive affect. In our study, 20 15-year-old boys played a simulated driving video game alone and in the presence of peers who were encouraged to call out advice while we recorded the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related potential in response to an impending car crash. FRN amplitude was reduced both as a function of peer presence and increased surgency. More importantly, we also calculated intracerebral current source density at the time of the FRNs, and found that both greater surgency and peer presence are associated with reduced activity specifically in the mPFC. Riskier performance resulting in more car crashes resulted from the presence of peers only as an interaction with surgency, this interaction being related strongly to reduced activity in the ventromedial PFC.

AB The quality of parenting children receive has a major influence on their development, well-being, and life opportunities. Of all the potentially modifiable influences that can be targeted through preventive interventions, none are more important than the quality of parenting children experience. Prevention interventions targeting parenting should be widely used to promote positive developmental outcomes for children and adolescents. This review argues that the development of comprehensive evidence-based strategies to improve the quality of parenting is best viewed as a major public health challenge. Using the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program as an exemplar, the initial development, gradual transformation into a public health model, and then global dissemination of the approach is described. The assumptions underpinning the public health approach to parenting support are discussed, along with key criteria that need to be met for the approach to work. Factors that facilitate and impede the global implementation and dissemination of evidence-based parenting programs are considered along with implications for future research, policy, and practice.

Participants were 214 undergraduates who currently engaged in NSSI, had a past history of, or never engaged in NSSI. Individuals with a current or past history of NSSI reported significantly more intense emotional experiences, more difficulty identifying their feelings, less access to emotion regulation skills, and significantly greater avoidance than individuals who never engaged in NSSI; additionally, individuals with a past NSSI history reported significantly greater acceptance of their emotional responses and significantly greater impulse control than individuals currently engaging in NSSI. The research and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Thats why divorce invites intensive attention. The fundamentals question is how divorce influences the health and prosperity of children. Metanalysis of divorce studies find the children from divorced families experiences more frequent behavioral and adjustment problems. Most striking is the after divorce conditions and the way the children and parents challenge them vary to a great extend. The serious negative factor is the after divorce conflict. Child reaction to divorce and post divorce conflict depends on their age. Serious emotional problems have 20 to 26 percent of children in comparison to 10 percent of children form intact families.

DE brief psychoanalytic psychotherapy; outcome study; parental states of

AB This article describes a study that was designed to examine the impact of brief psychoanalytic psychotherapy with children under-five years of age and their families. The work took place in a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in England, to which children are routinely referred with a range of behavioural and emotional problems. The study examined the hypothesis that through formulating the emotional forces that underpin the family's here-and-now experiences and bringing into the frame the child's perspective, a shift in the parents' states of mind from being less reactive and more reflective would be observed. Further, the less reactive parental state would result in the child feeling more contained, and impact positively in relation to symptom presentation. Using clinical description and quantitative data drawn from the videotaped clinical material the hypothesis was tested on seven families. The prediction was borne out, significantly so in relation to the parents being less blaming and more reparative in their comments. Parental reports also highlighted that six of the seven children exhibited a significant reduction / termination of symptoms for which they had been originally referred. The therapeutic process underlying these results is considered.

AB Background: This study investigated the relationship between parental personality patterns and internalising and externalising behaviour problems in a clinically referred sample of children (aged 48) and adolescents (aged 1218).
   Methods: Data from families involved in two clinical trials in Victoria, Australia were analysed (n = 59). Families were administered the Millons Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII (MCMI-III) which reports personality patterns consistent with Axis II disorder and an Achenbach measure of mental health as appropriate to child's age (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Youth Self-Report (YSR), or Adult Self-Report (ASR)). Relationships between internalising and externalising behaviour problems, and parental personality patterns were examined via correlation and regression analyses.
   Results: The study found a positive correlation between parental borderline, paranoid, and avoidant personality patterns, and child and adolescent externalising behaviour problems. The relationships were generally stronger for adolescents than for children. However, no relationship was observed between parental personality patterns and internalising behaviour problems.
   Conclusions: These findings underline the importance of clinical assessment of the family ecology as a wholeincluding the interaction between parental personality patterns and child and adolescent behaviour and emotional problems. These findings contribute to the understanding of developmental risk factors for child and adolescent mental health and the transmission of psychopathology across generations.

AB Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has been proposed as an effective treatment for eating disorders (EDs). We conducted a systematic literature review to locate refereed journal articles testing DBT for the treatment of EDs. We identified 13 studies empirically evaluating treatment efficacy across various settings. Findings, based on mostly uncontrolled trials, indicate that DBT treatments appear effective in addressing ED behaviors and other forms of psychopathology in ED samples. The expectation that improvements in emotion regulation capabilities drive reductions in ED pathology was not fully supported. Further research is necessary to confirm the efficacy of modified DBT treatments for EDs.

AB The purpose of this study was to increase our knowledge regarding the role that emotional functioning can play in the genesis of bullying and victimization at school for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, we examined the unique associations of basic emotions (anger and fear) and moral emotions (shame and guilt) with bullying and victimization in children with an ASD and a control group with typically developing (TD) children. The study included 130 children and young adolescents (64 with ASD, 66 TD, M-age 140 months), who filled out self-report questionnaires. The main findings showed that in both groups less guilt and more anger were associated with more bullying. More fear was associated with more victimization in TD children only. Yet, more anger was also strongly and uniquely associated with more victimization in children with ASD, but not in TD children. These outcomes support the idea that lack of guilt is a pivotal antecedent of bullying for TD and ASD children. However, unlike TD children, the dysregulation of anger seems to play an important role in victimization as well as bullying in children with ASD.

AB Affective and cognitive empathy are traditionally differentiated, the affective component being concerned with resonating with another's emotional state, whereas the cognitive component reflects regulation of the resulting distress and understanding of another's mental states (see Decety and Jackson, 2004 for a review). Adolescence is a critical period for the development of cognitive control processes necessary to regulate affective processes: it is only in young adulthood that these control processes achieve maturity (Steinberg,).Thus, one should expect adolescents to show greater automatic empathy than young adults. The present study aimed at exploring the neural correlates of affective (automatic) and cognitive empathy for pain from adolescence to young adulthood. With this aim, Event Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 32 participants (aged 11-39) in a task designed to dissociate these components. ERPs results showed an early automatic fronto-central response to pain (that was not modulated by task demand) and a late parietal response to painful stimuli modulated by attention to pain cues. Adolescents exhibited earlier automatic responses to painful situations than young adults did and showed greater activity in the late cognitive component even when viewing neutral stimuli. Results are discussed in the context of the development of regulatory abilities during adolescence.

AB Objectives: To examine global psychophysical health of the children of preschool and school age in single-parent families, as well as to determine the connection between particular components of children's health with the characteristics of family relations.
   Methods: Research sample consisted of mothers (248) from Novi Sad. The data were collected using a modified version of the CHQ/Child Health Questionnaire, as well as the The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale. In data processing, we have used descriptive statistical methods, discriminant analysis, Pearson correlation and factor analysis.
   Results: Psychosocial and physical health of children in single-parent families is estimated as globally poorer in relation to the children from two-parent families, and differences are reflected in the following variables: psychosocial health self-esteem, mental health, social role limitations (emotional problems), problems in behaviour and learning; physical health presence of chronic health problems. Through research, multiple connectedness of family relations and dimensions of psychosocial and physical health of a child is also determined.
   Conclusions: Implication of labour refers to the determination of new social and health measures in order to provide developmentally optimal conditions for adequate functioning of families with one parent.

AB Although it has been well-documented that parents and children who experience homelessness often have compromised health and well-being, few studies have examined the potential implications of homelessness on the process of parenting young children. In this review, we consider how parents of young children might function under the circumstances of homelessness. We begin with a brief overview of the psychological, social, and medical characteristics of homeless mothers and their young children. Using a developmental attachment perspective, we next briefly review the central tasks of parenting during the first 5 years of life, including emotion regulation and fostering of child autonomy, with an eye toward how homelessness may compromise a mother's ability to complete these tasks. Finally, we provide suggestions for further research that incorporate a developmental attachment perspective and other relevant viewpoints. Because of the paucity of research in this area, our review seeks to provide a heuristic framework for future research, intervention development, and policy.

AB Self-inflicted injury (SII) in adolescence marks heightened risk for suicide attempts, completed suicide, and adult psychopathology. Although several studies have revealed elevated rates of depression among adolescents who self injure, no one has compared adolescent self injury with adolescent depression on biological, self-, and informant-report markers of vulnerability and risk. Such a comparison may have important implications for treatment, prevention, and developmental models of self injury and borderline personality disorder. We used a multi-method, multi-informant approach to examine how adolescent SII differs from adolescent depression. Self-injuring, depressed, and typical adolescent females (n = 25 per group) and their mothers completed measures of psychopathology and emotion regulation, among others. In addition, we assessed electrodermal responding (EDR), a peripheral biomarker of trait impulsivity. Participants in the SII group (a) scored higher than depressed adolescents on measures of both externalizing psychopathology and emotion dysregulation, and (b) exhibited attenuated EDR, similar to patterns observed among impulsive, externalizing males. Self-injuring adolescents also scored higher on measures of borderline pathology. These findings reveal a coherent pattern of differences between self-injuring and depressed adolescent girls, consistent with theories that SII differs from depression in etiology and developmental course.

AB This study investigated the prospective, longitudinal relations between parental behaviors observed during parent-adolescent interactions, and the development of depression and anxiety symptoms in a community-based sample of 194 adolescents. Positive and negative parental behaviors were examined, with negative behaviors operationalized to distinguish between observed parental expressions of aggression and dysphoria. Results showed that higher levels of parental aggression prospectively predicted higher levels of both depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents over two-and-a-half years, whereas higher levels of positive parental behaviors prospectively predicted lower levels of depression symptoms only. Parental dysphoric behavior was not related to changes in either symptom dimension. These results suggest that patterns of parental behaviors may be differentially associated with depressive versus anxious outcomes in adolescents, and highlight the potential role for family-focused prevention or treatment interventions aimed at reducing an escalation of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence.

AB The current study compares the effects of experimentally induced rumination, positive reappraisal, distancing, and acceptance on affect states in adolescents aged 13-18. Participants (N = 160) were instructed to think about a recent stressful event. Next, they received specific instructions on how to think about that event in each condition. Manipulation checks revealed that the manipulations were successful, except for acceptance. The two most reported events were "a fight" and "death of loved one". Results showed that positive reappraisal (i.e., thinking about the benefits and personal growth) caused a significantly larger increase in positive affect and decrease in negative affect compared to rumination, distancing, and acceptance. Current findings implicate that positive reappraisal seems an adequate coping strategy in the short-term, and therefore could be applied in interventions for youth experiencing difficulties managing negative affect. Future research should focus on long-term effects of these cognitive strategies and on more intensive training of acceptance.

   DELINQUENCY; GENERATIONS
AB The coincidence of historical trends in youth antisocial behavior and change in family demographics has led to speculation of a causal link, possibly mediated by declining quality of parenting and parent-child relationships. No study to date has directly assessed whether and how parenting and parent-child relationships have changed. Two national samples of English adolescents aged 16-17 years in 1986 (N = 4,524 adolescents, 7,120 parents) and 2006 (N = 716 adolescents, 734 parents) were compared using identical questionnaire assessments. Youth-reported parental monitoring, expectations, and parent-child quality time increased between 1986 and 2006. Ratings of parental interest did not change. Parenting differences between affluent and disadvantaged families narrowed over time. There was thus little evidence of a decline in quality of parenting for the population as a whole or for disadvantaged subgroups. Parent-reported youth conduct problems showed a modest increase between 1986 and 2006. Findings suggested that the increase in youth conduct problems was largely unrelated to observed change in parent-child relationships.

AB Varied presentations of emotion dysregulation in autism complicate diagnostic decision making and may lead to inaccurate psychiatric diagnoses or delayed autism diagnosis for high-functioning children. This pilot study aimed to determine the concordance between prior psychiatric diagnoses and the results of an autism-specific psychiatric interview in adolescents with high-functioning autism. Participants included 35 predominantly Caucasian and male verbal 10- to 17-year-olds with a confirmed autism spectrum disorder and without intellectual disability. The average age of autism spectrum diagnosis was 11 years old. Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were established via the Autism Comorbidity Interview, developed to identify comorbid conditions within the context of autism. Autism Comorbidity Interview results were compared to parent report of prior community psychiatric diagnoses. Approximately 60% of prior psychiatric diagnoses were not supported on the Autism Comorbidity Interview; the lowest diagnostic concordance was for prior bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnoses. Although 51% of children met Autism Comorbidity Interview criteria for at least one psychiatric disorder, rates of prior diagnoses were much higher, with 77% having at least one prior psychiatric diagnosis and 60% having two or more. Although many participants met criteria for comorbid psychiatric disorders, the majority of previous psychiatric diagnoses were not supported when autism-related manifestations were systematically taken into account. These findings require replication and may not generalize to lower functioning and earlier diagnosed children with autism spectrum disorder. Results emphasize the importance of increasing awareness of the manifestations of high-functioning autism in order to improve accuracy of diagnosis and appropriateness of interventions.

AB Background Early and persistent exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage impairs children's health and wellbeing. However, it is unclear at what age health inequalities emerge or whether these relationships vary across ages and outcomes. We address these issues using cross-sectional Australian population data on the physical and developmental health of children at ages 0-1, 2-3, 4-5 and 6-7 years.
   Methods 10 physical and developmental health outcomes were assessed in 2004 and 2006 for two cohorts each comprising around 5000 children. Socioeconomic position was measured as a composite of parental education, occupation and household income.
   Results Lower socioeconomic position was associated with increased odds for poor outcomes. For physical health outcomes and socio-emotional competence, associations were similar across age groups and were consistent with either threshold effects (for poor general health, special healthcare needs and socio-emotional competence) or gradient effects (for illness with wheeze, sleep problems and injury). For socio-emotional difficulties, communication, vocabulary and emergent literacy, stronger socioeconomic associations were observed. The patterns were linear or accelerated and varied across ages.
   Conclusions From very early childhood, social disadvantage was associated with poorer outcomes across most measures of physical and developmental health and showed no evidence of either strengthening or attenuating at older compared to younger ages. Findings confirm the importance of early childhood as a key focus for health promotion and prevention efforts.

AB The authors compared parent-related perceptions by hospitalized adolescents (i.e., who were admitted to a specialized psychiatric unit; n = 50) and delinquent adolescents (i.e., who were placed at a juvenile treatment institution; n = 51) with adolescents from the general population (n = 51). All adolescents completed a broad set of measures of attachment, perceived parenting, and separation-individuation. Contrary to initial expectations, hospitalized adolescents scored higher than controls on indices of excessive autonomy. Ambivalence regarding issues of interpersonal closeness and distance was found among delinquent adolescents. In addition, hospitalized and delinquent adolescents were found to be struggling, each in their specific way, with attachment-related experiences of trauma. Finally, delinquent adolescents also showed a stage-appropriate form of potentially adaptive narcissism. These findings add to the growing consensus in the literature that associations between adolescent psychopathology and parent-related perceptions are typically complex and somewhat counterintuitive.

AB Alterations in emotion regulation processes may form the basis of psychopathologies. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system, composed of endogenous ligands, the enzymatic machinery in charge of their metabolism and the specific metabotropic receptors, has emerged as a major neuromodulatory system critically involved in the control of emotional homeostasis and stress responsiveness. Data from animal models indicate that the eCB system plays a key role in brain development, and is probably involved in the control of emotional states from early developmental stages. The present review summarizes the latest information on the role of the eCB system in emotionality and anxiety-related disorders throughout the lifespan. Putative therapeutic strategies based on the pharmacological modulation of this system will be discussed. Given the fact that the pharmacological modulation of the eCB system has recently arisen as a promising strategy in the management of anxiety and mood disorders, the potential efficacy of this pharmacological approach (i.e. blockers of the catabolic pathway) will be discussed, as well as pharmacological alternatives such as modulators of cannabinoid receptors other than the classical CB1 receptor, or administration of other plant-derived compounds (e.g. cannabidiol).

AB Background: We evaluated the opinions of parents in The Netherlands concerning treatment of their children with growth hormone, and examined beliefs and perceptions about treatment and quality of health care communication and support.
   Methods: An Internet survey was completed by 69 parents who had children prescribed growth hormone and were part of the Patient Intelligence Panel. Acceptance of the diagnosis and treatment was investigated with reference to four topics, ie, search and quality of information, involvement in decision-making process, operational aspects, and emotional problems and support.
   Results: Among the parents surveyed, 48% reported a lack of freedom to choose the type of growth hormone device that best suited their needs, 92% believed that their children (and they themselves) would benefit if the children self-administered growth hormone, and 65% believed training to support self-administration would be helpful. According to 79%, the availability of support from another parent with experience of treating their own child with growth hormone, alongside their doctor, would be valuable. Thirty-seven percent of the parents indicated that their children felt anxious about administration of growth hormone, and 83% of parents would appreciate psychological support to overcome their anxiety. An increase in reluctance to receive treatment with growth hormone was observed by 40% of parents after the children reached puberty, and 57% of these parents would appreciate psychological support to overcome this reluctance.
   Conclusion: Understanding how growth hormone treatments and their implications are perceived by parents is a first step towards addressing quality of growth hormone treatment, which may be instrumental in improving adherence. The data show a need for support and involvement of parents in the process of choosing a growth hormone device. This decision-making process may be instrumental in improving acceptance and diminishing emotional problems for children using growth hormone.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether obesity in adolescence is related to the quality of the early maternal-child relationship.
   METHODS: We analyzed data from 977 of 1364 participants in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Child attachment security and maternal sensitivity were assessed by observing mother-child interaction at 15, 24, and 36 months of age. A maternal-child relationship quality score was constructed as the number of times across the 3 ages that the child was either insecurely attached or experienced low maternal sensitivity. Adolescent obesity was defined as a measured BMI >= 95th percentile at age 15 years.
   RESULTS: Poor-quality maternal-child relationships (score: >= 3) were experienced by 24.7% of children compared with 22.0% who, at all 3 ages, were neither insecurely attached nor exposed to low maternal sensitivity (score: 0). The prevalence of adolescent obesity was 26.1%, 15.5%, 12.1%, and 13.0% for those with risk scores of >= 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively. After adjustment for gender and birth weight, the odds (95% confidence interval) of adolescent obesity was 2.45 (1.49-4.04) times higher in those with the poorest quality early maternal-child relationships (score: >= 3) compared with those with the highest quality (score: 0). Low maternal sensitivity was more strongly associated with obesity than insecure attachment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Poor quality of the early maternal-child relationship was associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent obesity. Interventions aimed at improving the quality of maternal-child interactions should consider assessing effects on children's weight and examining potential mechanisms involving stress response and emotion regulation.

AB Research with siblings of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) suggests that they may be at increased risk for behavioural and emotional problems and relatively poor sibling relationships. This study investigated a diathesis-stress model, whereby the presence of Broad Autism Phenotype features in the typically developing siblings might interact with family-environmental risk variables to predict sibling functioning (5-17 years of age) of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), their child with an ASD, and their own psychological well-being. Sibling adjustment was associated with the extent of behaviour problems in the child with an ASD and with the extent of the sibling's Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) features. Sibling relationships were more negative when the child with an ASD had more behaviour problems and when there was evidence of critical expressed emotion in the family environment. Siblings with more BAP features, who had brothers/sisters with an ASD and a greater number of behaviour problems, had more behaviour problems themselves. Siblings with more BAP features who had parents with mental health problems reported more sibling relationship conflict. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mobius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. Some studies suggest that psychosocial and psychiatric problems might be increased among affected persons. So far, there have been no studies on the self-perception of children and adolescents with the sequence. Seventeen participants with Mobius sequence (9 male, 8 female) aged 9-15 (mean: 11.59) years were studied. None of the probands was mentally retarded or had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Participants filled out well standardized German questionnaires on depression (Depressionsinventar fur Kinder und Jugendliche [DIKJ]), anxiety (Angstfragebogen fur Schuler [AFS]) and personality aspects (Personlichkeitsfragebogen fur Kinder von 9-14 Jahren [PFK 9-14]). Additionally, their primary caregivers were asked to complete a special questionnaire to compile the probands' personal, somatic and psychosocial history as well as the German version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Parent Form [SDQ-Deu]. According to the participants' self-perception only one girl scored clinical (t-score >= 63) for manifest anxiety [AFS] and depression [DIKJ] (5.9% vs. 10% in the general population). Moreover, the whole sample reported significantly lower test anxiety (p = 0.000) and manifest anxiety (p = 0.005) [AFS] whereas general anxiety as a personality aspect [PFK 9-14] did not differ from the normative sample. Compared to normative data, subjects expressed significantly less depression (p = 0.023) and impulsivity (p = 0.042). One out of 17 subjects was rated abnormal for total problems on the SDQ-Deu (5.9% vs. 10% of the normative sample), five participants scored abnormal for social problems (29.4%) and three for emotional problems (17.6%). Social problems correlated significantly with the probands' age (rho = 0.707; p = 0.002). As Mobius patients have severe difficulties with facial expression of feelings, and others might therefore falsely recognize them as serious or even depressed, the subjects' self-perception is crucial for assessment and diagnosis, especially if it differs considerably from that of the primary caregivers.

AB Emotion processing deficits are prominent in schizophrenia and exist prior to the onset of overt psychosis. However, developmental trajectories of neural circuitry subserving emotion regulation and the role that they may play in illness onset have not yet been examined in patients at risk for psychosis. The present study employed a cross-sectional analysis to examine age-related functional activation in amygdala and prefrontal cortex, as well as functional connectivity between these regions, in adolescents at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis relative to typically developing adolescents. Participants (n=34) performed an emotion processing fMRI task, including emotion labeling, emotion matching, and non-emotional control conditions. Regression analyses were used to predict activation in the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) based on age, group, sex, and the interaction of age by group. CHR adolescents exhibited altered age-related variation in amygdala and vlPFC activation, relative to controls. Controls displayed decreased amygdala and increased vlPFC activation with age, while patients exhibited the opposite pattern (increased amygdala and decreased vlPFC activation), suggesting a failure of prefrontal cortex to regulate amygdala reactivity. Moreover, a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed decreased amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity among CHR adolescents, consistent with disrupted brain connectivity as a vulnerability factor in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the at-risk syndrome is marked by abnormal development and functional connectivity of neural systems subserving emotion regulation. Longitudinal data are needed to confirm aberrant developmental trajectories intra-individually and to examine whether these abnormalities are predictive of conversion to psychosis, and of later deficits in socioemotional functioning.

AB The ability to use cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is an adaptive skill in adulthood, but little is known about its development. Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely affect adolescents. We compared older children (10-13), adolescents (14-17) and young adults (18-22) on a task that distinguishes negative emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally, we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with reappraisal instructions.

AB Objective: To examine changes in behavioral and emotional problems among opioid-dependent adolescents during a 4-week combined behavioral and pharmacological treatment.
   Methods: We examined scales of behavioral and emotional problems in youth using the Youth Self-Report measure at the time of substance abuse treatment intake and changes in scale scores during treatment participants were 36 adolescents (aged 13-18 years, eligible) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for opioid dependence. Participants received a 28-day outpatient, medication-assisted withdrawal with either buprenorphine, or clonidine, as part of a double-blind, double dummy comparison of these medications. All participants received a common behavioral intervention, composed of 3 individual counseling sessions per week, and incentives contingent on opioid-negative urine samples (collected 3 times/week) attendance and completion of weekly assessments.
   Results: Although a markedly greater number of youth who received buprenorphine remained in treatment relative to those who received clonidine, youth who remained in treatment showed significant reductions during treatment on 2 Youth Self-Report grouping scales (internalizing problems and total problems) and 4 of the empirically based syndrome scales (somatic, social, attention, and thought). On Youth Self-Report competence and adaptive scales, no significant changes were observed. There was no evidence that changes in any scales differed across medication condition.
   Conclusions: Youth who were retained demonstrated substantive improvements in a number of clinically meaningful behavioral and emotional problems, irrespective of pharmacotherapy provided to them.

AB We investigated age differences in instability, contingency, and level of self-esteem from age 13 to 72 years, using data from 1386 individuals who participated in a diary study over 25 days. Instability and contingency of self-esteem decreased from adolescence to old age, whereas level of self-esteem increased. Big Five personality traits predicted the level, but not the slope, of the trajectories of self-esteem characteristics. Age differences in self-esteem characteristics did not merely reflect age differences in instability and level of positive and negative affect. Finally, self-esteem characteristics showed a stable pattern of interrelations across the life span. Overall, the findings suggest that people's self-esteem tends to become better adjusted-i.e., more stable, less contingent, and higher across the life course. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Evidence supporting outpatient treatments for anorexia nervosa (AN) is severely lacking, due to low retention and poor outcome. One explanation for drop-out is weak treatment alliances. A single-case experimental analysis accompanied by in-depth qualitative description is presented for Ms. O, who received a novel treatment for AN called Alliance Focused Treatment (AFT) that attends to ruptures in the alliance, interpersonal difficulties and emotional avoidance. At intake Ms. O met diagnostic criteria for AN, Major Depressive Disorder, and Social Phobia. She was characterized as having symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive, Avoidant, and Depressive personality disorders. Treatment began with a Baseline followed by the experimental (AFT) and comparison treatments (Behavioral Change Treatment [BCT]) using a replicated experimental single-case phase change design. Graphs of slopes of kilocalorie and alliance change facilitated observation of treatment effects. Ms. O participated in 16 sessions of AFT and 8 sessions of BCT with specific benefits. Ratings of the treatment alliance were consistently high and she evidenced significant changes in weight, quality of life, and personality pathology. Associations between rupture/repair episodes and kilocalorie increases were observed. The utility of the treatment relationship in facilitating emotional expression was evident. At posttreatment, Ms. O endorsed cognitive AN symptoms, although these were not explicitly treated. This study provides preliminary support for the feasibility and effect of AFT and BCT, and highlights the importance of the alliance in treating adults with AN. Further research on emotion regulation in AN and its effect on the treatment relationship are needed.

AB Aim: To explore psychosocial health in children and adolescents surviving cancer three years after diagnosis compared with healthy controls, as assessed by adolescents themselves, their parents and teacher.
   Material and methods: Case-control study included 50 children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer between 1 January 1993 and 1 January 2003 and treated at the Paediatric Department St. Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. Data were collected using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (self-report, parent report and teacher report), as well as the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment questionnaire (teacher report).
   Results: Children surviving cancer had more emotional symptoms, higher total problem scores and poorer academic performance than their peers. Emotional problems were consistently reported by parents, teachers and adolescents themselves, in particular in children with brain tumours and among survivors with late effects.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that children surviving cancer are at higher risk for emotional problems when compared with their friends, even after several years following diagnosis and treatment. We conclude that when planning long-term follow-up care, rehabilitation of children and adolescents with cancer, especially for survivors with brain tumours and late effects, should particularly take into account their psychological problems and psychosocial functioning.

AB Aims. To determine the prevalence of psychosocial problems among Dutch children aged 8-12 years and studying its association with risk factors and quality of life.
   Methods. This study was conducted within the framework of a community-based health study in the north-west region of the Netherlands. The cross-sectional study sample consisted of 2703 children (1392 boys and 1311 girls). Psychosocial problems and quality of life were measured with the extended version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and KIDSCREEN-10, respectively. Questionnaires and data about risk factors (parental education level, ethnicity, family structure, income, chronic diseases and life events) were completed by the parents or caregivers.
   Results. The prevalence of psychosocial problems (SDQ score >= 14) in the total sample was 10.4%. The prevalence was higher in boys compared with girls (13.9% nu. 6.6%, OR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.75-2.97). Boys had significantly more hyperactivity/inattention, conduct, peer relationship and prosocial behaviour problems compared with girls. Risk factors associated with psychosocial problems were: one or more chronic disease(s), life event(s), a low parental educational level (for boys only) and an income under a modal level. Psychosocial problems were significantly inverse related with quality of life in the total sample (rho = -0.47).
   Conclusions. Psychosocial problems are common in children, especially among boys, and are inversely related with children's quality of life. The identified risk factors in this study can be useful for developing targeted prevention strategies aimed at children at high risk for psychosocial problems.

AB Objectives: To assess the perception of the quality of life of adolescents and young adults with congenital heart disease and to examine the variables that have a negative impact on it and that add a resilience effect. Methods: A total of 22 male and 18 female patients, aged 12-26 years, of whom 27 were admitted to surgery and 13 were not, participated in this study. All patients had complete medical records and were interviewed once; demographic and clinical data were collected, and patients filled a questionnaire on quality of life, the WHOQOL-BREF, and underwent an interview on social support, educational style, self-image, functional limitations, and emotional adjustment. Results/Conclusions: Our patients showed a better perception of quality of life than did the general population, on the basis of psychological, social relationship and environment scales. Older patients hold a better perception of quality of life on the psychological scale. Cyanosis did not show any significant impact over perception of quality of life decay; however, the number of surgical procedures and the persistence of moderate-to-severe residual injuries had considerable detrimental effect. Social support had an impact on increasing resilience, promoting adjustment to illness. Several factors may play a role in adjustment to congenital heart disease, either improving the perception of quality of life or worsening it. We may conclude that some buffer variables on congenital heart disease may play roles in increasing the perception of quality of life of patients during their lifetime, social support probably explaining why the perception of quality of life is better than in the normal population. The number of surgeries and the moderate-to-severe residual injuries, however, reverted that effect.

AB Objective: To study the relationship between self-reported exposure to childhood maltreatment (CM) and cerebral gray matter (GM) morphology in adolescents without psychiatric diagnoses.
   Design: Associations were examined between regional GM morphology and exposure to CM (measured using a childhood trauma self-report questionnaire for physical, emotional, and sexual abuse and for physical and emotional neglect).
   Setting: University hospital.
   Participants: Forty-two adolescents without psychiatric diagnoses.
   Main Outcome Measures: Correlations between childhood trauma self-report questionnaire scores and regional GM volume were assessed in voxel-based analyses of structural magnetic resonance images. Relationships among GM volume, subtypes of exposure to CM, and sex were explored.
   Results: Childhood trauma self-report questionnaire total scores correlated negatively (P<.005) with GM volume in prefrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala, sensory association cortices, and cerebellum. Physical abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect were associated with rostral prefrontal reductions. Decreases in dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices, insula, and ventral striatum were associated with physical abuse. Decreases in cerebellum were associated with physical neglect. Decreases in dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, and subgenual prefrontal cortices, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum were associated with emotional neglect. Decreases in the latter emotion regulation regions were also associated with childhood trauma self-report questionnaire scores in girls, while caudate reductions (which may relate to impulse dyscontrol) were seen in boys.
   Conclusions: Exposure to CM was associated with corticostriatal-limbic GM reductions in adolescents. Even if adolescents reporting exposure to CM do not present with symptoms that meet full criteria for psychiatric disorders, they may have corticostriatal-limbic GM morphologic alterations that place them at risk for behavioral difficulties. Vulnerabilities may be moderated by sex and by subtypes of exposure to CM.

AB Although emotion regulation deficits have been frequently implicated in the incidence of nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI), no research to date has examined in vivo change of affect associated with real-world NSSI behavior. The present study employed Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to assess change in affect associated with episodes of experienced NSSI in a sample of 36 college students with a self-reported history of NSSI. Results indicated that individuals who reported NSSI behavior over the course of the study experienced increases in negative affect prior to an episode of NSSI that peaked during the episode and faded gradually in the hours following the episode, with affect change roughly approximating a quadratic curve. These changes in affect were detected only at times in which individuals engaged in NSSI and were absent for individuals who did not report NSSI over the course of the study. Moreover, changes in negative affect associated with NSSI were, on average, detectable hours prior to the NSSI event. These findings suggest that episodes of NSSI may be predicted through a careful examination of affect change long before actual NSSI behavior occurs.

AB Anxiety and depressive disorders may pose a long-term, deleterious impact on youth, prompting a need for early and effective prevention of such concerns. A growing body of research has examined universal prevention programs targeting these emotional disorders in childhood. While most universal prevention programs are offered within the school setting, there is also a rationale for developing and investigating prevention programs within novel settings, including a recreational context. This initial investigation utilized the Emotion Detectives Prevention Program (EDPP), a universal prevention protocol focusing on anxiety and depression symptoms within a recreational summer camp. The aims of this pilot study were to assess the EDPP's feasibility and participant satisfaction following its initial administration in a camp setting. Forty children (ages 7-10 years, 70.7% male) were recruited from an existent recreational sports camp and participated in a non-randomized, open trial of the EDPP. The EDPP, a 15-session program, presents cognitive-behavioral strategies in a manner that emphasizes strategy applicability across a range of emotional experiences. Participating children reported a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms at post-prevention. No significant change in depression symptoms or other emotion regulation indices were reported. Moderate to high participant satisfaction was indicated. The EDPP appears to be a feasible program for the prevention of child-reported anxiety symptoms in a camp setting. Given the novelty of the prevention context, issues inherent in the conduct of research in a recreational camp setting and future directions for research in this setting are discussed.

AB How does parenting affect relational aggression in children? The goal of the present series of meta-analyses based on 48 studies (28,097 children) was to analyze and integrate the findings on the associations between various types of parenting behaviors and relational aggression, and to identify potential substantive and methodological factors that may moderate these associations. To distinguish between different parenting strategies, experts sorted the parenting measures used in the studies into 10 groups. Results of a multiple correspondence analysis revealed four separate clusters: Positive parenting, psychologically controlling parenting, negative/harsh parenting, and uninvolved parenting. The meta-analyses demonstrated that more positive parenting was associated with less relational aggression (combined effect sizes r = -.06, p < .05, for mothers, r = -.08, p < .01, for fathers). More harsh parenting (combined effect sizes r = .11, p < .01, for mothers, r = .12, p < .01, for fathers) and more uninvolved parenting (combined effect sizes r = .07, p < .01, for mothers, absent for fathers) were associated with increased relational aggression. Paternal psychologically controlling parenting was positively related to relational aggression (r = .05, p < .01), whereas maternal psychologically controlling parenting was not (combined effect sizes r = .04, p = .09). The effect of several moderators is discussed. The findings of this study suggest that dimensions of positive and negative parenting behaviors of mothers and fathers are associated with children's relational aggression and that these associations are - in case of fathers - contingent upon a number of sampling and procedural characteristics.

AB Objective: The functioning of neural systems supporting emotion processing and regulation in youth with bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (BP-NOS) remains poorly understood. We sought to examine patterns of activity and connectivity in youth with BP-NOS relative to youth with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) and healthy controls (HC). Method: Participants (18 BP-I youth, 16 BP-NOS youth, and 18 HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing two emotional-face gender labeling tasks (happy/neutral, fearful/neutral). Analyses focused on a priori neural regions supporting emotion processing (amygdala) and emotion regulation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Connectivity analyses used VMPFC as a seed region. Results: During the happy-face task, BP-I youth had greater amygdala, VMPFC, and DLPFC activity to happy faces whereas BP-NOS youth had reduced VMPFC and DLPFC activity to neutral faces relative to HC, and reduced amygdala, VMPFC, and DLPFC activity to neutral faces versus BP-I. During the fearful-face task, BP-I youth had reduced DLPFC activity to fearful faces whereas BP-NOS youth had reduced DLPFC activity to neutral faces relative to HC. BP-NOS youth showed greater VMPFC-DLPFC connectivity to happy faces relative to HC and BP-I youth. BP-I youth showed reduced VMPFC-amygdala connectivity to fearful faces relative to HC and BP-NOS youth. Conclusions: This is the first study to document differential patterns of abnormal neural activity in, and connectivity between, neural regions supporting emotion processing and regulation in BP-NOS versus BP-I youth. Findings suggest that despite similarities in symptom presentation, there are differential patterns of abnormal neural functioning in BP-NOS and BP-I relative to HC, which might reflect an "intermediate state" in the course of BP-I illness. Future longitudinal studies are needed to relate these findings with future conversion to BP-I/II. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(12):1275-1289.

AB Interest in mindfulness-based interventions for children and adolescents is burgeoning, bringing with it the need for validated instruments to assess mindfulness in youths. The present studies were designed to validate among adolescents a measure of mindfulness previously validated for adults (e. g., Brown & Ryan, 2003), which we herein call the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A). In 2 large samples of healthy 14- to 18-year-olds (N = 595), Study 1 supported a single-factor MAAS-A structure, along with acceptably high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and both concurrent and incremental validity. In Study 2, with a sample of 102 psychiatric outpatient adolescents age 14- 18 years, participants randomized to a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention showed significant increases in MAAS-A scores from baseline to 3-month follow-up, relative to nonsignificant score changes among treatment-as-usual participants. Increases in MAAS-A scores among mindfulness-based stress reduction participants were significantly related to beneficial changes in numerous mental health indicators. The findings support the reliability and validity of the MAAS-A in normative and mixed psychiatric adolescent populations and suggest that the MAAS-A has utility in mindfulness intervention research.

AB Supportive Non-Parental Adults (SNPAs), or non-parental adults who provide social support to youth, are present in the lives of many adolescents; yet to date, a guiding framework for organizing the existing literature on the provision of support provided by multiple types of SNPAS, such as teachers, natural mentors, and extended family members, as well as to inform future research efforts, is lacking. The aim of the current paper is to utilize the well-established lens of social support to integrate, across this broad range of literatures, recent findings regarding associations between SNPAs and four indices of adolescent psychosocial adjustment: academic functioning, self-esteem, and behavioral and emotional problems. Beyond offering an integrative framework for understanding the link between SNPAs and adolescent functioning, the issues reviewed here have potentially far-reaching consequences for adolescents and their families, as well as the professionals working with adolescents and their families in the health care, school, and community settings.

AB Positive illusions are systematically inflated self-perceptions of competence, and are frequently seen in areas of great difficulty. Although these illusions have been extensively documented in children and adults, their role in typical adolescent emotion regulation is unclear. This study investigated the relationship between positive illusions, depressive symptomatology, and school stress in a sample of 71 school-based adolescents. Findings revealed that adolescents who were achieving slightly below average in math significantly overestimated their performance, but adolescents did not overestimate their performance in spelling. Positive illusions in math were negatively related to depressive symptomatology. Implications for positive illusions theory are discussed.

AB Child and adolescent psychiatric neuroimaging research typically lags behind similar advances in adult disorders. While the pediatric depression imaging literature is less developed, a recent surge in interest has created the need for a synthetic review of this work. Major findings from pediatric volumetric and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity studies converge to implicate a corticolimbic network of key areas that work together to mediate the task of emotion regulation. Imaging the brain of children and adolescents with unipolar depression began with volumetric studies of isolated brain regions that served to identify key prefrontal, cingulate and limbic nodes of depression-related circuitry elucidated from more recent advances in DTI and functional connectivity imaging. Systematic review of these studies preliminarily suggests developmental differences between findings in youth and adults, including prodromal neurobiological features, along with some continuity across development.

AB Background Relatively little is known about the significance of normal variation in objectively assessed sleep duration and its regularity in children's psychological well-being.
   Purpose We explored the associations between sleep duration and regularity and behavioral and emotional problems in 8-year-old children.
   Methods A correlational design was applied among an epidemiological sample of children born in 1998. Sleep was registered with an actigraph for seven nights (range 3 to 14) in 2006. Mothers (n=280) and fathers (n=190) rated their child's behavioral problems with the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results Children with short sleep duration had an increased risk for behavioral problems, thought problems, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition-based attention-deficit hyperactivity problems according to maternal ratings. Based on paternal ratings, short sleep duration was associated with more rule-breaking and externalizing symptoms. Irregularity in sleep duration from weekdays to weekends was associated with an increased risk for specifically internalizing symptoms in paternal ratings.
   Conclusions The results highlight the importance of sufficient sleep duration and regular sleep patterns from weekdays to weekends. Short sleep duration was associated specifically with problems related to attentional control and externalizing behaviors, whereas irregularity in sleep duration was, in particular, associated with internalizing problems.

AB This study aimed to characterize affective functioning in families of youth at high familial risk for depression, with particular attention to features of affective functioning that appear to be critical to adaptive functioning but have been underrepresented in prior research including: positive and negative affect across multiple contexts, individual and transactional processes, and affective flexibility. Interactions among early adolescents (ages 9-14) and their mothers were coded for affective behaviors across both positive and negative contexts. Primary analyses compared never-depressed youth at high (n=44) and low (n=57) familial risk for depression. The high risk group showed a relatively consistent pattern for low positive affect across negative and positive contexts at both the individual and transactional level. In contrast to prior studies focusing on negative contexts that did not support disruptions in negative affect among high risk youth, the data from this study suggest variability by context (i.e. increased negativity in a positive, but not negative, context), and individual vs. transactional processes (e. g., negative escalation). Findings are discussed in concert with attention to affect flexibility, contextual and transactional factors.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the unique contribution of two aspects of emotion regulation (awareness and coping) to the development of internalizing problems in 11-year-old high-functioning children with an autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) and a control group, and the moderating effect of group membership on this. The results revealed overlap between the two groups, but also significant differences, suggesting a more fragmented emotion regulation pattern in children with HFASD, especially related to worry and rumination. Moreover, in children with HFASD, symptoms of depression were unrelated to positive mental coping strategies and the conviction that the emotion experience helps in dealing with the problem, suggesting that a positive approach to the problem and its subsequent emotion experience are less effective in the HFASD group.

AB Most athletes who experience a sports-related concussion recover from the acute effects within a few weeks. However, some children and adolescents with concussion experience symptoms for many weeks, or even months after the injury. Subacute and chronic symptoms related to concussion are particularly concerning in children, because cognitive deficits, headache or neck pain, sleep dysfunction, and emotional dysregulation can affect school performance and social function at a critical period of development and maturation. This article reviews the epidemiology of subacute symptoms after pediatric concussion and the current recommendations for the assessment and management cif these symptoms in children and adolescents.

AB Understanding how youths develop particular styles of responding to stress is critical for promoting effective coping. This research examined the prospective, interactive contribution of maternal socialization of coping and peer stress to youth responses to peer stress. A sample of 144 early adolescents (mean age = 12.44 years, SD = 1.22) and their maternal caregivers completed questionnaires and semistructured interviews in 2 waves over a 1-year period. Results revealed that mothers' disengagement coping suggestions predicted maladaptive responses to stress, particularly for youths who received low levels of engagement suggestions, and engagement coping suggestions protected youths against maladaptive responses to stress. Importantly, these effects emerged only in the context of heightened peer stress. This research suggests that maternal socialization of coping has the potential to support or undermine youths' development of an effective repertoire of responses to stress.

AB The marked sex difference in depression has been explained in part by the sex difference in rumination. However, we know little about why females are more likely than males to ruminate. One explanation is that greater feminine gender role identification may be associated with a greater tendency to ruminate. In Part 1 of this study, we examined gender role as a mediator of the sex difference in trait rumination for domain-specific stressors among 136 older adolescents (ages 14 to 20; 40% male). Although females were more likely than males to ruminate about all types of stressors, we found that femininity accounted for the sex difference in trait rumination about interpersonal, Coefficient = .09, 95% CI (.01, .21), R-2 = .16, but not achievement stressors Coefficient = .02, 95% CI (-.04, .14), R2 = .10. In Part 2 of the study, we prospectively followed 107 of the initial 136 participants to track state rumination about specific interpersonal and achievement stressors. Using a weekly diary design, participants reported their stressors and rumination about those stressors each week for 8 consecutive weeks. Despite no significant differences in state rumination by sex prospectively, data supported the cross-sectional findings. Femininity continued to form a significant path between biological sex and state rumination for interpersonal (Coefficient = .10, 95% CI = .01, .27, R-2 = .18), but not achievement stressors (Coefficient = .08, 95% CI = -.06, .32, R-2 = .02) over the 8-week period. Results suggest that the feminine gender role plays an important role in understanding rumination, and may be a better predictor of who ruminates than is biological sex.

AB Background: Suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in adolescents aged 15-19 years in Taiwan. Suicidal ideation is an important predictor of committing suicide among adolescents.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the important risk factors, the protective factors, and the role of protective factors on the relationship of risk factors to suicidal ideation among Taiwanese adolescents aged 15-19 years.
   Methods: By adopting a cross-sectional study, senior high school students (n = 577) aged 15-19 years in southern Taiwan were recruited for this study. An anonymous self-reported questionnaire was used to collect demographic characteristics, risk factors, protective factors, and suicidal ideation of the sample. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify the important risk and protective factors and the interaction between risk and protective factors on suicidal ideation.
   Results: Nearly 18% (n = 101) of the participants reported having suicidal ideation during the past 12 months. Gender (female; odds ratio [OR] = 4.23), life stress (OR = 1.03), depression (OR = 3.44), peer suicidal ideation (OR = 4.15), and bullying victimization (OR = 1.81) were important risk factors of suicidal ideation among the targeted sample. In addition, self-esteem (OR = 0.92) and emotional adaptation (OR = 0.88) were important protective factors of suicidal ideation. Self-esteem and emotional adaptation were not used to moderate the negative effects of life stress, depression, perceived peer suicidal ideation, and bullying victimization on suicidal ideation. The final model explained 40.6% of the total variance in suicidal ideation and correctly predicted 86.1% of participants with suicidal ideation.
   Discussion: Suicidal ideation prevention programs should be targeted to female adolescents. School-based efforts that provide adolescents with self-esteem enhancement, emotional regulation skills training, positive peer norms for life, coping skills for managing stress and depression, and antibullying programs might help reduce the suicidal ideation of adolescents.

AB Objective: To investigate long-term psychosocial outcomes in young adults who survived septic shock caused by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal septic shock) during childhood.
   Design: A cross-sectional study.
   Setting: The psychological investigation took place in the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital.
   Patients: All consecutive surviving patients with meningococcal septic shock requiring intensive care treatment at the pediatric intensive care unit between 1988 and 2001.
   Intervention: To explore biographical characteristics (such as living conditions, educational, occupational, and marital status) and illness-related physical or social consequences a structured interview was used. To assess intellectual functioning the Groninger Intelligence Test 2 was used and to assess behavioral/emotional problems, the Adult Self-Report was used.
   Measurements and Main Results: Fifty-eight of 83 eligible septic shock survivors were evaluated (response rate: 70%). The patients were 16-31 yrs old at time of follow-up (median age: 21 yrs old). These patients had had meningococcal septic shock before 18 yrs of age. Median follow-up interval was 13 yrs, with a range of 4 to 16 yrs. For the vast majority of meningococcal septic shock patients, outcomes on biographical characteristics, intellectual functioning, and levels of behavioral/emotional problems were comparable to those of reference groups. A minority (5% to 20%) still report illness-related physical or social consequences, behavioral and emotional problems, and lower intellectual functioning.
   Conclusions: Despite favorable outcomes for the majority of meningococcal septic shock patients in the long term, an important minority (5% to 20%) still struggles with ongoing problems as to behavioral/emotional problems, intellectual functioning, biographical characteristics, and illness-related physical or social consequences.

AB Objective: This study compares friendship quality, rates of loneliness and general psychosocial functioning in children who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) with non-injured controls.
   Methods: A between-subjects design with 14 participants in the TBI group and 14 in the non-injured control group, aged between 7-13 years and matched for age, gender, receptive vocabulary and socio-economic status. Children completed measures of receptive vocabulary (BPVS II), friendship quality (FQQ-R) and loneliness (LSDS). The main caregiver was asked to assess social skills and social withdrawal (PIC-2) and general psychosocial and behavioural functioning (SDQ).
   Results: Significant differences were not found on measures completed by children or on the PIC-2. On the SDQ, total difficulties were rated as much greater by caregivers in the TBI group (z == -2.6, p == 0.009) and these were mainly associated with sub-scales relating to emotional problems and hyperactivity.
   Conclusions: Whilst evidence for friendship problems was not found in children with TBI, evidence for emotional and behavioural difficulties that may lead to social vulnerabilities later in life were found. This indicates a need for prospective longitudinal research to explore the complex relationship between TBI and poorer social outcomes that may not become evident until adolescence.

   CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; GENDER DIFFERENCES; EUROPEAN-AMERICAN;

AB In this study, we evaluated hypotheses about cultural convergence and divergence in the nature and correlates of anger expressions. With a sample of 141 11-year-olds from the Netherlands and Hong Kong, we first examined a broad range of strategies for responding to a provocateur, finding that both Chinese and Dutch children were more likely to use intrapersonal strategies (for coping internally with the angry feelings) than interpersonal responses (to communicate anger to the provocateur). No cultural divergence was shown in the overall extent to which anger would be verbally expressed, but differences became apparent when we asked children precisely what they would say to an aggressor in a hypothetical anger-eliciting situation. As predicted, Chinese children were more likely to react tolerantly to the aggressor than their Dutch peers, whereas Dutch children indicated that they would verbally confront the aggressor more often, trying to reinstate their personal goals. In comparison with Dutch children, the Chinese sample viewed their chosen strategies as more likely to elicit positive reactions from the aggressor and to reduce anger. Directions for further research on the personal and socio-cultural functionality of anger response styles are discussed.

AB The aim was to examine the rates and types of parent reported neuropsychiatric problems in children and adolescents with mild mental retardation (MMR) (mild intellectual disability/UK) using the Five-To-Fifteen questionnaire (FTF). The target group comprised all pupils with clinically diagnosed MMR, aged between 7 and 15 years, attending the special schools for children with MMR in two municipalities in a region in the South-West of Sweden. The FTF is a 181-item parent questionnaire with age and gender specific Swedish norms covering eight domains, including the phenomenology of early symptomatic syndromes eliciting neurodevelopmental examinations (ESSENCE), including ADHD, autism, tic syndromes, and various kinds of language, memory, and learning problems. Parents of 63% (39/62) of the eligible target group completed the FTF. After scrutiny of the medical records, 6 of the 39 children were found not to meet criteria for MR. Scores exceeding the 90th centile of the norm group were considered indicative of neuropsychiatric problems. Such high scores are strongly associated with clinically valid ESSENCE/neuropsychiatric disorders. All the examined children with validated MR were reported by their parents to have learning problems. There were very high rates of problems reported in all the other seven FTF domains: perception (88%), language (79%), social skills/autism (76%), memory (67%), emotional problems (58%), motor skills (55%) and executive functions/ADHD (55%). School age children with MMR are all in need of a comprehensive work-up covering not only general cognitive abilities, but also many other areas, including motor skills, executive function/attention, social and emotional/behavioural symptoms/functioning. Such broad assessment (including child screening by parent report with the FTF) will enable a better basis for understanding their special needs of support through life. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In a clinical sample of child psychiatry outpatients, chart review data were collected for 114 consecutive admissions over a 1-year period at a Child and Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic. Data included history of documented maltreatment, potentially traumatic domestic or community violence, neglect or emotional abuse, and noninterpersonal stressors as well as demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and parent-rated child emotional and disruptive behavior problems. On a bivariate and multivariate basis, any past exposure to interpersonal violence-but not to noninterpersonal traumas-was related to more severe disruptive behavior problems, independent of the effects of demographics and psychiatric diagnoses. Noninterpersonal trauma and psychiatric diagnoses were associated with emotional problems; exposure to interpersonal violence appeared to partially account for this relationship despite not being independently associated with emotional problem severity. History of exposure to interpersonal violence warrants clinical and research attention as a severity marker and potential treatment focus in psychiatric outpatient services for children, particularly those with disruptive behavior problems.

AB Background: The current study directly investigated whether changes in the neural correlates of self-regulation (SR) are associated with the effectiveness of treatment for the externalizing problems of children.
   Methods: Seventy-one children 8-12 years of age with clinical levels of externalizing behavior and their families completed a 3-month cognitive behavioral therapy program with a parent management training component. Electroencephalogram correlates of SR were evaluated before and after treatment with a go/no-go task requiring inhibitory control.
   Results: Results showed that neural markers of SR, such as the N2 and frontal P3 event-related potential magnitudes, differed between the clinical sample and a matched comparison group before treatment: the clinical sample had larger N2 magnitudes and smaller frontal P3 magnitudes. Children who improved with treatment demonstrated a marked decrease in the magnitude of the N2 in comparison with children who did not improve. For improvers only, source analyses during the time period of the N2 estimated activation decreases in medial and ventral prefrontal cortex as well as the anterior medial temporal lobe.
   Conclusions: A decrease in N2 magnitudes and corresponding source activation in children who improved with treatment might reflect improved efficiency in the neural mechanisms of SR.

AB We examined child behavior problems and maternal mental health in a British population-representative sample of 5 year-old children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), controlling for the presence of an intellectual disability (ID). Behavior problems were significantly higher in children with ASD with/out ID compared to typically developing children, but compared to children with ID only hyperactivity was significantly higher in children with ASD/ID. After controlling for ID and maternal mental health, the presence of ASD significantly increased the odds for hyperactivity, conduct problems and emotional symptoms. Negative maternal outcomes (serious mental illness, psychological distress, and physical health limitations) were not consistently elevated in ASD. The findings highlight the early age at which behavior problems emerge in ASD, and suggest that at this age, there may not be a clear disadvantage for maternal mental health associated with having a child with ASD in the family, over and above that conferred by child behavior problems.

AB Acne vulgaris is common throughout the world and often perceived by both patients and clinicians as an inconsequential disease of adolescence. In reality, however, acne is a chronic medical disease that lasts for years and causes a considerable impact on quality of life. Many patients with acne experience emotional problems due to their disease, which can lead to reduced social interactions and even a lower likelihood of employment. Little has been written specifically about acne in Asian patients in the English-language medical published work, perhaps due to an assumption that the management of acne is the same in all populations. A group of acne experts from nine Asian countries and the USA met to review and discuss acne care within the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on evidence-based medicine. This group developed a care algorithm using results of clinical trials as well as knowledge of practice patterns.

   OUTCOMES
AB Background: The concept of resilience has captured the imagination of researchers and policy makers over the past two decades. However, despite the ever growing body of resilience research, there is a paucity of relevant, comprehensive measurement tools. In this article, the development of a theoretically based, comprehensive multi-dimensional measure of resilience in adolescents is described.
   Methods: Extensive literature review and focus groups with young people living with chronic illness informed the conceptual development of scales and items. Two sequential rounds of factor and scale analyses were undertaken to revise the conceptually developed scales using data collected from young people living with a chronic illness and a general population sample.
   Results: The revised Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire comprises 93 items and 12 scales measuring resilience factors in the domains of self, family, peer, school and community. All scales have acceptable alpha coefficients. Revised scales closely reflect conceptually developed scales.
   Conclusions: It is proposed that, with further psychometric testing, this new measure of resilience will provide researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive and developmentally appropriate instrument to measure a young person's capacity to achieve positive outcomes despite life stressors.

The sample comprised 151 early adolescents (aged 11-13) and their mothers (aged 29-57). Adolescent- and mother-reports of adolescent temperament and self-reports of maternal temperament were collected. Mother-adolescent dyads participated in event-planning and problem-solving interactions, which were coded for frequency of aggressive, dysphoric, and positive interpersonal maternal behavior. Analyses indicated that adolescents who are higher in temperamental Negative Affectivity and lower in Effortful Control are generally exposed to more frequent aggressive and less frequent positive interpersonal maternal behavior. Furthermore, mothers lower in Effortful Control engaged in more frequent dysphoric behavior toward their adolescent. Given the associations between parental emotional behavior and the development of adolescent emotion regulation, these findings suggest that temperamental dispositions, particularly of early adolescents, may influence their ongoing socialization of emotion regulation skills, and thus their emotional well being.

AB This study examined how mother and father-child relationship quality and marital forgiveness were related to early adolescents' forgiveness of mothers and fathers. Adolescents' social-cognitive skills (empathy and emotional regulation) and parents' forgiveness of child were examined as mediators. Mother, father, and child self-reported questionnaires and observational data were taken from Time 1 and Time 3 (two years later) of the Flourishing Families Project, and included 334 two-parent families with an early adolescent (M age at Time 1 = 11.24; 51% male; 76% Caucasian). Using path analyses via structure equation modeling, mother-child relationship quality and adolescents' own social-cognitive skills were salient correlates of adolescents' forgiveness toward parents. The unique contributions of mothers and fathers, differences by reporter, and the importance of studying forgiveness within the parent-child relationship are discussed.

AB The present study examined agreement between scores obtained from self-reports of behavioral and emotional problems obtained from 513 Algerian adolescents on the Youth Self-Report (YSR) with scores obtained from reports provided by their parents on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The correlations between self- and parent-report were larger than those observed in many other cultures (e.g., intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.60 and Pearson r = 0.65 for Total Problems). On the whole, cross-informant agreement did not vary significantly as a function of problem type, identity of the parental informant, gender and age of the adolescent. Similar to all studied cultures, adolescents on average reported more problems than their parents reported about them, but the discrepancies were smaller than in all previous societies. Mean YSR/CBCL score discrepancies indicated higher YSR scores for several scales, but variability across dyads was large, and many dyads showed the opposite pattern.

AB Because the ability to flexibly experience and appropriately express emotions across a range of developmentally relevant contexts is crucial to adaptive functioning, we examined how adolescent attachment security may be related to more functional emotional behavior during a relationship promoting interaction task. Data were collected from 74 early adolescent girls (Mean age 13.45 years; SD = 0.68; 89% Caucasian) and their primary caregiver. Results indicated that, regardless of the parent's interaction behavior and the level of stress in the parent adolescent relationship, greater adolescent security was associated with more positive and less negative behavioral displays, including greater positivity, greater coherence of verbal content and affect, less embarrassment, and less emotional dysregulation in response to a situational demand for establishing intimacy with the parent. Implications for encouraging and fostering adolescents' capacity to respond to interpersonal contexts in ways that promote the relationship are discussed.

AB This study examines adopted Chinese girls' social skills at home and in school as well as the effect of pre-adoption adversity on these skills. Parent ratings of 869 girls and teacher ratings of 611 of the 869 girls were obtained using the Social Skills Rating System for parent (SSRS-P) and teacher (SSRS-T) respectively. The girls were adopted on average at 15.6 months (SD = 13.9) and were in three age groups, including preschool, elementary school, and secondary school. Data on five indicators of pre-adoption adversity (i.e., signs/symptoms, delays at adoption, initial refusal/avoidance of adoptive mothers, crying/clinging behaviors, and age at adoption) were obtained from the same adoptive parents 2 years prior. Findings suggest that both parents and teachers rated the girls as either similar to or better than US norms on the SSRS. Parent-teacher agreement on SSRS subscales was significant but modest (rs = 0.12-0.25). Two indicators of pre-adoption adversity (i.e., delays at adoption and initial refusal/avoidance of adoptive mothers) predicted poorer social skills at home: two other indicators of pre-adoption adversity (i.e., signs/symptoms and age at adoption) predicted poorer social skills in school.

AB The purpose of this paper was to compare children placed out-of-home because of parental substance abuse (PSA) with children placed for other reasons (NPSA), and to explore the association between PSA and mental health problems in a Norwegian sample of 6- to 12-year-old children in out-of-home care (N=109). Several group differences were found related to the children themselves, their families and the Child Welfare case. The PSA children had less total difficulties, conduct problems and emotional problems than the NPSA children assessed by the teachers on the Revised Rutter Scale. However, both groups had far more mental health problems than children in general. The most important variable explaining the group difference in all subgroups of mental health problems was the extent of prosocial behavior in the children, but being placed for behavioral problems also explained a significant part of total difficulties and conduct problems. Variables like gender, discipline problems and socioeconomic conditions did not have a significant effect. The conclusion of the study was that prosocial behavior might be regarded as an important protective factor against mental health problems, which is an argument for investing in programs focusing on enhancing the placed children's mastering strategies.

AB This study investigates the associations between cognitive coping (as measured with the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; CERQ), defense mechanisms (as measured with the Defense Style Questionnaire-60; DSQ-60) and personality disorders (PDs; as measured with the SIDP-IV interview) in a large sample of patients with PDs (n = 1,435).
   Explorative factor analyses indicated that the nine CERQ subscales can be clustered into three higher-order factors (adaptive coping, non-adaptive coping and external attribution style). When compared to a general population sample, the PD sample particularly scored higher on nonadaptive coping styles. A higher number of PDs was related to a particularly higher level of nonadaptive coping and less mature defensive functioning, but also to lower levels of adaptive coping and external attribution. This study is the first to suggest that three higher-order coping styles can be identified among PD patients, and that these coping styles are related to the presence and number of PDs.

AB Although children and adolescents vary in their chronic tendencies to adaptively versus maladaptively reflect over negative feelings, the psychological mechanisms underlying these different types of self-reflection among youngsters are unknown. We addressed this issue in the present research by examining the role that self-distancing plays in distinguishing adaptive versus maladaptive self-reflection among an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of fifth-grade public school-children. Children were randomly assigned to analyze their feelings surrounding a recent anger-related interpersonal experience from either a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective. They then rated their negative affect and described in writing the stream of thoughts they experienced when they analyzed their feelings. Children's stream-of-thought essays were content analyzed for the presence of recounting statements, reconstruing statements, and blame attributions. Path analyses indicated that children who analyzed their feelings from a self-distanced perspective focused significantly less on recounting the "hot," emotionally arousing features of their memory (i.e., what happened to me?) and relatively more on reconstruing their experience. This shift in thought content-less recounting and more reconstruing-led children in the self-distanced group to blame the other person involved in their recalled experience significantly less, which in turn led them to display significantly lower levels of emotional reactivity. These findings help delineate the psychological mechanisms that distinguish adaptive versus maladaptive forms of self-reflection over anger experiences in children. Their basic findings and clinical implications are discussed.

AB Objective: Although previous neuroimaging studies suggest that adolescents with bipolar disorder exhibit smaller amygdala volumes compared with healthy adolescents, whether these abnormalities are present at illness onset or instead develop over time remains unclear. The aim of this study was to conduct a prospective longitudinal investigation comparing amygdala neurodevelopment among adolescents after their first manic episode, adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and healthy adolescents. Method: A total of 30 adolescents hospitalized for their first manic/mixed episode associated with bipolar disorder, 29 adolescents with ADHD, and 24 demographically matched healthy teens underwent magnetic resonance imaging scanning at index assessment and approximately 12 months later. Adolescents with bipolar disorder were prospectively evaluated using diagnostic interviews and with symptom rating scales. Results: Mixed models examining the group X time effect for both left (p = .005) and right (p = .002) amygdala volumes were statistically significant. Change in left (p = .01) and right (p = .0008) amygdala volumes from baseline to 12 months were significantly different among groups. Specifically, left amygdala volumes increased over time in healthy adolescents (p = .008) and adolescents with ADHD (p = .0009), but not in adolescents with bipolar disorder (p = .3). Right amygdala volume increased over time in adolescents with ADHD (p < .001), but not in healthy adolescents nor in adolescents with bipolar disorder (p = .1 and p = .3, respectively). In adolescents with bipolar disorder, baseline total amygdala volume was significantly greater in those who subsequently achieved symptomatic recovery as compared with those who did not achieve recovery (p = .02). Conclusions: Adolescents with mania do not exhibit normal increases in amygdala volume that occur during healthy adolescent neurodevelopment. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

AB Objective: We used multi-level modelling of sibling-pair data to disentangle the influence of proband-specific and more general family influences on maternal expressed emotion (MEE) toward children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: MEE was measured using the Five Minute Speech Sample (FMSS) for 60 sibling pairs (aged 5 through 17 years) each comprising one proband with ADHD and one child without ADHD. Questionnaire measures were used to assess child and adolescent conduct and emotional problems and maternal depression and ADHD. Multi-level models partitioned the effects of five MEE components (initial statement [IS], relationship [REL], warmth [WAR], critical comments [CC], and positive comments [PC]) into proband-specific and general family effects. Results: Significant proband-specific effects were confirmed for all MEE components, with higher levels of MEE expressed toward probands with ADHD than siblings without ADHD. For REL, PC, and CC, this effect was explained by comorbid child conduct problems rather than ADHD. Only low WAR was associated with child ADHD itself. Furthermore, only low WAR was related to variations in more general family characteristics, especially levels of maternal depression. Conclusions: MEE toward children with ADHD was influenced by proband-specific factors. For most components, these were driven by comorbid symptoms of conduct problems rather than ADHD itself. WAR was different; it was influenced by both child-specific and more general characteristics of the family. Further studies utilising a longitudinal design are required to establish the direction of causation and extend our understanding of the relationship between EE components and ADHD. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(10):1042-1053.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate prospectively the relationship between BMI and the mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of young children.
   METHODS: In this study we used data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children obtained when children were 4 to 5 and 8 to 9 years old. BMI was available for 3363 children at both waves. Mental health problems were assessed by using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which was completed by parents and teachers. HRQoL was assessed by using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), which was completed by the parents.
   RESULTS: Logistic regression models were adjusted for children's age, gender, baseline SDQ or PedsQL scores, and maternal characteristics. A 1-SD increase in BMI in children aged 4 to 5 years was associated with increased odds of scoring in the abnormal range of the SDQ peer problems scale of 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.28) for parent reports and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.04-1.37) for teacher reports when these children were aged 8 to 9 years. The odds ratio for children who scored above the at-risk cutoff on the parent-reported PedsQL social problems scale was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06-1.28) for each 1-SD increase at 4 to 5 years of age. There were also increased odds for teacher reports of childhood emotional problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI in children aged 4 to 5 years was positively related to poorer peer relationships and teacher-reported emotional problems but not to other childhood mental health problems, in these children at 8 to 9 years of age. Prospective studies are needed to determine if peer problems experienced by children with higher BMI predict subsequent mental health problems in other areas. Pediatrics 2011;128:677-684

AB Background: Little is known about the role of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) dimensions on the temporal unfolding of conduct disorder (CD) and depression in girls between childhood and adolescence. Method: The year-to-year associations between CD and depressive symptomatology were examined using nine waves of annually collected data (ages 8 through 16 years) from 1215 participants of the Pittsburgh Girls Study. A series of autoregressive path models were tested that included ODD-Emotion Dysregulation (ODD-ED) and ODD-Defiance, as time-varying covariates on CD predicting depression severity in the following year, and vice versa. Results: Conduct problems, depression, and ODD dimensions were relatively stable throughout childhood and adolescence, and a moderate degree of covariance was observed between these variables. Path analyses showed that CD often preceded depression across this developmental period, although the effect sizes were small. There was less consistent prediction from depression to CD. The overlap between ODD-ED and CD partially explained the prospective relations from CD to depression, whereas these paths were fully explained by the overlap between ODD-ED and depression. The overlap between ODD-Defiance and CD did not account for the prospective relations from CD to depression. In contrast, the overlap between ODD-Defiance and depression accounted for virtually all paths from CD to depression. Accounting for the overlap between ODD dimensions and both CD and depression eliminated all significant predictive paths. Conclusions: Symptoms of CD tend to precede depression in girls during childhood and adolescence. However, covariance between depression and both ODD-ED and ODD-Defiance accounts for these prospective relations. ODD dimensions should be assessed when evaluating risk for comorbid depression in girls with conduct problems, and emotion dysregulation and defiance aspects of ODD should be identified as targets for treatment in order to prevent depression in the future.

AB This study examined the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology symptoms with 7-12 year-old children (N = 97; 44 boys, 53 girls, M age = 9.14, SD = 1.38) and their mothers (M age = 38.46, SD = 6.86). Child emotion regulation mediated the links between maternal psychopathology and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In turn, the indirect effect was dependent on the level of maternal support in response to youth's expressions of negative emotions when considering particular constellations of maternal reactions and type of psychopathology symptoms. The findings indicate that the relations between maternal and child psychopathology symptoms and child emotion regulation are complex and vary by context. Regardless of the complexity, however, for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youth, the results suggest that building adaptive emotion regulation skills is an important target for prevention among children who are at risk for problems due to exposure to maternal psychopathology.

AB Context: Individuals with lower IQ scores have an increased risk of psychological disorders, mental health problems, and suicide; similarly, children with low IQ scores are more likely to have behavioral, emotional, and anxiety disorders. However, little is known about the effect of parental IQ on the mental health outcomes of their children.
   Objective: To determine whether maternal and paternal IQ scores are associated with offspring conduct, emotional, and attention scores.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: General population.
   Participants: Members of the 1958 National Child Development Study and their offspring were studied. Of 2984 parent-offspring pairs with nonadopted children 4 years or older, 2202 pairs had complete data regarding all variables of interest and were included in the analyses.
   Main Outcome Measures: Offspring conduct, emotional, and attention scores based on the Behavioral Problems Index for children aged 4 to 6 years or the Rutter A scale for children and adolescents 7 years and older.
   Results: Little evidence was observed of any association of parental IQ with conduct or emotional problems in children aged 4 to 6 years. However, among children and adolescents 7 years or older, strong evidence was observed from age- and sex-adjusted models to support a decrease in conduct, emotional, and attention problems in those whose parents had higher IQ scores. These associations were linear across the full IQ range. Individual adjustments for socioeconomic status and the child's own IQ had limited effect. However, adjustments for Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scores and parental malaise attenuated associations with the mother's IQ but had little effect on associations with the father's IQ ( scores were available for only 1 parent for each child or adolescent). Strong associations were no longer evident in models that simultaneously adjusted for all 4 potential mediating variables.
   Conclusions: Children whose parents score poorly on IQ tests may have an increased risk of conduct, emotional, and attention problems. The home environment, parental malaise, and the child's own IQ may have a role in explaining these associations.

AB Adolescents often fail to adaptively regulate their emotions and behaviors. This is most clearly demonstrated by the marked increase during this period in fatalities that are attributable to preventable causes. Using functional magnetic resonance methodology, this study explored whether adolescents and adults differed in their engagement of prefrontal circuitry in response to a cognitive and emotional challenge. Twenty-four adolescents and twenty-three adults were scanned while they solved difficult math problems with induced failure and negative social evaluation. Data is reported from 23 adolescents and 23 adults. Adult and adolescent participants showed similar increases in heart rate when responding to the experimental challenge. Despite the similarity of the autonomic response, adolescents recruited a more restricted network of prefrontal regions as compared to adults. Both adolescents and adults recruited the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, however adults additionally recruited the anterior insula. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula and other prefrontal regions was stronger in adults as compared to adolescents. Further, for adults, the magnitude of activity in the insula predicted lower autonomic activity in response to the challenge. Differences between adolescents and adults engagement of prefrontal networks may relate to adolescents' poor behavioral and emotional regulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, early-onset and enduring neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate deficits in attention, hyperactivity, increased impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, resulting in impairments in multiple domains of personal and professional life. ADHD has long been considered a disorder of childhood that resolves gradually with maturation during adolescence; however, this view was contested by systematic follow-up studies documenting the persistence of ADHD across the lifespan. In this article, we present converging evidence from clinical and genetic studies arguing for a remarkable perseverance of ADHD-related symptomatology, taking into account the disorder's variable and changing phenotype moderated by a high rate of comorbidity throughout the lifecycle. We also cover findings highlighting alterations in structural and functional neuroanatomy based on neuropsychological, psychophysiological and brain imaging approaches, and discuss options for deficit-focused pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions at different stages of life. In addition, we develop a fusion model of disease risk underlying the pathway to ADHD etiology. Finally, we argue for large-scale, systematic studies to explore factors predicting the long-term outcome of the disease and the possibilities to exploit those predictors with more personalized treatment strategies to enhance remittance and/or coping.

AB Child maltreatment-related outcomes range from no symptom expression to suicide. Increasingly, the diverse presentations have been conceptualized as core system dysregulation, including emotion dysregulation. Self-compassion has been advanced as a self-regulation strategy for countering negative self-directed emotions. This study explored whether individual differences in self-compassion would play a role in loosening the associations among childhood maltreatment severity and later emotion regulation difficulties. The sample consisted of transition-age youth (N = 81) seeking treatment for problem substance use. Self-compassion was negatively associated with emotion regulation difficulties and childhood maltreatment, and predicted emotion dysregulation above and beyond maltreatment history, current severity of psychological distress, and problem substance use. In addition, self-compassion mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment severity and later emotion dysregulation. These findings provide an impetus for further research into the relevance of self-compassion for maltreatment-related impairment.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the levels of depressive symptoms and the unique contribution of two aspects of emotion regulation (coping and mood states) to the development of depression in hearing-impaired children and a control group.
   Methods: In order to compare the groups, self-report questionnaires concerning symptoms of depression, coping strategies, and mood states were used. The study group consisted of 27 children with cochlear implants, 56 children with conventional hearing aids, and 117 normally hearing children.
   Results: Hearing-impaired children reliably reported more symptoms of depression than their normally hearing peers. Degree of hearing loss, socioeconomic status, gender, and age were unrelated to the level of depressive symptoms. But attending mainstream schools or using exclusively speech for communication were related to fewer depressive symptoms. The associations with depressive symptoms differed between the groups. For hearing-impaired children, the cognitive aspects (coping) and the affective aspects (mood states) of emotional functioning contributed separately to the prediction of depressive symptoms. For normally hearing children an integration of cognitive and affective aspects was detected: adequate coping skills prevented the development of negative mood states and in turn depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Hearing-impaired children reported more depressive symptoms than normally hearing children. Prevention and treatment of depression in hearing-impaired children could focus on the use of coping strategies adequately, because these strategies have a direct relation with the level of depression.

AB Objective: This study investigated the role of self-regulation of emotion in relation to functional impairment and comorbidity among children with and without AD/HD. Method: A total of 358 probands and their siblings participated in the study, with 74% of the sample participants affected by AD/HD. Parent-rated levels of emotional lability served as a marker for self-regulation of emotion. Results: Nearly half of the children affected by AD/HD displayed significantly elevated levels of emotional lability versus 15% of those without this disorder. Children with AD/HD also displayed significantly higher rates of functional impairment, comorbidity, and treatment service utilization. Emotional lability partially mediated the association between AD/HD status and these outcomes. Conclusion: Findings lent support to the notion that deficits in the self-regulation of emotion are evident in a substantial number of children with AD/HD and that these deficits play an important role in determining functional impairment and comorbidity outcomes.

AB Background: While there is considerable evidence of income gradients in child and adolescent behaviour problems, evidence relating to children and young people's emotional difficulties is more mixed. Older studies reported no income differentials, while recent reports suggest that adolescents from low-income families are more likely to experience emotional difficulties than their more affluent peers. Methods: We compared the association between low-versus medium-/high-family income and parent-reported emotional difficulties in 15- and 16-year-olds in three large nationally representative cohorts studied in 1974, 1986 and 1999/2004. We then examined whether increases in the income differential could be accounted for by changes in the association of a range of sociodemographic factors (family type or size, maternal education or housing tenure) with either family income or emotional difficulties. Finally, in the most recent cohorts, we considered whether the effects of these sociodemographic variables were mediated by more proximal family factors (maternal distress, stressful life events or family dysfunction). Results: An increasing income differential in adolescent emotional problems emerged over the period, with standardized coefficients for associations with low income increasing from .07 in 1974 and 1986 to .30 in 1999/2004. This was due partially (similar to 10%) to sociodemographic risk factors for emotional difficulties becoming more strongly associated with low-income families over time, and partially (similar to 40%) to the increasing impact of these risk factors. In the most recent cohorts, about 40% of the effects of sociodemographic risks appear to have been mediated by more proximal family factors. Conclusions: These findings have implications for our understanding of the health burden of emotional problems, recognition of the health burden associated with inequality and public concern about the consequences of social change.

AB This investigation analyzed the methods used over the past 35 years to study emotion regulation (ER) in children. Articles published from 1975 through 2010 were identified in 42 child clinical, developmental, and emotion psychology journals. Overall, 61.1% of published ER articles relied on one method and 23.6% used two methods. Analyses revealed (a) 82.8% of published ER research occurring within the past decade; (b) higher rates of observational methods with infant and toddler/preschool samples, but more use of self-report methodology with middle childhood and adolescent samples; (c) a longer history of published ER research with samples of infants to 5-year-olds, including the use of more longitudinal design, compared with older samples: and (d) a positive association between journal impact ratings and the use of physiological and observational measurement. Review of the measurement tools used to capture ER revealed great diversity in how emotion processes are understood and evaluated. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This study used a new cell phone ecological momentary assessment approach to investigate daily emotional dynamics in 47 youths with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 32 no-psychopathology controls (CON) (ages 7-17 years). Information about emotional experience in the natural environment was obtained using answer-only cell phones, while MDD youths received an 8-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or psychopharmacological treatment. Compared with CON youths, MDD youths reported more intense and labile global negative affect; greater sadness, anger, and nervousness; and a lower ratio of positive to negative affect. These differences increased with pubertal maturation. MOD youths spent more time alone and less time with their families than CON youths. Although differences in emotional experiences were found across social contexts, MDD youths were more negative than CON youths in all contexts examined. As the MDD participants progressed through treatment, diagnostic group differences in the intensity and lability of negative affect decreased, but there were no changes in the ratio of positive to negative affect or in measures of social context. We discuss methodological innovations and advantages of this approach, including improved ecological validity and access to information about variability in emotions, change in emotions over time, the balance of positive and negative emotions, and the social context of emotional experience.

AB Maternal depression is associated with problematic parenting and the development of emotional and behavior problems in children and adolescents. While emotional regulatory abilities are likely to influence emotional exchanges between parents and teens, surprisingly little is known about the role of emotion regulation during parent-child interactions, particularly in high-risk families. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been widely linked to emotion regulatory abilities in recent research, and the current study investigated RSA and maternal depression in relation to dyadic flexibility, as well as mutuality of negative and positive affect displayed during three discussion tasks between 59 mother-adolescent pairs (age 11-17 years). Dyadic flexibility was predicted by the interaction of maternal depression, maternal RSA, and teen RSA, with higher maternal RSA predicting greater dyadic flexibility, particularly in highest risk dyads (i.e., elevated maternal depression and lower teen RSA). Teen RSA interacted with maternal depression to predict mutual negative affect, serving as a protective factor. Finally, maternal and teen RSA interacted to predict mutual positive affect, with maternal RSA buffering against low teen RSA to predict higher mutual positive affect. Results support the role of RSA in affectively laden interactions between parents and adolescents, particularly in the face of maternal depression.

AB Positive affect has been implicated in the phenomenological experience of various psychiatric disorders, vulnerability to develop psychopathology and overall socio-emotional functioning. However, developmental influences that may contribute to positive affect have been understudied. Here, we studied youths' 5-HTTLPR genotype and rearing environment (degree of positive and supportive parenting) to investigate the differential susceptibility hypothesis (DSH) that youth carrying short alleles of 5-HTTLPR would be more influenced and responsive to supportive and unsupportive parenting, and would exhibit higher and lower positive affect, respectively. Three independent studies tested this gene-environment interaction (GxE) in children and adolescents (age range 9-15 years; total N = 1874). In study 1 (N = 307; 54% girls), positive/supportive parenting was assessed via parent report, in study 2 (N = 197; 58% girls) via coded observations of parent-child interactions in the laboratory and in study 3 (N = 1370; 53% girls) via self report. Results from all the three studies showed that youth homozygous for the functional short allele of 5-HTTLPR were more responsive to parenting as environmental context in a 'for better and worse' manner. Specifically, the genetically susceptible youth (that is, S'S' group) who experienced unsupportive, non-positive parenting exhibited low levels of positive affect, whereas higher levels of positive affect were reported by genetically susceptible youth under supportive and positive parenting conditions. These GxE findings are consistent with the DSH and may inform etiological models and interventions in developmental psychopathology focused on positive emotion, parenting and genetic susceptibility.

AB An accumulation of research evidence suggests that early pubertal timing plays a significant role in girls' behavioral and emotional problems. If early pubertal timing is a problematic event, then early developing Black girls should manifest evidence of this crisis because they tend to be the earliest to develop compared to other girls from different racial and ethnic groups. Given the inconsistent findings among studies using samples of Black girls, the present study examined the independent influence of perceived pubertal timing and age of menarche on externalizing behaviors and depressive symptoms in a nationally representative sample of Black girls (412 African American and 195 Caribbean Black; M = 15 years). Path analysis results indicated that perceived pubertal timing effects on externalizing behaviors were moderated by ethnic subgroup. Caribbean Black girls' who perceived their development to be early engaged in more externalizing behaviors than Caribbean Black girls' who perceived their development to be either on-time or late. Age of menarche did not significantly predict Black girls' externalizing behaviors and depressive symptoms. The onset of menarche does not appear to be an important predictor of Black girls' symptoms of externalizing behavior and depression. These findings suggest ethnic subgroup and perceived pubertal timing are promising factors for better understanding the adverse effects of early perceived pubertal timing among Black girls.

AB The goal of the current study was to determine the extent to which the perceived self-regulation deficits across behavioral, cognitive, and emotional domains seen in children with ADHD explain the association between the severity of ADHD symptoms and parenting stress. Participants for this study included 80 children (mean age = 10 years, 9 months) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD confirmed by a comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessment. Parents reported their own stress levels as well as the severity of their children's ADHD symptoms, aggression, emotional lability, and executive functioning difficulties. Results indicated that the severity of children's hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms but not their inattention related to parenting stress. Multiple mediational analyses indicated that the association between hyperactivity/impulsivity and parenting stress was explained by children's perceived comorbid aggression levels, emotional lability, and executive functioning difficulties. No significant differences in the strength of the mediators were found. The current study provides initial data showing that the perceived impairments in children's self-regulation across emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domains are what parents report as stressful, not simply the severity of ADHD symptoms. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study and shared variance from relying solely on parent report, it will be critical for future research to replicate our findings using longitudinal and multi-informant data such as teacher reports and standardized assessments.

AB We investigated the associations of appraisal and coping styles with emotion regulation in a community sample of preadolescents (N = 196, 9-12 years of age), with appraisal, coping styles, and emotion regulation measured at a single time point. In a previous study, we identified five frustration and four anxiety emotion regulation profiles based on children's physiological, behavioral, and self-reported reactions to emotion-eliciting tasks. In this study, preadolescents' self-reported appraisal and coping styles were associated with those emotion regulation profiles. Overall, findings revealed that children who were more effective at regulating their emotions during the emotion-eliciting tasks had higher levels of positive appraisal and active coping when dealing with their own problems. Conversely, children who regulated their emotions less effectively had higher levels of threat appraisal and avoidant coping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Incredible Years (IY) Series includes separate group interventions to improve parenting interactions, teacher classroom management, and child social-emotional regulation. Although originally developed to treat early onset conduct problems, IY targets many of the proposed mechanisms and risk factors for internalizing distress in early childhood. Prior studies have demonstrated the effects of the IY parent intervention on co-occurring depressive symptoms. We attempted to extend these findings by examining the unique and combined effects of IY interventions on children's co-occurring internalizing symptoms. One-hundred and fifty-nine families with children ages 4- to 8-years-old were randomly assigned to parent training (PT); parent plus teacher training (PT + TT); child training (CT); child plus teacher training (CT + TT); parent, child, plus teacher training (PT + CT + TT); or a waiting list control group. Children who received any of the intervention components were more likely to have lower mother-rated internalizing symptoms at posttreatment compared to children in a wait-list control group. Implications for future research and for designing interventions and prevention strategies for children with internalizing symptoms are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether systematic use of a validated social-emotional screening instrument in a primary care setting is feasible and improves detection of social-emotional problems among youth in foster care.
   METHODS: Before-and-after study design, following a practice intervention to screen all youth in foster care for psychosocial problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a validated instrument with 5 subdomains. After implementation of systematic screening, youth aged 11 to 17 years and their foster parents completed the SDQ at routine health maintenance visits. We assessed feasibility of screening by measuring the completion rates of SDQ by youth and foster parents. We compared the detection of psychosocial problems during a 2-year period before systematic screening to the detection after implementation of systematic screening with the SDQ. We used chart reviews to assess detection at baseline and after implementing systematic screening.
   RESULTS: Altogether, 92% of 212 youth with routine visits that occurred after initiation of screening had a completed SDQ in the medical record, demonstrating high feasibility of systematic screening. Detection of a potential mental health problem was higher in the screening period than baseline period for the entire population (54% vs 27%, P < .001). More than one-fourth of youth had 2 or more significant social-emotional problem domains on the SDQ.
   CONCLUSIONS: Systematic screening for potential social-emotional problems among youth in foster care was feasible within a primary care setting and doubled the detection rate of potential psychosocial problems.

AB Research conducted in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks (9/11) suggests that, except for those who directly witnessed or suffered loss from the attacks, for most children the emotional impact was relatively transitory. We review this literature as well as consider other ways in which the attacks may have played a role in the development of adolescents and young adults as they came of age in the shadow of 9/11 in the United States. Specifically, we discuss the potential impact of the collective trauma of 9/11 on children's coping and emotional regulation, their sociopolitical attitudes, and their general beliefs about the world. Developmental issues and the role of parents in shaping their children's responses to 9/11 are also addressed. Researchers interested in children's social, emotional, and psychological development have much to learn about children's reactions to events like 9/11 and factors that might mitigate the negative consequences of such events on children's development.

AB At present, no evidence-based treatments are available showing benefit for adults with anorexia nervosa (AN). Reasons for the absence of large-scale controlled trials include AN's relative rarity and challenges regarding participant retention. A promising investigative field is neuropsychology. Findings that AN patients demonstrate specific deficits in executive functioning are currently being translated into clinical interventions (e.g., cognitive remediation therapy). Emerging in parallel is literature emphasizing the role of emotion regulation deficits in disordered behavior. Originally developed for borderline personality disorder, emotion regulation-based treatments have been adapted for bulimia and binge eating. Haynos and Fruzzetti (2011) propose the utility of extending emotion dysregulation theories and treatments to AN, presenting evidence to support the need for further exploration in this area.

TI Do Agonistic Motives Matter More Than Anger? Three Studies of

AB Objectives: Three motivational profiles have been associated with recurring psychological stress in low-income youth and young adults: Striving to control others (agonistic striving), striving to control the self (transcendence striving), and not asserting control (dissipated striving). Agonistic striving has been associated with elevated ambulatory blood pressure during daily activities. Three studies tested the hypotheses that: (1) agonistic striving is associated with poor anger regulation, and (2) agonistic striving and poor anger regulation interactively elevate blood pressure. Design: Motivational profiles, anger regulation, and ambulatory blood pressure were assessed in a multi-ethnic sample of 264 urban youth. Main Outcome Measures: (1) anger regulation/recovery during laboratory challenge; (2) anger/blood pressure during daily activities (48 hours). Results and Conclusion: Replication of the profiles in distant cities showed they occur with similar frequency across differences of region, race, and gender. Analyses controlling for body size, race, and gender revealed that individuals with the agonistic striving profile had higher ambulatory pressure, especially during social encounters. They became more openly angry and aggressive when challenged but did not exhibit difficulty regulating anger in the laboratory, nor did they feel angrier during monitoring. However, individuals with the agonistic striving profile who did display poor anger regulation in the lab had the highest blood pressure; deficient self-regulatory capability amplified the positive association between agonistic striving and cardiovascular risk in both genders and all ethnic groups. Although anger is thought to increase cardiovascular risk, present findings suggest that anger and elevated blood pressure are coeffects of agonistic struggles to control others.

TI Economic Outcomes in Adulthood and their Associations with Antisocial

AB Background: Conduct disorder (antisocial conduct), attention deficit problems and anxiety in childhood have negative effects on individuals during their childhood, on their families, and often into adulthood.
   Aims of the Study: To quantify the connections between childhood antisocial conduct, attention deficit and anxiety, and some adulthood economic consequences.
   Methods: Data from a British birth cohort study were examined for links between behavioural and emotional problems in childhood, and occupational status and earnings in adulthood, after adjusting for individual and family covariates.
   Results: The effects of antisocial conduct on adult labour market outcomes were complex. Results for males with antisocial conduct at age 10 showed a higher probability of being unemployed at age 30 (after adjustment for other factors). However, males with antisocial conduct at age 10 had higher earnings than those without such behaviour, again after adjusting for other factors. There were no such differences for females with antisocial conduct. Attention deficit problems at age 10 were associated with lower employment rates, worse jobs, lower earnings if employed, and lower expected earnings overall for both males and females. Anxiety problems were associated with lower earnings. Other childhood factors associated with worse adulthood economic outcomes included cognitive attainment, living in a disadvantaged neighbourhood, mother's educational qualifications, family income and being looked after by a local authority.
   Discussion: Links between antisocial conduct and attention deficit in childhood and high adulthood personal and societal costs support arguments for effective interventions to prevent and treat behavioural problems in childhood. However, the cost-effectiveness of such interventions still needs to be considered carefully.
   Implications for Policy: Childhood mental health problems are strongly linked to adverse adulthood experiences across a number of domains. Early detection and intervention might head off many of these negative outcomes for children, their families and wider society. The positive impact of antisocial conduct on earnings needs further examination: it is not necessarily counter-intuitive, but it raises interesting policy questions.
   Implications for Further Research: The long-term outcomes of childhood problems and interventions need further study, as do the pathways connecting childhood morbidity, adulthood outcomes and other potential intervening factors.

AB This study examined the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescents' problem behaviors, moderated by adolescent gender, as well as the association between maternal depressive symptoms and the family environment characteristics above and beyond child variables. Data were collected from 137 mothers of runaway adolescents with alcohol and/or substance abuse problems. Results showed that both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors of adolescent girls, as opposed to problem behaviors of boys, were significantly associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In addition, higher family cohesion was significantly related to lower maternal depressive symptoms even after controlling for adolescent problem behaviors. Howevez; no significant relationship was found between family conflict and maternal depressive symptoms. These,findings indicate that both adolescents' problem behaviors and mothers' perceptions of the family environment are associated with maternal depressive symptoms, highlighting the potential utility of the family systems theoretical framework for understanding and intervening mothers' emotional problems in the family context.

AB Background: Emotion regulation deficits have been consistently linked to psychopathology in cross-sectional studies. However, the direction of the relationship between emotion regulation and psychopathology is unclear. This study examined the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between emotion regulation deficits and psychopathology in adolescents.
   Methods: Emotion dysregulation and symptomatology (depression, anxiety, aggressive behavior, and eating pathology) were assessed in a large, diverse sample of adolescents (N = 1065) at two time points separated by seven months. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of psychopathology.
   Results: The three distinct emotion processes examined here (emotional understanding, dysregulated expression of sadness and anger, and ruminative responses to distress) formed a unitary latent emotion dysregulation factor. Emotion dysregulation predicted increases in anxiety symptoms, aggressive behavior, and eating pathology after controlling for baseline symptoms but did not predict depressive symptoms. In contrast, none of the four types of psychopathology predicted increases in emotion dysregulation after controlling for baseline emotion dysregulation.
   Conclusions: Emotion dysregulation appears to be an important transdiagnostic factor that increases risk for a wide range of psychopathology outcomes in adolescence. These results suggest targets for preventive interventions during this developmental period of risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have revealed evidence for interactions between autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, indexed by saliva alpha amylase (sAA), and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical activity, in predicting psychological functioning. The present study extends this work by examining individual differences in sAA and cortisol stress reactivity in relation to behavioral and emotional adjustment in youth. Participants were 56 healthy children (age 7-16). sAA, cortisol, and other physiological and affective responses were measured before, during, and after stressor tasks (either performance or peer rejection). Basal and stress responsive sAA and cortisol as well as their interactions were assessed in relation to externalizing and internalizing behaviors and trait anxiety. sAA was positively related to anxiety, while sAA reactivity moderated associations between cortisol reactivity and problem behavior. Results highlight the importance of measuring multiple physiological systems to elucidate mechanisms underlying behavioral and emotional dysregulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Previous research has found links between being a victim of bullying and reporting more unhealthy eating behaviours and cognitions, particularly in girls. However, little is known about the factors that might mediate these relationships.
   Aim. The present study compared the relationships between bullying, emotional adjustment, restrained eating, and body dissatisfaction in adolescent boys and girls.
   Sample/method. Self-report data were collected from a sample of 11- to 14-year-olds (N = 376) on experiences of bullying, emotional symptoms, and unhealthy eating and shape-related attitudes and behaviours.
   Results. Bullying, emotional symptoms, restrained eating, and body dissatisfaction were all correlated. Emotional symptoms were found to significantly mediate the relationships between verbal bullying with body dissatisfaction in girls but not in boys.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that the experience of being verbally bullied places adolescent girls at risk of developing emotional problems which can then lead to body dissatisfaction. Longitudinal research is necessary to disentangle these pathways in more detail to facilitate the development of informed interventions to support children who are being bullied.

AB There is considerable evidence that children and adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are at increased risk of anxiety and anxiety disorders. However, it is less clear which of the specific DSM-IV anxiety disorders occur most in this population. The present study used meta-analytic techniques to help clarify this issue. A systematic review of the literature identified 31 studies involving 2,121 young people (aged < 18 years) with ASD, and where the presence of anxiety disorder was assessed using standardized questionnaires or diagnostic interviews. Across studies, 39.6% of young people with ASD had at least one comorbid DSM-IV anxiety disorder, the most frequent being specific phobia (29.8%) followed by OCD (17.4%) and social anxiety disorder (16.6%). Associations were found between the specific anxiety disorders and ASD subtype, age, IQ, and assessment method (questionnaire versus interview). Implications for the identification and treatment of anxiety in young people with ASD are discussed.

AB Self-silencing (or the suppression of expressing one's thoughts, feelings, and needs) can have a negative impact on the mental health of women, from depression to disordered eating behaviors. The authors examined the relationship between self-silencing and disordered eating as well as intuitive eating. The authors also explored whether emotional awareness would moderate these relationships because conflicts over expressiveness are associated with emotional problems and eating disorders. The sample comprised 140 college women (52% White; 36% Black) under the age of 24 from a midwestern urban university. Their results revealed that emotional awareness moderated the relationships between self-silencing and disordered eating and intuitive eating. Specifically, when there were lower levels of emotional awareness, self-silencing with disordered eating and intuitive eating were unrelated; however, with higher levels of emotional awareness together with more self-silencing, participants presented with more disordered eating and less intuitive eating. The findings highlight the importance of supporting women's emotional awareness in conjunction with their expressiveness of thoughts, feelings, and needs to increase intuitive eating and decrease disordered eating.

AB Difficulties with emotion and its regulation are of central importance to the etiology and course of depression. The current study investigated these constructs in relation to childhood and adolescence by comparing the emotional functioning of 170 9- to 15-year-olds reporting high levels of depressive symptoms (HD) to a matched sample of 170 children and adolescents reporting low levels of depressive symptoms (LD). Compared to LD, HD participants reported significantly greater shame proneness, poorer functioning on emotion regulation competencies (emotional control, self-awareness and situational responsiveness), less healthy emotion regulation strategy use (less reappraisal and greater suppression), and lower levels of guilt proneness. Empathic concern did not differ between the two groups. The findings enhance current knowledge by providing a more comprehensive profile of the emotional difficulties experienced by children and adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms.

AB Self-focus can be divided into adaptive and maladaptive aspects, that is, self-reflection and self-rumination respectively. This study explores how these distinctive forms of self-focus are associated with interpersonal skills required for beginning and maintaining social relationships, and with negative emotional regulation when one experiences interpersonal problems. A survey of 150 undergraduates (Study 1) indicated contrasting cross-sectional associations between self-reflection and self-rumination and interpersonal skills; self-rumination is associated with perceived impaired interpersonal skills, whereas self-reflection is associated with the improved skills. In Study 2, using a four-wave longitudinal design, we investigated the buffering effects of self-rumination and self-reflection on negative emotional reactivity to interpersonal conflicts. Analysis of multilevel models indicated that self-rumination predicts a greater increase in negative affect after one experiences negative interpersonal events, whereas self-reflection had no such effects on the negative affect. These results suggest that self-rumination is associated with perceived impaired interpersonal skills, which could delay problem solving and exacerbate the effect of interpersonal problems, thereby leading to dysphoria. In contrast, self-reflection might contribute to the maintenance of relationships in usual or stable conditions but does not aid emotion regulation or problem solving in difficult or negative situations such as when one experiences interpersonal problems.

AB The current study aimed to provide more insight into the role of online chatting in young adults' emotional adjustment. A model was tested that takes into account (a) extraversion of individuals who communicate online, (b) the kind of peers these individuals communicate with online (i.e., online-exclusive peers vs. friends), and (c) the extent to which effects of online chatting on emotional adjustment are mediated by individuals' ability to provide support to others. Young adults (age M = 18.9) filled out questionnaires about themselves and their fellow students at three measurements with a 4-month interval. Results showed that only for less extraverted individuals, chatting with peers found exclusively online directly predicted higher self-esteem and indirectly predicted less depressive symptoms through increases in supportiveness. Thus, results supported a model of social compensation where effects of online chatting with online-exclusive peers improved young adults' emotional adjustment.

AB Background: Questionnaires used by health services to identify children with psychosocial problems are often rather short. The psychometric properties of such short questionnaires are mostly less than needed for an accurate distinction between children with and without problems. We aimed to assess whether a short Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) can overcome the weaknesses of short written questionnaires when identifying children with psychosocial problems.
   Method: We used a Dutch national data set obtained from parents of children invited for a routine health examination by Preventive Child Healthcare with 205 items on behavioral and emotional problems (n = 2,041, response 84%). In a random subsample we determined which items met the requirements of an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to a sufficient degree. Using those items, item parameters necessary for a CAT were calculated and a cut-off point was defined. In the remaining subsample we determined the validity and efficiency of a Computerized Adaptive Test using simulation techniques, with current treatment status and a clinical score on the Total Problem Scale (TPS) of the Child Behavior Checklist as criteria.
   Results: Out of 205 items available 190 sufficiently met the criteria of the underlying IRT model. For 90% of the children a score above or below cut-off point could be determined with 95% accuracy. The mean number of items needed to achieve this was 12. Sensitivity and specificity with the TPS as a criterion were 0.89 and 0.91, respectively.
   Conclusion: An IRT-based CAT is a very promising option for the identification of psychosocial problems in children, as it can lead to an efficient, yet high-quality identification. The results of our simulation study need to be replicated in a real-life administration of this CAT.

AB Little is known about contributors to positive social, behavioral, and emotional adjustment among foreign-born youth at different stages of adapting to life in the United States. Using baseline data from the Adolescent Latino Acculturation Study (N = 217), this article examines the effects of time in residency on parent adjustment, family stress, parenting practices, and youth behavioral and socioemotional outcomes among Latino immigrant parents and youth (Grades 6 to 10) who have lived in the United States between 1 and 12 years. Results of cross-sectional analyses show that immigrant families with less time in residency may experience higher levels of distress that diminish in intensity over time and that youth problem behaviors increase and academic outcomes worsen with increased exposure to life in U.S. society. Time in residency, parent adjustment, and parenting practices each demonstrated unique and unmediated effects on youth outcomes. Results highlight specific vulnerabilities for families in states with emerging immigrant populations that often have few supports for the successful integration of recent immigrant families.

AB Research in mindfulness-based methods with young people is just emerging in the practice/research literature. While much of this literature describes promising approaches that combine mindfulness with cognitive-behavioral therapy, this paper describes an innovative research-based group program that teaches young people in need mindfulness-based methods using arts-based methods. The paper presents qualitative research findings that illustrate how young people in need (children and youth involved with child protection and/or mental health systems) can benefit from a creative approach to mindfulness that can teach them emotional regulation, social and coping skills, and that can improve aspects of their self-awareness, self-esteem, and resilience.

AB Background: To assess whether urban schoolchildren with aggressive behavior are more likely than peers to have symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing.
   Methods: Cross-sectional survey of sleep and behavior in schoolchildren. Validated screening assessments for conduct problems (Connor's rating scale), bullying behavior, and sleep-disordered breathing (pediatric sleep questionnaire) were completed by parents. Teachers completed Connor's teacher rating scale.
   Results: Among 341 subjects (51% female), 110 (32%) were rated by a parent or teacher as having a conduct problem (T-score >= 65) and 78 (23%) had symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing. Children with conduct problems, bullying, or discipline referrals, in comparison to non-aggressive peers, more often had symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing (each p < 0.05). Children with vs. without conduct problems were more likely to snore habitually (p < 0.5). However, a sleepiness subscale alone, and not a snoring subscale, predicted conduct problems after accounting for age, gender, a measure of socioeconomic status, and stimulant use.
   Conclusions: Urban schoolchildren with aggressive behaviors may have symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing with disproportionate frequency. Sleepiness may impair emotional regulation necessary to control aggression. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To determine whether children with hemifacial microsomia (HFM) have higher risk for psychosocial problems than children without HFM. Methods One hundred and thirty-six children with HFM (64% male, mean age 6.9 years) were compared to 568 matched controls (50% male, mean age 7.0 years) on parent and teacher measures of behavior problems and social competence, and teacher rankings of peer acceptance. Results Parents of cases and controls reported similar levels of behavior problems and social competence. Teachers reported higher frequencies of internalizing problems, lower social competence and less peer acceptance for cases. Relative to controls, teacher-rated outcomes were worse for female cases, those with younger mothers at the time of birth, those with eye anomalies, and those with one or more malformations in addition to the core features of HFM. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence of relatively poor psychosocial outcomes among children with HFM.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although many toddlers with expressive vocabulary delay ("late talkers") present with age-appropriate language skills by the time they are of school age, little is known about their broader behavioral and emotional profile. The aim of this study was to determine whether late talkers are at increased risk for behavioral and emotional problems during childhood and adolescence.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study. Early expressive vocabulary was measured by parent report at age 2 years using the Language Development Survey. Late talkers were defined as toddlers who scored at or below the 15th percentile on the Language Development Survey for their gender but were screened not to have any other developmental delays. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to measure problem child behavior with continuous z scores and clinical thresholds at ages 2, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 17 years. Potential confounders included maternal and family sociodemographic characteristics as well as prenatal smoking and alcohol exposure.
   RESULTS: At age 2 years, late talkers (n = 142) had higher Child Behavior Checklist scores (representing poorer behavior) than control toddlers (n = 1245) in total, internalizing, and externalizing scales and higher risk for clinically significant internalizing and externalizing problems. Regression models, incorporating the confounding variables, revealed no association between late-talking status at age 2 years and behavioral and emotional problems at the 5-, 8-, 10-, 14-, and 17-year follow-ups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Expressive vocabulary delay at the age of 2 years is not in itself a risk factor for later behavioral and emotional disturbances. Pediatrics 2011;128:e324-e332

AB Fatigue is a common complaint among adolescents. We investigated the course of fatigue in females during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood and examined psychological, immunological, and life style risk factors for development of fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)-related symptoms. Six hundred and thirty-three healthy females (age 14.63 +/- 1.37 years) filled out questionnaires measuring fatigue severity, depressive symptoms, anxiety, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)-related symptoms, sleep features, and life style characteristics at baseline and 41/2 years thereafter. Of 64 participants LPS- and CD2CD28-induced cytokine data at baseline were available. The best predictor of fatigue in young adulthood was previous fatigue severity. In participants who were non-fatigued during adolescence and who experienced a notable increase in fatigue, fatigue development was preceded by emotional problems and CFS-related complaints during adolescence. Increases as well as decreases in fatigue severity were accompanied by respectively increase and decrease in depressive symptoms and anxiety, suggesting that these symptoms cluster and co-vary over time. Higher interferon (1FN)-gamma, higher IFN-gamma/interleukin (IL)-4 ratio, lower tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lower IL-10 at baseline were related to fatigue severity at follow up. The rise in total number of CFS-related symptoms at follow up was predicted by anxiety and decreased physical activity during adolescence. Sleep and substance use were associated with fatigue severity and anxiety and depression. In conclusion, vulnerability to develop fatigue and associated symptoms in young adulthood can to a certain extent be identified already years before the manifestation of complaints.

AB This study examined relations between cardiac reactivity, family violence exposure (i.e., child maltreatment [CM] and interpartner violence [IPV]), and preschool children's emotional adjustment. A sample of 92 mother-preschooler dyads was drawn from predominantly low-income, rural communities. Dyads participated in a laboratory session in which children's Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring occurred during a resting baseline, joint-challenge, and individual emotional and cognitive tasks. Mothers consented to review of Children & Youth Services (CYS) records for CM and completed an IPV measure. Mothers rated children's emotional adjustment, and observers rated children on their frustration and positive affect. Children's vagal suppression was shown to moderate relations between family violence exposure and emotional adjustment. Findings indicated that children greater in vagal suppression showed better emotional adjustment when from families low in violence. However, regardless of children's level of vagal suppression, all children showed poorer emotional adjustment when from families high in violence.

AB Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are associated with antisocial and delinquent behaviors in children and represent a potential risk factor for adult psychopathy. However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research that explores the development of these traits, their longitudinal association with conduct problems (CP), and their psychosocial predictors and outcomes. Using a large sample of children followed longitudinally from the Twins Early Development Study (N = 9,578), we described the joint developmental trajectories of CU traits and CP during childhood (between ages 7 and 12) and examined the child- and family-level predictors (4 years old) and concomitant outcomes (12 years old) associated with the trajectories. The developmental trajectories were characterized with teachers' ratings of CU traits and CP from ages 7 to 12. Using general growth mixture modeling, we identified four trajectories of CU traits (stable high, increasing, decreasing, and stable low) and two trajectories of CP (high and low). Compared with the children who followed a low trajectory of CU traits and CP, those who followed a high trajectory of CU traits and CP had more negative child- and family-level predictors at 4 years (including CP, hyperactivity, negative parental discipline, and chaos in the home). Children with high or increasing levels of CU traits and concomitant high levels of CP presented the most negative outcomes at 12 years (including hyperactivity, peer problems, emotional problems, and negative parental feelings). Children with high CU traits and concomitant high levels of CP in childhood should be prioritized for targeted intervention.

AB Introduction. Puberty suppression by means of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) is used for young transsexuals between 12 and 16 years of age. The purpose of this intervention is to relieve the suffering caused by the development of secondary sex characteristics and to provide time to make a balanced decision regarding actual gender reassignment.
   Aim. To compare psychological functioning and gender dysphoria before and after puberty suppression in gender dysphoric adolescents.
   Methods. Of the first 70 eligible candidates who received puberty suppression between 2000 and 2008, psychological functioning and gender dysphoria were assessed twice: at T0, when attending the gender identity clinic, before the start of GnRHa; and at T1, shortly before the start of cross-sex hormone treatment.
   Main Outcome Measures. Behavioral and emotional problems (Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth-Self Report), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety and anger (the Spielberger Trait Anxiety and Anger Scales), general functioning (the clinician's rated Children's Global Assessment Scale), gender dysphoria (the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale), and body satisfaction (the Body Image Scale) were assessed.
   Results. Behavioral and emotional problems and depressive symptoms decreased, while general functioning improved significantly during puberty suppression. Feelings of anxiety and anger did not change between T0 and T1. While changes over time were equal for both sexes, compared with natal males, natal females were older when they started puberty suppression and showed more problem behavior at both T0 and T1. Gender dysphoria and body satisfaction did not change between T0 and T1. No adolescent withdrew from puberty suppression, and all started cross-sex hormone treatment, the first step of actual gender reassignment.
   Conclusion. Puberty suppression may be considered a valuable contribution in the clinical management of gender dysphoria in adolescents. de Vries ALC, Steensma TD, Doreleijers TAH, and Cohen-Kettenis PT.

AB Social cognition is the collection of cognitive processes required to understand and interact with others. The term 'social brain' refers to the network of brain regions that underlies these processes. Recent evidence suggests that a number of social cognitive functions continue to develop during adolescence, resulting in age differences in tasks that assess cognitive domains including face processing, mental state inference and responding to peer influence and social evaluation. Concurrently, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show differences between adolescent and adult groups within parts of the social brain. Understanding the relationship between these neural and behavioural observations is a challenge. This review discusses current research findings on adolescent social cognitive development and its functional MRI correlates, then integrates and interprets these findings in the context of hypothesised developmental neurocognitive and neurophysiological mechanisms.

AB This study aimed to determine levels of behaviour problem in primary school children, and to explore key determinants relevant to the Chinese context: being an only child, urban living, school stressors, being bullied and physical punishment.
   We administered a child self-completion questionnaire to children aged 7-13 and Rutter Parent Scales to their parents in nine primary schools, in urban and rural Zhejiang Province, eastern China.
   Full data were available for 2,203 child-parent pairs. Rutter Scores showed that 13.2% of the children (16.4% of boys, 9.4% of girls) had a behaviour problem. Girls manifest more emotional problems (5.3 vs. 2.3%) and boys more conduct problems. Questions about school stress showed that 78% worry "a lot" about exams, 80% felt pressure to perform at school "all the time", and 44% were bullied at least sometimes. Seventy-one percent were sometimes or often physically punished by their parents. Conduct problems were strongly significantly associated with male gender (OR 3.8 95% CI 3.0-4.6), rural residence OR 2.3, 1.3-3.4, having been bullied (1.8, 1.5-2.2) and frequent physical punishment (4.5, 3.2-5.8). Emotional problems were most strongly associated with being bullied (OR 4.9, 2.3-7.7). Being an only child was not associated with behaviour problems.
   High levels of behaviour problems in these Chinese children could relate to high expectations in a very competitive educational environment. Our results raise concerns for the future mental well-being of those children with behaviour problems.

AB Associations between individual- and family-level psychosocial factors and sexual behavior were examined among 325 adolescents ages 10-18 in rural Kenya. History of sexual activity was reported by 51% of males and 30% of females. Among those reporting sex within the past year, 64% of males and 32% of females had multiple partners; 85% of males and 54% of females reported not using a condom at last sex. Multivariate logistic regression modeling demonstrated sexually active adolescents were significantly more likely to be older, male, more accepting of risky behavior, and have greater perceived HIV risk, caregiver social support, social support related to HIV, and emotional problems. Youths reporting high-risk behavior (unprotected sex or multiple partners) were significantly more likely to be younger, male, and have lower sex-related self-efficacy, lower caregiver monitoring, and more externalizing problems. Future studies should evaluate HIV prevention interventions targeting improvements in mental health and family relationships.

AB Research suggests that parenting styles are related to the types of discipline parents utilize and that the coupling of parenting styles and discipline techniques are related to child outcomes. Although extant research examines the effects of parenting styles and discipline on child and early adolescent adjustment, less is known about adjustment in late adolescents, also described as emerging adults. Thus, the current study investigated the relationships among parenting styles (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), discipline strategies (e.g., non-violent discipline, psychological aggression, physical assault), and emerging adult emotional adjustment (e.g., self-esteem, depression, and anxiety). The sample consisted of 526 participants ranging in age from 18 to 22 years. Results were analyzed with structural equation modeling and suggest that, although perceived parenting styles and discipline are both correlated with emerging adult emotional adjustment, perceived parenting is associated with emerging adult emotional adjustment for females but not males when examined simultaneously with perceived discipline. This finding demonstrates the importance of examining the direct and indirect relationships in the context of gender dyads.

AB Speculation continues regarding the accurate classification of selective mutism and potential etiologic factors. Current research has shed some light on several factors that may predispose some children to this disorder, but conclusions are difficult to draw due to reliance on subjective measures, few comparison groups, and/or limited theoretical grounding. This article provides an update on recent efforts to elucidate the etiologic pathways of selective mutism and on the current debate regarding its strong overlap with anxiety disorders, most notably social phobia. An additional attempt is made to examine findings based on a developmental perspective that accounts for multiple pathways, context, and the developmental stage of the child. Emotion regulation theory is offered as a potential factor in why some children may be more vulnerable to the etiologic factors described. Suggestions for future research are offered based on this integration of information.

AB Inactivity, Obesity and Mental Health in the Spanish Population from 4 to 15 Years of Age
   Background: An active lifestyle and a good weight status are two major health determinants from a public health perspective. Aim: To evaluate the degree of association between physical activity, weight status and the emotional and mental health of Spanish schoolchildren.
   Method: Mental health status was assessed through the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), also leisure time physical activity and body mass index (BMI) in a total of 6 803 children from 4 to 15 years participating in the Spanish National Health Survey 2006. The degree of association between. these variables was estimated by a multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among sedentary schoolchildren are more common mental health problems (OR 2.10), emotional problems (OR 1.84), conduct problems (OR 1.53), problems with peers (OR 2.35) and social relationship difficulties (OR 1.36). Obesity is associated with poor general mental health (OR 1.58), and obese schoolchildren show more often emotional problems (OR 1.52) and problems with peers (OR 2.43).
   Conclusions: In the Spanish schoolchildren, a healthy BMI is associated with increased mental well-being, although an active lifestyle is the best indicator of a good mental health status.

AB Objective: To determine whether externalizing behaviors are more prevalent in youth who have experienced an episode of malnutrition in the first year of life than in healthy comparison youth.
   Method: Parents of previously malnourished youth and a matched healthy comparison group completed a behavior rating scale when the youth were 9-15 years of age and again, 2 years later, when they were 11-17 years of age. Longitudinal multiple regression analysis was applied to evaluate group differences adjusted for baseline age, sex, household standard of living, and maternal depressive symptoms.
   Results: Early childhood malnutrition was associated with problems in executive functioning at both occasions. Malnutrition also predicted discernibly higher parent-reported levels of aggression toward peers at 9-15 years than at 11-17 years. These findings were independent of baseline age, sex, household standard of living, and maternal depressive symptoms. Problem behaviors in general decreased during follow-up.
   Conclusion: Parents report persisting problems with executive functioning through adolescence in youth who suffered an episode of moderate-to-severe protein-energy malnutrition in the first year of life, while reports of aggression, although more common when this cohort were younger, did not persist at follow-up.

AB Anxiety, mood and somatoform disorders are among the most prevalent forms of psychological suffering during childhood and adolescence. If untreated, these problems can be predictors of more severe disorders in adulthood. New trends in clinical psychology suggest the relevance of focusing on child's competencies and developing optimal functioning in youth. A specific psychotherapeutic strategy for enhancing well-being (Well-Being Therapy; WBT) has been developed for adult patients and it was found to be effective in determining remission from affective symptoms, in improving psychological well-being and in preventing relapses. In this article we describe a modified form of WBT which has been applied for the first time to children suffering from emotional and behavioral disorders in order to test its feasibility and potential effects in reducing symptoms and in improving new skills. Four cases particularly interesting by a clinical point of view are reported. This new therapeutic approach, based on the promotion of psychological well-being seems to be a very promising intervention: children improved at post treatment and during 1 year follow-up, both in symptomatology and in social skills. The promotion of psychological well-being and optimal functioning is an innovative and relevant ingredient and could play an important role in the treatment of somatic and psychosocial symptoms in paediatric settings.

AB As public and professional attention to outcome and evaluation research grows, focus community remains centered on the question, "Does this treatment work or not?" Consequently, much less emphasis is given to what exactly it means for a treatment to be effective. This article examines 5 issues relevant to whether an intervention is deemed successful or not: (a) Sponsorship: Who generates the empirical evidence? (b) Sensitivity: How deep does the evidence gathering go? (c) Scope: Over what time period does the evidence span? (d) Source: According to which data is a determination reached? (e) Fairness: How seriously are negative cases examined? After exploring each issue, larger implications for youth treatment are discussed. Ultimately, we propose that current trends warrant more thoughtful deliberation and education among citizens and practitioners about treatment outcomes generally.

AB Background: Adolescents with a chronic somatic disease often show comorbid mental health problems which interfere with adherence and disease management. As adolescents often pass their rehabilitation treatment without their parents and therapists frequently lack resources necessary for assessing information from both the patients and their parents, the question arises what conclusions can be drawn on the basis of self report data only and how general agreement between parent and adolescents can be rated.
   Methods: Parent-child-agreement of chronically ill adolescents and their families are analyzed using intra-class-correlation (ICC). Data of 367 adolescents with obesity, chronic respiratory disease, skin disease and diabetes between the age of 12.0 and 16.11 years were collected at the beginning of rehabilitation treatment. Parents received their questionnaire via post. Psychological symptoms were identified using the German version of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Deu).
   Results: There was medium to high agreement between parent and child ratings regarding "emotional problems", "peer relationship problems" and "total difficulty score" for all diagnoses.
   Conclusions: Therapists of chronically ill adolescents can act on the assumption that parent-child-agreement is medium to high. Consequently, self-ratings appear a useful diagnostic indicator for rehabilitation treatment.

Methods: Treatment efficacy of 28 long-term treatments with adolescents were analyzed from the perspective of the afflicted adolescents, their parents, and their therapist. Assessments were made three times over a mean frequency of 113 h. Results: Therapy group (n = 28) and waiting group (n = 32) did not differ in relevant features, including diagnosis. In the therapy group, the therapists reported a strong reduction in symptomatology (eta(2) = .62) and communicative disturbances with parents, siblings and friends (eta(2) = .57) over time. Adolescents and parents reported a significant reduction in symptomatology (eta(2) = .26) over time, but did not differ in their evaluation of treatment effectiveness. The diagnosis (internalizing vs. externalizing disturbances) had no impact on the evaluation of treatment effectiveness of adolescents and parents. Conclusions: Psychotherapy should include the different perspectives of all persons involved.

ID DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY; COMORBIDITY
AB Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood. Although some symptoms of ADHD may diminish this does not mean that functioning is unimpaired in adults. Follow-up studies of children with ADHD show that it persists into adulthood in the majority of cases. Due to genetic factors high rates of ADHD exist among the parents of children with ADHD. More females are identified and become diagnosed in adulthood. There is a greater persistence of inattentive than of hyperactive/impulsive childhood symptoms of ADHD in adulthood. Some experts conceptualise ADHD as primarily a deficit of executive functions impairing planification, time perception and emotional regulation. ADHD often presents as a lifelong condition in adults associated with a range of clinical and psychosocial impairments. Young adults with comorbid antisocial or substance use disorder in adolescence are at significantly increased risk for criminal behaviors. Some predictor's of the outcome have been identified such as childhood symptom profile and severity, comorbidity and childhood family adversities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

   POPULATION SURVEY; ADOLESCENTS; DEPRESSION
AB Purpose: In this population-based study we wanted to assess the prevalence and impact of psychiatric symptoms in children with epilepsy compared to controls, and investigate possible age and gender differences.
   Methods: Data were collected using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent report (SDQ-P) as part of a more extensive questionnaire. A total of 14,699 parents of children aged 8-13 years (response rate 78%) participated. Associations between SDQ scores and epilepsy, other chronic disease, age, gender, and socioeconomic factors were explored using logistic regression analysis.
   Key Findings: Children with epilepsy (CWE) (n = 110) had a significantly higher frequency of psychiatric symptoms (37.8% vs. 17.0% in controls, p < 0.001). Gender differences were found in several subscales of the SDQ; girls had more emotional problems, whereas boys had higher scores regarding peer relationship and hyperactivity/inattention problems. Male gender, low socioeconomic status (family income below poverty limit and living in a single parent home), and other chronic disease (asthma/diabetes) were independent risk factors of developing psychiatric symptoms, along with epilepsy. Having or having had epilepsy was, however, a much stronger risk factor for developing psychiatric symptoms in girls than in boys [odds ratio (OR) 4.2 vs. OR 2.3]. A minor effect of age was seen only in girls with epilepsy, with an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms in age group 10-13 years (OR 1.28 for scoring borderline/abnormal on SDQ-total difficulties). Borderline/abnormal impact scores were found in 31.8% of CWE compared with 13.0% of controls (p < 0.001).
   Significance: Multiple risk factors contribute to the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in CWE, perhaps differently in boys and girls. Awareness of this complex interaction may help target intervention toward high risk groups and thus prevent more serious problems from arising.

AB In 398 twin pairs belonging to the population-based Italian Registry, we investigated by the monozygotic twin intrapair differences model and bivariate designs whether the phenotypic correlations between CBCL/6-18 problem behaviours and competencies could better be accounted for by direct, causal effects, or by the presence of latent etiological factors, acting simultaneously as elements of risk/protection for psychopathology and competencies. All zero-order correlations between six CBCL DSM-oriented scales (DOS) and three competence scales (CS) were negative and small-to-moderate. After implementing multiple regressions we found robust enough prediction only for ADH DOS on school CS, and for anxiety DOS on social CS. Results from the intrapair differences model indicated shared elements of liability, rather than direct causation, as more likely explanations for the negative phenotypic correlations between these emotional/behavioural problem and competencies scores. Bivariate analyses indicated shared genetic factors that influence simultaneously the emotional/behavioural problems and the competencies domains as the best explanations for the phenotypic covariations between DOS and CS.

AB The ability to regulate one's emotions is critical to mental health and well-being, and is impaired in a wide range of psychopathologies, some of which initially manifest in childhood or adolescence. Cognitive reappraisal is a particular approach to emotion regulation frequently utilized in behavioral psychotherapies. Despite a wealth of research on cognitive reappraisal in adults, little is known about the developmental trajectory of brain mechanisms subserving this form of emotion regulation in children. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we asked children and adolescents to up- and down-regulate their response to disgusting images, as the experience of disgust has been linked to anxiety disorders. We demonstrate distinct patterns of brain activation during successful up- and down-regulation of emotion, as well as an inverse correlation between activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and limbic structures during down-regulation, suggestive of a potential regulatory role for vmPFC. Further, we show age-related effects on activity in PFC and amygdala. These findings have important clinical implications for the understanding of cognitive-based therapies in anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Why do some adolescents respond to interpersonal conflicts vengefully, whereas others seek more positive solutions? Three studies investigated the role of implicit theories of personality in predicting violent or vengeful responses to peer conflicts among adolescents in Grades 9 and 10. They showed that a greater belief that traits are fixed (an entity theory) predicted a stronger desire for revenge after a variety of recalled peer conflicts (Study I) and after a hypothetical conflict that specifically involved bullying (Study 2). Study 3 experimentally induced a belief in the potential for change (an incremental theory), which resulted in a reduced desire to seek revenge. This effect was mediated by changes in bad-person attributions about the perpetrators, feelings of shame and hatred, and the belief that vengeful ideation is an effective emotion-regulation strategy. Together, the findings illuminate the social cognitive processes underlying reactions to conflict and suggest potential avenues for reducing violent retaliation in adolescents.

AB There is evidence of a long-term rise in the prevalence of adolescent emotional problems in the UK and in other countries. The aim of this study was to test whether time trends in parents' emotional difficulties contributed to these increases using data from two national surveys of English teenagers and parents studied twenty years apart (1986 and 2006). The 1986 sample is the age 16 follow-up of the 1970 British Cohort Study (N = 4524 adolescents, N = 7169 parents). The 2006 sample included 16/17-year-olds and their parents drawn from the 2002 and 2003 Health Surveys for England (N = 711). Both studies used identical self-complete questionnaire assessments of adolescent (GHQ-12 and Malaise Inventory) and parent (Malaise) symptoms of depression and anxiety. Follow-up data on emotional problems and psychiatric service use at age 30 years (N = 2785) for adolescents in the first cohort was used to validate the role of parent emotional problems as risk factors for offspring mental health. We found that maternal emotional problems increased across all socio-demographic groups between 1986 and 2006, mirroring increases in adolescent emotional problems over this period. They were cross-sectionally and prospectively associated with adolescent emotional problems. Cohort differences in adolescent emotional problems were attenuated when accounting for the increase in maternal emotional problems. Rising rates of maternal emotional problems have likely contributed to, but do not fully explain, recent time trends in adolescent emotional problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To investigate gender differences in how emotional and behavioural problems (hyperactivity, emotional problems, and conduct problems) and maternal psychological distress, all measured at three time points in childhood (ages 5, 10, and 16), predict psychological distress in adult life (age 30).
   Longitudinal data from 10,444 cohort members of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) were used.
   Emotional problems in adolescence tended to be more strongly associated with adult psychological distress in men than in women. No gender differences in the association of adult psychological distress with maternal psychological distress in adolescence were found. In childhood and adolescence boys' externalizing behaviour problems tended to show more homotypic continuity than girls', but all heterotypic continuity (although very little) of behaviour problems was seen in girls. Maternal psychological distress in childhood tended to have a stronger effect on girls' than boys' emotional problems in adolescence.
   In general there was little evidence for gender differences either in the association of adult psychological distress with adolescent psychopathology or in the association of adult psychological distress with maternal psychological distress in adolescence. The continuity of emotional problems from childhood to adolescence to adult life was strong and similar for both sexes.

AB This study examined the role of the level and variability of happiness, anger, anxiety, and sadness in the development of adolescent-reported anxiety disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, and aggressive behavior in 452 adolescents (250 male) followed from age 13 to 14. Level and between-day variability of emotions were assessed through adolescent report at 3-month intervals across a 1 year period. Level and variability of the four emotions contributed to changes in anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms more consistently than to changes in aggressive behavior. All four emotions were predictive of changes in internalizing problems, while anger played the most prominent role in the development of aggressive behavior. Variability of emotions contributed to changes in anxiety disorder symptoms, while heightened levels of negative emotions and diminished happiness contributed to changes in depression. Results suggested somewhat stronger effects of negative affect on aggressive behavior for females than for males. Results underscore the role of emotion dysregulation in the development of psychopathology.

AB The study investigated the moderating role of emotion regulation (ER) in relationships between body image concerns and psychological symptomatology. A community sample of 533 boys and girls (11-20 years) completed measures assessing body image thoughts and feelings, domain-specific and general ER strategies, drive for thinness, and bulimic, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results indicated that ER moderated relationships between body image concerns and both bulimic and depressive symptoms, but not relationships between body image concerns and drive for thinness or anxiety symptoms. Adolescents who reported frequent body image concerns were more likely to have higher levels of bulimic symptoms if they tended to use avoidance and internal dysfunctional ER strategies. Furthermore, adolescents who reported frequent body image concerns were more likely to have higher levels of depressive symptoms if they used positive rational acceptance and internal functional strategies infrequently. Implications of the findings for prevention and intervention are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Several lines of evidence suggest that bipolar disorder is associated with progressive changes in gray matter volume (GMV), particularly in brain structures involved in emotional regulation and expression. The majority of these studies however, have been cross-sectional in nature. In this study we compared baseline and follow-up scans in groups of bipolar disorder and healthy subjects. We hypothesized bipolar disorder subjects would demonstrate significant GMV changes over time.
   Methods: A total of 58 bipolar disorder and 48 healthy subjects participated in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subjects were rescanned 3-34 months after their baseline MRI. MRI images were segmented, normalized to standard stereotactic space, and compared voxel-by-voxel using statistical parametrical mapping software (SPM2). A model was developed to investigate differences in GMV at baseline, and associated with time and episodes, as well as in comparison to healthy subjects.
   Results: We observed increases in GMV in bipolar disorder subjects across several brain regions at baseline and over time, including portions of the prefrontal cortex as well as limbic and subcortical structures. Time-related changes differed to some degree between adolescent and adult bipolar disorder subjects. The interval between scans positively correlated with GMV increases in bipolar disorder subjects in portions of the prefrontal cortex, and both illness duration and number of depressive episodes were associated with increased GMV in subcortical and limbic structures.
   Conclusions: Our findings support suggestions that widely observed progressive neurofunctional changes in bipolar disorder patients may be related to structural brain abnormalities in anterior limbic structures. Abnormalities largely involve regions previously noted to be integral to emotional expression and regulation, and appear to vary by age.

AB Objective. To determine the relative importance of familial, dietary, behavioral, psychological and social risk factors for predicting body mass index (BMI) change, and onset of overweight and obesity among adolescent girls. Methods. Data from the NHLBI Growth and Health Study (n = 2 150), a longitudinal cohort of girls, were used to identify the most important predictors of change in BMI percentile between the ages of 9 and 19 years, and second, risk for becoming overweight and obese. Forty-one baseline predictors were assessed using a tree-based regression method (Random forest) to rank the relative importance of risk factors. Results. The five factors that best predicted change in BMI percentile (p < 0.05) were related to family socio-economic position (income and parent education) and drive to restrict eating and weight (body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and unhappiness with physical appearance). The factors that were statistically significant (p < 0.05) predictors of both onset of overweight and obesity were income, ineffectiveness and race. Conclusions. Family socio-economic position and emotion regulation appeared as the top predictors of both BMI change and onset of overweight and obesity. Our results build upon prior findings that policies to prevent the onset of obesity during adolescence be targeted towards girls from lower socio-economic position households. Our findings also suggest several novel psychological factors including ineffectiveness as predictors of obesity during adolescence. These predictive findings offer a direction for future inquiry into adolescent obesity etiology using causal methods.

AB BACKGROUND: This study evaluated stress management training to improve mental health, social interaction and family function among adolescents of families with one Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive member.
   METHODS: There were 34 adolescents (13-18 years old) with at least one family member living with HIV from whom finally 15 attended the study and participated in 8 weekly sessions of stress management training. The tests used in this study were: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (self and parent report), General Health Questionnare-28 (GHQ-28) and Family Assessment Device (FAD), conducted before, after and three months after the intervention. The collected data were analyzed by repeated measure test using SPSS software (Version 18.0).
   RESULTS: Adolescents with one HIV positive family member showed high level of emotional problem (40%) and conduct problem (33.3%). There was a significant difference between before, after and 3months after intervention based on GHQ-28 mean scores and FAD mean sores (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference between mean scores of peers' relationship based on SDQ (self report and parents report forms) before and after intervention, but there was no significant difference between mean scores of pro social behavior based on SDQ (self report and parents report forms) in all three stages (before, after and three months after intervention).
   CONCLUSIONS: Stress management training is effective in improving mental health, family function and social interaction among adolescents living with parents infected with HIV/AIDS.

   YOUTH
AB Inattention, motor instability, and impulsivity, associated in varying degrees of severity depending on the clinical subtype, constitute the key symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, emotional symptoms are frequent in patients with AD 111) and may, in some cases, be responsible for a major part of the negative impact on functioning and outcome. Emotional problems have been described in ADHD even in the absence of characterized comorbid conditions such as depressive or anxiety disorders. They can manifest acutely in the form of severe tantrums and aggressive behaviour, generally in reaction to an environmental trigger, or show a more chronic course of irritable or labile aloud. Symptoms of emotional undercontrol seem to occur more frequently when ADHD is associated with oppositional defiant behaviour, but they are not specific and may contribute to difficulties in making a differential diagnosis, especially with bipolar disorder and prodromal symptoms of personality disorders. The frequency and negative impact of emotional symptoms and the need to differentiate them from bipolar disorder has led some authors to the description of a novel clinical entity called "severe mood dysregulation" or "temper dysregulation with dysphoria." This article aims to review the recent literature on emotional symptoms associated with ADHD and to discuss relevant clinical and biological issues. Current research highlights the links between emotional self-regulation and executive functions and possible involvement of motivational systems. The role of environmental factors in the development of emotional regulation and self-control is another important issue, especially because environmental modification is the major focus of current preventive and therapeutic interventions.

AB Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and persistent worrying. Neural substrates of this disorder are insufficiently understood, which relates to functional as well as to structural brain abnormalities. Especially, findings on the neuroanatomy of GAD have been inconsistent and were predominantly derived from pediatric samples. Therefore, we studied adult patients. Thirty-one women (16 patients with GAD and 15 healthy control participants) underwent structural MRI scanning. Gray matter volumes for specific brain regions involved in worrying, anticipatory anxiety, and emotion regulation were analyzed by means of voxel-based morphometry. Relative to controls, patients with GAD had larger volumes of the amygdala and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). Moreover, patients' self-reports on symptom severity were positively correlated with volumes of the DMPFC and the anterior cingulate cortex. Patients with GAD show localized gray matter volume differences in brain regions associated with anticipatory anxiety and emotion regulation. This abnormality may represent either a predisposition for GAD or a consequence of disorder-specific behavior, such as chronic worrying. This issue should be addressed in future MRI studies.

AB In early adolescence, attachment security reflects not only the quality of ongoing relationships with parents, but also how adolescents process social relationships with "others" - that is, their "social value orientation" - with possible implications for adolescents' risk-taking. In this study, a sample of Italian early adolescents were administered self-report measures in order to examine the relationships (a) between early adolescents' perceived attachment security to mothers and fathers, social values (related to family and the sociocultural context), and sensation seeking (as a temperamental predisposition to risk-taking), and (b) between these variables and adolescents' externalizing problem behaviour. Adolescents were more securely attached to the same-sexed parent. Further, attachment security with the opposite-sexed parent predicted more conservative social value orientations, and lower levels of problem behaviour. In contrast, sensation seeking predicted self-enhancement and openness-to-change values to a greater extent, and, in girls, lower levels of attachment security to mothers and fathers.

AB In a structural model, we tested how relations of predictors to level of adolescent substance use (tobacco, alcohol, marijuana), and to substance-related impaired-control and behavior problems, are moderated by good self-control and poor regulation in behavioral and emotional domains. The participants were a sample of 1,116 public high-school students. In a multiple-group analysis for good self-control, the paths from negative life events to substance use level and from level to behavior problems were lower among persons scoring higher on good behavioral self-control. In a multiple-group analysis for poor regulation, the paths from negative life events and peer use to level of substance use were greater among persons scoring higher on poor behavioral (but not emotional) regulation; an inverse path from academic competence to level was greater among persons scoring higher on both aspects of poor regulation. Paths from level to impaired-control and behavior problems were greater among persons scoring higher on both poor behavioral and poor emotional regulation. Theoretical implications concerning the role of behavioral and emotional regulation in moderation effects are discussed.

AB The BASC-2 Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS) Student Form (Kamphaus & Reynolds, 2007) is a recently developed youth self-report rating scale designed to identify students at risk for behavioral and emotional problems. The BESS Student Form was derived from the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition Self-Report of Personality (BASC-2 SRP; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) using principal component analytic procedures and theoretical considerations. Using 3 samples, the authors conducted exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to understand the underlying factor structure of the BESS Student Form. The results of the EFA suggested that the SRP contained a 4-factor (i.e., Personal Adjustment, Inattention/Hyperactivity, Internalizing, School Problems) emergent structure, which was supported by CFA in 2 additional samples. Practical and research implications are discussed.

AB Impulsivity is inherent to both problem gambling and ADHD. The purpose of this study is to examine ADHD key symptoms, and gambling behaviors and problem severity among adolescents. Additionally, internalizing and externalizing behaviors exhibited among these individuals and the role of these symptoms in gambling are examined. We used a cross-sectional study design and survey 1,130 adolescents aged 12-19. Results indicated that adolescents who screened positive for ADHD were significantly more likely than non-ADHD adolescents to engage in gambling and significantly more likely to develop gambling problems. Those who screened positive as predominantly inattentive and those who screened positive for ADHD Combined (Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity) were equally likely to gamble, but the latter were twice as likely to have gambling problems. However, we found no significant interaction between the key ADHD symptoms and gambling as the severity of hyperactivity-impulsivity or inattention did not significantly differ with respect to gambling pathology. Emotional problems and depressive affect were the only variables that could significantly differentiate the ADHD types and gambling severity. Our Results highlight the clinical importance of considering the subtype of ADHD among gamblers and the greater association of depressive affect and emotional problems with gambling among adolescents.

AB Although childhood generalized anxiety disorder is generally understudied, worry, the cardinal feature of GAD, appears to be relatively common in youth. Despite its prevalence, there are few conceptual models of the development of clinical worry in children. The current review provides a framework for integrating the developmental psychopathology perspective, models of worry in adults, and data available on worry in children. General risk factors for the development of worry are considered, as well as potential pathways including genetics, temperament, cognitive, emotional and parenting influences, as well as the influence of cognitive development. Based on this review, it appears unlikely that main effects models will be able to explain the development of GAD or clinical worry in children and that a broad, complex model incorporating a number of factors and their interactions will best describe etiological and maintaining factors. With this perspective in mind, a number of suggestions for future work are offered.

AB Background:
   High rates of psychopathology were found amongst deaf adolescents, but little is known about the psychosocial risk factors. This study investigated whether (1) less severe deafness and/or acquired or otherwise complicated deafness, and (2) having mainly contacts with hearing people, each represent chronic stressful conditions that moderate the associations between self-esteem and emotional problems. In addition, the moderating effect of observed peer rejection on the association between social acceptance and behavioural problems was explored.
   Method:
   Deaf adolescents of normal intelligence (N = 68) completed the Self Perception Profile for Adolescents. Psychopathology was assessed using a semi-structured interview with adolescents and reports by parents, teachers and expert ratings. Data on moderator variables were collected from school records, parental and teachers' reports.
   Results:
   Emotional mental health problems were negatively associated with self-esteem and positively with peer rejection. The association between self-esteem and emotional problems was moderated by the deafness variable less severe deafness or acquired or otherwise complicated deafness. Behavioural mental health problems were positively associated with social acceptance and peer rejection but negatively with the amount of involvement with hearing people. Peer rejection moderated the association between social acceptance and behavioural problems.
   Conclusions:
   The findings emphasise the importance of considering self-concept dimensions, peer problems and deafness- and context-related characteristics when assessing and treating deaf adolescents.

AB Objective: To examine the extent to which self-regulation skills of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D), including executive functioning and emotion regulation, relate to treatment adherence and glycemic control.
   Method: Participants were 109 adolescents aged 12-18 yr with TID and their primary caregiver who attended an outpatient appointment at a pediatric endocrinology clinic. Parents and adolescents completed a measure of treatment adherence. Parents completed a self-regulation measure while a glycemic control measure [i.e., hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)] was collected.
   Results: For boys, executive functioning and emotion regulation deficits were significantly associated with worse treatment adherence and glycemic control. Further analyses indicated that emotion regulation was the primary self-regulation measure related to treatment adherence and glycemic control. No significant associations were found for girls.
   Conclusion: For adolescent boys, the ability to cope with various stressors and emotions may be as important as higher-order thinking skills for maximizing treatment adherence and diabetes control. Clinical implications and potential mechanisms by which emotion regulation skills relate to adolescent boys' diabetes treatment management are discussed.

   INFORMATION
AB The aim of this study was to test for gender differences in how negative cognitive errors (overgeneralizing, catastrophizing, selective abstraction, and personalizing) mediate the association between adverse life events and adolescents' emotional and behavioural problems (measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). The sample consisted of 202 boys and 227 girls (aged 11-15 years) from three state secondary schools in disadvantaged areas in one county in the South East of England. Control variables were age, ethnicity, special educational needs, exclusion history, family structure, family socio-economic disadvantage, and verbal cognitive ability. Adverse life events were measured with <link rid="b43">Tiet et al.'s (1998) Adverse Life Events Scale. For both genders, we assumed a pathway from adverse life events to emotional and behavioural problems via cognitive errors. We found no gender differences in life adversity, cognitive errors, total difficulties, peer problems, or hyperactivity. In both boys and girls, even after adjustment for controls, cognitive errors were related to total difficulties and emotional symptoms, and life adversity was related to total difficulties and conduct problems. The life adversity/conduct problems association was not explained by negative cognitive errors in either gender. However, we found gender differences in how adversity and cognitive errors produced hyperactivity and internalizing problems. In particular, life adversity was not related, after adjustment for controls, to hyperactivity in girls and to peer problems and emotional symptoms in boys. Cognitive errors fully mediated the effect of life adversity on hyperactivity in boys and on peer and emotional problems in girls.

AB Although emotion and its regulation have been linked to children's general psychopathology, it has only recently been studied in relation to childhood anxiety disorders. In this study, the authors examine the relationship between various inputs of emotion regulation and anxiety in a clinical sample of youth. Participants (N = 112) were administered a battery of questionnaires that assessed for negative emotionality, emotion expression style, and familial affective expression. Participants also took part in a structured diagnostic interview to assess for clinical levels of anxiety. Results of standard multiple regression analyses indicated a relationship between all three components of the emotion in question. Moderator analyses revealed that age, but not gender, affects the relationship between negative emotionality and self-reported anxiety symptomatology. Results of mediation analyses suggested that emotion expression influences the relationship between negative emotionality and anxiety in older participants (ages 13-17), whereas the direct effect of negative emotionality and anxiety is maintained for younger participants (ages 8-12).

AB Empathy, theory of mind, and adaptive emotion regulation are critical skills for social functioning. However, the ways in which these skills may co- or differentially develop has thus far been understudied. We explored how these social-cognitive skills converge and diverge across a year of development in early adolescence, and with different kinds of arts training: the visual arts or music, and acting. Results show differential effects of acting versus other arts training, with the expected convergence for the artists and musicians but less convergence than predicted for the actors. Results are discussed in light of the cognitive effects of arts and acting training and social cognition as a field.

AB Design. Data were obtained from the Youth Health Monitor Rotterdam, a community-based health surveillance system.
   Methods. The sample consisted of 11,881 pupils of 11-16 years old. Next to the original five-factor model, a factor model with the number of factors based on parallel analysis and scree test was investigated. Confirmatory factor analysis for ordered-categorical measures was applied to examine the goodness-of-fit and factorial invariance of the factor models.
   Results. After allowing reverse-worded items to cross-load on the prosocial behaviour factor and adding error correlations, a good fit to the data was found for the original five-factor model (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer problems, prosocial behaviour) and a model with four factors (emotional symptoms and peer problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, prosocial behaviour). Factorial invariance across gender, age, level of education, and ethnicity was found for the final five- and four-factor model, except for the prosocial factor of the four-factor model that showed partial invariance across gender.
   Conclusions. While support was found for both models, the final five-factor model is theoretically more plausible and gained additional support as the original scales emotional problems and peer problems showed different relations with gender, educational level, and ethnicity.

AB The study examined aggression, guilt feelings and conduct disorder (CD) in adolescent immigrants from the Former Soviet Union. One hundred and nineteen adolescents, including sixty six immigrants and fifty native Israelis from four residential schools, completed questionnaires assessing level of aggression, sense of guilt, ego identity, and parenting style. Objective assessments of CD were obtained from instructors at the residential schools, using the CBCL. Results indicate that diffused ego identity is the strongest predictor of aggression, guilt, and CD. A lack of positive parenting moderates the link between diffused ego identity and aggression and CD, while positive parenting promotes a sense of guilt, especially in the immigrant group. These results warrant cultural identity-sensitive interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The aim of the present study was to assess cognitive, affective, and motor long-term sequelae after acquired focal pediatric cerebellar lesions.
   Methods Eight patients with a history of isolated acquired hemorrhagic cerebellar lesions before the age of 13 participated in this study. All participants underwent a neurologic examination, including the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment (ZNA) and the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Cognitive functions have been evaluated with a general cognitive assessment and an extensive neuropsychological battery. Furthermore, patients and parents filled in questionnaires about quality of life and possible behavioral or emotional problems.
   Results The results revealed that all patients exhibited motor problems (ZNA). Most participants had further restricted oculomotor movements (ICARS). Age at injury and the full scale IQ were significantly positively correlated (Pearson correlation 0.779; p = 0.023). Conversely, no overall neuropsychological profile could be identified except for marginally reduced reaction times and susceptibility to interference. In addition, borderline results in semantic and phonemic word fluency tasks were apparent. A dysexecutive syndrome was diagnosed in one patient. However, verbal performance and reading abilities were non-pathologic in all participants. The patients reported having a good quality of life without major physical restrictions.
   Conclusions Emotional disturbances and the presence of a mild cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (as frequently described in adult patients) could only be confirmed in adolescents with vermis lesions. Nevertheless, in laboratory conditions, neuropsychological impairments were present in all patients. Heterogeneity of age at injury and exact lesion site may have led to interpersonal differences in neuropsychological outcome.

AB This paper reviews current literature relating to parent and child emotional functioning, specifically their emotion regulatory skills and emotional expression. Included are considerations regarding theoretical, methodological, and sampling strengths and weaknesses of existing literature. On the basis of the review, several directions for future research are proposed. First, it is argued that consistency in the measurement of emotion regulation is necessary, including assessment of more refined theoretical conceptualizations of regulatory types, skills, or strategies. Second, it is argued that emotion regulation developmental research examining the post-early childhood period is necessary in order to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of youths' emotion regulation. Finally, it is argued that greater examination of paternal influences on child emotional functioning, in addition to maternal influences, is required. Consideration of these issues in future emotion regulation research will ideally contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in child and adolescent development of optimal regulatory capacities.

AB Social dysfunction is intrinsically involved in severe psychiatric disorders such as depression and psychosis and linked with poor theory of mind. Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS, or velo-cardio-facial syndrome) have poor social competence and are also at a particularly high risk of developing mood (40%) and psychotic (up to 30%) disorders in adolescence and young adulthood. However, it is unknown if these problems are associated with theory of mind skills, including underlying social-cognitive and social-perceptual mechanisms. The present cross-sectional study included classic social-cognitive false-belief and mentalising tasks and social-perceptual face processing tasks. The performance of 50 children with 22q11DS was compared with 31 age-matched typically developing sibling controls. Key findings indicated that, while younger children with 22q11DS showed impaired acquisition of social-cognitive skills, older children with 22q11DS were not significantly impaired compared with sibling controls. However, children with 22q11DS were found to have social-perceptual deficits, as demonstrated by difficulties in matching faces on the basis of identity, emotion, facial speech and gaze compared with sibling controls. Furthermore, performance on the tasks was associated with age, language ability and parentally rated social competence and emotional problems. These results are discussed in relation to the importance of a better delineation of social competence in this population.

AB Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a serious illness characterized by emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and impaired interpersonal relationships. Prior work shows the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG)-a region primarily involved in assessing the salience of emotional information and regulating emotional responses-is smaller in adults with BPD. We tested the hypothesis that, similar to adults, adolescents with BPD would have reduced Brodmann area (BA)-24 volume. Thirteen adolescent inpatients with co-morbid BPD and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 13 matched healthy controls received 3T-MRI scans. Using a cytoarchitecturally-derived approach measuring gray and white matter volume, we observed a Group x Cingulate BA (25,24,31,23,29) x Matter (gray, white) type interaction indicating the BPD/MDD adolescents had smaller BA24 volume in gray but not white matter. Greater number of suicide attempts and BPD symptom severity measured by the Diagnostic Interview for BPD-revised (DIB-R) total score but not depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was associated with smaller BA24 volume. Our preliminary findings suggest that BPD-related abnormalities in BA24 volume may occur early in the developmental course of BPD with MDD. Future studies examining samples of MDD patients with and without BPD co-morbidity will be needed to clarify whether BA24 volume reductions are specific to BPD. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Dysfunctions in both emotion regulation and social cognition (understanding behavior in mental state terms, theory of mind or mentalizing) have been proposed as explanations for disturbances of interpersonal behavior in borderline personality disorder (BPD). This study aimed to examine mentalizing in adolescents with emerging BPD from a dimensional and categorical point of view, controlling for gender, age, Axis I and Axis II symptoms, and to explore the mediating role of emotion regulation in the relation between theory of mind and borderline traits. Method: The newly developed Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) was administered alongside self-report measures of emotion regulation and psychopathology to 111 adolescent inpatients between the ages of 12 to 17 (mean age = 15.5 years; SD = 1.44 years). For categorical analyses borderline diagnosis was determined through semi-structured clinical interview, which showed that 23% of the sample met criteria for BPD. Results: Findings suggest a relationship between borderline traits and "hypermentalizing" (excessive, inaccurate mentalizing) independent of age, gender, externalizing, internalizing and psychopathy symptoms. The relation between hypermentalizing and BPD traits was partially mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation, accounting for 43.5% of the hypermentalizing to BPD path. Conclusions: Results suggest that in adolescents with borderline personality features the loss of mentalization is more apparent in the emergence of unusual alternative strategies (hypermentalizing) than in the loss of the capacity per se (no mentalizing or undermentalizing). Moreover, for the first time, empirical evidence is provided to support the notion that mentalizing exerts its influence on borderline traits through the mediating role of emotion dysregulation. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2011;50(6): 563-573.

AB Children in immigrant families from Hong Kong, Mainland China, and the Philippines living in Toronto and Montreal are at higher risk of Emotional Problems than children in immigrant families in Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver (Beiser et al., 2010). The current publication explores human capital, social capital, institutional receptivity, and perceptions of welcome as explanations for regional disparities. Parent's lack of linguistic fluency, and depressive symptoms provided the most likely explanation for Montreal's mental health disadvantage. Immigrant human and social capital, poor home-school relationships, marginalization, and lack of neighborhood organization contributed to the prediction of risk for emotional problems among immigrant children in Toronto, but may not fully account for differences between Toronto and Vancouver.

AB This research examined parents' involvement in children's learning in the United States and China. Beginning in seventh grade, 825 American and Chinese children (mean age = 12.74 years) reported on their parents' involvement in their learning as well as their parents' psychological control and autonomy support every 6 months until the end of 8th grade. Information on children's academic and emotional adjustment was obtained. American (vs. Chinese) parents' involvement was associated less with their control and more with their autonomy support. Despite these different associations, parents' heightened involvement predicted children's enhanced engagement and achievement similarly in the United States and China. However, it predicted enhanced perceptions of competence and positive emotional functioning more strongly in the United States than China.

AB Recent progress in neuroscience has yielded major findings regarding brain maturation during adolescence. Unlike the body, which reaches adult size and morphology during this period, the adolescent brain is still maturing. The prefrontal cortex appears to be an important locus of maturational change subserving executive functions that may regulate emotional and motivational issues. The recent expansion of the adolescent period has increased the lag between the onset of emotional and motivational changes activated by puberty and the completion of cognitive development the maturation of self-regulatory capacities and skills that are continuing to develop long after puberty has occurred. This "disconnect" predicts risk for a broad set of behavioral and emotional problems. Adolescence is a critical period for high-level cognitive functions such as socialization that rely on maturation of the prefrontal cortex. Intervention during the period of adolescent brain development provides opportunities and requires an interdisciplinary approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Effortful control is thought to foster adaptive action in defensive contexts and may thereby protect individuals against anxious inhibition and focus on their own distress. We examined if effortful control predicted adolescents' perceived arousal, unpleasantness, and control as well as autonomic (heart rate [HR]) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol) responses during social stress. The data came from a focus sample of the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a prospective population study of Dutch adolescents (N = 715, 50.9% girls; mean age = 16.11, SD = 0.59), who participated in a laboratory session including a social stress task (public speaking and mental arithmetic). Perceived and physiological stress measures were assessed before, during, and after the social stress task. Effortful control was measured using various questionnaires and informants, as well as by means of a reaction time (RT) task assessing response inhibition. Overall, adolescents with high questionnaire-based effortful control tended to feel more relaxed, pleasant, and in control during the laboratory session than adolescents with lower levels of control and had stronger HR responses to the stress test. Adolescent girls with high inhibitory control as measured by the RT task also had strong HR responses, but inhibitory control was associated with high rather than low perceived arousal. Our results suggest that both questionnaire and RT measures of effortful control predict strong HR responses to challenging situations, but associational patterns diverge with regard to perceived stress measures.

AB Background: When students proceed to junior high school from elementary school, rapid changes in the environment occur, which may cause various behavioral and emotional problems. However, the changes in cognitive functions during this transitional period have rarely been studied. Methods: In 158 elementary school students from 4th- to 6th-grades and 159 junior high school students from 7th- to 9th-grades, we assessed various cognitive functions, including motor processing, spatial construction ability, semantic fluency, immediate memory, delayed memory, spatial and non-spatial working memory, and selective, alternative, and divided attention. Results: Our findings showed that performance on spatial and non-spatial working memory, alternative attention, divided attention, and semantic fluency tasks improved from elementary to junior high school. In particular, performance on alternative and divided attention tasks improved during the transitional period from elementary to junior high school. Conclusion: Our finding suggests that development of alternative and divided attention is of crucial importance in the transitional period from elementary to junior high school.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of social-emotional screening in the primary care setting for youths in foster care.
   METHODS: The setting was a primary care practice for all youth in home-based foster care in 1 county. Subjects were youths, aged 11 to 17 years, and their foster parents; both completed a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at well-child visits. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire is a previously validated 25-item tool that has 5 domains: emotional symptoms; conduct problems; hyperactivity/inattention; peer problems; and prosocial behaviors and an overall total difficulties score. We first compared youth versus parent Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores and then assessed the accuracy of these Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores by comparing them in a subsample of youths (n = 50) with results of home-based structured clinical interviews using the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes.
   RESULTS: Of 138 subjects with both youth and parent reports, 78% had prosocial behaviors (strengths), and 70% had 1 or more social-emotional problems. Parents reported significantly more conduct problems (38% vs 16%; P < .0001) and total difficulties (30% vs 16%; P = .002) than did youth. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire had better agreement with the Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes (n = 50) for any Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-identified problem for combined youth and foster-parent reports (93%), compared with youth report alone (54%) or parent report alone (71%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although most youths in foster care have social-emotional problems, most have strengths as well. Youth and foster-parent perspectives on these problems differ. Systematic social-emotional screening in primary care that includes both youth and parent reports can identify youths who may benefit from services. Pediatrics 2011; 127: 904-910

AB Objective: To examine rates of depression and (un)met psychological needs in youth with type 1 diabetes.
   Methods: An open-access web-survey was conducted, collecting data on demographics, self-reported HbA1c, depressive symptoms [Child Depression Inventory (CDI)], wished and received psychological care in youth with type 1 diabetes (9-19 years).
   Results: The survey was completed by 233 youth; 17.2% reported elevated depressive symptoms on the CDI, girls more than boys (p = 0.003). Half of the youth did not talk about their feelings with their pediatrician or nurse. Of those youth with elevated depressive symptoms, 28% received psychological care, 25% wished to see a psychologist and 47% did not think it was necessary to receive psychological support.
   Discussion: This web-survey confirms the high prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms in youth with type 1 diabetes and the urgency to address their psychological needs. Screening for depressive symptoms in the context of periodic outpatient consultation could improve early detection and treatment of emotional problems.

AB Objective. The relationship between recurrent headache and reduced psychological well-being among adolescents has been well documented. Evidence also suggests that headache is associated with greater impediment to successful goal pursuits, which in turn is related to reduced well-being. The aim of this study was to investigate both the independent and interactive effects of headache and self-regulatory processes on daily positive and negative affect.
   Design and methods. In order to be able to investigate both concurrent and prospective relationships a daily diary design was employed. Independent variables were headache occurrence, daily goal frustration, and strategies to cope with these setbacks. Dependent variables were daily negative and positive affect. Eighty-nine adolescents from the general population aged 13-21 completed an on-line diary for 3 weeks. Data were analysed using multi-level modelling.
   Results. Negative affect was related to same day headache occurrence, high daily goal frustration, rumination, catastrophizing, other blame, and low coping efficacy beliefs. Furthermore, in the context of headache, coping efficacy appears to buffer the effects of goal frustration on same day negative affect. Negative affect on the next day was predicted by high daily goal frustration, rumination, catastrophizing, and low coping efficacy. In contrast, positive affect was related to no same day headache occurrence; low daily goal frustration, and high acceptance, positive refocusing, and coping efficacy. Positive affect on the following day was related to low daily goal frustration, rumination, and high positive refocusing.
   Conclusions. Daily goal frustration and cognitive coping strategies may provide important targets for interventions aimed at adolescent with reduced well-being due to headache.

AB P>Maternal obesity in pregnancy is associated with a number of adverse outcomes for mother and her offspring both perinatally and later in life. This includes recent evidence that suggests that obesity in pregnancy may be associated with central nervous system problems in the foetus and newborn. Here, we systematically review studies that have explored associations between maternal overweight and obesity in pregnancy and cognitive, behavioural and emotional problems in offspring. The 12 studies eligible for this review examined a wide range of outcomes across the lifespan and eight provided evidence of a link. These data suggest that the offspring of obese pregnancies may be at increased risk of cognitive problems and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood, eating disorders in adolescence and psychotic disorders in adulthood. Given the limitations of existing data, these findings warrant further study, particularly in light of the current worldwide obesity epidemic.

AB The associations between psychological factors and weight problems in adolescents are not conclusive. We studied associations between psychological factors, including personality and weight problems, in an adolescent population. In addition, we examined the same psychological factors as predictors for change in weight categories during adolescence.
   From 1995 to 1997, 8,090 adolescents, aged 13-18 years, participated in the Young-HUNT-I study; of those, 1,619 also participated in a follow-up study in 2000-2001. They completed a questionnaire monitoring eating problems, self-esteem, personality, anxiety, and depression, and had their height and weight measured. Weight problems were defined using the international age-and sex-specific BMI-cut-offs defining underweight, overweight, and obesity. Psychological factors at baseline were studied both in relation to weight categories at baseline, and as predictors for weight change between baseline and the follow-up.
   Significant sex differences in mean values were found in all psychological factors, with higher scores in girls compared with boys. In the cross-sectional design, eating problems were associated with weight problems, and the two factors of oral control (EAT-A) and food preoccupation (EAT-B) showed an inverse association. Oral control was associated with underweight, while food preoccupation was associated with overweight and obesity in both sexes. Low self-esteem was associated with overweight and obesity in both sexes, but no association was found between emotional problems or personality traits, and weight problems. During the follow-up, oral control was a clear predictor of weight change during adolescence in both sexes. Oral control protected against unhealthy weight gain but also predicted unhealthy weight reduction in both sexes.
   Girls scored higher on all psychological factors compared with boys, but no sex differences were found with regard to the association between psychological factors and weight problems. Eating problems showed the strongest association with weight problems at baseline and were also the strongest predictor of weight change during adolescence.

AB Low birth weight and preterm birth, and social disadvantage may negatively affect mental health of children, but findings have been inconsistent.
   To assess the influence of perinatal and social factors on mental health problems in children aged 7-9 years.
   A random sample of 805 births in So Luis, Brazil was studied in 1997/1998 and again in 2005/2006. Perinatal, socioeconomic and demographic variables were assessed within 24 h after delivery. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess mental health problems in the children. Simple and multiple Poisson regressions were used for statistical analysis.
   The overall prevalence of mental health problems in the total sample was 47.7%. The prevalences of emotional and conduct problems were 58.2 and 48.8%, respectively. Only paternal age (< 20 years) was associated with mental health problems as measured by the full SDQ scale (prevalence ratio PR = 1.27). Children born to single mothers (PR = 1.31) and those with birth weight from 1,500 to 2,499 g (PR = 1.18) and from 2,500 to 2,999 g (PR = 1.17) had a higher risk of emotional problems, but those from low income families had a lower risk (PR = 0.80). Children with a father of less than 20 years had a higher risk of having problems with their peers (PR = 1.75). A maternal education of 9 years or over was inversely associated with peer (PR = 0.70) and conduct problems (PR = 0.73). Girls had a lower risk of conduct (PR = 0.77) and hyperactivity problems (PR = 0.68). A maternal education of 4 years or less increased the risk of hyperactivity (PR = 1.48).
   Socioeconomic and demographic conditions were better predictors of mental health problems in children than birth weight or preterm birth. However, since most effect sizes were small most mental health problems were, unexplained by the variables in the study.

AB Thirty NF1-patients (mean age 11.7 years, SD = 3.3) and 30 healthy controls (mean age 12.5 years, SD = 3.1) were assessed on social skills, autistic traits, hyperactivity-inattention, emotional problems, conduct problems, and peer problems. Cognitive control, information processing speed, and social information processing were measured using 5 computer tasks. GLM analyses of variance showed significant group differences, to the disadvantage of NF1-patients, on all measures of behavior, social functioning and cognition. General cognitive ability (a composite score of processing speed, social information processing, and cognitive control) accounted for group differences in emotional problems, whereas social information processing accounted for group differences in conduct problems. Although reductions were observed for group differences in other aspects of behavior and social functioning after control for (specific) cognitive abilities, group differences remained evident. Training of cognitive abilities may help reducing certain social and behavioral problems of children with NF1, but further refinement regarding associations between specific aspects of cognition and specific social and behavioral outcomes is required.

AB Depression is associated with the development of the metabolic syndrome, and both depression and metabolic syndrome are associated with markers of systemic inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined associations between affective status in adolescence and adulthood, and the metabolic syndrome at age 53 years in a large representative British birth cohort. We also investigated whether two CRP gene polymorphisms (rs1205 and rs3093068) were associated with affective status and the metabolic syndrome, and whether the association between affective status and the metabolic syndrome was modified by these CRP polymorphisms. Women, but not men, with emotional problems in adolescence were more likely to have the metabolic syndrome (OR= 1.53, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.26), although this sex difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.22). The CRP SNPs were not associated with affective status or the metabolic syndrome, but the association of adolescent emotional problems with the metabolic syndrome was stronger in those who were homozygous for the major allele (C) of rs1205 (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.86) than in carriers of the T allele (OR = 1.01,95% CI: 0.66, 1.55) (p = 0.05 for gene by affective status interaction). This interaction was stronger when considering adolescent emotional problems as a continuous variable (p = 0.003). Adolescent emotional problems play an important role in the development of the metabolic syndrome later in life, particularly in those homozygous for the major allele of CRP rs1205. These findings may highlight new ways of identifying people with emotional problems at high risk of developing the metabolic syndrome, which is of great importance for the management of the physical health of these patients.

AB The study examined adolescents' emotional separation and detachment from parents, analyzing their relations with connectedness and agency, with some aspects of self-other boundary regulation and with problem behavior. The participants were 331 Italian adolescents, aged from 16 to 19 years (mean age = 17.40, SD = 1.14). Separation and detachment were positively related; they were negatively related to connectedness; detachment was also negatively associated to agency. Emotional separation was negatively predicted by empathic concern, perspective-taking and separate self; emotional detachment was negatively predicted by empathic concern and self-other differentiation. Separation negatively predicted internalizing behavior, and detachment positively predicted internalizing and externalizing behavior. Globally, findings showed that emotional separation and detachment are two distinct dimensions of the parent-adolescent relationship.

AB Objective: To evaluate how adolescents with marijuana problems who received a research-based treatment (five sessions of motivational enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavioral therapy [MET/CBT5]) in an experimental setting would have fared had they received exemplary community-based outpatient treatment. Method: Twelve-month outcomes representing six domains (substance use problems, substance use frequency, emotional problems, illegal activities, recovery, and institutionalization) were assessed for youth who received MET/CBT5 in the Cannabis Youth Treatment study and youth who received outpatient treatment from one of three community-based programs selected for evidence of efficacy. Groups were matched on pretreatment characteristics using a propensity score weighting strategy. Results: Youth who received MET/CBT5 exhibited greater reductions in substance use frequency, substance use problems, and illegal behaviors 12 months after treatment entry than had they entered the community-based outpatient programs. Results showed no evidence that youth who received MET/CBT5 would have fared better with respect to emotional problems, the likelihood of being institutionalized, or achieving a "recovery" status at 12 months had they received community-based treatments. Conclusions: The community-based treatments used in this study have not been assessed relative to "treatment as usual" but were selected as "exemplary" models of adolescent treatment. There is no evidence in this study that these exemplary programs yielded superior 12-month outcomes for the treatment of adolescents with marijuana problems; youth receiving MET/CBT5 experienced greater reductions in substance use and illegal activities. Thus, MET/CBT5 may be a promising treatment for community-based providers to adopt to treat these clients. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 380-389, 2011)

AB Although elevated rates of parent psychosocial distress have been associated with child behavior and emotional problems, little is known about the nature of this relationship over time. This study followed an epidemiological cohort of children and adolescents over 11 years with 4 waves of data collection. Within this cohort, complete data were available on 238 mothers and their children. Behavior and emotional problems were assessed using the DBC, maternal mental health with the GHQ. Multivariate growth curve modelling was used to evaluate the commonality of individual change patterns. High levels of mental health problems were reported, which were stable over time. Higher scores on the DBC were associated with higher rates of mental health problems. Increases in child social relating problems were associated with increases mental health symptoms, particularly depression and anxiety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The predictive effects of peer victimization and harsh parenting on deliberate self-harm were examined. As derived from the experiential avoidance model, the study also tested whether these links were moderated by individual self-regulation approaches. Data were collected at two points in time from 880 junior high school students (mean age = 13.72) in Sweden. Analyses using structural equation modeling revealed that Peer Victimization was predictive of self-harm. Although Harsh Parenting was not predictive of self-harm, this link was moderated by adolescents' gender. No moderating effect of self-regulation was revealed. The study concludes that the high prevalence of deliberate self-harm recently found in community samples of adolescents cannot be prevented without attending to environmental psychosocial factors.

AB Evaluating emotional regulation requires a certain level of complexity due to the multiple theoretical approaches that exist nowadays as well as a lack of universal agreement as to its conceptualization. Looking at what recent research offers, we capture the most significant and relevant concepts as an urge to come close to offer a unified definition. The present revision seeks to show a panoramic view of the existing evaluation modalities for this construct, placing it in a comprehensive perspective in order to build a guide looking forward to further investigations. Assessment methods as well as principal findings will be revised examining prior core elements of its definition.

AB The main purpose of this study was to examine how self-silencing, emotional regulation, and body-esteem differentiated healthy eating from different patterns of disordered eating. A community sample of adolescent females was classified as either; 1) Restrained Eaters (n = 104, M(age) = 14.48); 2) Emotional Eaters (n = 125, M(age) = 14.52); or, 3) Healthy Eaters (n = 396, M(age) = 13.71). A discriminant function analysis revealed two significant functions. The first function differentiated the two disordered eating groups (i.e., the restrained and emotional eaters) from the healthy group, with the disordered eating groups scoring significantly higher on levels of self-silencing and anger regulation, and lower on body-esteem. The second function differentiated between the restrained and emotional eaters, with the emotional eaters reporting higher levels of externalized self-perception and anger, and lower levels of body-esteem. The results suggest that body-esteem and anger suppression were the most influential variables in differentiating between groups. The findings are discussed in terms of the implications for disordered eating prevention and treatment programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HARM; POPULATION
AB The increasing prevalence of self-injurious behavior (SIB) among mainstream adolescents has led to a growing body of research. This maladaptive behavior is used as a means of regulating negative emotions. Best practices regarding therapy are unclear, with many types of intervention being tried. Analysis of 36 qualitative and quantitative studies, reviews, and theory articles addressing adolescent SIB was conducted looking at aspects such as history, demo-graphics, motivators, risk factors, techniques, and treatment options. An explosion of research is surfacing to determine effective care through creative approaches. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) shows great promise. The school setting is a natural environment for the identification and intervention of SIB which requires knowledge of indicators and risk factors. Education of school staff will increase awareness and enhance communication among disciplines. A circle of care can then surround the student to provide support and guidance while the proper interventions for emotional regulation and individual health promotion are developed.

AB Objective:
   This study explores the factors that influence adolescents' help-seeking intentions. Specifically, the study investigates the extent to which perceived benefits of help seeking, stoicism, gender and symptoms of psychological distress are associated with intentions to seek professional help for emotional problems.
   Design and setting:
   A cross sectional self-report questionnaire was administered to adolescents recruited from seven high schools in rural towns in the Riverina region of New South Wales.
   Participants:
   A total of 778 adolescents were recruited. The sample included 373 male and 404 female participants between 13 and 18 years of age.
   Main outcome measure(s):
   Participants completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire designed to measure help-seeking intentions in the advent that they were to experience emotional problems, psychological distress symptoms, perceived benefits of help seeking and stoicism.
   Results:
   In all, 17% of male participants and 29% of female participants reported they would be likely to seek help from doctors if they were to experience emotional problems. In total, 15% of male participants and 23% of female participants reported they would be likely to seek help from other health care professionals. Multiple regression analysis suggested that adolescents are more likely to seek help from professionals if they perceive help seeking as beneficial (t = 12.91; P < 0.001). Female particpants reported that they were more likely to seek help than male participants (t = 2.69; P = 0.01).
   Conclusions:
   Findings suggest that adolescents are reluctant to seek professional help if experiencing emotional problems, because they do not believe professional help seeking is beneficial. Improving adolescents' beliefs about the benefits of professional help seeking might be a key strategy for increasing their use of professional health services to address mental health problems.

AB Although there is great interest in identifying the neural correlates of cognitive processes that create risk for psychopathology, there is a paucity of research in young children. One event-related potential (ERP), the N2, is thought to index conflict monitoring and has been linked cognitive and affective risk factors for anxiety. Most of this research, however, has been conducted with adults, adolescents, and older children, but not with younger children. To address this gap, the current study examined 26 4-8-year-olds, who completed a cued flanker task while EEG was continuously recorded. We assessed whether the N2 was detectable in this group of young children and examined associations between the N2 and factors reflecting affective risk (e.g., reduced executive attention, temperamental effortful control, and temperamental surgency). We documented an N2 effect (greater N2 amplitude to incongruent versus congruent flankers), but only in children older than 6 years of age. Increases in the N2 effect were associated with less efficient executive attention and lower temperamental effortful control. We discuss the implications of these findings and consider how they may inform future studies on biomarkers for cognitive and affective risk factors for anxiety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine a model of factors that place psychiatrically hospitalized girls at risk for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The role of familial and peer interpersonal difficulties, as well as emotional dysregulation, were examined in relationship to NSSI behaviors. Participants were 99 adolescent girls (83.2% Caucasian; M age = 16.08) admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Structural equation modeling indicated the primacy of emotional dysregulation as an underlying process placing adolescents at risk for NSSI and mediating the influence of interpersonal problems through the family and peer domains. When family and peer relationships were characterized by conflict and lack of support for managing emotions, adolescents reported more dysregulated emotion processes. Family relational problems were directly and indirectly related to NSSI through emotional dysregulation. The indirect processes of peer relational problems, through emotional dysregulation, were significantly associated with NSSI frequency and severity. The findings suggest that the process by which interpersonal difficulties contribute to NSSI is complex, and is at least partially dependent on the nature of the interpersonal problems and emotion processes.

AB The present study investigated differences in cognitive coping strategies between anxiety-disordered and non-anxious adolescents. In addition, the interaction effect with gender as well as differences between specific anxiety diagnoses was examined. A clinical sample of 159 anxiety-disordered adolescents and a general community sample of 370 non-anxious adolescents were recruited. Nine cognitive coping strategies were assessed in all adolescents (aged 12-16 years). Results showed that anxiety-disordered adolescents had significantly higher scores on most of the cognitive coping strategies than non-anxious adolescents. The cognitive coping strategies rumination, self-blame and catastrophizing accounted for most of the variance. Gender did not modify the results. Further analyses within the anxiety-disordered sample indicated that adolescents with a generalized anxiety disorder scored significantly higher on rumination, but not on other cognitive coping strategies, than social phobic adolescents. The results suggest that cognitive coping is a valuable target for psychological assessment and treatment in adolescents. (C) 2010 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) generates controversy among the general population on its diagnosis and treatment. This could be explained by the sparse level of education about mental health, which affects the parent's knowledge and beliefs about this disorder.
   ADHD is highly prevalent and 3-5% of school-age children can be diagnosed. In Mexico it represents 1.5 million cases. It represents more than 30% of all cases in clinical pediatric settings.
   The reports in health services have shown that the time gap between symptoms identification and treatment is around 8 to 15 years. Moreover, only 25% of the affected children's parents recognize conduct or emotional problems on them and 13% receive mental health care. Attention seeking has been associated with higher severity of the disorder and parent's superior educational level.
   Despite the advances in the research on neurobiology and psychopharmacology, understanding of the social context that surrounds the disorder is incomplete. Comparatively little is known regarding how parents conceive the symptoms and causes of ADHD and how these parental views may relate to children's treatment. Understanding these factors is important due to the central role of parents in selecting and accessing treatments and service providers for children with ADHD.
   For parents and children, getting information about ADHD is a lottery that depends on which professional they see and what they read or gather from television and the Internet. Mental health professionals most give complete information to parents and children, so risks and benefits of the different treatments may be considered along with the family's needs, values and cultural background.
   A better understanding about the parent's knowledge, beliefs and attitudes regarding ADHD would help to improve the communication mechanisms between mental health professionals and parents during the treatment.
   Objective
   To describe the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes regarding ADHD in Mexican parents.
   Methods
   The study was approved by the local investigation review board. Informed consent was obtained and parents of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD were recruited at four mental health facilities (three public and one private) in two cities. Each parent completed the questionnaire of knowledge and beliefs about ADHD (CASE ADHD, parent's version). The questionnaire was created for this study as an instrument with three versions: a) Parents, b) Teachers, c) Health professionals. Results of parent's version were included in this report. This questionnaire incorporates information of other instruments such as Barkley's Evaluation Questionnaire and the one used in the National Colombian Survey for the Consensus of treatment of ADHD 2008. CASE ADHD includes three parts: 1. An identification record with the mother's or father's general data, 2. The ADHD Rating Scale-IV, and 3. A 36 multiple choice questionnaire related to six main areas: a) The caretaker report of symptoms and clinical characteristics related with ADHD, b) The knowledge about ADHD, c) The pathways to care report, d) The Beliefs about ADHD treatment, e) The professional mental health's performance, and f) The parent's perceptions about ADHD. The questionnaire must be completed with the assistance of a mental health professional. The average application time is 30 minutes.
   For statistical analysis central tendency measures were used; as means, standard deviations and percentages.
   Results
   The total sample was integrated by 288 parents of children or adolescents. The 80.1% of the questionnaires were fulfilled by the mother. The mean age of those who answered was 40.06 years, 25.4% reported to complete professional studies. The mean age of patients was 11.15 years (SD = 3.54), 58% were children and 74% were male, their ADHDRS-IV average score was 27.5 (SD = 14.03).
   Knowledge about ADHD. The 85.4% (N = 246) of the surveyed sample considered ADHD as a disease and 8.3% as a rearing difficulty. The 69.2% (N = 198) of parents said they knew what is ADHD, but only 62.1% reported to receive information by the physician or psychologist about this condition.
   Attitudes about ADHD. When questioned about what would they do if they suspected that their child had ADHD, 35.1% (N=101) would consult a psychiatrist, 21.2% a psychologist, and 12.2% a neurologist or pediatric neurologist. The 28% of parents were deemed unable to manage their child's behavior problem. When we asked about who is able to diagnose ADHD, 49.5% answered that the psychologist, 48.5% the psychiatrist and 19.8% that the pediatrician. The psychiatrist was considered able to treat this condition by 45.8% of the sample followed by psychologist (19.8%), and neurologist (10.4%).
   Beliefs about diagnosis and treatment. Nearly 63% of the sample (N = 183) considered that the best treatment for ADHD was the combined treatment; 16.3% preferred the psychological approach and psychopharmacology was chosen by only 6.6%. Almost half (48.5%, N = 129) of the sample considered that drug treatment only supports the psychosocial treatment and does not have a therapeutic effect by itself, 46.2% (N = 133) of the sample believed that "drugs only control the symptoms and do not cure the disorder". Regarding to psychological treatment, 52.4% (N = 151) of parents considered it as "the most helpful intervention". So the parent's expectancies for mental health services were mainly to receive psychotherapy (42.3%) and counseling (31.0%).
   Experiences about mental health services. The parents of children who had already received treatment reported that they consulted 2 +/- 1.42 mental health professionals before obtaining an adequate treatment.
   Conclusions
   In this study, most surveyed parents considered ADHD as a disease. It is interesting to note that nearly half of parents reported that the psychologist was able to make the diagnosis of this condition, in numbers slightly higher than physicians. Nearly one fifth reported that the pediatrician is trained to diagnose ADHD. As far as who is qualified to treat ADHD, more than 40% declared that psychiatrist, followed by psychologist (19.8%), and neurologist (10.4%).
   Almost two thirds (63%) of parents reported that the best treatment for ADHD was the combined treatment. Where the psychosocial treatment was considered the most useful intervention. This point highlights the importance of training psychologists as key members in the early diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

AB The current investigation examined the long-term prediction of sibling jealousy assessed in a laboratory-based paradigm on sibling relationship quality 2 1/2 years later. This multi-method longitudinal study included mothers, fathers, and two children from 35 families. Younger siblings were 16 months and older siblings were, on average, 4 years at Time 1. Positive longitudinal associations were found between older siblings' jealousy reactions when interacting with the father at Time 1 and sibling conflict at Time 2. These associations continued to exist even when older siblings' behaviour during the mother sessions was considered. Children's inability to regulate their jealous reactions may be indicative of lower levels of emotion regulation skills, which may, in turn, translate to poorer sibling interactions years later.

AB Background. Problem behaviour is common following pre-term birth, but the underlying nature of these difficulties is not well known.
   Aims. We sought to establish the mechanisms underpinning behavioural difficulties in very pre-term (VPT) children in middle childhood by comparing their performance to that of term born peers on tasks of working memory, inhibition, and processing speed, and relating these to parent and teacher assessments of their behaviour. Particular focus was given to inattention and overactive/impulsive behaviour, as these behaviours have been associated with different neuropsychological problems in term children.
   Samples. A group of VPT children (gestational age < 31 weeks, N = 56) aged 9-10 years and term controls (N = 22) participated in the study.
   Method. Children were assessed with measures of working memory, inhibition, and processing speed. Parents and teachers reported behavioural problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and two additional scales measuring overactive/impulsive behaviour and inattention.
   Results. Results revealed increased rates of problem behaviour in VPT compared to term children for parent-rated total difficulties, hyperactivity, emotional problems, peer problems, prosocial behaviour, overactive/impulsive behaviour, and parent- and teacher-rated inattention. Processing speed and working memory, but not inhibition, were significantly related to inattentive and overactive/impulsive behaviour.
   Conclusions. The increased rates of inattention and overactive/impulsive behaviour in VPT children may be explained by impairment in processing speed and working memory. Expected links between overactive/impulsive behaviour and inhibitory control were not identified, suggesting the nature of such difficulties may be different in VPT compared to term children.

AB Particularly in adolescence, fostering adaptive emotion regulation is an important aim in health promotion. Expressive writing in combination with psycho-education on emotion regulation seems especially appropriate to serve this aim. In this study, school classes were randomly assigned either to a prevention (N = 208) or to a non-treatment control group (N = 151). The prevention group showed significant improvements regarding negative affect, grades, and days absent compared to the control-group. A combination of expressive writing with elements of psycho-education of emotion regulation might be an effective preventive tool, as it seems to improve psychosocial adjustment by establishing functional emotion regulation strategies.

AB Background. The aim of this study was to investigate three main aspects of executive functions (EFs), i.e. shifting, updating and inhibition, in adolescents engaging in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) as compared with healthy controls.
   Method. EFs were assessed using the lntra/Extradimensional Set Shift, the Spatial Working Memory (SWM) Test and the Stop Signal Test (SST) from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in a high-severity NSSI group (n=33), a low-severity NSSI group (n=29) and a healthy control group (n=35). Diagnostic characteristics were examined using the Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version.
   Results. There were group differences on the SWM Test. A trend towards an interaction effect of sex revealed that males in the high-severity NSSI group made significantly more errors than males and females in the control group. Both males and females in the high-severity NSSI group made poor use of an efficient strategy in completing the test. The low-severity NSSI group performed poorly on the SST, making more errors than the control group and showing an impaired ability to inhibit initiated responses, as compared with the high-severity NSSI group. There were group differences in frequencies of current and previous major depressive disorder. However, no effects of these diagnoses were found on any of the EF tests.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrates that NSSI subgroups have distinct deficits in EFs. The high-severity NSSI group has working memory deficits, while the low-severity NSSI group has impaired inhibitory control. This supports the emotion regulation hypothesis.

AB This investigation examines the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of the Chinese version Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 cerebral palsy (CP) Module in pediatric CP.
   The study sample was comprised of 126 parents of children with CP between the ages of 2 and 12 years including 18 child respondents 5-12 years of age. Mean age of the 87 boys (69.0%) and 39 girls (31.0%) was 4 years 1 month (SD 2 years 2 month).
   Reliability was demonstrated for the PedsQL 4.0 (alpha = 0.86 child, 0.89 parent) and CP Module (alpha = 0.91 child, 0.96 parent). The PedsQL 4.0 distinguished between healthy children and children with CP. Construct validity of the CP Module was supported through an analysis of the intercorrelations between the Generic Core Scale scores and the CP Module Scale scores and exploratory factor analysis of PedsQL items.
   The findings provide support for the measurement properties of the Chinese version PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and 3.0 CP Module in pediatric CP.

AB Objective: To measure the mental health status of deaf adolescents with cochlear implants (CI). Study sample and Design: We used the ""Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire"" (SDQ) to assess the mental health problems of 32 adolescents with CI (mean age 15.0 years) and 212 normal hearing peers (mean age 15.0 years). Results: Parent and teacher ratings for the CI subjects (ES emotional symptoms, HA inattention-hyperactivity, CP conduct-problems and PBS pro-social behavior) did not differ significantly from the results of normal hearing peers. However, teachers rated significantly more cases as having peer problems (PP) and more cases as having very high (clinical) total difficulty scores (TDS) in the CI group. The SDQ results of the CI users correlated significantly with poor results in auditory performance and special school education. The age at CI implantation was not found to be a correlated with emotional, behavioral and social problems. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the mental health of deaf adolescents with CI is comparable to that of normal hearing peers.

AB It is commonly asserted that the same, or similar, risk factors are associated with a wide range of problematic child and adolescent outcomes such as educational, social and emotional problems, and poor health. This argument underpins calls for preventive approaches that target common causal drivers. However, the argument rests largely on the compilation of findings from multiple studies of single outcomes. Growing Up in Australia, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, is one of relatively few studies that can directly test this proposition within the one dataset. The same neighbourhood, child care, school, family, and child factors measured at 4-5 and 6-7 years were used to predict children's social/emotional, physical, and learning outcomes at 8-9 years, allowing assessment of commonalities in the predictors of each outcome. Results showed that the 'common drivers' proposition generally applied, but there were also unique factors associated with each outcome. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of oral medication adherence and perceived adherence barriers with disease severity in a sample of adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
   Methods Participants included 62 adolescents, aged 13-17 years, diagnosed with IBD, and their parents. Data on the measures of parent-rated and patient-rated oral medication adherence and related barriers, behavioral and emotional functioning per parent report and self-report, and disease severity per medical chart reported by a physician were obtained.
   Results Fifteen percent of the sample reported clinically elevated depressive symptoms and 24% reported clinically elevated internalizing behavioral problems. Number of reported adherence barriers was 2.6 +/- 1.5, and none of the participants reported zero barriers. Parental ratings of medication adherence (t = -2.11, P < 0.05) and perceived barriers to adherence (t = 2.05, P < 0.05) significantly predicted disease severity after statistically controlling for the contributions of behavioral and disease parameters to disease severity.
   Conclusion Results suggest that the oral medication adherence and perceived adherence barriers are significantly related to disease severity in adolescents with IBD. These patients also may be at risk for increased behavioral and emotional problems, which may impact health outcomes as well. Clinicians should make particular efforts to attend to medication adherence issues with their patients. Working with patients and families to develop solutions for eliminating adherence barriers might result in better disease outcomes.

AB Resilience and positive youth development have substantial overlap and offer complementary perspectives on fostering healthy youth development. However, these two areas have not yet been fully integrated into a unified approach, one that has the potential to build on the interconnectedness of risk, protection, and assets within the ecological systems affecting adolescent development. This article draws on extant research to delineate linkages between the risk and resilience and positive youth development literatures. School-related outcomes are examined within an integrative conceptual model delineating eight developmental domains useful for future research on underlying mechanisms associated with healthy outcomes, as well as prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Developmental psychology research finds that when children and adolescents engage in excessive discussion of problems with friends, a phenomenon termed "co-rumination," they experience trade-offs between negative adjustment outcomes (e.g., depression), but better friendship quality. This study examines the possibility that adults in the workplace engage in co-rumination about workplace problems, and that co-rumination, gender, and the presence of abusive supervision influence both positive and negative individual outcomes.
   A sample of 147 adults ranging in age and occupation completed a questionnaire assessing co-rumination, abusive supervision, and workplace outcomes.
   Results suggested that women engage in more co-rumination than men, and that abusive supervision exacerbates its negative effects for women. In contrast, for men experiencing high abusive supervision, co-rumination was associated with reduced negative effects. However, under low abusive supervision, co-rumination had no significant effect on any outcome variable for women, but was related to negative outcomes for men.
   This study suggests that co-rumination is useful for understanding different types of social support in workplace contexts, and in particular, how men and women might differ in social support seeking. Co-rumination might prove useful for reconciling the somewhat mixed results regarding social support in helping individuals cope with workplace problems.
   This study is the first to examine co-rumination in working adults. It provides insight into how the interaction among co-rumination, gender, and exposure to stress (e.g., abusive supervision) influence both positive and negative individual outcomes.

AB Children with specific language impairment (Sit) have often been reported to have associated behavioral, emotional and social difficulties. Most previous studies involve observations at a single time point, or cross sectional designs, and longitudinal evidence of the developmental trajectories of particular difficulties is limited. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure behavioral (hyperactivity and conduct), emotional and social (peer) problems in a sample of individuals with a history of SLI at four time points from childhood (age 7) to adolescence (age 16). A decrease in behavioral and emotional problems was observed from childhood to adolescence, although emotional problems were still evident in adolescence. In contrast, there was an increase in social problems. Reading skills and expressive language were related only to behavioral problems. Pragmatic abilities were related to behavioral, emotional and social difficulties. As a group, those with a history of Sit have poorer long term social and, to a lesser extent, emotional outcomes. In contrast, behavioral difficulties appear to decrease to normative levels by adolescence. Different aspects of early language abilities and reading skills exert different types and degrees of influence on behavioral, emotional and social difficulties.
   Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) understand the types of behavioral, emotional and social difficulties present in individuals with a history of SLI; (2) be familiar with the developmental trajectory of these difficulties from childhood to adolescence; and (3) understand the relationships between behavioral, emotional and social difficulties and early language and literacy ability.

AB Background: To test whether emotional arousal mediates the moderator effect of non-verbal cognitive ability on the association between cumulative contextual risk (number of proximal and distal adverse life events) and adolescent problem behaviour. Method: Data from a UK community sample of secondary school aged children were used. The study sample comprised 207 children with a mean age of 13.44 years (SD = 1.45). Problem behaviour was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, non-verbal cognitive ability was assessed with Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Plus, and emotional arousal was measured with the Acting Out Emotions Scale of the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire. Adjustment was made for gender, age, family structure, and socio-economic disadvantage. Results: Non-verbal cognitive ability moderated the effect of cumulative contextual risk on overall problem behaviour, and emotional arousal mediated this moderator effect. That is, risk predicted emotional arousal, which predicted overall problem behaviour, but emotional arousal was more strongly related to overall problem behaviour among children of low non-verbal cognitive ability than among children of high non-verbal cognitive ability. Conclusions: These findings are important for both theory development and intervention design. They advance theory because they suggest that non-verbal cognitive ability buffers the effect of risk on overall problem behaviour by strengthening control over emotions. They have implications for intervention design because they suggest that interventions carried out to enhance children's emotion regulation skills in the presence of multiple adversity might be more effective if they target children who score low on non-verbal cognitive ability.

AB Psychopathology in youths is thought to originate from a dynamic interplay of a variety of protective and vulnerability factors. In this study, a large multi-ethnic sample of non-clinical adolescents (N = 376) completed questionnaires for measuring a wide range of person-related protective and vulnerability factors as well as psychopathology symptoms, in order to explore (a) the relations among various protective and vulnerability factors, and (b) the unique contributions of these protective and vulnerability factors to different types of psychological problems. Results indicated that the overlap among protective and vulnerability factors was quite modest. Further, it was found that factors clustered in theoretically meaningful components reflecting protection, vulnerability, and more specific aspects of coping and social support. Finally, data indicated that each type of psychopathology symptoms was associated with a typical set of protective and vulnerability factors. Although these results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, they may nevertheless guide future research exploring multifactorial models of psychopathology in youths.

AB This study examined the relations among temperament, emotion regulation, and depressive symptoms in early adolescents. Early adolescents provided self-reports of temperament on two occasions, as well as reports on emotion regulation and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, 163 of these adolescents participated in event-planning and problem-solving interactions with their mothers. Adolescents with temperaments that were high in negative emotionality or low in effortful control displayed more emotionally dysregulated behaviors during the interaction tasks, reported having maladaptive responses to negative affect more often and adaptive responses less often, and had more depressive symptoms. In particular, adolescents with the high negative emotionality and low effortful control temperament combination reported the highest levels of depressive symptomatology. Sequential analyses of family interactions indicated that adolescents with more depressive symptoms were more likely to reciprocate their mothers' negative affective behaviors. Adolescents' adaptive and maladaptive responses to negative affect mediated the associations between their temperament and concurrent depressive symptoms.

AB The purpose of this longitudinal study was twofold: (a) to investigate academic, behavioral, emotional outcomes for adolescents who were followed longitudinally from middle through high school and (b) to determine if early assessment of achievement and behavior predicts academic and behavioral outcomes for adolescents who were identified as at risk for developing emotional and behavioral problems when they were in primary school. Teacher ratings and student self-reports suggested that the behavioral and emotional symptoms for this school-based sample of predominately minority adolescents (n = 212, 91% African American and/or Hispanic, 45% boys, 55% girls) decreased across time, although there was significant variability for individuals. The at-risk students in special education had significantly higher self-ratings of emotional problems than the other groups and viewed school more negatively. Assessment of reading and math achievement and teacher ratings of behavior in primary school predicted achievement and behavior through middle and high school for at-risk students. Results have implications for early identification, prevention/intervention programs, and transition planning for children and youth at risk for developing problem behaviors.

Assessments included home interviews with parents and teenagers separately. Results and conclusion: Adolescent reports indicated that 10% were in the clinical range on internalising behaviours, 23% had engaged in major delinquent acts, and 46% reported some substance use. Eighteen percent of children had criminal justice system involvement and 42% had elevated levels of externalising behaviours (mother report). Post-treatment factors predicting negative outcomes (delinquent acts) were maternal reports of behaviour problems and observed mother-child coercion.

AB Background: Psychotherapies with known efficacy in adolescent depression have been adapted for prepubertal children; however, none have been empirically validated for use with depressed very young children. Due to the centrality of the parent child relationship to the emotional well being of the young child, with caregiver support shown to mediate the risk for depression severity, we created an Emotional Development (ED) module to address emotion development impairments identified in preschool onset depression. The new module was integrated with an established intervention for preschool disruptive disorders, Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Preliminary findings of an open trial of this novel intervention, PCIT-ED, with depressed preschool children are reported. Methods: PCIT was adapted for the treatment of preschool depression by incorporating a novel emotional development module, focused on teaching the parent to facilitate the child's emotional development and enhance emotion regulation. Eight parent child dyads with depressed preschoolers participated in 14 sessions of the treatment. Depression severity, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, functional impairment, and emotion recognition/discrimination were measured pre- and posttreatment. Results: Depression severity scores significantly decreased with a large effect size (1.28). Internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as functional impairment were also significantly decreased pre- to posttreatment. Conclusions: PCIT-ED seems to be a promising treatment for preschoolers with depression, and the large effect sizes observed in this open trial suggest early intervention may provide a window of opportunity for more effective treatment. A randomized controlled trial of PCIT-ED in preschool depression is currently underway. Depression and Anxiety 28:153-159, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This review of recent research on prenatal depression suggests that it is a strong predictor of postpartum depression and is more common than postpartum depression. Prenatal depression has been associated with excessive activity and growth delays in the fetus as well as prematurity, low birthweight, disorganized sleep and less responsiveness to stimulation in the neonate. Infants of depressed mothers have difficult temperament, and later in development attentional, emotional and behavioral problems have been noted during childhood and adolescence, as well as chronic illnesses in adulthood. Several variables have confounded the effects of prenatal depression including comorbid anxiety and anger as well as stressful life events. Potential mediating variables are low prenatal maternal dopamine and serotonin levels and elevated cortisol and norepinephrine. The associated intrauterine artery resistance may limit blood flow, oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Some studies also suggest the heritability of developmental problems for the children of prenatally depressed mothers, including ADHD and antisocial behavior. Multivariate, longitudinal research is needed to disentangle these confounding and mediating variables. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Preschool children have long been a neglected population in the study of psychopathology. The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA), which includes the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5) and the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF), constitutes the few available measures to assess preschoolers with an empirically derived taxonomy of preschool psychopathology. However, the utility of the measures and their taxonomy of preschool psychopathology to the Chinese is largely unknown and has not been studied. The present study aimed at testing the cross-cultural factorial validity of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF, as well as the applicability of the taxonomy of preschool psychopathology they embody, to Mainland Chinese preschoolers. Country effects between our Chinese sample and the original U. S. sample, gender differences, and cross-informant agreement between teachers and parents were also to be examined. A Chinese version of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF was completed by parents and teachers respectively on 876 preschoolers in Mainland China. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the original, U. S.-derived second order, multi-factor model best fit the Chinese preschool data of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF. Rates of total behavior problems in Chinese preschoolers were largely similar to those in American preschoolers. Specifically, Chinese preschoolers scored higher on internalizing problems while American preschoolers scored higher on externalizing problems. Chinese preschool boys had significantly higher rates of externalizing problems than Chinese preschool girls. Cross-informant agreement between Chinese teachers and parents was relatively low compared to agreement in the original U.S. sample. Results support the generalizability of the taxonomic structure of preschool psychopathology derived in the U.S. to the Chinese, as well as the applicability of the Chinese version of the CBCL/1.5-5 and C-TRF.

AB Mounting evidence suggests that genetic risks for mental disorders often interact with the social environment, but most studies still ignore environmental moderation of genetic influences. The authors tested interactions between maternal parenting and the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the dopamine transporter gene in the child to increase understanding of gene environment interactions involving early parenting. Participants were part of a 9-year longitudinal study of 4- to 6-year-old children who met criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and demographically matched controls. Maternal parenting was observed during standard mother child interactions in Wave I. The child's conduct disorder (CD) symptoms 5-8 years later were measured using separate structured diagnostic interviews of the mother and youth. Controlling for ADHD symptoms and child disruptive behavior during the mother child interaction, there was a significant inverse relation between levels of both positive and negative parenting at 4-6 years and the number of later CD symptoms, but primarily among children with 2 copies of the 9-repeat allele of the VNTR. The significant interaction with negative parenting was replicated in parent and youth reports of CD symptoms separately.

AB Background:
   There is little research on how specific borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms relate to suicide attempts or suicide and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) within adolescent populations, which is important to know given the recent proposal of an NSSI disorder. Even less well known is whether specific BPD symptoms distinguish NSSI from suicide attempts or differentiate single from repeated acts of either suicide or NSSI.
   Method:
   Archival, de-identified outpatient clinical charts from 441 ethnically diverse (4.3% Caucasian; 70.9% female) adolescents (mean age = 14.9, SD = 1.61) were reviewed. Data pertaining to NSSI, suicide attempt history, BPD symptoms, and psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from self-report measures and semi-structured interviews administered at intake.
   Results:
   MANOVA and logistic regression analyses revealed significant differences across groups, with the BPD symptoms of 'confusion about self' and 'unstable interpersonal relationships' significantly predicting NSSI and NSSI+Suicide group status. The number of BPD criteria met plus high levels of confusion about self significantly predicted single vs. repeat self-harm group membership.
   Conclusions:
   Two BPD symptoms exhibit distinct relationships to NSSI and suicide attempts, but there is not strong variation in their relationship to BPD. Treatment addressing BPD symptoms may be useful to reducing both NSSI and suicide in ethnically diverse adolescents.

   PERSISTENCE; PREDICTION
AB Background:
   Low levels of dispositional anger and a good attention span are critical to healthy social emotional development, with attention control reflecting effective cognitive self-regulation of negative emotions such as anger. Using a longitudinal design, we examined attention span as a moderator of reciprocal links between changes in anger and changes in externalizing and internalizing problems from 4.5 to 11 years of age.
   Method:
   Participants were children from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), assessed four times between 4.5 and 11 years. Composite scores for anger and attention were computed using indicators from multiple informants. Externalizing and internalizing problems were reported by mothers.
   Results:
   Latent difference score analysis showed reciprocal lagged effects between increased anger and elevated levels of externalizing or internalizing problems. Significant moderating effects of attention indicated more persistent effects of anger on externalizing problems in the poor attention group. Although the poor and the good attention groups did not differ regarding the effects of anger on internalizing problems, significant moderating effects of attention indicated stronger and more persistent reciprocal effects of internalizing problems on anger in the poor attention group.
   Conclusions:
   Attention control mechanisms are involved in self-regulation of anger and its connections with changes in behavioral and emotional problems. Strong attention regulation may serve to protect children with higher levels of dispositional anger from developing behavioral and emotional problems in middle childhood.

AB Background
   People with severe and profound levels of intellectual disability (ID) are frequently examined as a single group in research. However, these two groups may be significantly different, particularly in the area of emotional and behavioural difficulties.
   Method
   The Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC) was completed by parents and caregivers of 107 people with severe ID and 22 people with profound ID at four time periods across 12 years. Regression analyses were used to examine trends in sub-scale scores across time and groups.
   Results
   Significant differences between the groups of people with severe and profound ID were found. People with profound ID had significantly lower scores across all sub-scales except Social Relating. This was usually related to fewer items being selected as present for people with profound ID, as opposed to the scores being attributable to lower item severity scores.
   Conclusions
   There are significant differences between groups of people with severe and profound ID in scores on the DBC, indicating differences in behavioural and emotional problems. Caution should be exercised by researchers treating these two disparate groups as a single group, and by practitioners translating such findings into practice.

AB The purpose of this study was to establish the reliability and validity of the scores on a brief strengths-based assessment, the 22-item Personal Strengths Inventory (PSI). In Study 1, findings from exploratory factor analysis of 410 adolescents provided evidence for a five-factor solution-social competence (four items), emotional awareness (five items), goal setting (six items), emotional regulation (four items), and empathy (three items). Preliminary evidence of convergent validity was also reported. In Study 2, results from confirmatory factor analysis of 598 adolescents provided additional support for the results obtained from Study 1. Moderate to high reliability coefficients were obtained for the PSI scores. The results are discussed in comparison with other research on social-emotional competence, and further research is suggested.

AB CONTEXT: The promotion of optimism has been widely advocated for children and adolescents, but epidemiologic data to support this approach are scant.
   METHODS: This was a 3-wave longitudinal study of health and social development in younger adolescents from 3 Australian states. The 5634 student participants, initially aged 12 to 14 years, were assessed for optimistic thinking style, emotional problems, substance use, and antisocial behaviors.
   RESULTS: Cross-sectional associations between optimism and each of the study outcomes were strongly protective but tended to differ according to gender in extent. In prospective analyses of the onset of new cases of each study outcome, protective associations were weaker. Those in the highest optimism quartile had risks for depressive symptoms that were reduced by almost half (odds ratio: 0.54 [95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.70]) compared with those in the lowest category. No effect was seen in prevention of anxiety symptoms after adjustment for other aspects of psychological style. In predicting the onset of heavy substance use and antisocial behavior, high optimism had modest protective effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: Optimistic thinking style is somewhat protective against adolescent health risks; the clearest effects are seen against depressive symptoms. Promoting optimism along with other aspects of psychological and emotional style has a role in mental health promotion that is likely to be enhanced if an intervention also addresses risk and protective factors in an adolescent's social context.

AB Objective: To better understand emotional information processing in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its relationship with depression. Pediatric IBD is associated with higher rates of depression than seen in other physical diseases and in community samples. In systemic inflammation, proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in altering activity in brain regions known to affect emotion processing and emotion regulation in depression. Methods: We examined differences in pupillary responses as a marker of brain function in response to negative emotional information in youths (ages, 8-17 years) with IBD both with (n = 8) and without (n = 15) comorbid depression and who were receiving high-dose steroid treatment. We compared their responses to each other and to depressed youths without IBD (n = 20) and healthy youths (n = 22). Results: Youths with IBD demonstrated greater pupillary responses to the initial presentation of negative emotional stimuli, regardless of their depression status (p=.05). In contrast, depressed youths, regardless of their IBD status, demonstrated a greater constriction of the pupil 10 seconds to 12 seconds after exposure to negative stimuli. This constriction was associated with greater depressive severity and lower albumin levels. Conclusions: IBD may be associated with increased sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli above and beyond depression diagnosis. Depressed youths potentially demonstrate affective blunting, emotional avoidance, or a failure to regulate emotion after exposure to negative emotional information. Thus, there seem to be unique contributions of medical disease and depression to physiological indications of emotional reactivity, but these factors do not seem to interact.

AB Using a multi-informant approach, this study examined emotion regulation within the social context of White and Black adolescent peer groups by assessing two aspects of sadness expression management (i.e., inhibition, disinhibition) and their linkages to peer acceptance and social functioning as a function of gender and ethnicity. Seventh- and eighth-grade adolescents (N = 155, 52 percent female, 54.8 percent Black) completed self-reports and peer nominations of sadness management and sociometric ratings of peer acceptance. Parents rated their child's social competence and social problems. Results revealed specific patterns of sadness regulation across informants that were associated with social functioning and varied by gender, but not ethnicity. Boys were more likely than girls to minimize sadness displays; boys who violated this pattern had lower peer acceptance and higher parent-rated social problems. In contrast, although girls were rated as displaying overt sadness more frequently than boys, this was unrelated to peer acceptance.

AB Aims: To investigate whether variation may exist in betel nut- and ecstasy-involved adolescents in terms of sociobehavioral characteristics, the experience of psychoactive substance use, and behavioral/emotional problems.
   Methods: Students (n = 53,528) aged 12-18 sampled via stratified, multistage, random cluster sampling in 2004, 2005, and 2006 throughout Taiwan were categorized into four groups: betel nut- and ecstasy-naive (n = 51,009), betel nut use only (n = 1965), ecstasy use only (n = 196), and use of both (n = 152). Participants completed a questionnaire with information on sociodemographic features, substance-use experiences, and the Chinese adaptation of the Youth Self Report.
   Results: Having a job, a larger weekly allowance, truancy, sexual experience, and externalizing behaviors were all in strong association with the involvement of either betel nut or ecstasy use. Compared with ecstasy-only users, betel nut-only users were more likely to be male, from the Eastern region of Taiwan, with initiation motivated by family members or friends, and having excess risks for Anxiety/Depression, Thought Problems, and Attention Problems. In contrast, ecstasy-only users were more likely to be female and involved in using other illegal drugs, with their initiation motivated by entertainment and with the drug use taking place in such settings.
   Conclusions: The variation in the experience of psychoactive substance use and behavioral problems for betel nut and ecstasy users suggests the existence of subgroups of drug-using adolescents in Taiwan. The identification of such heterogeneity may guide the efforts to reduce substance use and develop subgroup-tailored preventive programs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An analysis of the emotional indicators in children's human figure drawings was done in order to investigate variables that could affect their prevalence. The sample consisted of 2,206 human figure drawings made by children (695 girls and 408 boys), aged between 5-12 years old, with no apparent clinical disturbances. Scoring systems by Naglieri, McNeish and Bardos (emotional assessment) and Wechsler (cognitive assessment) were employed. The analysis of variance demonstrated significant effects (p<.01) of children's sex and age; type of figure drawn; type of school attended; and interaction of sex, age and figure type on emotional as well as on cognitive scores. Emotional scores were negatively related (p<.01) to cognitive scores. Different cut-off scores are proposed to provide an adequate psychodiagnostic assessment.

AB Low-income youth experience social-emotional problems linked to chronic stress that are exacerbated by lack of access to care. Drumming is a non-verbal, universal activity that builds upon a collectivistic aspect of diverse cultures and does not bear the stigma of therapy. A pretest-post-test non-equivalent control group design was used to assess the effects of 12 weeks of school counselor-led drumming on social-emotional behavior in two fifth-grade intervention classrooms versus two standard education control classrooms. The weekly intervention integrated rhythmic and group counseling activities to build skills, such as emotion management, focus and listening. The Teacher's Report Form was used to assess each of 101 participants (n = 54 experimental, n = 47 control, 90% Latino, 53.5% female, mean age 10.5 years, range 10-12 years). There was 100% retention. ANOVA testing showed that intervention classrooms improved significantly compared to the control group in broad-band scales (total problems (P<.01), internalizing problems (P<.02)), narrow-band syndrome scales (withdrawn/depression (P<.02), attention problems (P<.01), inattention subscale (P<.001)), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-oriented scales (anxiety problems (P<.01), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (P<.01), inattention subscale (P<.001), oppositional defiant problems (P<.03)), and other scales (post-traumatic stress problems (P<.01), sluggish cognitive tempo (P<.001)). Participation in group drumming led to significant improvements in multiple domains of social-emotional behavior. This sustainable intervention can foster positive youth development and increase student-counselor interaction. These findings underscore the potential value of the arts as a therapeutic tool.

AB This study examines processes linking inner-city community violence exposure to subsequent internalizing and externalizing problems. Hypothesized risk and protective factors from 3 ecological domains-children's parent and peer relationships and individual characteristics-were examined for mediating, moderating, or independent roles in predicting problem behavior among 667 children over 3 years of middle school. Mediation was not found. However, parent and peer variables moderated the association between exposure and internalizing problems. Under high exposure, normally protective factors (e.g., attachment to parents) were less effective in mitigating exposure's effects than under low exposure; attachment to friends was more effective. Individual competence was independently associated with decreased internalizing problems. Variables from all domains, and exposure, were independently associated with externalizing problems. Protective factors (e.g., parent attachment) predicted decreased problems; risk factors (e.g., friends' delinquency) predicted increased problems. Results indicate community violence reduction as essential in averting inner-city adolescents' poor behavioral outcomes.

This study sought to evaluate participants in Prodigy (a program synthesizing arts and self-regulation skills) regarding changes in mental health symptoms and academic performance. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest was conducted with 108 at-risk adolescents and their parents. Significant reductions in internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms and increases in academic self-efficacy with positive trends in improved academic achievement were noted. Future research regarding the potential of these two modalities is discussed.

AB Self-injury among female adolescents has become an important clinical issue in social work practice. Anxiety has been cited as one of the primary reasons that self-injury occurs in this population. This paper explores the role of empathy in mitigating anxiety and helping with emotional regulation and highlights the need to empathically monitor the self-systems of female clients who self-injure. This paper considers issues of gender and family structure within this population and explores transference and countertransference as important processes that can help to develop empathy in the therapeutic relationship. A case study is presented to highlight these important processes. Implications for social work practice are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between sport type, interdependence (task and outcome), and the developmental experiences of select male basketball players (n=129) and middle-distance runners (n=83) aged 14-17 years. Athletes completed the Youth Experiences Survey 2.0 (Hansen Larson, 2005) and a modified measure assessing task and outcome interdependence (Van der Vegt, Emans, Van de Vliert, 1998 Vliert, 2001). Hierarchical multiple regression determined that basketball players reported higher rates of teamwork and social skills, adult networks and social capital, and negative experiences. Furthermore, outcome interdependence was a predictor of identity exploration, initiative, emotional regulation, positive relationships, teamwork and social skills, and adult networks and social capital experiences independent of sport type. Although different sports may provide different learning environments, the developmental experiences youth garner may be more strongly influenced by how the people involved interact (outcome interdependence) than by the type of sport.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as intentionally causing bodily harm to oneself without the intent to kill oneself. Recently, there has been an increase in research aimed at understanding why individuals, especially youth and young adults, engage in NSSI. This chapter explores the emergence and maintenance of NSSI from a developmental perspective. Epidemiological research suggests that rates of NSSI increase dramatically from early adolescence to young adulthood. No study has investigated NSSI in youth younger than age 10. Current understanding of how emotion and cognitions as well as interpersonal processes play a role in the emergence and maintenance of NSSI is explored. Further, the role of biology (e.g., neurological underpinnings, genetic associations, HPA-axis functioning) on NSSI is explored. Throughout the chapter, particular limitations (e.g., sample selection, measurement issues) in the extant corpus of knowledge are highlighted. Finally, we consider future research directions that may inform developmentally sensitive understanding of the proximal and distal risk factors that may affect the emergence and maintenance of NSSI across the life span.

AB Mental health problems (MHPs) among children with perinatal HIV infection have been described prior to and during the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Yet child, caregiver and socio-demographic factors associated with MHPs are not fully understood. We examined the prevalence of MHPs among older children and adolescents with perinatal HIV exposure, including both perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV+) and perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) youth. Our aims were to identify the impact of HIV infection by comparing PHIV+ and PHEU youth and to delineate risk factors associated with MHPs, in order to inform development of appropriate prevention and intervention strategies. Youth and their caregivers were interviewed with the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2) to estimate rates of at-risk and clinically significant MHPs, including caregiver-reported behavioral problems and youth-reported emotional problems. The prevalence of MHPs at the time of study entry was calculated for the group overall, as well as by HIV status and by demographic, child health, and caregiver characteristics. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with youth MHPs. Among 416 youth enrolled between March 2007 and July 2009 (295 PHIV+, 121 PHEU), the overall prevalence of MHPs at entry was 29% and greater than expected based on recent national surveys of the general population. MHPs were more likely among PHEU than among PHIV+ children (38% versus 25%, p < 0.01). Factors associated with higher odds of MHPs at p < 0.10 included caregiver characteristics (psychiatric disorder, limit-setting problems, health-related functional limitations) and child characteristics (younger age and lower IQ). These findings suggest that PHEU children are at high risk for MHPs, yet current models of care for these youth may not support early diagnosis and treatment. Family-based prevention and intervention programs for HIV affected youth and their caregivers may minimize long-term consequences of MHPs.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether exposure to violence (EV) in several contexts predicts aggressive behavior through social information processing (SIP) in adolescents. Six hundred and fifty adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 participated in a 3-wave longitudinal study. The participants completed measures of proactive and reactive aggression at all waves, SIP measures at Time 1 and Time 2, and violence exposure at Time 1. It was expected that SIP would mediate the predictive relationship between EV and aggressive behavior. We found that total Time 1 EV predicted Time 3 reactive aggression. The influence of EV on proactive aggression was direct. Slight differences emerged, however, for victimization and witnessing violence. Witnessing was associated with reactive aggression via both hostile attribution and response selection, whereas victimization predicted reactive aggression via hostile attribution only. Results also suggested that the types of exposure that are most relevant for the development of aggressive behavior are community and school violence. Finally, male adolescents experienced more EV than female adolescents in all contexts except in the home. The findings indicate that intervention in social-cognitive mechanisms is important to reduce aggressive behavior in adolescents who have been exposed to violence.

AB Evidence for the importance of sleep in the mood disorders has mushroomed over the past decade. Among adolescents and adults with a mood disorder, sleep disturbance is a risk factor for episodes, can contribute to relapse, has an adverse impact on emotion regulation, is critical for cognitive functioning, compromises health, and may contribute to substance use comorbidity and suicidality. This evidence has triggered a shift away from viewing sleep disturbance as an epiphenomenon, toward viewing sleep disturbance as an important but under-recognized mechanism in the multifactorial cause and maintenance of the mood disorders. Because the biology underpinning the sleep and circadian system is an open system, readily influenced by inputs from the environment, sleep in the mood disorders represents a unique and exciting domain for interdisciplinary research across behavioral, social, cognitive, and neurobiological levels of explanation. Together, the accumulated evidence has informed a range of novel, powerful, simple, and inexpensive treatments with potential for massive improvements to public health, including improving quality of life, reducing length and severity of episodes, and reducing the risk of subsequent episodes in the large number of individuals who suffer from mood disorders.

AB We investigated the change in mountaineers' affect from pre- to post-mountain route and the moderating role of self-regulation strategies in this process. First, we hypothesized that engagement in a high-risk sport such as mountaineering would lead to a decrease in negative affect and an increase in positive affect and that this affect regulation would be moderated by self-regulation strategies (escape from self-awareness and compensation). Second, we predicted that the self-regulation affect process would be specifically associated with high-risk sport rather than sport generally. One hundred and five mountaineers and 73 judokas completed the Risk and Excitement Inventory and the Positive and Negative Emotions Scale before and after completing their activity (mountain route or judo fight). Regression analyses revealed that anxiety significantly decreased from pre- to post-mountain route and that the self-regulation of escape from awareness yielded a significantly greater anxiety decrease. No such interaction emerged for the compensation strategy and no effects were revealed for judokas. Results are discussed in terms of the specificity of the high-risk sport domain in its ability to serve an affect regulation function for those individuals who seek to escape from self-awareness.

AB This article examined the impact of distress tolerance on sex differences in the acquired capability for suicide. Two hundred undergraduate participants filled out a series of questionnaires related to emotions and suicide risk. Males exhibited higher mean levels of the acquired capability than did women and distress tolerance interacted with sex to predict the acquired capability (=-.70, p.02), such that males with high distress tolerance were at the greatest risk. These results indicate that the degree to which an individual can tolerate negative emotions impacts the strength of the relationship between sex and the acquired capability for suicide.

AB This study examined associations between attachment insecurity and autonomic response during the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) in a sample of 47 women with eating disorders using a new system for the synchronous acquisition of behavioral and physiological data: the Bio Dual-channel and Representation of Attachment Multimedia System (BioDReAMS; Soares, Cunha, Zhan Jian Li, Pinho, Neves, 1998). Consistent with the emerging literature on the psychophysiology of adult attachment, insecurity was positively correlated with electrodermal reactivity during the AAI. Furthermore, relatively secure patients showed some evidence of parasympathetic withdrawal, which can be conceptualized as evidence of more effective emotion regulation. Results suggest that, even among women with diagnosed psychopathology, security is associated with moreproductive patterns of psychophysiological response to attachment-related challenges.

Children in the CWS also experience a diverse range of reactions across multiple areas of functioning that are associated with such exposure. Nevertheless, few CWSs routinely screen for trauma exposure and associated symptoms beyond an initial assessment of the precipitating event. This study examines trauma histories, including complex trauma exposure (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, domestic violence), posttraumatic stress, and behavioral and emotional problems of 2,251 youth (age 0 to 21; M = 9.5, SD = 4.3) in foster care who were referred to a National Child Traumatic Stress Network site for treatment. High prevalence rates of complex trauma exposure were observed: 70.4% of the sample reported at least two of the traumas that constitute complex trauma; 11.7% of the sample reported all 5 types. Compared to youth with other types of trauma, those with complex trauma histories had significantly higher rates of internalizing problems, posttraumatic stress, and clinical diagnoses, and differed on some demographic variables. Implications for child welfare practice and future research are discussed.

AB The orbital frontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, a better understanding of its functions will likely provide critical information to understand the specific behavioral and cognitive processes affected in these human disorders. In recent years, a growing number of studies have provided evidence for anatomical and functional differentiation within the OFC. Here we discuss the effects of selective OFC (areas 11/13) lesions on social behavior, emotional regulation, and behavioral adaptation. Damage to these specific OFC subfields in adult monkeys resulted in profound changes in the flexible modulation of responses guided by reward value that could explain the poor fear regulation and disturbed social interactions observed in the same animals. A similar pattern of results was found when the OFC lesions were done in infancy. Thus, in monkeys, self-regulation abilities mediated by OFC areas 11/13 emerge from midinfancy through adolescence.

AB We outline a contextual and motivational model of judgment and decision-making (JDM) biases across the life span. Our model focuses on abilities and skills that correspond to deliberative, experiential, and affective decision-making processes. We review research that addresses links between JDM biases and these processes as represented by individual differences in specific abilities and skills (e.g., fluid and crystallized intelligence, executive functioning, emotion regulation, personality traits). We focus on two JDM biase-the sunk-cost fallacy (SCF) and the framing effect. We trace the developmental trajectory of each bias from preschool through middle childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, and later adulthood. We conclude that life-span developmental trajectories differ depending on the bias investigated. Existing research suggests relative stability in the framing effect across the life span and decreases in the SCF with age, including in later life. We highlight directions for future research on JDM biases across the life span, emphasizing the need for process-oriented research and research that increases our understanding of JDM biases in people's everyday lives.

AB Narratives of the self are embedded within families in which narrative interaction is a common practice. Especially in adolescence, when issues of identity and emotional regulation become key, narratives provide frameworks for understating self and emotion. The authors' research on family narratives suggests that adolescents' personal narratives are at least partly shaped by intergenerational narratives about their parents' childhoods. Both personal and intergenerational narratives emerge frequently in typical family dinner conversations, and these narratives reflect gendered ways of being in the world. Adolescents who tell intergenerational narratives that are rich in intergenerational connections and perspective-taking show higher levels of well-being. These findings suggest that individual narrative selves are created within families and across generations. (C) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Adolescence ushers in dramatic social and affective changes and increased vulnerability for affective disorders. Yet, little is known about the effects of pubertal maturation on neural systems of social threat processing. We examined adolescents' brain function to social stimuli in relation to pubertal maturation, depressive symptoms, and real-world subjective negative affect. Compared with pre/early adolescents, mid/late adolescents exhibited less amygdala reactivity to emotionally neutral faces relative to non-face stimuli; less ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) reactivity to fearful faces relative to non-face stimuli, neutral faces, or angry faces; and more VLPFC reactivity to angry relative to neutral faces. Amygdala and VLPFC reactivity were correlated with negative affect and depressive symptoms. Threat-processing changes during puberty may facilitate changes in social behavior and negative affect.

TI Parental Reporting of Adverse Drug Reactions Associated with
   Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Medications in Children
   Attending Specialist Paediatric Clinics in the UK
SO DRUG SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
ID STIMULANT MEDICATIONS; METHYLPHENIDATE; TRIAL; COMMUNITY
AB Background: The development of systems to ensure appropriate and informed use of medicines in children is a global priority. Current pharmacovigilance systems, such as the UK Yellow Card Scheme, are limited by opportunistic reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), lack of a denominator and lower than expected reporting rates.
   Objective: To develop a pharmacovigilance system able to target specific patient populations such as children, and specific medicines of interest, using specialist medical clinics.
   Methods: Between January and March 2010, parents of 578 children (3-16 years of age) receiving pharmacological therapy for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and attending a child and adolescent clinic in the UK were sent an ADR questionnaire to elicit information on possible ADRs associated with their child's medication use. Two approaches, free text and a symptom tick list, were used to elicit possible ADRs.
   Results: Two hundred and seven questionnaires were returned, of which 200 were evaluable, giving a response rate of 35.9%. 123 questionnaires reported a total of 213 free-text ADRs perceived by the parents to be due to the medications under study. Two-thirds of reported ADRs were considered to be ongoing at the time of reporting. Duration of reported ADRs ranged from 1 week to 3 years. 81 returned questionnaires reported 134 different ADRs for methylphenidate monotherapy. For methylphenidate, the most frequently reported ADRs were loss of appetite (34.3%), headache (17.9%), mood and emotional problems (14.9%), stomach upset (14.9%), sleep disturbance (10.4%), and rash and other skin problems (5.2%). 467 possible drug-related symptoms were reported using the tick-list approach. Using the tick list, the most frequently reported symptoms were mood and emotional problems (28.1% [131/467]), stomach and abdominal problems (13.3% [62/467]), insomnia (12.8% [60/467]) and lack of appetite (12.6% [59/467]). The symptom tick list identified a broader range of possible adverse effects not reported as free-text ADRs, such as schooling difficulties, hearing problems, cough and blurred vision.
   Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using specialist clinics to target both at-risk patient populations and/or medicines of interest. We have also clearly demonstrated the practicality and feasibility of parental reporting. Parents reported common and less common ADRs, such as suicidal ideation, using both the free text and symptom tick-list approach.

AB The study investigated the interactive impact of different dimensions of social skills on children's emotional symptoms. We differentiate between self-oriented social skills which focus on considering own goals and needs in social interactions (assertiveness, social participation) and other-oriented social skills which focus on considering other's goals and needs (pro-social and cooperative behavior). 167 children participated in the study at the ages of 5, 6, and 9 years. A multi-informant approach (parents, teacher, and child) was employed to assess children's psychopathology. Teachers rated children's social skills. The study demonstrated the importance of deficits in self-oriented social skills for the development of emotional symptoms. Low levels of assertiveness predicted later emotional symptoms. In children with low levels of pro-social behavior, high assertiveness protected from emotional problems. In contrast, high levels of pro-social behavior emerged as a risk factor for later emotional symptoms, especially when is goes along with low levels of social participation.

AB This study investigated the short-term effects of behavioural training for preschool children. The goals of this programme were to reduce disruptive behaviour as well as shy and withdrawn behaviour, and to promote social-emotional competencies. In young children, insufficient emotional competencies and difficulties concerning adequate conflict resolution are already related to conduct disorders and problems with peers. At the same time, preschool age is a developmental stage where children begin to acquire many social-emotional competencies. Method The study used a quasi-experimental evaluation design with eight preschool classes of children (N = 90) aged three to six years. In order to assess the impact of the social-emotional skills training, intervention and control group outcomes were to be compared pre- and post-test. The effects on behaviour problems and social-emotional competencies were assessed by teacher ratings. Results Relative to controls, children displayed fewer problems with peers as well as less restless, inattentive behaviour and their emotion regulation skills and academic skills had improved. However, no effects were found regarding aggressive behaviour or emotional problems. RESUME: Contexte L'etude presente les effets a court terme de l'entrainement comportemental pour les enfants d'age prescolaire. Les objectifs de ce programme sont de reduire les comportements perturbateurs ainsi que les conduites de timidite et de repli sur soi, et de developper les competences socio-emotionnelles. Chez les jeunes enfants, des competences emotionnelles insuffisantes et des difficultes dans la resolution de conflit sont deja reliees a des troubles et des problemes avec les pairs. Dans le meme temps, la periode prescolaire est un stade du developpement au cours duquel les enfants commencent a acquerir de nombreuses competences socio-emotionnelles. Methode: L'etude a mis en OEuvre une demarche quasi-experimentale avec huit classes d'enfants ages de trois a six ans (N = 90). Afin d' evaluer l'impact de l'entrainement aux capacites socio-emotionnelles, les resultats d'un groupe experimental et d'un groupe controle ont ete compares lors d'un pre-test et d'un post-test. Les effets sur les problemes de comportement et sur les competences socio-emotionnelles ont ete evalues par les enseignants. Resultats: Selon les controles, les enfants presentent moins de problemes avec les pairs, ainsi que moins d'agitation, d'inattention, et ameliorent leurs capacite de regulation des emotions et leurs acquisitions scolaires. Cependant, il n'y pas eu d'effet constate sur les conduites agressives ou les problemes emotionnels. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: In dieser Studie werden kurzfristige Effekte des Verhaltenstrainings im Kindergarten vorgestellt. Das Programm zielt darauf ab, oppositionell-aggressives Verhalten und sozial unsicheres Verhalten von Kindern im Kindergartenalter zu vermindern und sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen zu fordern. Mangelnde emotionale Kompetenzen und Schwierigkeiten Konflikte angemessen zu losen, stehen schon bei jungen Kindern mit Verhaltensstorungen und Problemen mit Gleichaltrigen im Zusammenhang. Gleichzeitig umfasst das Kindergartenalter eine Entwicklungsphase, in der viele sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen erst von den Kindern gelernt werden. Neunzig Kinder im Alter zwischen drei und sechs Jahren nahmen im Rahmen einer quasiexperimentellen Studie an der Uberprufung der Wirksamkeit des Trainings teil.
   Dazu wurden die Padagogen der Kinder vor und nach dem Training in der Interventions- und der Kontrollgruppe zu sozialen und emotionalen Kmpetenzen der Kinder befragt. Im Vergleich mit den Kindern der Kontrollgruppe zeigten die der Interventionsgruppe nach dem Training weniger Probleme mit Gleichaltrigen und weniger Probleme durch motorische Unruhe und unaufmerksames Verhalten. Die emotionale Regulationsfahigkeit verbesserte sich und sozial-emotionale Kompetenzen stiegen an. RESUMEN: En este estudio se presentan efectos a corto plazo del entrenamiento del comportamiento (condicionamiento) de ninos en el jardin infantil. El programa pretende disminuir tanto comportamientos agresivos como inseguridad social de los ninos en edad parvularia, y a fortalecer las capacidades socio-emocionales. En ninos pequenos, las deficiencias en las capacidades emocionales y en las dificultades para resolver conflictos en forma adecuada, estan ligados a trastornos de comportamiento y problemas con ninos de la misma edad. Al mismo tiempo la edad parvularia abarca una fase de evolucion en la cual los ninos adquieren la mayoria de las competencias socio-emocionales. 90 ninos de una edad comprendida entre los tres y los seis anos participaron en un estudio cuasi-experimental para comprobar la eficacia del entrenamiento. Para este fin, antes y despues del entrenamiento se entrevisto a los pedagogos de los ninos, tanto del grupo de intervencion como del grupo de control, acerca de las competencias sociales y emocionales de los ninos. En comparacion con el grupo de control los ninos del grupo de intervencion mostraron menos problemas con ninos de su misma edad, menos problemas de agitacion motora y de comportamiento inatento. Se incremento la capacidad reguladora y las capacidades socio-emocionales aumentaron positivamente.

AB When families migrate the new culture and culture of origin may conflict, with possible consequences for parenting and children's development. Turks form one of the largest immigrant groups in Western Europe, and there is also much movement within Turkey. This study compares three groups; Turkish immigrants to the UK (N=142), migrants within Turkey (N=229), and Turkish non-migrants (locals, N=396). The children were 39-71 months old (M=58 months, SD=6.5), 392 were boys and 375 were girls. Parents supplied data on family characteristics and parenting, and teachers supplied data on children's behaviour. Using Baumrind's parenting model and allowing for background effects, compared to non-migrants and migrants, the immigrant parents were less permissive and more authoritarian. Children in immigrant families had more externalizing problems, internalizing problems and emotional dysregulation and less social competence than migrant and non-migrant children. Multilevel models and structural equation models both found that these effects upon child behaviour were evident after taking into account demographic factors and were not eliminated by taking into account parenting style differences, and thus suggest that immigration and migration are risk factors for child behaviour. Effects of immigrant and migrant status were partly direct and partly indirect via their effects on parenting.

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY

DT Article
DE emotion-regulation; emotion; faces; go/nogo
AB Emotion discrimination, emotion regulation, and cognitive control are three related, yet separable processes that emerge over the course of development. The current study tested 100 children, adolescents, and adults on an Emotional Go/Nogo task, illustrating the ability of this paradigm to identify the unique developmental patterns for each of these three processes in the context of both positive (happy) and negative emotions (fear, sad, and anger), across three different age groups. Consistent with previous literature, our findings show that emotion discrimination and regulatory abilities (both cognitive control and emotion regulation) improve steadily for each age group, with each age group showing unique patterns of performance. The findings suggest that emotion regulation is constructed from basic cognition control and emotion discrimination skills. The patterns of behavior from the Emotional Go/Nogo task provide normative benchmark data across a wide range of emotions that can be used for future behavioral and neuroimaging studies that examine the developmental construction of emotion regulatory processes.

AB This exploratory study examined the mean levels of perfectionism among 178 general education students and 141 students enrolled in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, a rigorous academic curriculum. The study also explored perfectionism in relation to grade level and student outcomes (psychological functioning, academic achievement). Results of independent t-tests and one-way ANOVAs indicated higher levels of adaptive perfectionism and lower levels of maladaptive perfectionism among IB students, as well as a significant decrease in mean levels of adaptive perfectionism and increases in maladaptive perfectionism by grade level among IB students. Among both groups of high school students, maladaptive perfectionism was linked to greater anxiety and lower GPAs; IB students evidenced a particularly strong inverse relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and global life satisfaction. Adaptive perfectionism was moderately correlated with academic achievement, as well as associated with greater life satisfaction especially for general education students. Maladaptive perfectionism did not moderate any relationships between adaptive perfectionism and student outcomes.

AB In mammals, sex specialization is reflected by differences in brain anatomy and function. Measurable differences are documented in reproductive behavior, cognition, and emotion. We hypothesized that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plays a crucial role in controlling the extent of the brain's sex specificity and that changes in GnRH action during critical periods of brain development, such as puberty, will result in altered sex-specific behavioral and physiological patterns. We blocked puberty in half of the 48 same-sex Scottish mule Texel cross sheep twins with GnRH analog (GnRHa) goserelin acetate every 3 weeks, beginning just before puberty. To determine the effects of GnRHa treatment on sex-specific behavior and emotion regulation in different social contexts, we employed the food acquisition task (FAT) and measurement of heart rate variability (HRV). ANOVA revealed significant sex and sex x treatment interaction effects, suggesting that treated males were more likely to leave their companions to acquire food than untreated, while the opposite effect was observed in females. Concordant results were seen in HRV; treated males displayed higher HRV than untreated, while the reverse pattern was found in females, as shown by significant sex and sex x treatment interaction effects. We conclude that long-term prepubertal GnRHa treatment significantly affected sex-specific brain development, which impacted emotion and behavior regulation in sheep. These results suggest that GnRH is a modulator of cognitive function in the developing brain and that the sexes are differentially affected by GnRH modulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Despite consensus that development shapes every aspect of coping, studies of age differences in coping have proven difficult to integrate, primarily because they examine largely unselected age groups, and utilize overlapping coping categories. A developmental framework was used to organize 58 studies of coping involving over 250 age comparisons or correlations with age. The framework was based on (1) conceptualizations of coping as regulation to suggest ages at which coping should show developmental shifts (Skinner & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2009), and (2) notions of hierarchical families to clarify which coping categories should be distinguished at each age (Skinner, Edge, Altman, & Sherwood, 2003). Developmental patterns in coping (e. g., problem-solving, distraction, support-seeking, escape) were scrutinized with a focus on common age shifts. Two kinds of age trends were discerned, one reflecting increases in coping capacities, as seen in support-seeking (from reliance on adults to more self-reliance), problem-solving (from instrumental action to planful problem-solving), and distraction (adding cognitive to behavioural strategies); and one reflecting improvements in the deployment of different coping strategies according to which ones are most effective in dealing with specific kinds of stressors. Results were used to formulate guidelines for future research on the development of coping.

AB Background:
   While research indicates elevated behavioural and emotional problems in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and decreased well-being in their parents, studies do not typically separate out the contribution of ASD from that of associated intellectual disabilities (ID). We investigated child behavioural and emotional problems, and maternal mental health, among cases with and without ASD and ID in a large population-representative sample.
   Methods:
   Cross-sectional comparison of child behavioural and emotional problems and maternal mental health measures among 18,415 children (5 to 16 years old), of whom 47 had an ASD, 51 combined ASD with ID, 590 had only ID, and the remainder were the comparison group with no ASD or ID.
   Results:
   The prevalence of likely clinical levels of behavioural and emotional problems was highest among children with ASD (with and without ID). After controlling for age, gender, adversity, and maternal mental health, the presence of ASD and ID significantly and independently increased the odds for hyperactivity symptoms, conduct, and emotional problems. Emotional disorder was more prevalent in mothers of children with ASD (with or without ID). The presence of ASD, but not ID, significantly increased the odds for maternal emotional disorder. As has been found in previous research, positive maternal mental health was not affected by the presence of ASD or ID.
   Conclusions:
   ASD and ID are independent risk factors for behavioural and emotional problems. ASD (but not ID) is positively associated with maternal emotional disorder. Approaches to diagnosing hyperactivity and conduct problems in children with ASD may need to be reconsidered.

AB We examined whether associations between symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), depression, and anxiety assessed in a sample of 2,026 youth aged 6 to 16 years and socioeconomic functioning measured 18 years later varied as a function of whether parents or teachers had rated symptomatology. After accounting for confounding variables (e.g., family socioeconomic status in childhood), psychological symptoms explained 2.78% of the variability in adult socioeconomic status. Much of that variance was unique to teachers or parents (0.90% and 1.41%, respectively). Moreover, several informant-specific associations emerged: teacher-rated depression and parent-rated ADHD and ODD were significant predictors of later socioeconomic functioning. Overall, these findings provide further evidence that differences between informants are meaningful and support the utility of maintaining the unique perspective of each rater in analytic and measurement strategies.

AB In this study, we examined the internal consistency of informant discrepancies in reports of youth behavior and emotional problems and their unique relations with youth, caregiver, and family characteristics. In a heterogeneous multisite clinic sample of 420 youths (ages 11-17 years), high internal consistency estimates were observed across measures of informant discrepancies. Further, latent profile analyses identified systematic patterns of discrepancies, characterized by their magnitude and direction (i.e., which informant reported greater youth problems). In addition, informant discrepancies systematically and uniquely related to informants' own perspectives of youth mood problems, and these relations remained significant after taking into account multiple informants' reports of informant characteristics widely known to relate to informant discrepancies. These findings call into question the prevailing view of informant discrepancies as indicative of unreliability and/or bias on the part of informants' reports of youths' behavior.

AB This study evaluated whether pubertal development and gender role orientation (i.e., masculinity and femininity) can partially explain sex variations in youth anxiety symptoms among clinic-referred anxious youth (N = 175; ages 9-13 years; 74% Hispanic; 48% female). Using youth and parent ratings of youth anxiety symptoms, structural equation modeling results indicated that youth who reported being more advanced in their pubertal development reported high levels of femininity and anxiety symptoms. Youth who reported high levels of masculinity had low levels of anxiety symptoms as reported by both youths and parents. The estimated effects of pubertal development, femininity, and masculinity on youth and parent ratings of youth anxiety symptoms were not significantly moderated by biological sex. Pubertal development and gender role orientation appear to be important in explaining levels of youth anxiety symptoms among clinic-referred anxious youth.

AB Background Familial risk factors have been implicated in the development of mental health problems in adolescents. Whether the associations between parental loading, as assessed by lifetime psychopathology, and offspring internalising and externalising problems were moderated by family socioeconomic position (SEP) was investigated. Two hypotheses of moderation were tested: (1) the "social push" hypothesis in which parental loading effects are stronger in contexts with low environmental risks and (2) the "vulnerability" hypothesis in which parental loading effects are stronger in high-risk environments.
   Method In a population-based sample of 2149, familial loading and family SEP were assessed at baseline by parent reports. Offspring psychopathology was assessed by reports from multiple informants (parent, self and teachers). Multiple linear regression was used to assess the independent associations of parental loading and family SEP on offspring psychopathology and their potential interaction.
   Results Both family SEP and familial loading had significant independent main effects on offspring internalising and externalising problems. However, the interaction terms were not significant and did not add any explanatory power to the model.
   Conclusions Lower levels of family SEP appear not to confer additional risks for mental health problems in offspring of parents with high loading on psychopathology. During early adolescence, parental psychopathology and low family SEP seem independent risk factors for offspring mental health problems. Results do not support either the social push or vulnerability hypothesis as no evidence of interactions between parental loading and family SEP were found.

ID BORDERLINE PERSONALITY; EMOTION; PSYCHOPATHY; MOTIVATION; OFFENDERS;
   BEHAVIOR
AB Despite its relative neglect by most emotion theorists, excitement has been found to be an important motive for criminal, and particularly violent, offending in young men. Exceptionally, reversal theory (Apter, M.J. (2007b). Reversal theory: The dynamics of motivation, emotion and personality (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oneworld Publications.) regards the quest for excitement as a powerful motive for human behaviour, including antisocial behaviour. The quest for excitement, manifesting as a desire to inflict harm and suffering on others, is prevalent in the dissocial domain of personality disorders and is arguably most prominent in those showing traits of 'meanness' and 'disinhibition' (Patrick, C. (2010). Conceptualizing the psychopathic personality: Disinhibited, bold... or just plain mean? In D. R. Lynam & R.J. Salekin (Eds.), Handbook of child and adolescent psychopathy (pp. 15-48). New York: Guilford Press.). Violence motivated by the desire for excitement is often facilitated by drug or alcohol use, overrides whatever feelings of empathy individuals might have for their victims, and represents a failure of emotion regulation characterised by an inability to down-regulate positive emotional states such as excitement and exhilaration. A quadripartite typology of violence is described which is intended as a working hypothesis and a framework to guide future research focusing on motivations for violent offending.

AB Core features of psychopathic personality in adults are shallow affectivity and generally low levels of emotional distress. Several studies suggest that these features are also in young people with psychopathic personality traits. The concept of emotion regulation refers to a person's ability to regulate negative emotions to reduce feelings of emotional distress. Since maladaptive emotion regulation has been associated with high levels of emotional distress it may be expected that individuals with psychopathic personality traits show particularly adaptive strategies for the regulation of negative emotionality. On the basis of these expectations, the current study investigated the relationship between psychopathic traits, self-reported degree of emotional problems, and emotion regulation strategies in 104 incarcerated young offenders. Psychopathic traits were not associated with emotional problems or with adaptive emotion-regulation but were positively related to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. When scores for each psychopathy factor were investigated separately, significant disparities were found in emotional symptoms and emotion regulation.

ID DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE; STRENGTHS
AB The aim of this study was to investigate group sex offenses with regard to the role of leaders versus followers and to compare both groups on levels of psychopathology, intelligence, and psychosocial and offense-related characteristics. Eighty-nine adolescent group sex offenders (mean age = 14.9, SD = 1.4) referred by the police to the Dutch child protection agency were examined. Psychopathology, intelligence, and psychosocial and offense-related characteristics were assessed by means of standardized instruments, and criminal careers of the participants were ascertained from official judicial records. Although leaders and followers were similar on many characteristics, some remarkable differences were found. During their sexual acts, followers reported using excessive force more frequently than leaders. Furthermore, leaders reported more emotional problems, whereas followers were characterized by higher levels of problems in the social relational domain. As the findings indicate that juvenile group sex offenders constitute a group with specific mental health needs, diagnostic investigation is important to recognize risk factors and (treatable) problems. The absence of some expected differences between leaders and followers could be due to the method of classification or because group offending constitutes a dynamic process without clearly defined roles for individuals.

AB Objective While studies of the effects of prenatal smoking on child psychopathology have found positive relationships, most studies (1) failed to control for a range of correlates of maternal smoking that could affect children's behavior; (2) have been conducted with school-age rather than younger children, so it is not clear when such problems emerge; and (3) have not examined the effects on internalizing problems. Method This study examined the effects of prenatal smoke exposure on behaviors associated with externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and negative temperament in a diverse community sample of 679 4-year-olds. Results After controlling for correlates that include socioeconomic status, life stress, family conflict, maternal depression, maternal scaffolding skills, mother-child attachment, child negative affect and effortful control, smoking during pregnancy was no longer associated with child behavior or emotional problems. Conclusions Future studies need to control for a wide range of covariates of maternal smoking.

AB Little is known about the long-term consequences of positive well-being in childhood in the general population. We analysed data from the British 1946 birth cohort study to test associations between adolescent positive wellbeing and well-being in midlife. Positive and negative behaviours at ages 13 and 15 were rated by school teachers, and personality was assessed when the children were 16 years. Positive childhood behaviour was associated with midlife well-being; specifically a low probability of lifetime emotional problems, satisfaction with work, a high frequency of contact with friends or family and engagement in social activities. Happy children in this cohort were no more likely to marry, but significantly more likely to divorce. These associations were independent of childhood social class, childhood cognition, educational attainment, midlife occupational social class and extraversion. From this longitudinal study, we conclude that childhood well-being predicts positive adult wellbeing, and not merely the absence of mental ill-health.

AB This paper reports results of an evaluation study on effectiveness of a social-emotional competence training. Preschool children (n = 127) took part in a training program and are compared to an untreated control group (n = 129) by means of teachers evaluation questionnaires before and after the training. Afterwards, the training effects of a risk group with problematic social behavior are evaluated. General analyses show positive effects on social-emotional competence, but only marginal effects on problem behavior. However, differential analyses of the risk group show positive effects on both aspects. Due to the practicability and the results for the promotion of social-emotional skills, the evaluated training can also be recommended as a universal prevention program.

AB The toll of multiple and prolonged deployments on families has become clearer in recent years as military families have seen an increase in childhood anxiety, parental psychological distress, and marital discord. Families overcoming under stress (FOCUS), a family-centered evidence-informed resiliency training program developed at University of California, Los Angeles and Harvard Medical School, is being implemented at military installations through an initiative from Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. The research foundation for FOCUS includes evidence-based preventive interventions that were adapted to meet the specific needs of military families facing combat operational stress associated with wartime deployments. Using a family narrative approach, FOCUS includes a customized approach utilizing core intervention components, including psychoeducation, emotional regulation skills, goal setting and problem solving skills, traumatic stress reminder management techniques, and family communication skills. The purpose of this study is to describe the development and implementation of FOCUS for military families. A case example is also presented.

AB Loss of control (LOG) over eating is a common and psychopathologically relevant experience in childhood. The current study aimed at evaluating bite size and bite velocity as behavioral indicators of LOG eating in an experimental test meal study with a variation of mood. Children with or without LOG eating (N = 120, 8-13 years) consumed a parent-child test meal and a child-only meal consisting of snack food, following induction of negative mood. Bite size and bite velocity were determined through behavioral observation, food intake was measured, and sense of LOG and mood were rated. Children with LOG eating did not show greater bite size and bite velocity than children without LOG eating. Bite size of children with LOG eating was increased in negative mood and decreased in neutral mood. Greater bite size and bite velocity predicted greater food intake at test meal and snack eating and greater LOG over eating at snack eating, however, without an intervening influence of negative mood. Bite size was significantly associated with greater body weight of child and parent. Bite size and bite velocity were not significantly associated with eating disorder psychopathology and varying levels of LOG symptoms. The evidence as to whether bite size and bite velocity are suited as behavioral indicators of LOG eating is not clear-cut. Further research on behavioral indicators of childhood LOG eating is warranted.

AB The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) is one of the most frequently used dimensional instruments for screening behavioural and emotional problems in children. In this study the psychometric properties of the CBCL 2001-version and the usefulness of existing US norms within a Flemish community sample were explored. Mothers of young children (N = 170) and school-aged children and adolescents (N = 718) completed the CBCL and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Reliability of both the CBCL/1(1)/(2)-5 and CBCL/6-18 was excellent. There were substantial correlations between the SDQ and CBCL scales, indicating a good concurrent validity. Significant differences were found when comparing the mean CBCL raw scores of the different sub-samples (for different ages and gender groups) with the US norms. Generally spoken, the mean CBCL raw scores as well as the clinical and borderline clinical cutpoints for Flemish children were mostly lower, specifically for the Total Problems score and the Externalising scales.

AB This study explored the mediating effect of coping strategies on the relationship between emotional competence (EC) and quality of life (QOL) among children with asthma. Participants were 87 children (M age = 11.72, SD = 2.58) with controlled and partially controlled asthma, undergoing everyday treatment. They filled in questionnaires assessing EC, coping strategies and QOL. Results showed that the association between some ECs and the QOL of children with asthma was fully mediated by two maladaptive cognitive coping strategies. Among children with asthma, a greater ability to differentiate their emotions, a reduced attention to bodily signals of emotions and a reduced analysis of their current emotional state were related to decreased engagement in two coping strategies ('Ignoring Asthma' and 'Worrying about Asthma'), which in turn increased their QOL. These findings show that EC has an indirect effect on QOL through very specific coping strategies. They also emphasise the importance of screening EC in children with asthma and the importance of developing and using multidisciplinary interventions for them.

AB Background: Prenatal stress is known to be a potential risk factor for cognitive, behavioural and motor development that even last until adolescence. A consensus of how 'prenatal stress' can be measured, in which trimester of pregnancy women should be studied and whether subjective feelings of being stressed are associated with a hormonal response is still lacking. To close this gap, a prospective longitudinal study was conducted in pregnant women. Sampling and Methods: 108 subjects were asked to fill out questionnaires concerning pregnancy-related anxiety, perceived stress, marital satisfaction, critical life events and to collect salivary cortisol in each trimester of pregnancy. Results: Fear of giving birth increases until the end of pregnancy, and marital satisfaction is highest at the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress is related to a hormonal response in cortisol only in the first (r = 0.18, p < 0.10) and second (r = 0.18, p ! 0.10) trimesters of pregnancy. Critical life events are linked to raised cortisol levels in early pregnancy only (r = 0.28, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Prenatal stress can be operationalized by using different subjective as well as physiological stress measures. Only in the first half of pregnancy self-report and physiological stress measures seem to be associated. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

Sampling and Methods: Data were collected from 439 adolescents (age = 12-17 years) admitted to psychiatric hospitalization between April 2001 and March 2006. Information on adolescents' suicidal behavior and psychiatric DSM-IV diagnoses was obtained by using the Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children. An adolescent was defined as overweight if his/her BMI exceeded the 85th percentile BMI in the age-and sex-matched Finnish population. Results: Compared to adolescents without overweight, a 2.5-fold likelihood for SMB was found among overweight girls, but not among boys. Conclusions: Low self-esteem, depression or dysfunctional emotion regulation may be possible mediating factors between overweight and SMB. Copyright (C) 2011 S Karger AG, Basel

AB Although children and adolescents with developmental disabilities are said to have higher risks of abuse than those without, trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are little examined in those diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Our study aims to assess trauma types, prevalence, risk factors and symptoms: and PTSD in individuals with diagnosis of ASD. Participants were 69 children and adolescents (53 males, 16 females) who were consecutively followed-up at our clinic and met DSM-IV criteria for ASD. Assessment was done using semi-structured interview forms. 18 had trauma history and 12 were diagnosed with PTSD. Witnessing or being a victim of accidents/disasters/violence was the most common type of trauma. Interestingly, the rate of sexual and/or physical abuse was less than in the general population. Trauma history and PTSD rates were higher in girls than boys. Deterioration in social and communicative abilities, increase in stereotypes, aggression, distractibility, sleep disorders, agitation, hyperactivity, self-injury, and loss of self-care skills were the most common symptoms detected following trauma. These results underscore the importance of detailed assessment of behavioral and emotional problems in this group by ruling out any trauma history at periods which might otherwise be misdiagnosed as an exacerbation of symptoms of ASD.

AB According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model endorsed by the World Health Organization, activity (the execution of a task or action by an individual), and participation (involvement in a life situation) are important components in the assessment of health and functioning of an individual. The purpose of this study was to compare the activity performance and school participation of preschool children with developmental delay (DD) and age-matched typically developing children, and to identify the determinants of activity and participation in preschoolers with DD. Fifty-four children with DD (37 boys, 17 girls; mean age: 66 months) and 54 age-matched typically developing children (34 boys, 20 girls; mean age: 65 months) were recruited from the mainstream preschools with integrated program units. Activity and participation were evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and School Function Assessment (SFA). Other factors that may influence activity and participation such as impairments in sensory, motor, and mental functioning, and other contextual factors (e.g. family income) were also measured. The DD group had significantly lower VABS (p < 0.001) and SFA (p < 0.001) scores than controls, indicating suboptimal activity and participation. Multiple regression analysis revealed that deficits in social and motor skills, and in inattention/hyperactivity, were significantly associated with activity and participation in children with DD, accounting for approximately 35-37% of the variance in the VABS and SFA scores (p < 0.001). In conclusion, deficits in social and motor functioning, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder-related symptoms, are important determinants of activity and participation in preschoolers with DD. One may consider targeting these specific areas to enhance activity and participation amongst these children. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Scientific literature has shown that self-esteem and emotion regulation are related to various psychopatological disorders, although, few studies have investigated the influence of these variables in well-being. Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the relations of these variables with subjective well-being (life satisfaction) and psychological well-being (happiness and meaning). It also wants to investigate the predictive value of gender, self-esteem and emotion regulation strategies (suppression and cognitive reavaluation) on the different components of well-being. Method: A normative sample of 216 adolescents, from both sexes, has answered four instruments that evaluated self-esteem, the emotion regulation capacity, subjective and psychological well-being. Results: Suppression has correlated negatively with all the measures of well-being meanwhile cognitive reavaluation has correlated positively and more strongly with levels of happiness. Self-esteem had showed a strong and positive relation with life satisfaction and a higher predictive value of well-being than emotion regulation strategies. Discussion: Self-esteem has revealed being an important variable in the promotion of adolescent well-being, assuming a primary role in the field of a more positive and preventive clinical practice.

AB Adolescent substance abuse is a serious problem in Hong Kong. Antidrug education campaigns should aim at enhancing students' understanding of the effects of illegal drugs to themselves. Moreover, life skill training is important in helping adolescents face life's challenges without attempting to do drugs. A major component of life skill training is the promotion of emotional competence. The present study outlines the importance of emotional competence and adolescent development. For an antidrug education campaign to be effective, adolescents should be able to identify their emotions and understand their own emotion regulation mechanism. Likewise, they should be made aware of the consequences of their emotions and emotion-driven behaviors. Finally, the use of an inspirational story with a strong message against substance abuse to trigger emotions is recommended for designing an antidrug education curriculum. All these components are integrated in the newly developed curriculum of the P.A.T.H.S. Project in Hong Kong.

AB This paper outlines the design of a new curriculum for positive youth development (P.A.T.H.S. II) in Hong Kong. The paper discusses the conceptual base for designing a drug-education curriculum for junior-secondary students using four positive youth development constructs-cognitive competence, emotional competence, beliefs in the future, and self-efficacy. The program design is premised on the belief that adolescents do have developmental assets; therefore, the curriculum is designed to develop their psychosocial competencies. The goal of the curriculum is to develop the selfhood of these youths and ultimately achieve the goal of successful adolescent development.

AB Social responsibility is a value orientation, rooted in democratic relationships with others and moral principles of care and justice, that motivates certain civic actions. Given its relevance for building stronger relationships and communities, the development of social responsibility within individuals should be a more concerted focus for developmental scholars and youth practitioners. During childhood and adolescence, the developmental roots of individuals' social responsibility lie in the growth of executive function, empathy and emotion regulation, and identity. Efforts to cultivate children and adolescents' social responsibility in the proximal settings of their everyday lives should emphasize modeling prosocial behaviors, communicating concerns for others, and creating opportunities to practice civic skills.

AB Objective. This investigation explored the associations of parenting (Study I) and aspects of the parent-adolescent relationship (Study 2) with adolescent emotion regulation (ER) difficulties, and the potential moderating role of adolescent gender in these associations. Method. Adolescents reported on their mothers' parenting, on negative interactions, and support in their relationship to their mothers, and on ER difficulties. Results. Results show that maternal control (especially psychological control) and the quality of the mother-adolescent relationship is significantly associated with adolescent ER difficulties in expected directions. Links between behavioral control, support and negative interaction, and adolescent ER difficulties were generally stronger for females than for males. Conclusion. It may be concluded that aspects of parenting and the adolescent-mother relationship are salient in the adolescent's experience of emotion regulation difficulties. Studies on ER in social context should account for potential gender effects.

AB Adolescent relationships to peers and friends are regarded as sources of social support and as a context for the development of social and emotional competencies. In the German land Brandenburg a sample of 380 students from 21 classrooms in 7 schools were questioned by questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of grade 7. The schools were organized in a way that students spent either half the day or the whole day in school. Data collection and analysis were based on the social competence model of Rose-Krasnor und Denham (2009). While the emotional competencies were assessed through adolescents' self reports, social competencies were corroborated by classmates' and teachers' reports. While the prosocial orientation and the ability to solve social problems constructively did not change much during seventh grade, significant time effects were noticed in regard to adolescents' social awareness, their self awareness and their self regulation. Students from all-day schools showed a significant increase in their attention to other peoples' feelings, while this ability declined somewhat among students from half-day schools. In addition, physically aggressive behavior decreased among boys form all-day schools (and increased somewhat among boys from half-day schools). Boys from half-day schools were also the only group whose attention to their own feelings did not increase over the course of seventh grade. These results are in line with those of other studies. They are discussed from the perspective of the changing demands of the increasingly globalized world that the adolescents grow up to.

AB Background: The psychosocial development of pediatric HIV patients has not been extensively evaluated. The study objectives were to evaluate whether emotional and social functions are differentially associated with HIV-related complications.
   Methods: A matched case-control study design was conducted. The case group (n = 20) consisted of vertically infected children with HIV (aged 3-18 years) receiving HAART in Greece. Each case was matched with two randomly selected healthy controls from a school-based population. CNS imaging and clinical findings were used to identify patients with HIV-related neuroimaging abnormalities. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale III and Griffiths Mental Abilities Scales were applied to assess cognitive abilities. The age specific Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to evaluate emotional adjustment and social skills. The Fisher's exact test, student's t-test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to compare categorical, continuous, and ordinal scores, respectively, of the above scales between groups.
   Results: HIV patients without neuroimaging abnormalities did not differ from patients with neuroimaging abnormalities with respect to either age at HAART initiation (p = 0.306) or months of HAART treatment (p = 0.964). While HIV patients without neuroimaging abnormalities had similar cognitive development with their healthy peers, patients with neuroimaging abnormalities had lower mean General (p = 0.027) and Practical (p = 0.042) Intelligence Quotient scores. HIV patients without neuroimaging abnormalities had an increased likelihood of both Abnormal Emotional Symptoms (p = 0.047) and Hyperactivity scores (p = 0.0009). In contrast, HIV patients with neuroimaging abnormalities had an increased likelihood of presenting with Abnormal Peer Problems (p = 0.033).
   Conclusions: HIV patients without neuroimaging abnormalities are more likely to experience maladjustment with respect to their emotional and activity spheres, while HIV patients with neuroimaging abnormalities are more likely to present with compromised social skills. Due to the limited sample size and age distribution of the study population, further studies should investigate the psychosocial development of pediatric HIV patients following the disclosure of their condition.

AB Parental anxiety has been linked to child anxiety in various studies. However, specific mechanisms responsible for this relationship in the context of child social anxiety are still largely unknown. A potential mediator between parental and child social anxiety may be parental fear of negative child evaluation (FNCE). To investigate this concept, we collected self-reported data from families with 9- to 16-year old children in a non-clinical sample (458 mother-child dyads and 336 father-child dyads). While both paternal and maternal FNCE predicted child social anxiety, only maternal FNCE mediated the association between maternal and child social anxiety. Maternal report of FNCE was also found to mediate the association between maternal social anxiety and general childhood emotional problems but not externalising problems. Overall, this study is the first to identify a mediator variable that may explain the association between mother and child social anxiety in school-age children. The results shed new light on the mechanisms by which fear and anxiety may be transmitted across generations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The current study investigated spontaneous anger coping, cardiac autonomic regulation and phasic heart rate responses to anger provocation. Forty-five adolescents (27 female, mean age 14.7 years) attended the single experimental session, which included monitoring of continuous heart rate and blood pressure responses to anger provocation (receiving an unfair offer) using a modified version of the Ultimatum Game (UG). Vagal activation was operationalized as high frequency component of heart rate variability during rest periods, and spontaneous baroreflex-sensitivity (SBR) during the UG. Adolescents employing cognitive reappraisal showed higher vagal activity under resting conditions and attenuated heart rate deceleration after receiving the unfair offer compared with participants who tended to ruminate about their anger and experienced injustice. Results from SBR suggested vagal withdrawal in anger ruminators during contemplation of the unfair offer. These results provide further support for the specificity and sensitivity of vagal responses to higher cortical functions such as emotion regulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The current study examined emotion dysregulation as a mechanism underlying risky sexual behavior and sexual revictimization among adult victims of child sexual abuse (CSA) and child physical abuse (CPA).
   Methods: Participants were 752 college women. Victimization history, emotion dysreguladon, and risky sexual behavior were assessed with anonymous, self-report surveys utilizing a cross-sectional design.
   Results: Approximately 6.3% of participants reported CSA, 25.5% reported CPA, and 17.8% reported rape during adolescence or adulthood. CSA and CPA were associated with increased risk for adolescent/adult rape; 29.8% of CSA victims and 24.3% of CPA victims were revictimized. Path analytic models tested hypothesized relationships among child abuse, emotion dysregulation, adolescent/adult rape and three forms of risky sexual behavior (e.g., failure to use condoms, contraception, or having sex with someone under the influence of alcohol/drugs), including frequency of risky sexual behavior with a regular dating partner, with a stranger, and lifetime number of intercourse partners. Emotion dysregulation mediated revictimization for both CSA and CPA. Emotion dysregulation also predicted lifetime number of sexual partners and frequency of risky sex with a stranger, but not frequency of risky sex with a regular dating partner.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that emotion dysregulation is a distal predictor, and risky sex, particularly with lesser known partners, is a proximal predictor of sexual revictimization. Because emotion dysregulation also maintained a significant direct path to revictimization, risky sexual behavior appears to be one of several proximal risk factors for revictimization.
   Practice implications: Findings confirm that emotion dysregulation is a critical pathway to more proximal risk factors such as risky sexual behavior, and suggest that clinical interventions aimed at improving emotion dysregulation may help reduce risky sexual behavior and risk for revictimization.

AB Aim. - This study examined the respective contributions of the demographics, medical variables and alexithymia characteristics of young diabetics to their glycaemic control. The goal was to replicate the role of the 'difficulty describing feelings' factor of alexithymia in the prediction of poor glycaemic control as has been found in adult diabetic populations.
   Method. - The study included 45 type 1 diabetic children, aged 8-12 years (24 girls and 21 boys). Participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and provided medical information on their diabetes. HbA(1c) values (glycated haemoglobin), and the number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes and hospitalizations for hyperglycaemia, were collected for the previous 12 months (3 months for severe hypoglycaemias). Alexithymia characteristics were measured by means of the Alexithymia Questionnaire for children.
   Results. - Hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that both demographic (marital status and parental education; P < 0.05) and medical (duration of diabetes and daily self-monitoring of blood glucose frequency; P < 0.01) variables are associated with HbA(1c) levels. More important, one alexithymia factor (difficulty describing feelings) was found to be an additional predictor over and above the other variables (P < 0.01), explaining an additional 12% of the total variance in HbA(1c) levels.
   Conclusion. - Confirming results already observed in diabetic adults, the present findings show, for the first time, that children who have difficulties in expressing their feelings to others are more at risk of poor glycaemic control. In future, it will be useful to identify the diabetic young people who have such difficulties and to consider interventions designed specifically for them. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB This study draws upon 22,680 children from the 2002 National Survey of America's Families to investigate the demographic and family characteristics and well-being of stepchildren who have been adopted by a stepparent (n = 140) relative to children with 2 biological parents, children with 2 adoptive parents, and children with 1 biological parent and 1 nonadoptive stepparent. Five percent of all stepchildren and one quarter of all adopted children have been adopted by a stepparent. How the characteristics of adopted stepchildren compare to those of other children depends on the child's age-whereas younger adopted stepchildren are most similar to children with 2 biological parents, older adopted stepchildren are most similar to nonadopted stepchildren. Adopted stepchildren of all ages have significantly more behavior and emotional problems than children with 2 biological parents, but have similar levels of school engagement. There were no significant differences between children with 2 adoptive parents, nonadopted stepchildren, and adopted stepchildren on any measure of well-being regardless of the child's age. Implications for practice and policy include increasing awareness of adopted stepchildren and paying greater attention to the legal context under which stepchildren are adopted.

AB We examined the relations between parental interpersonal sensitivity and youth social problems and explored the mediational role of child emotion dysregulation. Mothers (N = 42; M age = 39.38) and fathers (N = 41; M age = 39.38) of youth aged 7-12 (N = 42; M age = 9.12) completed measures of their own interpersonal sensitivity and reported on their child's emotion regulation skills and social functioning. Maternal interpersonal sensitivity was positively associated with child social problems, and this relationship was fully mediated by child emotion dysregulation. A bootstrapping technique provided evidence for the significance of the mediation. For fathers, only the association between child emotion dysregulation and child social problems was significant. Our findings suggest one potential mechanism through which maternal behaviors relate to youth psychosocial functioning. Identification of such mechanisms contributes to the development of conceptual models of youth functioning and suggests specific targets for prevention and intervention efforts.

AB This study examined the association of problem behavior with neurotransmitter deficiency in adolescents, which would provide new insights into behavioral problems. A total of 1259 students of the seventh grade from 4 middle schools in Wuhan city located in the central China were recruited. With the approval of school and parents, they were invited to complete the Youth Self-Report (YSR) questionnaire and Symptom Scale of Neurotransmitter Deficiency (SSND) questionnaire. Pearson's bivariate correlation analysis showed that the correlation coefficients between each subscale of YSR and SSND ranged from 0.24 to 0.61 with all P < 0.01. Canonical correlation analysis indicated that anxiety/depression was interrelated with insufficiency of GABA and 5-HT; aggressive behavior was associated with inadequate GABA; famine of DA influenced the attention problems. It was concluded that neurotransmitter deficiency may cause a series of behavioral and mental problems.

AB The relation between subtypes of maltreatment and dimensions of personality and personality pathology was investigated in a representative sample of 142 incarcerated Dutch male juveniles. Normal personality dimensions were assessed with the Big Five Inventory, the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology Basic Questionnaire for Adolescents was used to measure pathological personality dimensions, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess childhood maltreatment. The five maltreatment subtypes were found to be differentially and uniquely related to the normal and pathological personality dimensions in juvenile delinquents. The association between the abusive subtypes and Emotional Dysregulation depended on the co-occurrence of neglect. It was concluded that subtypes of maltreatment are distinctively related to dimensions of personality and personality pathology, possibly due to specific gene-environment interactions. Further research on this interplay is needed to be able to recognize genetic vulnerability. Early identification of children at risk could aid to limit the long-term consequences of maltreatment.

This approach demands an understanding of the complex interplay of genes, environment, risk, and protective factors that influence the Manifestation of behavior problems. The focus of this article is prevention efforts aimed at processes thought to be involved in the development of mental illnesses. A particular emphasis is on prevention strategies that reduce risk prior to the onset of an identifiable mental disorder. Included are interventions appropriate to nurses who deal with children in schools, pediatric primary care, and specialty mental health care.

AB We explored linkages among different components of emotional competence and bullying and victimization in children enrolled in community after school programs. Seventy-seven children were recruited from after school programs and their display rule knowledge for sadness and anger was evaluated. Their emotion self-regulation skills and bullying experiences were also assessed. Knowledge of display rules for sadness was a negative predictor of physical victimization whereas emotional lability/negativity was positively related to bullying. Boys bullied more than girls and family income was negatively related to bullying and emotional lability/negativity and positively associated with emotion self-regulation. Emotion self-regulation mediated the relation between family income and bullying. Analyses also suggested that bullies and bully-victims had poorer emotion self-regulation skills than non-bullies/victims or victims. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study examined associations between the endorsement of drug use expectancies and the frequency and severity of marijuana use in a community sample of 332 women aged 18-24 years who were not explicitly seeking treatment for their marijuana use. Participants were enrolled in a larger intervention study of motivational interviewing for various health behaviors and provided self-reports of their current and past marijuana use, marijuana abuse/dependence symptoms, and marijuana use expectancies. Marijuana use expectancies were measured using the six subscales of the Marijuana Effects Expectancy Questionnaire (MEEQ). Use frequency was defined as the number of use days in the past month, severity as the total number of DSM-IV marijuana abuse or dependence symptom criteria met. Replicating and extending prior research, expectations regarding Relaxation and Tension Reduction emerged as a robust belief in this cohort, predicting not only frequency (p<.01) but also severity (p<.01) of marijuana use in multivariate analyses. Severity of marijuana use was further predicted by expectations regarding loss of control, affective changes following marijuana use, and other aspects of emotion dysregulation (Global Negative Effects, p<.01). These findings document meaningful associations between substance-related cognitions and use behavior and suggest that marijuana users who hold certain beliefs regarding marijuana use may be particularly susceptible to clinically significant problems associated with their substance use. As such, marijuana use expectancies may represent a clinical target that could be incorporated into future interventions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poor outcomes in parent training programs have been associated with parental psychopathology in general, and difficulties in parental affect regulation in particular. Although many parents may be able to learn behavioral management skills in a controlled therapy setting, for those who experience affect dysregulation, generalization of these skills to the natural environment may be challenging when their emotions are aroused. Parents, particularly those who struggle with affect dysregulation around their child's behavior, may benefit from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) because it specifically targets problems in emotion regulation. Thus, the purpose of this article is to discuss relevant aspects of DBT (e.g., dialectics, biosocial model, and validation) and highlight its applicability to parents who struggle with affect dysregulation. Several clinical case studies will also be presented to elucidate how mental health professionals can address the affect dysregulation in parents by teaching them DBT skills to manage their own negative emotions, particularly when their child's behavior is the source of emotional arousal.

AB This study extends Engels et al.'s model of emotional adjustment to young adults and includes the constructs of interparental conflict and conflict resolution. Results indicate that parental attachment is better conceived as a two-factor construct of mother and father attachment and that although attachment to both mothers and fathers directly predicts emotional adjustment, the mechanisms that mediate these relationships differ. Attachment to fathers was found to be predictive of better social skills, which in turn promoted greater relational competence, and better emotional adjustment. Attachment to mothers was found to be predictive of better conflict resolution behavior, which in turn promoted greater relational competence, and better emotional adjustment. These results are discussed along with recommendations for practice and future research.

AB This study used a three-wave longitudinal design to investigate developmental cascades among social competence and externalizing and internalizing behavioral adjustment in a normative sample of 117 children seen at 4, 10, and 14 years. Children, mothers, and teachers provided data. A series of nested path analysis models was used to determine the most parsimonious and plausible cascades across the three constructs over and above their covariation at each age and stability across age. Children with lower social competence at age 4 years exhibited more externalizing and internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more externalizing behaviors at age 14 years. Children with lower social competence at age 4 years also exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more internalizing behaviors at age 14 years. Children who exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 4 years exhibited more internalizing behaviors at age 10 years and more externalizing behaviors at age 14 years. These cascades among social competence and behavioral adjustment obtained independent of child intelligence and maternal education and social desirability of responding.

AB This study investigated gender differences in the moderating and mediating effects of responses to stress on the association between perceived peer stress and symptoms of psychopathology. A sample of 295 middle school students (63.7% female; M-age, = 12.39 years, SD = 0.99) completed self-report surveys on stress, coping, and behavioral problems. Involuntary responses to stress (e.g., physiological arousal. intrusive thoughts, impulsive action) mediated the association between perceived stress and anxiety/depression and aggression for girls and for boys. Disengagement coping (e.g., denial, avoidance) partially mediated the association between peer stress and anxiety/depression for boys and for girls. In contrast. disengagement coping mediated the association between peer stress and overt aggression for boys only. Finally, engagement coping (e.g., problem solving, emotion regulation, cognitive restructuring) buffered the indirect effect of peer stress on symptoms of psychopathology for girls only. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.

AB Psychiatric hospital treatment (PHT) is expensive and indicates a severe disorder. Investigation of the early identification of this small patient group has though been hindered by small samples or unsatisfactory assessment in childhood. The present study aims to study the predictive association between psychopathology at age 8 using multi-informant assessment and later PHT. A nationwide birth cohort of Finnish children (n = 5,346) was assessed at age 8 to obtain information about psychopathology using the Rutter parent and teacher reports and self-reports of depressive symptoms. The main outcome was admission to any hospital with a primary diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder according to the Finnish National Hospital Discharge Register between age 13 and 24. Between age 13 and 24, 6.2% of the males and 4.1% of the females had been admitted for PHT. Among males, PHT was independently predicted by non-intact family and adult reports of conduct and of emotional symptoms, while among females by self-reported depressive symptoms. However, the combination of conduct and emotional problems was the strongest predictor for PHT in both sexes. Admission due to psychosis among males was associated with childhood conduct, attention, and emotional problems, but with emotional problems among females. Psychopathology at age 8 can be seen as a long-lasting increased risk of severe psychiatric disorders requiring hospital treatment in adolescence or early adulthood. Attention should be paid to self-reports among females and of comorbid conduct and emotional problems in both sexes in the early identification of this patient group.

AB Background.-
   Headaches are common in childhood and significantly impact children's quality of life. On the contrary to the adolescent and adult population, there are few data on the associations between headaches and psychopathology in young children.
   Objective.-
   The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between child headaches, emotional and behavioral difficulties in children aged 6-11 years old.
   Methods.-
   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 in 100 primary schools from a large French region, with 2341 children aged 6-11 years old randomly selected. Child headache status, comorbid physical conditions, and socioeconomic characteristics were collected in parent-administered questionnaires. Child psychopathology outcomes were assessed using child- and parent-reported standardized instruments: respectively, the Dominic Interactive and the Strengths and the Difficulties Questionnaire. Associations were estimated using logistic regression models.
   Results.-
   Response rates to the parent questionnaire and the Dominic Interactive were 57.4% and 95.1%, respectively. The final sample size was 1308 children. Eleven percent of the children already experienced frequent headaches in their lifetime, with no difference by age or gender. Headaches were associated with parent-reported emotional problems (OR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.03-3.01) and self-reported general anxiety disorder (OR = 1.99; 1.13-3.52). Comorbid physical conditions >= 2 appeared as an independent factor significantly associated with headaches (OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.13-2.73). Inversely, low parental punitive behaviors were less frequently associated with headaches (OR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.18-0.94).
   Conclusion.-
   Our results suggest some associations between headaches, emotional disorders, and comorbid physical conditions in young children aged 6-11 years old. Those results should be considered in the treatment approaches of childhood headaches and from the etiological aspect.

AB The current prospective study investigated transactional relations between maternal depressive symptoms and children's depressive and externalizing symptoms. Participants included 240 children (M age = 11.86 years, SD = 0.56; 53.9% female) and their mothers who were part of a 6-year longitudinal study. Measures of maternal depression (Beck Depression Inventory), child depression (Children's Depression Inventory), and children's externalizing symptoms (Youth Self-Report Form) were assessed annually. Data analyses using dynamic latent difference score structural equation models indicated that the observed relations between mothers' and adolescents' symptoms were stable across the 6 years. Higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms predicted subsequent elevations in children's depressive symptoms and in their externalizing problems over time. Among mothers with high initial levels of depression, children's depressive symptoms predicted subsequent declines in mothers' depressive symptoms. Children's externalizing problems were not related to subsequent change in maternal symptoms.

AB The current article explores the connection between maternal depression and offspring aggression during the transition to adulthood, expanding the scope of prior research on this topic. Both family-level factors (including parent child relationship quality and maternal romantic relationship quality) and youth factors (including depression history and social functioning in midadolescence) were tested as potential mediators in a longitudinal community sample of 710 youth at ages 15 and 20. The results suggest that maternal depression confers a risk for higher levels of aggressive behavior by offspring at age 20. Structural equation models suggested that the association between maternal depression and youth aggression is fully mediated by youth history of depression by midadolescence, even when accounting for the stability of aggression between ages 15 and 20. Parent child relationship quality, youth social functioning, and maternal relationship quality were not unique mediators of this association. Limitations and implications are discussed.

AB The objective of the study was to systematically examine patterns of psychiatric comorbidity in referred youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) including autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Consecutively referred children and adolescents to a pediatric psychopharmacology program were assessed with structured diagnostic interview and measures of psychosocial functioning. Comparisons were made between those youth satisfying diagnostic criteria for ASD and age and sex matched youth without ASD referred to the same clinical program. 9.3% (217/2323) of the referred youth (age range: 3-17 years) met DSM-III-R criteria for ASD. ASD youth suffered from significantly higher number of comorbid disorders than comparisons (6.4 +/- 2.7 vs. 5.2 +/- 2.9; p < 0.001). Ninety-five percent of the youth with ASD had three or more comorbid psychiatric disorders and 74% had five or more comorbid disorders. ASD youth were also more functionally impaired and required extra-assistance in school and therapeutic interventions at higher rates than age and sex matched non-ASD referred youth. Youth with ASD have high levels of psychiatric comorbidity and dysfunction comparable to the referred population of youth without ASD. These findings emphasize the heavy burden of psychiatric comorbidity afflicting youth with ASD and may be important targets for intervention.

AB Background: The aim of the study was to test the following: (1) the predictive value of medical variables for long-term parent-reported behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents who underwent invasive treatment of congenital heart disease in infancy and (2) the relationship between parental psychological distress and parental reports on problems in children.
   Methods: The Child Behavior Checklist was used to investigate to what extent behavioral and emotional problems in 7- to 17-year-old children with congenital heart disease can be predicted by the following: (1) medical history, (2) therapeutic intervention and direct postinterventional course, (3) long-term medical course, (4) present contact with physicians, and (5) present medical status. The General Health Questionnaire was used to assess parental distress (especially anxiety).
   Results: Higher Child Behavior Checklist total problems scores were predicted by cardiac medication before therapeutic intervention. Palliative intervention (Rashkind procedure) before therapeutic intervention was associated with more favorable scores on total problems and externalizing. Longterm maternal distress was significantly related to parent-reported problems in children.
   Conclusion: Long-term behavioral and emotional outcomes are only marginally predicted by medical variables. In counseling of children with congenital heart disease and their parents, attention should be paid to long-term maternal distress that has an influence on parent-reported problems in children.

AB Objectives The subgenual prefrontal cortex (SGPFC) is an important brain region involved in emotional regulation and reward mechanisms Volumetric abnormalities in this region have been identified in adults with bipolar disorder but thus far not in pediatric cases We examined the volume of this brain region in subjects with pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) and compared them to healthy controls
   Methods Fifty one children and adolescents (mean age +/- SD 13 2 +/- 2 9 y) with DSM-IV PBD and 41 (mean age +/- SD 13 7 +/- 2 7 y) healthy comparison subjects (HC) underwent 1 5 T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans We traced the SGPFC manually and compared SGPFC gray matter volumes using analysis of covariance with age gender and intracranial volume as covariates We also examined the relationship of family history of affective disorders and medication status to SGPFC volumes
   Results SGPFC volumes were not significantly different in PBD and HC subjects However exploratory analysis showed PBD subjects who had one or more first degree relatives with mood disorders (n = 33) had significantly smaller left hemisphere SGPFC compared to HC (p = 003 Sidak corrected) Current usage of a mood stabilizer was significantly associated with larger right SGPFC volume in PBD (F = 4 82 df = 1/41 p = 0 03)
   Conclusion Subjects with PBD and a close family history of mood disorders may have smaller left SGPFC volumes than HC Mood stabilizing medication may also impact SGPFC size and could have masked more subtle abnormalities overall (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB The purpose of the current investigation was to examine relations among maternal regulatory support, maternal antagonism, and mother-son relationship quality in relation to boys' self-regulation during early adolescence. As part of a larger longitudinal study on 263 low-income, ethnically diverse boys, multiple informants and methods were used to examine associations among parenting practices and mother-son relationship quality in relation to boys' self-regulation at ages 10 and 11. Multivariate analyses indicated that high levels of regulatory supportive parenting and relationship quality and low levels of antagonistic parenting independently predicted high levels of boys' self-regulation at age 10. Only antagonistic parenting and relationship quality explained variance in levels of boys' self-regulation at age 11 after accounting for prior self-regulation. The findings suggest that parenting and the context of the parent-child relationship are linked to self-regulation during early adolescence; however, it appears that parental antagonism and relationship quality, not maternal regulatory supportive parenting, contribute to rank-order change in self-regulation abilities. Implications of these results for research and practice are discussed.

AB Introduction: Negative affect is an important psychological factor in the promotion and maintenance of cigarette smoking, though the underlying factors that account for this relationship remain to be determined. One possible mechanism may be smokers' emotion regulation strategies. Preliminary research among adolescents and young adults suggests that greater utilization of expressive suppression versus cognitive reappraisal is associated with higher rates of smoking initiation. There is limited research, however, on the role of emotion regulation strategies in smoking maintenance in adult smokers.
   Methods: Data from participants in a laboratory study (N = 121) were used to examine whether utilization of cognitive reappraisal and/or expressive suppression were related to smoking characteristics and subjective (i.e., mood, urge to smoke ratings) and behavioral reactions (i.e., Emotional Stroop Task performance, smoking behavior) to a mood induction procedure. Data were evaluated for the full sample and subsample who endorsed current depressive symptoms (n = 46).
   Results: Frequent reappraisal was associated with weaker expectancies that smoking alleviates unpleasant feelings, greater positive mood, and fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast, frequent suppression was related to longer smoking history and greater attentional bias to smoking cues on an Emotional Stroop Task. Among the depressed subsample, reappraisal moderated the effect of mood condition on smoking duration, number of cigarette puffs, and carbon monoxide boost.
   Conclusions: These results provide preliminary support that emotion regulation strategies may be associated with motivational correlates of smoking as well as actual smoking behavior among depressed smokers.

AB This study aimed to examine parent emotion socialisation practices and their association with personality and emotion regulation (ER). Mothers (n = 353) and fathers (n = 206) of children and adolescents (n = 372; 10-18 years) completed measures of the five factor model of personality, ER, responses to child negative emotions, and emotional expressiveness. All five personality factors were related to parenting, with openness and agreeableness being most pertinent to socialisation practices. Although there were some significant associations between parent ER and emotion socialisation. ER explained very little variance in parenting after controlling for personality. The findings provide important insights into individual differences in emotion socialisation practices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose This work aims to prospectively study stress response symptoms (SRS) in adolescents during the first year after a parent's cancer diagnosis and factors associated with SRS. Additionally, SRS in these adolescents were compared to SRS in adolescents whose parents were diagnosed 1-5 years (reference group) previously.
   Methods Forty-nine adolescents, 37 ill parents, and 37 spouses completed questionnaires within 4 months after diagnosis (T1) and six (T2) and 12 months (T3) later.
   Results Clinically elevated SRS were found in 29% of adolescents at T1,16% at T2, and 14% at T3. In contrast, in the reference group, we found 29% clinically elevated SRS. Daughters seemed more at risk than sons. Adolescents' age, patient's gender, and intensity and duration of treatment did not significantly affect SRS. Adolescents with more SRS reported having more emotional/behavioral problems. Parents observed fewer problems in those adolescents. Initial SRS affected later SRS and emotional problems.
   Conclusions The findings illustrate that adolescent children of cancer patients may have clinically elevated SRS that are associated with emotional and behavioral problems. The prevalence of such problems may be underestimated by the parents.

AB Ambulant and outpatient youth welfare: long-term effectiveness Objective: This study concerns the long-term effects of ambulant and outpatient youth provisions. Progress was examined regarding the impact of stress, extensive conduct problems, emotional problems, as well as available resources. In addition, we included data on adolescents' educational status, legal problems, and substance use in the analysis. Method: Using quantitative data from three surveys, we analysed the development in children and adolescents and their families, all of whom were engaged in youth welfare services (N = 59). Results: At the onset of youth welfare services involvement, there were three groups that different significantly regarding the stress impact (low, moderate, high). It was hypothesized that children with low stress impact would benefit most from youth welfare services. Even 3 years after the welfare service had come to an end children and adolescents with a high level of problems at service onset still showed significantly higher impact levels and more familial problems. However, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding behavioral problems. Conclusions: The study indicates the long-term effects of youth welfare services, independent of the initial extent of general impact.

AB The aim of this study was to assess early determinants of attention and hyperactivity problems in adolescents. In 1993, all hospital births in the city of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, were monitored and mothers were interviewed (N = 5,249). At 11 years of age, 4,423 mothers answered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in order to evaluate attention and hyperactivity problems in the adolescents. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated using Poisson regression. Prevalence of attention and hyperactivity problems was 19.9%. Factors associated with the outcome in the adjusted analysis were: male gender, low family income, smoking during pregnancy, minor psychiatric disorders in the mother, and history of child's behavioral/emotional problems at four years of age. Early life events impacted attention and hyperactivity problems in adolescence. Risk factors for attention and hyperactivity problems found in this study were similar to those reported in other cultures.

AB Research has identified a relationship between social-emotional problems and motor impairment in both pre-school and school-age children. The aim of the current study was to determine how motor performance in infancy and early childhood is related to levels of anxious and depressive symptomatology at age 6-12 years. Fifty participants were assessed by their parents 11 times between the ages of 4 months and 4 years using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), and once between the age of 6 and 12 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The ASQ scores were used to obtain the stability (variance) of fine and gross motor performance. Once gestational age, sex and age of testing were taken into account, the stability of gross motor scores predicted both the anxiety/depression measure and the anxious score from the CBCL. It appears that how variable a young child's gross motor development is from 4 months to 4 years predicts the level of anxious/depressive symptoms at school age.

AB Self-injury without conscious suicidal intent is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon particularly among adolescent populations. This pilot study examined the extent and correlates of self-injurious behaviour in a school population sample of 393 adolescents (aged 13-18 years) using a self-report questionnaire. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether personality was related to self-injury and whether this relationship was moderated by emotion regulation or coping strategies. Few personality and coping variables were directly related to self-injury after controlling for age and psychopathology. However the relationship between personality and self-injury was moderated by coping skills and emotion regulation. We suggest future research explore these relationships in order to determine the role of coping skills and emotional regulation training in prevention of self-injury.

AB The relationship between negative affectivity (NA) and emotion regulation (ER) in determining anxiety and depressive symptomatology was examined in a large (n = 1441) sample of adolescents (12-17 years old). Two models, diverging only as to inclusion or exclusion of a path from NA to negative ER, were analyzed through structural equation modeling: the goal was to explore the mediational or non-mediational role of ER in determining anxiety symptoms. The models yielded similar adequate fit to data, indicating that both NA and negative ER contribute to anxiety symptoms which, in turn, significantly determine depressive symptomatology. The mediational model better captures the relationships revealed in the data, with NA determining negative ER to a great extent Additionally, most individuals scoring highly in NA also tend to score highly in negative ER, indicating that adolescents with heightened NA are prone to a dysfunctional style of ER.

AB We conducted a pilot study of the initial development of a self-report measure assessing how adolescents react when parents respond in a helpful manner to their sad emotional experiences. Participants were late adolescents (ages 18-20) attending a large, racially diverse urban university (N = 86; 75% women; 46% racial/ethnic minority). A broad range of relationship-oriented literatures (e.g., early childhood and marital) were considered in creating items for the Adolescent Reactions to Parents (ARP) scale. A 3 factor solution (Accepting, Avoidant, and Attacking) appeared to provide the most parsimonious fit to the data. Adequate levels of reliability were observed for each of the three ARP subscales. Zero-order correlations among subscales of the ARP were moderate in strength. Findings indicated that participants who reported more avoidant and attacking reactions also reported more adjustment difficulties including emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression. Results suggest that the ARP scale has the potential to be a valuable tool for advancing knowledge related to the socialization of emotions.

AB The current study aimed to investigate emotion regulation (ER) strategy use in a sample of 21 clinic-referred children and adolescents (10-14 years old) presenting with school refusal, all of whom were diagnosed with at least one anxiety disorder. Being the first known study to examine ER and school refusal, hypotheses were guided by previous research on anxiety. It was hypothesized that the school refusal sample would report less healthy ER strategy use compared to an age-and sex-matched nonclinical sample (n = 21). As expected, the school refusal sample reported less use of cognitive reappraisal and greater use of expressive suppression to regulate their emotions than did the nonclinical sample. Although preliminary, the findings provide important information regarding the emotional functioning of children and adolescents presenting with school refusal. Future directions for research and implications for improved prevention and intervention programs are discussed.

AB Emotionality and emotion regulation are presumed to interact to produce social behavior. Prior empirical evidence for this interaction has been weak. Researchers have tended to take a variable-centered approach to predicting social behavior and this may have obscured the relations between negative emotionality, emotion regulation, and social behavior. Therefore, a person-centered approach was used to examine the links among these variables. Two-hundred and three adolescents (M age = 13.3 years) completed measures of negative emotionality, emotion regulation, and socioemotional behavior. Cluster analysis suggested four profiles of adolescents: those moderate on regulation and negative emotionality, those low in both, those high in negative emotionality and low in regulation, those low in negative emotionality and high in regulation. LDF analysis suggested that these profiles of adolescents differed along two dimensions on socioemotional behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

All children had experienced at fast 1 war-related event and 78% were additionally exposed to at least 1 incident of domestic violence. Prevalences of posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder were 33%, and 36%, respectively. Behavioral and emotional problems above clinical cutoff were measured in 61%. No gender differences were found regarding mental health outcomes. War experience and domestic violence were significantly associated with all mental health outcomes. The authors' findings point to the detrimental effects of domestic violence in addition to traumatizing war experiences in child soldiers.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the protective processes for depressed mood and anger among sexually abused adolescents. A cross-sectional anonymous self-report national survey was conducted including 9113 16-19-year-old students attending all upper secondary schools in Iceland in 2004. Correlations and multiple linear regression models were carried out to test for main, interaction and mediating effects. The results showed that parental support, positive attitudes towards school and sport participation negatively predicted depressed mood and anger (main effects). Self-esteem however, turned out to be a stronger negative predictor of depressed mood and anger for sexually abused adolescents than for non-abused adolescents (interaction effect). Finally, self-esteem mediated the effects of parental support, attitudes towards school and sport participation on depressed mood and anger. These results underscore the specific importance of self-esteem when predicting depressed mood and anger among sexually abused adolescents. They also indicate that parental support, attitudes towards school and sport participation are important predictors of these emotional problems, both directly and indirectly through their effects on self-esteem.

AB Background. There is growing evidence on the importance of experiences of stressful events in the development of psychopathology. This study aimed to investigate the role of stressful events in the continuity of internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as the cross-influence of these problems from early childhood to late adolescence.
   Method. Data came from a general population sample of 396 children followed from the ages of 3 to 18 years. Parent-ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 3, 5, 10 and 18 years were used. Parents also reported on the presence of stressful events between the ages of 3 and 5 years, and 5 and 10 years. Adolescent reports on stressful events over the ages of 10-18 years were used. Structural equation models were used to disentangle/analyse the role of stressful events in the development of internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results. From the age of 3 years onwards externalizing symptoms predicted experiences of stressful events. In turn, these experiences predicted later externalizing problems. Stressful events also explained part of the continuity of internalizing problems from the age of 10 years onwards, but not during childhood. From childhood onwards, cross-influences from externalizing problems to subsequent internalizing problems were found to run through stressful events. Only in adolescence cross-influences from internalizing problems to externalizing problems were found, again via stressful events.
   Conclusions. From childhood onwards to late adolescence, stressful events play a significant role in both the continuity and the co-occurrence of externalizing and internalizing problems. Theoretical and methodological implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Data from the New Canadian Children and Youth Study (NCCYS), a national study of immigrant children and youth in Canada, are used to examine the mental health salience of putatively universal determinants, as well as of immigration-specific factors. Universal factors (UF) include age, gender, family and neighbourhood characteristics. Migration-specific (MS) factors include ethnic background, acculturative stress, prejudice, and the impact of region of resettlement within Canada.
   In a sample of children from Hong Kong, the Philippines and Mainland China, the study examined the determinants of emotional problems (EP), and physical aggression (PA). A two-step regression analysis entered UF on step 1, and MS variables on step 2.
   Universal factors accounted for 12.1% of EP variance. Addition of MS variables increased explained variance to 15.6%. Significant UF predictors: parental depression, family dysfunction, and parent's education. Significant MS variables: country of origin, region of resettlement, resettlement stress, prejudice, and limited linguistic fluency. UF accounted for 6.3% of variance in PA scores. Adding migration-specific variables increased variance explained to 9.1%. UF: age, gender, parent's depression, family dysfunction. MS: country of origin, region of resettlement, resettlement stress, and parent's perception of prejudice.
   Net of the effect of factors affecting the mental health of most, if not all children, migration-specific variables contribute to understanding immigrant children's mental health.

AB This article reports on the addition of the coping subscale, media use" to the questionnaire for the measurement of coping in children and adolescents (SSKJ 3-8, Lohaus, Eschenbeck, Kohlmann & Klein-Healing, 2006). The results were based on a study with a total of 1,086 pupils (50% girls) attending class levels 2 to 8. Coping was assessed with the subscales seeking social support, problem-solving, avoidant coping, palliative emotion regulation, anger-related emotion regulation, and media use. The postulated 6-factor structure was confirmed in exploratory factor analyses and confirmatory factor analyses. Associations with age, extent of media use, and stress symptoms indicated the validity of the newly developed coping scale, media use.

   REQUIREMENTS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PART 2; SYMPTOMS; ADHD
AB Background: Polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential nutrients for humans. They are structural and functional components of cell membranes and pre-stages of the hormonally and immunologically active eicosanoids. Recent discoveries have shown that the long-chained omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) also play an important role in the central nervous system. They are essential for normal brain functioning including attention and other neuropsychological skills.
   Materials and methods: In our large observational study we monitored 810 children from 5 to 12 years of age referred for medical help and recommended for consuming polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in combination with zinc and magnesium by a physician over a period of at least 3 months. The food supplement ESPRICO (R) (further on referred to as the food supplement) is developed on the basis of current nutritional science and containing a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids as well as magnesium and zinc. Study objective was to evaluate the nutritional effects of the PUFA-zinc-magnesium combination on symptoms of attention deficit, impulsivity, and hyperactivity as well as on emotional problems and sleep related parameters. Assessment was performed by internationally standardised evaluation scales, i.e. SNAP-IV and SDQ. Tolerance (adverse events) and acceptance (compliance) of the dietary therapy were documented.
   Results: After 12 weeks of consumption of a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids as well as magnesium and zinc most subjects showed a considerable reduction in symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity/impulsivity assessed by SNAP-IV. Further, the assessment by SDQ revealed fewer emotional problems at the end of the study period compared to baseline and also sleeping disorders. Mainly problems to fall asleep, decreased during the 12 week nutritional therapy. Regarding safety, no serious adverse events occurred. A total of 16 adverse events with a possible causal relationship to the study medication were reported by 14 children (1.7%) and only 5.2% of the children discontinued the study due to acceptance problems. Continuation of consumption of the food supplement was recommended by the paediatricians for 61.1% of the children.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest a beneficial effect of a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids as well as magnesium and zinc consumption on attentional, behavioural, and emotional problems of children and adolescents. Thus, considering the behavioural benefit in combination with the low risk due to a good safety profile, the dietary supplementation with PUFA in combination with zinc and magnesium can be recommended.

DT Article

   COMMUNITY; STRENGTHS; BEHAVIOR; SENSE
AB Background. Connectedness to school is a significant predictor of adolescent health and academic outcomes. While individual predictors of connectedness have been well-described, little is known about school-level factors which may influence connectedness. A school's ecology, or its structural, functional, and built aspects, coupled with interpersonal interactions, may also help to enhance adolescent connectedness.
   Aim. This study aims to identify school ecological characteristics which predict enhanced connectedness in secondary school.
   Sample. Data from 5,159 Grade 8 students (12-13 years) from 39 randomly selected schools were tracked until the end of Grade 9 (13-14 years).
   Method. Students' self-reported school, teacher, and family connectedness, mental health and peer relationships were measured at two time points. Accounting for school-level clustering, student-and school-level ecological characteristics were modelled on self-reported school connectedness in Grades 8 and 9.
   Results. Students' higher school connectedness in Grades 8 and 9 was influenced by greater levels of family connectedness, fewer classroom and peer problems, less difficult secondary school transition, fewer emotional problems, and greater prosocial skills. Seven school-level ecological variables were significantly associated with school connectedness after controlling for student-level predictors. At the school-level, priority for pastoral care and students' aggregated writing skills scores significantly predicted concurrent and future enhanced connectedness.
   Conclusions. Interventions to improve students' school connectedness should address individual student characteristics and school functional features such as pastoral care strategies and helping students to achieve greater academic outcomes. Future studies should focus on the cumulative longitudinal influence of school ecological and student-level predictors of school connectedness.

AB The objective of the study is to investigate the prevalence, distribution and predictors of mental health problems in 5-7-year-old Danish children in the general population. This study is a 5-7-year follow-up study of a birth cohort of 6,090 children, the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000. The extended version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was answered by parents and pre-school teachers. Data from Danish national registers included perinatal data, socioeconomic data and data on child mental illness diagnosed at hospital in preschool age. Register data from the first year of life was obtained from 99.7% of the children in the cohort. Of 5,898 eligible children, 3,501 participated in the SDQ assessment (59%). The overall estimated 6-month prevalence of mental health problems was 4.8% (95% CI 4.1-5.6). Conduct problems were found in 3.0% (95% CI 2.4-3.6), problems of hyperactivity/inattention in 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.0) and emotional problems in 1.5% (95% CI 1.1-1.9). Boys showed a higher risk of having mental health problems as compared to girls: risk ratio 2.0 (95% CI 1.5-2.8). Several markers of socioeconomic disadvantages were associated with mental health problems at 5-7 years of age. In conclusion, the 6-month prevalence of SDQ-measured mental health problems was relatively low in Danish children when compared with findings from several European countries, but was in line with findings from other studies in Nordic countries. The lower prevalence might reflect differences in psychosocial risk load and environmental stress given the social and cultural context.

AB Objective: This prospective study examined whether psychological variables related to the transdiagnostic theory of eating disorders measured at admission predicted length of time to reach 85 per cent of ideal body weight (IBW) among underweight adolescents hospitalized for an eating disorder.
   Method: Thirty-three girls (aged 12-17) weighing below 85 per cent of IBW, admitted to an inpatient and/or partial hospitalization eating disorder programme completed self-report measures at admission. Cox regression tested whether scores on admission measures predicted time to reach 85 per cent of IBW.
   Results: After controlling for IBW at admission, higher self-esteem and lower perfectionism predicted shorter time to reach 85 per cent of IBW, with emotion regulation as a marginally significant predictor.
   Conclusion: Self-esteem and perfectionism may be predictors of responsiveness to weight-gain efforts during hospitalization. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these variables might be appropriate targets for intervention to promote weight gain in underweight girls with eating disorders.

AB The promotion of socio-emotional skills in educational contexts is highly beneficial to individuals' global adjustment and development. Evaluation research suggests that interventions for the promotion of socio-emotional skills are effective. However, most of this work has been carried out in the USA and there is now a pressing need to evaluate interventions at the cross-cultural level. This 4-year study evaluated the effectiveness of a teacher manual-based intervention for the promotion of social and emotional skills in Portuguese elementary school children. Using a quasi-experimental design, teachers taught manual-based strategies to children in the experimental group, focusing on specific social and emotional skills. These strategies were integrated as part of the curricular activities. Results showed statistically significant differences between the experimental group and the control group on the evaluated outcomes (self-control, emotional differentiation, emotional regulation, social skills, and self-esteem). For each of the dimensions studied, effect sizes were large (above 0.80). Findings are similar to those reported by international research evaluating the effectiveness of programmes for the promotion of social and emotional skills in school-age children. This study is an important contribution in the establishment of evidence-based socio-emotional skills programmes at the cross-cultural level.

AB Introduction This study examined the longitudinal association between adolescent psychological problems following cancer treatment and obesity, limited exercise, smoking, and excess sun exposure during adulthood in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort.
   Methods Participants included 1,652 adolescent survivors of childhood cancer and 406 siblings of cancer survivors, initially evaluated at 12-17 years of age and >= 5 years post-diagnosis. A follow-up survey of these participants was conducted roughly 7 years later and included assessment of health status and health behaviors. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between adolescent psychological problems and adult health behavior outcomes.
   Results During adolescence, survivors demonstrated higher rates of attention deficits, emotional problems, externalizing behavior and social withdrawal compared to sibling controls. Social withdrawal was associated with adult obesity (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.1-2.1) and physical inactivity (OR=1.7, 1.1-2.5). Use of stimulant medication during adolescence was also associated with adult obesity (OR=1.9, 1.1-3.2), while antidepressant use was associated with physical inactivity (OR=3.2, 1.2-8.2).
   Discussion/Conclusions Adolescent survivors of childhood cancer display higher rates of psychological problems compared to siblings of cancer survivors. These psychological problems are associated with an increased risk for obesity and poor heath behavior in adulthood, which may increase future risk for chronic health conditions and secondary neoplasms.
   Implications In order to decrease risk of future health problems, adolescent survivors of childhood cancer should be routinely screened and treated for psychological problems following cancer therapy.

AB There is increased recognition of the importance of children learning how to regulate emotions in a functional and adaptive manner for healthy psychological development. However, there is a paucity of tools for assessing emotion regulation during the middle childhood and adolescent years. This study reports on the psychometric evaluation of the 16-item self-report Emotion Regulation Index for Children and Adolescents (ERICA) involving a sample of 1,389 (768 girls, 621 boys) Australian children and adolescents aged 9 to 16 years. Convergent validity for the ERICA is reported with measures of self-conscious emotions (shame, guilt), empathy, childhood depressive symptomatology, and the perceived parenting dimensions of Care and Overprotection. Construct validity assessment using Principal Components Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis yielded three factors: (1) Emotional Control, (2) Emotional Self-Awareness, and (3) Situational Responsiveness. The ERICA was also found to have good internal consistency and to be relatively stable over a four week test-retest period and to be sensitive to age and sex differences. It is concluded that the ERICA is a psychometrically sound measure for the assessment of the identified key aspects of emotion regulation in children and adolescents.

AB T he extent to which students feel connected to their school is a powerful predictor of many health, social and academic outcomes. These outcomes are also influenced by other factors including characteristics of the school such as its size, policies and practices, but how do these characteristics modify the relationship between a student and his or her later school connectedness? This article draws on Western Australian data describing 5159 students from 39 schools who were tracked for the first two years of their secondary schooling. Controlling for interpersonal predictors of adolescent connectedness, the extent to which school characteristics, represented by school sector, modified later school connectedness was assessed using random intercept multi-level models. Significant interactions between school and individual student characteristics of interpersonal relationships as well as mental health were found for later school connectedness, suggesting the sector to which a school belongs influences a student's sense of connectedness to school.

AB A large body of research suggests that common and specific psychopathology dimensions underlie the symptoms that occur within mood and anxiety disorders. As of yet, it is unclear precisely how the facets of Anxiety Sensitivity (AS), or fear of the symptoms of fear and anxiety, relate to these latent factors. Using data from 606 adolescents participating in the baseline phase of a longitudinal study on risk factors for emotional disorders, we modeled the facets of AS as measured by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Expanded Form (ASI-X) and related these facets to a hierarchical model of latent symptoms of psychological distress. Results suggest that one facet of AS is associated with a broad General Distress factor underlying symptoms of most emotional disorders while others relate to intermediate-level and conceptually-meaningful narrow factors representing aspects of psychological distress specific to particular emotional disorders.

AB Objective
   To examine the association of fetal alcohol exposure during pregnancy with child and adolescent behavioural development.
   Design
   The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study recruited 2900 pregnancies (1989-91) and the 14-year follow up was conducted between 2003 and 2006.
   Setting
   Tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth, Western Australia.
   Population
   The women in the study provided data at 18 and 34 weeks of gestation on weekly alcohol intake: no drinking, occasional drinking (up to one standard drink per week), light drinking (2-6 standard drinks per week), moderate drinking (7-10 standard drinks per week), and heavy drinking (11 or more standard drinks per week).
   Methods
   Longitudinal regression models were used to analyse the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scores over 14 years, assessed by continuous z-scores and clinical cutoff points, after adjusting for confounders.
   Main outcome measure
   Their children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, 10 and 14 years. The CBCL was used to measure child behaviour.
   Results
   Light drinking and moderate drinking in the first 3 months of pregnancy were associated with child CBCL z-scores indicative of positive behaviour over 14 years after adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic characteristics. These changes in z-score indicated a clinically meaningful reduction in total, internalising and externalising behavioural problems across the 14 years of follow up.
   Conclusions
   Our findings do not implicate light-moderate consumption of alcohol in pregnancy as a risk factor in the epidemiology of child behavioural problems.

AB OBJECTIVE To identify models of health care delivery that support youth access to health and mental health care.
   DATA SOURCES Information was obtained from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and Sociological Abstracts (CSA Illumina).
   STUDY SELECTION Studies reviewed in this article provided level I, II, or III evidence.
   SYNTHESIS Youth access health care, with the support of parents and family, through families' existing health care providers or family physicians. Youth might be reluctant to involve parents or to consult family physicians for health concerns related to substance use, emotional problems, or reproductive concerns. Primary health care service models need to support youth access to care and ensure that youth feel comfortable seeking care for all of their health concerns. School-based and community-based health care centres might be better positioned to meet the needs of youth than traditional office-based practices are.
   CONCLUSION There is a growing body of evidence on health service models that support effective and accessible delivery of health and mental health services for youth. The health needs and challenges of youth are often predictable. Available evidence highlights the importance of including youth experience and voices in planning, delivery, and evaluation of services.

AB Although conflict is a frequent and dynamic interpersonal process in children's sibling relationships, ambivalence (i.e., combinations of, or shifts between, positive and negative behaviors and affects) may better characterize normative sibling interactions. Nonetheless, there is a general assumption that reducing conflict is the most effective mechanism for improving sibling relationships. This review argues that the focus on conflict as the predominant attribute of sibling relationships is misplaced and has served to overshadow research on other relationship processes; it has also handicapped the development of effective prevention and intervention tools. Strategies are presented for moving theory, research, and practice toward the identification and development of factors and social processes that promote prosocial forms of sibling engagement and manage conflict. Innovative strategies are needed on two fronts: to help young siblings set their relationship on a positive trajectory and to help them avoid or remediate conflictual interactions.

AB Maltreated children frequently experience academic difficulties. In the past, this has been attributed to placement instability, length of involvement with the child welfare system, and numerous other factors that disproportionately affect maltreated children. Maltreated children are also prone to emotion regulation (ER) difficulties and patterns of emotion dysregulation. Resilience (i.e., normative functioning despite having experienced maltreatment) among maltreated children is rare, particularly across multiple domains. ER has been found to predict academic performance in non-maltreated samples. In this study, the relationship between emotion dysregulation and academic performance was analyzed in a sample already at risk for academic difficulties (maltreated children). Measures of emotion dysregulation and academic performance were analyzed in a sample of maltreated children (n = 158). Linear regression analysis indicated that the absence of emotion dysregulation was significantly related to academic resilience. Late adolescence, race, and placement stability were also significantly related to academic resilience. Implications for child welfare professionals and educators of maltreated children are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to: (1) examine symptom levels of anxiety and depression in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFASDs) compared with matched control children using child self-reports and parent ratings; and (2) examine source differences within the two condition groups. An overall multivariate effect indicated significantly elevated depression and anxiety symptoms for children with HFASDs based on parent reports; however no significant between-group differences based on child self-reports. Within-condition source comparisons (parent vs. child) revealed a significant multivariate effect indicating a significant difference in symptoms of depression and anxiety for the HFASD group but none for the control. Correlations between parent and child reports for the HFASD group suggested some positive association between child-reports and parent-reports for depressive symptoms only; however, the difference in average scores reflected a substantial discrepancy in the magnitude of symptoms by rater. Implications for clinical assessment and future research are provided.

AB Objective: The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence, associated co-morbid psychiatric disorders and behavioral/emotional problems associated with the subtypes of specific phobia in children and adolescents.
   Methods: A total of 2673 randomly selected children and adolescents from Seoul. Korea were assessed using the parent version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) and Children's Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We analyzed differences in psychiatric co-morbidities and CBCL profiles among the subtypes of specific phobia.
   Results: The 1-year prevalence of specific phobia was 7.9% (95% CI 7.63-8.17). Animal phobia was associated with anxiety disorder (OR 8.68, 95% CI 1.91-39.51) and oppositional defiant disorder (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.27-5.12). Nature-environment phobia was associated with anxiety disorder (OR 25.70, 95% CI 6.16-107.10). Blood-injection-injury phobia showed associations with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD: OR 6.74, 95% CI 2.81-16.15). Subjects with nature-environment phobia scored higher than did controls on the anxious/depressed, social problems, attention problems, and total behavioral problem profiles of the CBCL. Subjects with blood-injection-injury phobia scored significantly higher than did controls on the attention problems, aggressive behaviors, and externalizing problem profiles.
   Conclusions: Contrary to animal phobias, nature-environment and blood-injection-injury phobias were associated with various behavioral and emotional problems and approximately correlated to their comorbid psychiatric disorders. Among these subtypes, significant differences were found in demographic characteristics, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, and emotional/behavioral problems. These findings suggest that distinctive clinical characteristics might be related with different subtypes of specific phobia and clinician must consider psychiatric co-morbidities when treating children & adolescents with specific phobia.

AB Evidence-based practices to improve outcomes for children with severe behavioral and emotional problems have received a great deal of attention in children's mental health. Therapeutic foster care (TFC), a residential intervention for youth with emotional or behavioral problems, is one of the few community-based programs that is considered to be evidence-based. However, as for most treatment approaches, the vast majority of existing programs do not deliver the evidence-based version. In an attempt to fill this gap and improve practice across a wide range of TFC agencies, we developed an enhanced model of TFC based on input from both practice and research. It includes elements associated with improved outcomes for youth in "usual care" TFC agencies as well as key elements from Chamberlain's evidence-based model. The current manuscript describes this "hybrid" intervention-Together Facing the Challenge-and discusses key issues in implementation. We describe the sample and settings, highlight key implementation strategies, and provide "lessons learned" to help guide others who may wish to change practice in existing agencies.

AB Background:
   Evidence about trends in adolescent emotional problems (depression and anxiety) is inconclusive, because few studies have used comparable measures and samples at different points in time. We compared rates of adolescent emotional problems in two nationally representative English samples of youth 20 years apart using identical symptom screens in each survey.
   Methods:
   Nationally representative community samples of 16-17-year-olds living in England in 1986 and 2006 were compared. In 1986, 4524 adolescents and 7120 parents of young people participated in the age-16-year follow-up of the 1970 British Cohort Study. In 2006, 719 adolescents and 734 parents participated in a follow-up of children sampled from the 2002/2003 Health Surveys for England. Adolescents completed the Malaise Inventory and 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Parents completed the Rutter-A scale. Individual symptoms of depression and anxiety were coded combining across relevant questionnaire items. Young people also reported frequency of feeling anxious or depressed.
   Results:
   Youth- and parent-reported emotional problems were more prevalent in 2006 for girls, and rates of parent-reported problems increased for boys. Twice as many young people reported frequent feelings of depression or anxiety in 2006 as in 1986. Some symptoms showed marked change in prevalence over time (e.g., worry, irritability, fatigue), whereas others showed no change (e.g., loss of enjoyment, worthlessness). There was no evidence of differential trends in emotional problems for young people from socially advantaged and disadvantaged or intact and non-intact families. Changes in family structure and ethnic composition did not account for trends in youth emotional problems.
   Conclusions:
   The study provides evidence for a substantial increase in adolescent emotional problems in England over recent decades, especially among girls.

AB Background:
   The goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence, severity and clinical correlates of emotional lability (EL) in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to examine factors contributing to EL and familiality of EL in youth with ADHD.
   Methods:
   One thousand, one hundred and eighty-six children with ADHD combined type and 1827 siblings (aged 6-18 years) were assessed for symptoms of EL, ADHD, associated psychopathology and comorbid psychiatric disorders with a structured diagnostic interview (PACS) as well as parent and teacher ratings of psychopathology (SDQ; CPRS-R:L; CTRS-R:L). Analyses of variance, regression analyses, chi 2-tests or loglinear models were applied.
   Results:
   Mean age and gender-standardized ratings of EL in children with ADHD were > 1.5 SD above the mean in normative samples. Severe EL (> 75th percentile) was associated with more severe ADHD core symptoms, primarily hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, and more comorbid oppositional defiant, affective and substance use disorders. Age, hyperactive-impulsive, oppositional, and emotional symptoms accounted for 30% of EL variance; hyperactive-impulsive symptoms did not account for EL variance when coexisting oppositional and emotional problems were taken into account, but oppositional symptoms explained 12% of EL variance specifically. Severity of EL in probands increased the severity of EL in siblings, but not the prevalence rates of ADHD or ODD. EL and ADHD does not co-segregate within families.
   Conclusion:
   EL is a frequent clinical problem in children with ADHD. It is associated with increased severity of ADHD core symptoms, particularly hyperactivity-impulsivity, and more symptoms of comorbid psychopathology, primarily symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), but also affective symptoms, and substance abuse. EL in ADHD seems to be more closely related to ODD than to ADHD core symptoms, and is only partly explainable by the severity of ADHD core symptoms and associated psychopathology. Although EL symptoms are transmitted within families, EL in children with ADHD does not increase the risk of ADHD and ODD in their siblings.

AB Background. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed in a cohort of long-term childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. Procedure. Rand-36-Item health Survey (RAND-36) was used to assess subjective HRQoL in 74 survivors of ALL an average of 20 years after the diagnosis. Cranial irradiation had been administered to 46 of the survivors, while 28 survivors had solely been treated with chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 146 healthy young adults selected from local population registry. Survivors were examined by a physician and late effects were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv3). Results. ALL survivors achieved significantly higher scores than the controls on three of the eight FIRQoL subscales; role limitations due to emotional problems (P = 0.030), mental health (P=0.030) and vitality (P=0.004). In comparison to controls, survivors with a follow-up of more than 20 years had significantly higher scores on vitality (P = 0.006) and mental health (P = 0.011). Survivors with severe (grade 3 and 4) late effects scored significantly better than controls on vitality (P = 0.043) and mental health (P = 0.040). Patients who had been treated for an ALL relapse and had received the most intensive chemo- and radiotherapy had significantly higher scores on mental health (P = 0.004) and vitality (P = 0.004) than the controls. Conclusions. Long-term survivors of childhood ALL reported equal or better HRQoL in RAND-36. Higher HRQoL scores were associated with more severe late effects and intensive therapy.

AB Objective: To investigate the use and content of web-based peer support in children coping with parental cancer.
   Methods: In children aged above 12 years, 158 forum discussions on the Dutch website www.kankerspoken.nl in a time-period of 3 months were investigated. Age, gender, number of discussions, participation and main activities on the website were quantitatively assessed. Contents of the discussions were qualitatively analyzed.
   Results: In total, 129 children and 8 adults participated on the website with an average age of 15.3 years. The majority was female (80%). On average, a child was on-line for 3 days and participated in 4 to 5 forum discussions. Main activities on the website were sharing personal experience, providing encouragement/support, providing and seeking information or advice and seeking contact outside of the website. Qualitative content analysis revealed that children regularly faced emotional problems and experienced a lack of understanding and communication in their direct environment.
   Conclusions: In dealing with parental cancer, children experience a variety of difficulties. This study offers a window into the use of web-based peer support by children dealing with parental cancer. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The objective of the current study was to develop a Chinese version of the Responses to Stress Questionnaire (RSQ-C) and to evaluate its reliability and validity. The original version of the RSQ was back-translated into Chinese and administered to a sample of students recruited from two middle schools in Hunan, China. The final sample consisted of 1068 adolescents (49.9% males and 50.1% females). Participants' ages ranged from 14 to 20 (M = 16.47 years, standard deviation = 1.02). The RSQ-C exhibited moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha was 0.87), and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients was 0.82 over a 1-month interval). Results of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the fit of a three-factor model of voluntary coping and a separate two-factor model of involuntary coping. With regard to predictive validity, the results of multiple regression analyses suggest that the high levels of Disengagement Coping and low levels of Primary Control Engagement Coping were significant predictors of depressive symptomology. Additionally, high levels of Involuntary Engagement and low levels of Primary Control Engagement Coping predicted higher levels of social anxiety symptoms. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background. Chronic constipations present an important problem in children. They cause a significant distress and decrease the quality of life of patients and their families.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to assess the major clinical and demographic parameters influencing the manifestation of functional constipations in children.
   Material and Methods. A total of 126 children (67 boys and 59 girls) suffering from functional constipations were included into the study. A specially designed questionnaire containing demographic and clinical data was completed based on anamnesis and physical examinations. All subjects were divided into subgroups according to their age, gender, age at disease onset, disease duration, family history of chronic constipations, coexistence of allergic disorders, coexistence of urinary tract infection, presence of emotional problems, the previous treatment, and Body Mass Index (BMI).
   Results. The most frequently observed symptoms of functional constipations were abdominal pain (60.3% of children), followed by rectal tenesmus (58.7%) and pain during defecation (52.4%). Analysis of various clinical parameters revealed that patients' age, gender, age at disease onset, disease duration, positive family history of constipation, food allergy and urinary tract infection may have an influence on the clinical presentation of functional constipations in children.
   Conclusions. Clinical manifestation of functional constipations in children may significantly vary between patients. While studying the symptoms of chronic constipations in children it is of great importance to identify parameters that influence the clinical presentation of this disorder (Adv Clin Exp Med 2010, 19, 4, 519-530).
