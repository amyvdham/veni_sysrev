AB The current work aims to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Brief form of the Young Schema Questionnaire for Adolescents (B-YSQ-A), so that Early Maladaptive Schemas can be accurately measured in younger populations. Early Maladaptive Schemas are self-defeating core themes underlying maladaptive cognition, affect, and behavior. A community sample of 877 adolescents, aged 12-18 years old, filled out self-report instruments on maladaptive schemas, anger management, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The items composing the B-YSQ-A were selected based on statistical and content analyses criteria. Its internal structure, reliability, age- and gender-based invariance, and between-gender mean differences were examined, as well as its relationship with external variables. Results indicated a satisfying fit for the 18 original schema factors through confirmatory factor analysis. These schemas also showed adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, with the exception of the entitlement/grandiosity and self-sacrifice schemas. The B-YSQ-A was found to be age and gender invariant. Concerning gender differences, boys scored higher on the entitlement/grandiosity, insufficient self-control/discipline, approval/recognition seeking, unrelenting standards/hyper-criticalness and punitiveness schemas, whereas girls scored higher on the abandonment/instability, mistrust/abuse, and self-sacrifice schemas. Furthermore, evidence was found for construct validity in relation to measures of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and of anger expression. Findings offer support for the use of the B-YSQ-A with adolescents, both for research and intervention purposes.

AB International adoptees are at an increased risk of emotional and behavioral problems, especially those who are adopted at an older age. We took a new approach in our study of the network structure and predictability of emotional and behavioral problems in internationally adopted children in Finland. Our sample was from the on-going adoption study and comprised 778 internationally adopted children (387 boys and 391 girls, mean age 10.5 (SD 3.4) years). Networks were estimated using Gaussian graphical models and lasso regularization for all the children, and separately for those who were adopted at different ages. The results showed that anxiety/depressive symptoms, social problems, and aggressiveness were the most central symptom domains. Somatic symptoms were the least central and had the weakest effect on the other domains. Similarly, aggressiveness, social problems, and attention problems were high in terms of predictability (73-65%), whereas internalizing problems were relatively low (28-56%). There were clear but local age-group differences in network structure, symptom centrality, and predictability. According to our findings, network models provide important additional information about the centrality and predictability of specific symptom domains, and thus may facilitate targeted interventions among international adoptees.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the relative importance of self-, parent-, and teacher-reported problem behavior for initial specialist mental health care use in adolescence and the extent to which the relative importance of each informant changes over time.
   Methods: Data from the Dutch community-based cohort study TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) were linked to administrative records of specialist mental health care organizations. Self-, parent-, and teacher- reported internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at ages 11, 13, and 16 years, with self- reported problems also assessed at age 19 years. The study included 1,478 adolescents, of whom 19.8% had administrative records between January 2000 (age 9 years) and December 2011 (age 21 years).
   Results: After effects of internalizing and externalizing problems were adjusted for each other and for sociodemographic correlates, internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems, predicted initial specialist mental health care use. Teacher reports mainly predicted initial specialist care between the ages of 11 and 13 years (hazard ratio [HR] =1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-2.02; P <.001), parent reports mainly predicted initial specialist care between the ages of 13 and 16 years (HR =1.47; 95% CI, =1.13-1.91; P=.004), and self- reports mainly predicted initial specialist care between the ages of 16 and 19 years (HR =1.61; 95% CI, =1.25-2.08; P <.001) and between the ages 19 and 21 years (HR =1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.05; P=.011).
   Conclusions: Teachers, parents, and adolescents are the driving force behind initial specialist care at consecutive phases in adolescence. Future research should assess whether improving the problem recognition of teachers in secondary education and educating young adults about mental health problems are effective ways of reducing the treatment gap.

AB Parental empathy is a key component of sensitive parenting that supports children's social adaptation throughout life. Consistent with a two dissociable network perspective on empathy, we measured within- and between network integrity of two empathy-related networks in the parental brain as predictors of children's social outcomes across the first six years of life. We focused on two empathy networks; embodied simulation, which supports parents' capacity to resonate with infant state and emotions and implicates cingulo-insulary structures, and mentalizing, which underpins parents' theory-of-mind and mental attributions via prefrontal-temporoparietal circuit. We followed 87 first-time parents across the first six years of family formation, including heterosexual and homosexual parents. In infancy, parents' brain response to own versus unfamiliar infant stimuli was imaged; in preschool, children's cortisol production and emotion regulation were assessed; and at six years, children's behavior problems were reported. Parents' intro- and inter-network integrity increased when viewing their own infant compared to unfamiliar infant, suggesting that attachment stimuli increase network coherence in the parental brain. Functional connectivity within the parent's embodied simulation network in infancy predicted lower child cortisol production while inter-network connectivity among the embodied simulation and mentalizing networks was associated with more advanced child emotion regulation skills in preschool and lower internalizing problems at six years. Children's emotion regulation capacities mediated the link between inter network integrity in the parental brain and internalizing symptoms. Our findings, the first to demonstrate that integrity of empathy-related networks in the parental brain shape children's long-term stress reactivity and emotional adaptation, highlight the brain component of the parental empathy attribute, suggest that increased coherence within the "parental caregiving network" marks a key feature of parent-infant attachment, and contribute to discussion on biobehavioral mechanisms underpinning the cross-generation transmission of human stress reactivity and sociality.

AB The present follow-up study examines the associations between cognition and parent-rated internalizing problems among adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) at baseline (T1) and self-rated internalizing problems 13 years later (T2). Twelve individuals (8 male/4 female) with EOS and 30 healthy controls (16 male/14 female) were included in the study. All were between 12 and 18 years of age at Tl. Internalizing problems were measured with the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Internalizing Scale. Cognition was examined with a neuropsychological test battery measuring auditory attention/working memory, visuomotor processing, cognitive flexibility and verbal memory. Compared to healthy controls, the EOS group had significant cognitive deficits and more internalizing problems both at T1 and T2. There was no correlation between parent-rated internalizing problems at T1 and self-rated internalizing problems at T2 in the EOS group. However, deficits in auditory attention/working memory at T1 were significantly associated with internalizing problems at T2. A focus on improving the treatment of cognitive impairments may be important in preventing the development of internalizing problems in young patients with schizophrenia. The small sample size of the study is a limitation and further research is recommended.

AB Objective: In the developmental traumatology model, the biological construct of sex is considered a moderator that may negatively influence child maltreatment sequelae including those pertaining to neurocognitive function. Method: This study examined sex-differences in neurocognitive function and behavior problems in maltreated boys (n = 42), maltreated girls (n = 56) versus nonmaltreated boys (n = 45) and girls (n = 59). Maltreated boys were hypothesized to have poorer neurocognitive functioning than maltreated girls, and nonmaltreated boys and girls, in all neurocognitive domains, particularly pertaining to executive function and attention. We also examined correlations between cognitive function and parent report of child behavior problems for maltreated and nonmaltreated children. Results: Maltreated boys performed more poorly on measures of intelligence, attention, language, memory, executive function, and academic achievement in both reading and math than nonmaltreated boys. Maltreated boys did not perform more poorly on these cognitive measures or behavioral measures than maltreated girls, except for one memory measure. Maltreated girls performed more poorly on measures of intelligence, language, memory, executive function, and academic achievement than nonmaltreated girls. Maltreated girls with better visual-spatial skills had more internalizing and externalizing problems. Effect sizes for these sex differences ranged from small to large. Conclusions: Both maltreated boys and girls showed poorer cognitive function than their nonmaltreated sex-matched controls. Maltreated girls had subtle sparing of attention and short-term memory (STM). Understanding sex differences in neurocognitive functioning may have implications for designing large population studies of maltreated youth.
   Clinical Impact Statement
   The present study points to the merit of examining the ways in which sex differences impact neurocognitive and behavioral functioning in maltreated youth. These findings pertaining to sex differences support the idea that neuropsychological screening and intervention for maltreated youth have the potential to close gaps in functioning and decrease cumulative risk for maltreated youth. These findings also fit within current conceptualizations of mental health in general, and children's mental health in particular, which emphasize preventing and curtailing mental health problems with a precision approach that considers both sex and cumulative risk profiles rather than categorical designations.

AB Objective: The effects of exposure to violent events in adolescence have not been sufficiently studied in middle-income countries such as Brazil. The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among 12-year-olds in two neighborhoods with different socioeconomic status (SES) levels in Sao Paulo and to examine the influence of previous violent events and SES on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: Students from nine public schools in two neighborhoods of Sao Paulo were recruited. Students and parents answered questions about demographic characteristics, SES, urbanicity and violent experiences. All participants completed the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS) to obtain DSM-IV diagnoses. The data were analyzed using weighted logistic regression with neighborhood stratification after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics, gender, SES and previous traumatic events.
   Results: The sample included 180 individuals, of whom 61.3% were from low SES and 39.3% had experienced a traumatic event. The weighted prevalence of psychiatric disorders was 21.7%. Having experienced a traumatic event and having low SES were associated with having an internalizing (adjusted OR = 5.46; 2.17-13.74) or externalizing disorder (adjusted OR = 4.33; 1.85-10.15).
   Conclusions: Investment in reducing SES inequalities and preventing violent events during childhood may improve the mental health of youths from low SES backgrounds.

AB To determine the prevalence of inhalant use in Russian adolescents and to investigate associated psychosocial problems from a gender perspective.
   Data on inhalant use and comorbid psychopathology were collected by means of self-reports from 2892 (42.4% boys) sixth to tenth grade students in public schools in Arkhangelsk, Russia. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to assess differences in the levels of internalizing and externalizing problems in boys and girls, who were non-users and users of inhalants.
   The prevalence of inhalant use was 6.1% among boys and 3.4% among girls. Compared with non-users, inhalant users scored significantly higher on internalizing and externalizing problems, functional impairment and lower on academic motivation, with psychopathology increasing with age. While there were no gender differences for internalizing problems, increased levels of externalizing problems in inhalant users were gender-specific (significantly higher in boys).
   Inhalant use is related to significantly higher levels of comorbid psychopathology in Russian adolescents. Comprehensive, evidence-based prevention and intervention policies are needed to address inhalant use and its harmful effects.

AB Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) is an important aspect of early life environment associated with later life health/health behaviors, including alcohol misuse. However, alcohol misuse is modestly heritable and involves differing etiological pathways. Externalizing disorders show significant genetic overlap with substance use, suggesting an impulsivity pathway to alcohol misuse. Alcohol misuse also overlaps with internalizing disorders, suggesting alcohol is used to cope. These differing pathways could lead to different patterns over time and/or differential susceptibility to environmental conditions, such as childhood SES. We examine whether: 1) genetic risk for externalizing and internalizing disorders influence trajectories of alcohol problems across adolescence to adulthood, 2) childhood SES alters genetic risk these disorders on trajectories of alcohol problems, and 3) these patterns are consistent across sex. We find modest evidence of gene-environment interaction. Higher childhood SES increases the risk of alcohol problems in late adolescence/early adulthood, while lower childhood SES increases the risk of alcohol problems in later adulthood, but only among males at greater genetic risk of externalizing disorders. Females from lower SES families with higher genetic risk of internalizing or externalizing disorders have greater risk of developing alcohol problems.

AB The current study explored the extent to which teacher-child closeness during prekindergarten moderates the association between residential mobility and behavior problems in kindergarten for children living in non parental care. Data were obtained from the Head Start Impact Study. The sample included 260 children (53% male) who were eligible for Head Start. On average, children were 48.57 months old (SD = 6.95), and were 42% Anglo-American, 40% African-American, and 18% Hispanic-American. Results indicated that teacher-child closeness during prekindergarten was negatively related to behavior problems in kindergarten. Further, although residential mobility was not directly related to behavior problems in kindergarten, teacher-child closeness was a significant moderator between moving and externalizing, but not internalizing, problems. These findings suggest that closeness with teachers may help to curb the impact of mobility on externalizing problems during the transition to kindergarten for children in non-parental care. Implications for future research and intervention development are discussed.

AB This study examined whether the prospective association between peer victimization and depressive symptoms is moderated by early adolescents' affiliation value (i.e., desire for social contact and close relationships) and extracurricular commitment (i.e., importance attributed to involvement in adult-led organized activities). Data were collected initially from 123 early adolescents in the fifth or sixth grade and again ten months later, following the transition to middle school. The association between peer victimization and adolescent-reported depressive symptoms was stronger at higher levels of parent-reported affiliation value compared to lower levels of affiliation value, and this moderation effect was consistent across models with adolescent-, parent-, and teacher-reported peer victimization. In addition, teacher-reported peer victimization predicted depressive symptoms among adolescents who were not highly committed to an organized extracurricular activity. Results suggest that social values and extracurricular commitment may be useful prevention or intervention targets.

AB Currently, few studies have reported the risk behavior profiles of Mexican baccalaureate students. The study was conducted to detect the variability of the onset adolescents' participation in 11 risk behaviors. The study enrolled 4,606 students from 5 baccalaureate schools (57 % female and with a mean age of 15 years). Six behavioral patterns were detected through a latent class analysis: Non-Participants (43 %), Fighters (28 %), Normative Transgressors (12 %), Vulnerable Transgressors (9 %), Internalizing Transgressors (4 %), and Wide Spectrum Transgressors (3 %). Males and females had a differential probability of belonging to each group. The results show that the risk behaviors assessed are not a unified phenomenon and highlight the importance of using youth risk profiles to design more efficacious prevention programs.

AB Background. Although there is extensive evidence that problematic alcohol use is associated with smaller hippocampal volume, the typical cross-sectional study design cannot determine whether hippocampal deviations reflect pre-existing liability toward problematic alcohol use or instead reflect an alcohol exposure-related effect. We used the co-twin control study design, which capitalizes upon differences within a twin pair in levels of drinking, to differentiate preexisting liability from an effect of alcohol exposure.
   Methods. The sample included 100 female twins, prospectively assessed from ages 11 to 24. Problematic alcohol use was assessed dimensionally and included indicators of quantity, frequency, and density of alcohol use and intoxication. Hippocampal volume was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results. Problematic alcohol use (proximal and cumulative) was associated with significantly smaller left and right hippocampal volume. Follow-up co-twin control analyses that partitioned individual-level alcohol effects into pre-existing, familial liability and non-shared alcohol exposure-related effects indicated that this association reflected alcohol exposure. Greater alcohol using twins had smaller hippocampal volume relative to lesser alcohol using co-twins, beyond effects of their shared genetic and environmental liability toward problematic alcohol use. Results held accounting for recent alcohol use, other substance use, externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, personality traits, trauma exposure, and menstrual phase.
   Conclusions. The association between problematic alcohol use and smaller hippocampal volume likely reflects an alcohol exposure-related effect. Differentiating pre-existing brain deviations that confer risk for problematic alcohol use from those that reflect effects of alcohol on the brain will inform etiological models of addiction and further prevention and intervention efforts.

AB The evolution of behavior problems from school age to adolescence and their relationships with early risk factors and parenting stress were examined among 71 international adoptees. Children's health status and development were assessed soon after arrival in their family to provide indices of early adversity. At ages 7 and 15, self-report measures (DI and DIA) were used to evaluate behavior problems while mothers completed the CBCL. Mothers also completed the Parenting Stress Index and Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents. A lower percentage of children reported internalizing problems during adolescence than at school age while mothers reported a decrease in externalizing problems over age. A few correlations were found between internalizing and externalizing symptoms and early risk factors. However, these links were sequentially mediated by parenting stress at school age and in adolescence. The potential impact of parenting stress on international adoptees' psychological adjustment is discussed.

AB Introduction. Despite the extensive literature, the gender differences in eating disorders (ED) have been poorly investigated. Most of the studies, in fact, have been conducted so far on female samples, emphasizing the misleading belief that such disorders are of exclusive relevance of women. Aim. The review aim at highlighting as this preconception is still widespread among the male patients and the clinicians and as it represents an impediment to a correct diagnosis and a proper treatment planning. Method. Included studies were selected in the scientific literature published between January 2007 and December 2017 through the main databases, combining the words: "males", "eating disorder", "anorexia nervosa", "bulimia nervosa", "binge eating disorder". Results. Fifty-four studies have been selected in accordance with the followed methodological criteria. Discussion. Only recently, the attention of researchers have been also focused on male population: many differences between genders have emerged in prevalence, onset, phenomenology, diagnosis, comorbidity and outcomes of ED. The studies on risk factors have also pointed out significant differences between males and females, especially in relation to the different weight exerted by psychological variables involved in the aetiology of eating disorders. Conclusions. Compared with a little knowledge of ED in the male population, it is important to widespread the comprehension taking into account the gender perspective. The attention must be paid particularly to critical developmental periods, such as puberty and adolescence, where early detection and prevention of these disorders is of greatest importance, inside a conceptual framework which considers the mutual influence between biological and psychological vulnerability, and sociocultural factors.

AB There is robust evidence of an association between insomnia, anxiety, and depression in adolescence. The aim of this review is to describe and synthesize potential mechanisms underlying this association and explore implications for the design of adolescent behavioral sleep interventions. Specifically, we examine whether insomnia symptoms are a mechanism for the development of internalizing symptoms in adolescence and whether sleep interventions are an effective treatment for both insomnia and internalizing symptoms in adolescence because they target the shared mechanisms underlying these disorders. Research using different methodologies points to the role of sequential, parallel, and interacting mechanisms. In this paper, we review a wide range of relevant biological (i.e., polymorphisms and dysregulation in serotonin, dopamine, and circadian clock genes; alterations in corticolimbic and mesolimbic brain circuits; cortisol reactivity to stress; inflammatory cytokine dysregulation; biased memory consolidation; changes in sleep architecture), psychological (i.e., cognitive inflexibility, interpretational biases, judgment biases, negative attribution styles, worry, rumination, biased attention to threat, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, misperception of sleep deficit), and social mechanisms (i.e., reduced and impaired social interactions, unhelpful parenting behaviors, family stress) and propose an integrative multilevel model of how these phenomena may interact to increase vulnerability to both insomnia and internalizing disorders. Several tiopsychosociaE mechanisms hold promise as viable treatment targets for adolescent behavioral sleep interventions, which may reduce both insomnia and internalizing symptoms.

AB Depression is associated with deficits in executive functions (EFs)-cognitive control abilities that regulate goal-directed thoughts and actions-but the etiology of these associations is unclear. We examined the relations between depressive symptoms and multiple EF latent variables in a population-based sample of 439 twin pairs assessed at mean ages 12, 17, and 23 years. Greater depressive symptoms negatively related to a Common EF factor capturing shared variance across response inhibition, working memory updating, and mental set shifting tasks, and also negatively related to an Updating-Specific factor, but not a Shifting-Specific factor. Cross-lagged panel models suggested that the Common EF correlations reflected within-wave associations rather than prospective effects, whereas the Updating-Specific correlations reflected associations of earlier depression levels with later Updating-Specific ability. Twin models were consistent with a model in which Common EF and Updating-Specific abilities relate to depression through correlated genetic risk, with no significant environmental correlations.

AB Objective: To examine the associations of food insecurity with children's cognitive and behavioral outcomes using quantile regression.
   Design: Secondary analysis of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study dataset.
   Participants: A total of 2,046 children aged 5 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Child behavioral outcomes were measured using externalizing (aggressive) and internalizing (emotional) behavior problems. Child cognitive outcomes were measured using the Peabody Vocabulary test and the Woodcock-Johnson letter-word identification test. Food insecurity was measured using the US Department of Agriculture's Food Security Module.
   Analysis: Unconditional quantile regressions were employed. Statistical significance was set at P <= .05.
   Results: Negative associations between food insecurity and child behavior problems (externalizing and internalizing) were largest for children with the most behavior problems. For Peabody Vocabulary scores, the negative association with food insecurity was statistically significant only for children in the top half of the distribution (>= 50th percentile). The analysis found mixed evidence of an association between food insecurity and the Woodcock Johnson letter-word identification test. These associations were similar for boys and girls.
   Conclusions and Implications: Because children's cognitive skills and behavioral problems have long-lasting implications and effects later in life, reducing the risk of food insecurity might particularly benefit children with greater externalizing and internalizing behavior problems.

AB This article tested a model of parenting stress as a mediator between maternal depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, and child behavior problems using a sample of homeless, substance-abusing mothers. Participants were 119 homeless mothers (ages 18-24 years) and their young children (ages 0-6 years). Mothers responded to questions about their depressive symptoms, emotion regulation, parenting stress, and child behavior problems. A path analysis showed that maternal depressive symptoms were positively associated with child behavior problems through increased parenting stress whereas maternal cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with child behavior problems through decreased parenting stress. Moreover, maternal expressive suppression was negatively related to child externalizing problems. Findings support the parenting stress theory and highlight maternal parenting stress as a mechanism associated with homeless children's mental health risk. This study has significant implications for understanding the parenting processes underlying child's resilience in the context of homelessness and maternal substance use.
   RESUMEN Este estudio puso a prueba un modelo de estres de crianza como mediador entre los sintomas depresivos maternos, la regulacion de la emocion y los problemas de conducta del nino usando un grupo muestra de madres sin hogar y que habian abusado de sustancias. Las participantes fueron 119 madres sin hogar (edades de 18 a 24 anos) y sus pequenos ninos (edades de 0 a 6). Las madres respondieron a preguntas acerca de sus sintomas depresivos, la regulacion de la emocion, el estres de la crianza y los problemas de comportamiento del nino. Un analisis de trayectoria mostro que los sintomas depresivos maternos estaban positivamente asociados con los problemas de comportamiento del nino por medio de un incremento en el estres de la crianza, mientras que la revaloracion cognitiva materna fue negativamente asociada con los problemas de comportamiento del nino por medio de una baja en el estres de la crianza. Es mas, la supresion expresiva materna estuvo negativamente relacionada con los problemas externalizados del nino. Los resultados apoyan la teoria del estres de la crianza y subrayan el estres de crianza materno como un mecanismo asociado con el riesgo de salud mental de ninos sin hogar. Este estudio tiene implicaciones significativas para la comprension de los procesos de crianza subyacentes en la resistencia del nino dentro el contexto de la condicion de no tener un hogar y del uso de sustancias por parte de la madre.

Les participantes ont consiste en 119 meres sans abris (ages 18-24 ans) et leurs jeunes enfants (ages 0-6). Les meres ont repondu a des questions sur leurs symptomes depressifs, leur regulation des emotions, le stress de parentage et les problemes de comportement de l'enfant. Une analyse causale a demontre que les symptomes depressifs maternels etaient lies de maniere positive aux problemes de comportement de l'enfant au travers d'une augmentation du stress de parentage, alors que la reevaluation cognitive maternelle etait liee de maniere negative aux problemes de comportement de l'enfant au travers du stress de parentage. De plus, la suppression expressive maternelle etait liee negativement aux problemes d'externalisation de l'enfant. Les resultats soutiennent la theorie de stress de parentage et mettent en valeur les stress de parentage maternel comme mecanisme lie au risque de sante mental des enfants sans abris. Cette etude a des implications importantes pour la comprehension des processus de parentage qui sous-tendent la resilience de l'enfant dans le contexte de la vie sans-abri et de toxicomanie maternelle.
   ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Dieser Artikel testete ein Modell von Erziehungsstress als Mediator zwischen mutterlichen depressiven Symptomen, Emotionsregulation und Verhaltensproblemen auf Seiten des Kindes anhand einer Stichprobe von obdachlosen, substanzmissbrauchenden Muttern. Teilnehmerinnen waren 119 obdachlose Mutter (18-24 Jahre) und ihre Kleinkinder (0-6 Jahre). Die Mutter beantworteten Fragen zu ihren depressiven Symptomen, ihrer Emotionsregulation, ihrem Erziehungsstress und zu Verhaltensproblemen ihres Kindes. Eine Pfadanalyse zeigte, dass mutterliche depressive Symptome durch erhohten Erziehungsstress positiv mit Verhaltensproblemen des Kindes assoziiert waren, wahrend die mutterliche kognitive Neubewertung durch verringerten Erziehungsstress negativ mit Verhaltensproblemen des Kindes assoziiert war. Daruber hinaus war die mutterliche expressive Unterdruckung negativ mit kindlichen Externalisierungsproblemen assoziiert. Die Ergebnisse unterstutzen die Parenting-Stress-Theorie und heben den mutterlichen Erziehungsstress als einen Mechanismus hervor, der mit dem psychischen Gesundheitsrisiko von obdachlosen Kindern verbunden ist. Diese Studie hat erhebliche Auswirkungen auf das Verstandnis der Erziehungsprozesse, die der Belastbarkeit des Kindes im Zusammenhang mit Obdachlosigkeit und mutterlichem Substanzkonsum zugrunde liegen.

AB Drawing on economic models of child development and attachment relationship perspectives, this study examined the effect of maternal employment in the first year after childbirth on subsequent behavioral and cognitive development in low-income children. Analyses of data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (N = 411) revealed that despite the accompanying family income gains, maternal employment in the first year after childbirth adversely affected caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems of Hispanic, Black, and White children at ages 3 and 5 years. This study also examined how paternal participation in childcare might affect children's outcomes. Results indicate that greater paternal participation eased the adverse impacts of maternal employment on internalizing behavior problems. There was no evidence that maternal employment was associated with children's memory cognitive functioning or that paternal involvement moderated children's cognitive development. These findings suggest that when early intervention programs are designed to assist low-income families, enhancing supports (e.g., paternal involvement or parental leave) for working mothers during their child's first year may be valuable for young children's healthy development.
   RESUMEN Partiendo de modelos economicos de perspectivas sobre el desarrollo del nino y la relacion de afectividad, este estudio examino el efecto que el empleo de la madre en el primer ano despues del nacimiento tiene sobre el comportamiento subsecuente y el desarrollo cognitivo en ninos de bajos recursos economicos. Los analisis de datos del Proyecto sobre Desarrollo Humano en los Vecindarios de Chicago (PHDCN) (N = 411) revelaron que a pesar de las entradas economicas a la renta familiar que el empleo de la madre conlleva, este afecto adversamente, en el primer ano despues del nacimiento, los problemas de comportamiento internalizados y externalizados reportados por quienes prestaban el cuidado de ninos hispanos, negros y blancos a las edades de 3 y 5 anos. Este estudio tambien examino como la participacion del padre en el cuidado del nino pudiera afectar los resultados posteriores en el nino. Los resultados del estudio indican que la mayor participacion del padre alivio los impactos adversos del empleo de la madre sobre problemas de comportamiento internalizados. No hubo evidencia de que el empleo de la madre estuviera asociado con el funcionamiento de la memoria cognitiva de los ninos, ni tampoco de que la participacion del padre moderara el desarrollo cognitivo de los ninos. Estos resultados sugieren que cuando se disenan programas de temprana intervencion para ayudar a familias de bajos recursos, aumentar el apoyo (v.g. participacion del padre o licencia laboral de los padres) a las madres trabajadoras durante el primer ano de su nino, pudiera ser de mucho valor para el desarrollo saludable de los ninos pequenos.
   RESUME A partir de modeles economiques du developpement de l'enfant et a partir de perspectives de relation de l'attachement, cette etude a examine l'effet de l'emploi maternel dans la premiere annee apres la naissance sur le developpement cognitif et en matiere de comportement chez des enfants de milieux defavorises. Les analyses de donnees d'un Projets sur le Developpement Humain dans les Quartiers de Chicago aux Etats-Unis (PHDCN) (N = 411) ont revele qu'en depit de l'amelioration des revenus de la famille allant avec l'emploi, l'emploi maternel dans la premiere annee apres la naissance affectait defavorablement les problemes de comportement d'externalisation et d'internalisation rapportes par les personnes prenant soin des enfants chez les enfants noirs, hispaniques et blancs de 3 et 5 ans. Cette etude a aussi examine la maniere dont la participation paternelle ameliorait les impacts adverses de l'emploi maternel sur les problemes de comportement d'internalisation. On n'a trouve aucune preuve que l'emploi maternel soit lie au fonctionnement de la memoire cognitive des enfants, ni que la participation paternelle ait modere le developpement cognitif des enfants. Ces resultats suggerent que lorsque des programmes d'intervention precoce sont concus pour assister les familles de milieux defavorises, le fait d'ameliorer les soutiens (soit par exemple la participation paternelle ou le conge parental) pour les meres qui travaillent durant la premiere annee de leur enfant peut s'averer benefique pour le developpement sain des jeunes enfants.
   ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Diese Studie untersuchte anhand von okonomischen Modellen zur kindlichen Entwicklung und Bindungsperspektiven welchen Einfluss die mutterliche Beschaftigung im ersten Jahr nach der Geburt auf die spatere behaviorale und kognitive Entwicklung von Kindern in Familien mit niedrigem Einkommen hat. Die Analysen von Daten aus dem Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods-Projekt (PHDCN) (N = 411) ergaben, dass trotz der damit verbundenen Familieneinkommenszuwachse die Beschaftigung von Muttern im ersten Jahr nach der Entbindung nachteilig auf das berichtete internalisierende und externalisierende Verhalten von hispanischen, schwarzen und wei ss en Kindern im Alter von 3 und 5 Jahren auswirkte. In dieser Studie wurde auch untersucht, wie sich die vaterliche Beteiligung an der Kinderbetreuung auf die Ergebnisse der Kinder auswirkt. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass eine starkere vaterliche Beteiligung die negativen Auswirkungen der Beschaftigung von Muttern auf die internalisierenden Verhaltensprobleme abmildern kann. Es gab keine Evidenz dafur, dass die Beschaftigung von Muttern mit der kognitiven Gedachtnisleistung der Kinder assoziiert ist, und es gab auch keine Befunde, die zeigten, dass die vaterliche Beteiligung die kognitive Entwicklung der Kinder moderiert. Diese Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass Fruhinterventionsprogramme, die zur Unterstutzung einkommensschwacher Familien entwickelt werden, fur eine gesunde Entwicklung des Kindes im ersten Lebensjahr auf eine hohe Unterstutzung (z.B. vaterliche Beteiligung oder Elternzeit) von berufstatigen Muttern achten sollten.

AB Objectives: This study examined several underlying mechanisms hypothesized by the Environmental Stress Hypothesis (ESH) to explain the association between probable Developmental Coordination Disorder (pDCD) and internalizing problems.
   Design/Method: A cross-sectional analysis involving 1206 children aged 12-14 years (79 pDCD, 6.6% of the sample) was conducted. Children received assessments of motor coordination, physical activity, BMI, global selfworth, and internalizing problems. Path analysis was conducted to examine overall model fit and sex differences.
   Results: The results showed significant sex differences in the underlying pathways connecting pDCD to internalizing problems, indicating more mediating pathways through physical activity, BMI and global self-worth in girls, compared to boys.
   Conclusions: Overall, we were able to find support for some of the pathways identified in the ESH in school -aged children. Results also suggest that the development of interventions may need to be sex specific.

AB Background: Sucrose combined with non-nutritive sucking provided better pain relief than sucrose or non-nutritive sucking alone in a single painful procedure. However, whether the combination of non-nutritive sucking with sucrose could obtain a significant difference in analgesic effect of the repeated procedural pain than any single intervention has not been established.
   Objective: To compare the effect of non-nutritive sucking and sucrose alone and in combination of repeated procedural pain in preterm infants.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: A level III neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital in China.
   Method Preterm infants born before 37 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to four groups: routine care group (routine comfort through gentle touch when infants cried; n = 21), non-nutritive sucking group (n = 22), sucrose group (0.2 ml/kg of 20%; n = 21), sucrose (0.2 ml/kg of 20%) plus non-nutritive sucking group (n = 22). Each preterm infant received three nonconsecutive routine heel sticks. Each heel stick included three phases: baseline (the last 1 min of the 30 min without stimuli), blood collection, recovery (1 min after blood collection). Three phases of 3 heel stick procedures were videotaped. Premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score, heart rate, oxygen saturation and percentage of crying time were assessed by five independent evaluators who were blinded to the purpose of the study at different phases across three heel sticks. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance, with repeated measures at different evaluation phases of heel stick.
   Results: 86 preterm infants completed the protocol. During the blood collection and recovery phases, combination group, had lower PIPP score (4.4 +/- 1.5; 3.0 +/- 0.8), lower heart rate (138.6 +/- 7.9; 137.4 +/- 4.7), higher oxygen saturation (95.2 +/- 1.6; 96.0 +/- 1.2), and smaller percentage of crying time (11.5 +/- 8.6; 4.6 +/- 3.4), compared with the group has given non-nutritive sucking (9.3 +/- 1.3, 6.8 +/- 1.4; 154.2 +/- 9.0, 148.0 +/- 9.3; 92.9 +/- 2.4, 94.1 +/- 1.0; 44.2 +/- 9.6, 31.2 +/- 10.5; respectively) or sucrose (10.1 +/- 2.0, 7.4 +/- 1.6; 151.6 +/- 9.6, 147.9 +/- 6.9; 93.5 +/- 1.7, 94.5 +/- 1.2; 53.8 +/- 16.7, 35.2 +/- 13.9; respectively) or routine care (13.3 +/- 1.6, 10.6 +/- 1.9; 156.8 +/- 7.2, 151.7 +/- 7.9; 92.9 +/- 2.1, 93.8 +/- 1.6; 80.6 +/- 7.6, 68.2 +/- 9.9; respectively). Both non-nutritive sucking and sucrose were more effective in reducing preterm infants' PIPP score and percentage of crying time than routine care. There was no difference in PIPP score, heart rate, oxygen saturation and percentage of crying time between the non-nutritive sucking and sucrose groups.
   Conclusion: The combination of non-nutritive sucking with sucrose provided better pain relief during repeated painful procedures than when non-nutritive sucking or sucrose was used alone. The effect of non-nutritive sucking was similar to that of sucrose on repeated procedural pain.

AB Coparenting, the way that parents work together in their roles to parent children, has emerged as an important area for prevention and intervention. Though research indicates that low coparenting quality is associated with increased externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in children, the existing literature is not inclusive of families diverse in sociocultural identity and structure. We examined the link between coparenting and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and tested the moderating effect of child gender on the relationship between coparenting and child behavior problems in two-year-old children of African American and Latina adolescent mothers. One hundred and thirty five parents (69 mothers and 66 fathers) completed self-report measures of coparenting and child behavior problems when their children were two years old. While we did not find support for a direct association between coparenting quality and child behavior problems, child gender did moderate the association between mother's report of coparenting quality and both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. High coparenting quality was associated with lower levels of externalizing behavior problems in girls and higher levels of externalizing behavior problems in boys. High quality coparenting was associated with lower levels of internalizing behavior problems in girls, but there was no difference for boys. Though the results for boys were mixed, our findings for girls suggest that high quality coparenting may be a protective factor for the development of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB Anxiety is a prevalent psychiatric disorders. Theoretically, attachment insecurity is associated with the development of clinical anxiety. Few studies have examined this empirically. The current study investigates possible differences in attachment security and the related construct reflective functioning (Developmental Perspective, Theory of Mind, and Diversity of Feeling) in a case-controlled design between an index group of clinically anxious children (n = 111) and a control group of non-anxious children (n = 111) matched on age and gender. Clinical interviews established anxiety, attachment, and reflective functioning. No significant differences in attachment classification or Developmental Perspective emerged; however, index children had significantly poorer ratings on Theory of Mind and Diversity of Feeling. Insecure attachment might be a global risk factor rather than a risk factor for anxiety. Poorer scores on Theory of Mind and Diversity of Feeling might reflect genuinely lower abilities, or be results of the cognitive strategies applied by anxious children.

AB Many parents have concerns about the implications of dating (and subsequent breakups) on their children's wellbeing. Yet, little is known about the ways in which mothers' post-divorce dating breakups influence children's development. According to family systems theory, the effect dating breakups have on children's behavior may be more dependent on the rapport children have with mothers' dating partners than the event of a breakup itself. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of mothers' post-divorce dating breakups on children's adjustment, specifically internalizing and externalizing behaviors, while also testing children's rapport with dating partners as a moderator. The current study used longitudinal, multi-method and multi-informant data of mothers who dated following divorce (N = 270) and children who were aware of their mothers' dating relationships (N = 170). Using hierarchical linear modeling techniques, results indicated no main effect of breakup on children's problem behaviors. However, children's rapport with mothers' dating partners significantly moderated the effects of breakups on children's internalizing behaviors. Children who reported high levels of rapport with dating partners exhibited more internalizing behaviors at breakup compared to children who reported low levels of rapport with dating partners. Additionally, in families where children were aware of their mothers' dating relationships and mothers experienced breakups (n = 88), rapport moderated the effects of breakup for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Thus, transitions out of dating relationships appear stressful for children when they established positive relationships with mothers' dating partners. Further implications for post-divorce adjustment are discussed.

AB Objective: Studies have demonstrated a relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and adult obesity. Group interventions addressing the psychosocial sequelae of ACES using a trauma-informed approach for adults are well described in the literature. There is also a significant body of literature on the efficacy and proposed structure of interventions addressing weight reduction in adults. However, it is unknown how often interventions addressing attainment of a healthy weight incorporate a specific focus on adult women with a history of ACEs, including childhood abuse and trauma. Method: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using standard approaches. Two additional reviews used broadened inclusion criteria to identify and include group-level interventions that addressed intended outcomes other than obesity. Studies that examined the link between ACEs and obesity as a primary outcome and that provided a description of any potential mediating variables were also identified. The current literature search was conducted as the first step in a multifaceted approach to the development of a set of proposed research protocol designs for an Office on Women's Health-sponsored trauma-informed healthy weight pilot intervention for obese women with a history of ACEs. Results: No articles describing interventions for the treatment of obesity or overweight women with a history of ACEs were identified. Eleven articles describing ACE-related interventions and 15 studies identifying mediators were reviewed. Conclusions: Intervention studies for women with ACEs, other than psychotherapy, are limited. Significant mediators to be considered include anxiety symptoms and internalizing behaviors. Specific recommendations for interventions are provided.

AB Objective: The current study investigated associations between appraisals of shame and alienation related to mothers' own experiences of child maltreatment and symptoms across generations-in mothers themselves as well as their toddler/preschool-aged children. Method: Mothers who survived maltreatment (N = 113) with a child between the ages of 2 and 5 were recruited to participate in an online study on Maternal Coping, Attachment and Health. Mother participants completed a series of questionnaires, including those that asked about posttrauma appraisals of their own maltreatment experiences as well as their child's and their own mental health symptoms. Results: When taking into account other posttrauma appraisals (e.g., fear, betrayal, anger, self-blame), maternal shame and alienation were both significantly associated with maternal trauma-related distress (a composite of anxiety, PTSD, dissociation, and depressive symptoms). Maternal shame was also significantly linked to child internalizing symptoms and externalizing symptoms. Lower levels of fear and higher levels of betrayal were associated with externalizing symptoms as well. Maternal trauma-related distress mediated the relationship between maternal shame and child externalizing symptoms, and partially mediated the relationship between shame and internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to examine the role of posttrauma appraisals among mother survivors of maltreatment as they relate to symptoms in their young children. Although additional research is necessary, findings suggest that mothers' posttrauma appraisals, such as shame, could be a relevant factor in the early social-emotional development of survivors' children.

AB BackgroundAttachment insecurity is associated with poor mental health across the life span, and increasing evidence suggests that emotion regulation difficulties are implicated in these associations. To date, research has focused largely on adult attachment in the context of romantic relationships; however, close friendships are well-established predictors of mental health and well-being, and little is known about the influence of attachment in the context of close friendships on mental health, and the potential role of emotion regulation. The present research examined whether attachment to friends was associated with mental health and interpersonal functioning, and whether emotion regulation mediated these associations.
   MethodA sample of 243 adults (Mage = 20.91 years) completed an online questionnaire assessing attachment to friends, emotion regulation, mental health, and interpersonal functioning.
   ResultsEmotion dysregulation mediated the association between attachment anxiety and depression, anxiety, stress, and interpersonal distress. There were also direct effects of attachment anxiety on symptoms of anxiety and interpersonal distress. Emotion dysregulation did not mediate the association between attachment avoidance and psychosocial outcomes, though attachment avoidance directly predicted depression and interpersonal distress.
   ConclusionsThis research highlights that emotion dysregulation may be one mechanism underlying the association between anxious attachment to friends and poor psychosocial functioning. Clinical interventions may therefore benefit from assessing attachment in the context of friendships, and targeting emotion dysregulation for those high in attachment anxiety.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify the pathways from childhood physical and sexual abuse to adolescent physical and sexual victimization by assessing behavior symptoms (both internalizing and externalizing) and peer popularity as potential mediating variables. The data derive from Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN), which tracks the consequences of child abuse and neglect using five study sites across the US. Child physical and sexual abuse was measured at age 12 using self-reports of life-time maltreatment experiences. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed at age 12 using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Peer popularity was assessed at age 14 by teachers. Peer victimization was assessed at age 16 using the modified version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire. The results indicated that physical abuse had no direct effect on either physical or sexual peer victimization, whereas sexual abuse had significant direct effect on both physical and sexual victimization. Assessed at age 12, children who had been physically or sexually maltreated were found to have higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These increased symptoms are associated with lower peer popularity at age 14, which in turn is associated with greater physical and sexual peer victimization at age 16. The findings suggest that multiple points for interventions may exist to disrupt the cycle of victimization. Early assessment and treatment for externalizing symptoms and for low peer popularity may be helpful in preventing physical peer victimization among adolescents who have been physically and/or sexually abused.

AB Parent depressive symptomatology is robust risk factor for externalizing behavior in childhood (Goodman et al., 2011). Although the precise mechanisms underlying this association have yet to be fully illuminated, there is some evidence that parent depression can impact externalizing behavior via both genetic and environmental pathways. In the current study, we investigated the extent to which genetic and environmental influences on externalizing behavior are moderated by parent depressive symptoms (i.e., genotype-environment interaction) in a sample of 2,060, 6- to 11-year-old twins. Results suggest that genetic influences explain more variance in externalizing behavior as maternal depressive symptoms increase, whereas shared environmental effects decrease. These findings were specific to maternal depressive symptoms, however, and did not extend to not paternal depressive symptoms. Findings are critical for understanding the role of parental depression as a risk factor for problematic child behavior, and informing programs that seek to minimize the impact of this risk factor.

AB Children of parents with mental health problems (CPM) have an increased risk for behavioral and psychological problems. This study investigated the age- and gender-specific course as well as predictors of mental health problems in CPM using the longitudinal data (baseline 1- and 2-year follow-ups) of a German general population sample from the BELLA study. Children and adolescents aged 11-17 years (at baseline) who had a parent with mental health problems (n = 325) were analyzed. The mental health problems of the children were assessed by the self-reported version of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). We used individual growth modeling to investigate the age- and gender-specific course, and the effects of risk as well as personal, familial and social protective factors on self-reported mental health problems in CPM. Additionally, data were examined differentiating internalizing and externalizing mental health problems in CPM. Results indicated that female compared to male CPM showed increasing mental health problems with increasing age. Mental health problems in CPM were associated with lower self-efficacy, worse family climate and less social competence over time. Internalizing problems were associated with lower self-efficacy, less social competence and more severe parental mental health problems. Externalizing problems were associated with lower self-efficacy, worse family climate and lower social competence. The main limitations of the study are the short time period (2 years) covered and the report of mental health problems by only one parent. Our findings should be considered in the development of treatment and prevention programs for mental health problems in CPM.

AB Research linking child maltreatment and dating violence in adolescence and emerging adulthood has proliferated in the past two decades; however, the precise mechanisms by which these experiences are related remain elusive. A trauma-informed perspective suggests four particularly promising mediators: maladaptive attachment, emotion regulation difficulties, emotional distress, and hostility. The current article characterizes the status of the empirical literature examining these four mediators using a study space analysis and a narrative review of existing research. An extensive literature search identified 42 papers (44 studies) that met the following criteria: (1) at least one measure of child maltreatment (emotional, physical, sexual, neglect, or exposure to intimate partner violence); (2) a measure of one of the four mediator variables; (3) a measure of dating violence perpetration or victimization; and (4) a sample of adolescents or young adults. The study space analysis suggested several important observations about the research on this topic, including a dearth of studies examining hostility as a mediator and little research using prospective designs or clinical samples. There are also limitations with the conceptualization and measurement of dating violence, child maltreatment, and some of the mediator variables. In addition, few studies examined more than one mediator variable in the same study. The narrative review suggested that maladaptive attachment (specifically insecure attachment styles), emotion regulation difficulties (specifically regulation of the emotion of anger), and emotional distress construed broadly represent promising mediators of the association between child maltreatment and dating violence, but conclusions about mediation must remain tentative given the state of the literature. The discussion offers recommendations for improved theoretical and empirical rigor to advance future research on mechanisms linking child maltreatment and dating violence.

AB This randomized clinical trial (RCT) compared Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) with residential treatment (RT) for adolescents with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders on substance use, delinquency, and mental health symptoms. Using an intent-to-treat design, 113 adolescents who had been referred for residential treatment were randomly assigned to either RT or MDFT in the home/community. The sample was primarily male (75%) and Hispanic (68%) with an average age of 15.4 years. Seventy-one percent of youth had at least one previous residential treatment placement. Participants were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4, 12 and 18 months post-baseline. During the early phase of treatment (baseline to 2 months), youth in both treatments showed significant reductions in substance use [substance use problems (d = 1.10), frequency of use (d = 1.36)], delinquent behaviors (d = 0.18) and externalizing symptoms (d = 0.77), and youth receiving MDFT reported significantly greater reductions in internalizing symptoms than youth receiving RT (d = 0.42). In phase 2, from 2 to 18 months after baseline, youth in MDFT maintained their early treatment decreases in substance use problems (d = 0.51), frequency of use (d = 0.24), and delinquent behaviors (d = 0.42) more effectively than youth in RT. During this period, there were no significant treatment differences in maintenance of gains for externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that Multidimensional Family Therapy is a promising alternative to residential treatment for youth with substance use and co-occurring disorders. The results, if supported through replication, are important because they challenge the prevailing assumption that adolescents who meet criteria for residential treatment cannot be adequately managed in a non-residential setting.

AB We investigated the relationships of adolescents' internalizing and externalizing behaviors with their early maladaptive schemas (EMS), coping responses, and schema modes. We focused on EMS related to experiences of disconnection and rejection that comprise vulnerable emotions, such as shame, mistrust, deprivation, abandonment, and isolation/alienation. This cross-sectional study included a total of 699 adolescents (combined clinical and non-referred sample) who were 11 to 18 years old (M = 14.6; SD = 1.6), and of which 45% was male. All participants completed self-report questionnaires on EMS, coping responses, schema modes, and behavior problems. We aimed to clarify the relationships between these variables by testing mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation models. In general, coping responses functioned as mediators rather than moderators in the relationships between EMS and schema modes. Furthermore, EMS regarding experiences of disconnection and rejection were related to both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and coping responses and schema modes mediated these effects. In conclusion, although adolescent internalizing and externalizing behavior problems manifest quite differently, they seem related to the same EMS.

AB Objective: This study examines whether fluctuation in mothers' posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) predicts fluctuation in child adjustment problems in families seeking services for intimate partner violence (IPV). Method: Participants were 300 mothers (mean age = 30.65 years) of children (mean age = 6.88 years; 49% female) who were seeking shelter or legal services because of IPV. Most mothers identified as Hispanic (57%), followed by Black/African American (26%). Mothers reported PTSSs on a 7-item screening measure and reported child externalizing and internalizing problems on the Child Behavior Checklist. Mother and child functioning were assessed shortly after the mothers' requested services and then every 4 months for a 5-year period. Results: Eighty-one percent of mothers reported clinical levels of PTSSs at the initial assessment. As hypothesized, fluctuation in mothers' PTSSs predicted fluctuation in child externalizing and internalizing problems during the ensuing 4-month period. These relations, however, occurred within subjects but not between subjects. The within-subject associations emerged after accounting for IPV and mothers' depressive symptoms and were stronger for older children than younger children. The strength of the associations decreased over time. Conclusions: Addressing women's trauma symptoms at the point of seeking services for IPV has possible implications for child mental health. Attempting to reduce mothers' PTSSs may have positive effects for women as well as their children.

AB A recently defined interconnected systems framework (ISF) provides explicit guidance on steps to align positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) and expanded school mental health (SMH) within the multitiered system of support (MTSS). As PBIS and SMH strategies align, there are opportunities to expand and improve effective programs and services for students at all tiers of the MTSS. A prominent need is to improve programs and services for students presenting internalizing disorders such as those related to trauma, depression, and anxiety. In this article, we discuss relevant issues involved in improving multitiered systems/interventions for students presenting internalizing problems and provide guidance for this work in dimensions of cross-system collaboration (with major emphasis on effective teams), implementing evidence-based practices, and data-based decision making/quality improvement. The article concludes with recommendations for practice, research, and policy to improve MTSS for students presenting internalizing problems.

AB Background. Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term disability in children and adolescents worldwide. Amongst the wide array of consequences known to occur after pediatric TBI, behavioral impairments are among the most widespread and may particularly affect children who sustain injury early in the course of development. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems 6 months after preschool (i.e. 18-60 months old) mild TBI.
   Methods. This work is part of a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of preschool TBI. Participants (N = 229) were recruited to one of three groups: children with mild TBI, typically developing children and orthopedic injured (OI) children. Mothers of children in all three groups completed the Child Behavior Checklist as a measure of behavioral outcomes 6-month post-injury. Demographics, injury-related characteristics, level of parental distress, and estimates of pre-injury behavioral problems were also documented.
   Results. The three groups did not differ on baseline characteristics (e.g. demographics and pre-injury behavioral problems for the mild TBI and OI groups) and level of parental distress. Mothers' ratings of internalizing and externalizing behaviors were higher in the mild TBI group compared with the two control groups. Pre-injury behavioral problems and maternal distress were found to be significant predictors of outcome.
   Conclusion. Our results show that even in its mildest form, preschool TBI may cause disruption to the immature brain serious enough to result in behavioral changes, which persist for several months post-injury.

AB Using data from a prospective population based study, the prevalence and psychopathological correlates of sibling bullying in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were estimated. There were 475 children with ASD and 13,702 children without ASD aged 11 years. Children with ASD were more likely to be bullied by their siblings compared to those without ASD. They were also more likely than those without ASD to both bully and be bullied by their siblings, which was associated with lower prosocial skills as well as more internalizing and externalizing problems compared to those not involved in any sibling bullying. Interventions to improve social and emotional outcomes in children with ASD should focus on both the affected and the unaffected sibling.

AB Adolescent romantic relationships have the potential to affect psychological functioning well into adulthood. This study assessed adolescent romantic relationship qualities as long-term predictors of psychological functioning utilizing a longitudinal multi-method, multi-informant study of 80 participants (59% female; 54% Caucasian, 35% African American, 11% mixed or other race) assessed at age 17 along with their romantic partners and at ages 25-27. Controlling for gender, family income, and baseline mental health, partner-reported hostile conflict at age 17 predicted relative increases in internalizing behaviors from age 17 to 27. In contrast, observed teen support with their partner during a help-seeking task at age 17 predicted relative decreases in externalizing behaviors over time. The results are interpreted as suggesting qualities that may help determine whether adolescent romances have positive vs. negative long-term psychological health implications.

AB Our objective was to test ways parental caring and over-controlling rearing approaches predict internalizing problems across multiple generations of offspring: from grandparents to parents and from parents to children. We examined whether retrospective perceptions of grandparents' caring and over-controlling behaviors predicted parents' current anxiety problems and rearing behaviors toward their own children in a sample that participated in a clinical trial for youth with a specific phobia (SP). We further tested whether parental anxiety and rearing approaches (as perceived by parents and children) predicted children's longitudinal outcomes of internalizing problems and severity of the SP over time, above and beyond the effects of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of the SP. We were ultimately interested in testing indirect, intergenerational processes from grandparents to children to identify buffers or risks of anxiety via patterns of care and control from parents. Data were drawn from 113 treatment-seeking children with SPs and their parents (52.2% female, ages 6-15, M age = 8.77, SD = 1.75) from pre-treatment to three-year follow-up. Hierarchical linear models tested the effects of earlier grandparent rearing behaviors on parent and child outcomes and the effects of parent anxiety and rearing behaviors on child outcomes. Models supported indirect effects of grandparent rearing behaviors onto child outcomes via ongoing parent anxiety problems and select rearing behaviors, suggesting these intergenerational processes could potentially maintain anxiety (i.e., use of over-controlling behaviors) or buffer offspring from anxiety risks (i.e., use of care behaviors).

AB Objectives:We sought to identify subgroups of individuals based on patterns of psychological health problems (PH; e.g., depressive symptoms, hazardous drinking) and family maltreatment (FM; e.g., child and partner abuse).
   Method:We analyzed data from very large surveys of United States Air Force active duty members with romantic partners and children.
   Results:Latent class analyses indicated six replicable patterns of PH problems and FM. Five of these classes, representing approximate to 98% of survey participants, were arrayed ordinally, with increasing risk of multiple PH problems and FM. A sixth group defied this ordinal pattern, with pronounced rates of FM and externalizing PH problems, but without correspondingly high rates/levels of internalizing PH problems.
   Conclusions:Ramifications of these results for intervention are discussed.

ID SAMPLE
AB The Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation (SCBE), originally developed for assessing preschoolers, was adapted for the adolescents. The instrument taps social competence, externalizing and internalizing problems. In the adolescent SCBE, more than 65% of the items (54 items) remained practically the same as in the preschool version, 24 items were modified slightly, and two items were rewritten completely. The instrument was tested on 342 adolescents (M = 14.4 years, SD = .6). The summary scales showed high reliability. Using exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), acceptable support for the three-factor model based on 16-item clusters was found, indicating that minimal adjustments to the items of the preschool version allows for the assessment of the same constructs in adolescence. The adolescent version of the SCBE can be valid and reliable instrument for describing social adjustment in adolescents making the SCBE interesting from an international perspective.

AB The present studies report on the initial development and validation of the Youth Internalizing Problems Screener (YIPS), which is a 10-item self-report rating scale for assessing general internalizing problems and identifying depression and anxiety caseness within the context of school mental health screening. Results from Study 1 (N = 177) demonstrated that responses to the YIPS yielded a single-factor latent structure, that scores derived from the scale had concurrent validity with scores from measures of student subjective well-being and problem behavior, and showed that scores derived from the YIPS demonstrated incremental validity in comparison with scores from another common internalizing problems screener for predicting self-reports of broad student functioning. Findings from Study 2 (N = 219) confirmed the latent structure and internal reliability of responses to the YIPS, demonstrated that scores derived from this scale had strong associations with scores from criterion measures of depression and anxiety, and showed that YIPS scores had good-to-excellent power for accurately discriminating between youth scoring at or above the clinical caseness thresholds on criterion measures of depression and anxiety. Taken together, results suggest the YIPS shows promise as a technically adequate instrument for measuring general internalizing problems and identifying depression and anxiety caseness among secondary students. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB This study examines the relationship between Theory of Mind (ToM) and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood and early adolescence. This developmental period has been largely neglected by ToM researchers, even though internalizing symptoms typically emerge and become stable at this age. In a sample of 318 (157 girls) school-aged children, we found that a high ToM performance is significantly associated with low depressive symptoms and low symptoms of panic disorder and separation anxiety. Further analyses revealed that problem-solving abilities mediate the relationship between ToM and depressive symptoms. Moreover, problem-solving abilities also mediate the relationship between ToM and separation anxiety symptoms, in boys only. The present findings suggest that depressive and separation anxiety symptoms in middle childhood and early adolescence might derive from a complex interaction between ToM abilities and coping strategies.

AB The disruption of key epigenetic processes during critical periods of brain development can increase an individual's vulnerability to psychopathology later in life. For instance, DNA methylation in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) in adulthood is known to be associated with early-life adversities and has been suggested to mediate the development of stress-related disorders. However, the association between NR3C1 methylation and the emergence of internalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence has not been studied extensively. In the present report, we used saliva DNA from a cohort of Swedish adolescents (13-14 years old; N = 1149) to measure NR3C1 methylation in the exon 1F region. Internalizing psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC). We found that NR3C1 hypermethylation was cross-sectionally associated with high score for internalizing symptoms in the whole group as well as among the female participants. In addition, an analysis of social environmental stressors revealed that reports of bullied or lacking friends were significantly associated with NR3C1 hypermethylation. This cross-sectional association of NR3C1 exon 1F hypermethylation with internalizing psychopathology in adolescents, as well as with bullying and lack of friends are novel results in this field. Longitudinal studies are needed to address whether NR3C1 methylation mediates the link between social stressors and psychopathology in adolescence.

AB Animal and human studies have shown that both early-life traumatic events and ongoing stress episodes affect neurodevelopment, however, it remains unclear whether and how they modulate normative adolescent neuro-maturational trajectories. We characterized effects of early-life (age 0-5) and ongoing stressors (age 14-17) on longitudinal changes (age 14 to17) in grey matter volume (GMV) of healthy adolescents (n = 37). Timing and stressor type were related to differential GMV changes. More personal early-life stressful events were associated with larger developmental reductions in GMV over anterior prefrontal cortex, amygdala and other subcortical regions; whereas ongoing stress from the adolescents' social environment was related to smaller reductions over the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that early-life stress accelerates pubertal development, whereas an adverse adolescent social environment disturbs brain maturation with potential mental health implications: delayed anterior cingulate maturation was associated with more antisocial traits - a juvenile precursor of psychopathy.

AB Background: It is well known that sports participation is positively associated with psychosocial health in children, but details about this association over time are lacking. This study aimed to explore longitudinal associations between several characteristics of sports participation and three aspects of psychosocial health (internalizing problems, externalizing problems and prosocial behaviour) in Dutch children aged 10-12 years.
   Methods: Data from 695 fourth-grade primary school children were included at baseline; 10-13 months later, 487 children (response rate 70.1%) were retained. At both time points, children reported on their sports participation (Move and Sports Monitor Questionnaire - Youth Aged 8-12 Years) and psychosocial health (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire). Longitudinal associations between several characteristics of sports participation and the three aspects of psychosocial health were analysed using linear mixed models, both clustering the repeated measures within children and clustering the children within schools. In addition to crude analyses, analyses were performed adjusting for sex, age, BMI, household composition, SES and frequency of sports participation.
   Results: Membership in a sports club, moderate or high frequency of sports participation, performing team sports, performing outdoor sports, performing contact sports and involvement in competition were longitudinally associated with fewer internalizing problems. The longitudinal association of higher frequency of sports participation with fewer internalizing problems was stronger as a child's BMI increased. The association of performing team sports with fewer internalizing problems was only observed for boys. Membership in a sports club and moderate or high frequency of sports participation were also longitudinally associated with better prosocial behaviour. These associations with prosocial behaviour were stronger for girls. None of the characteristics of sports participation examined were longitudinally associated with externalizing problems.
   Conclusions: This study shows that from a longitudinal perspective, fewer internalizing problems and better prosocial behaviour were seen in children who were active in sports. Fewer internalizing problems were also associated with the kind of sports participation; for example, with performing outdoor sports. No associations were found for externalizing problems. Future research should preferably take the form of an intervention to investigate whether the observed statistical associations are of a causal nature.

AB Objective: This study examined cross-informant evidence for a general factor of psychopathology ("P") and a narrower, clinically oriented dysregulation general factor based on the Dysregulation Profile ("DP") in a large clinical sample of children and adolescents. We also compared the magnitude of P and DP general factor associations with self-harm and suicidal ideation as an indicator of criterion validity.
   Method: Itemwise data from the Child Behavior Checklist (N = 2,934; 4-18 years of age) were analyzed using confirmatory bifactor modeling and replicated in a supplementary analysis using Youth Self Report data (N = 2,395).
   Results: General P and DP bifactor models fit the data better than single-factor and correlated factor models. Cross-informant criterion analyses on a subset of youth (n = 1,552) suggested that whether modeled as latent P or DP, associations with a brief composite index of self-harm and suicidal ideation are essentially of the same magnitude.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide novel, large-sample support for the existence of general factors of psychopathology and dysregulation in clinically referred children and adolescents using a standardized rating system of psychopathology symptoms. Moreover, our results provide preliminary evidence that general psychopathology and dysregulation factors are clinically meaningful constructs. In addition, our findings raise the possibility that the DP general factor may serve as an efficient proxy for the general psychopathology factor in future clinical applications. Further efforts are necessary to understand the core empirical meaning of the P factor and to determine how it can be applied to clinical assessment and intervention.

AB The desire to build and maintain positive relations is a fundamental and universal need of humans. Therefore, individuals' perception of social exclusion has been investigated as a potentially important factor for mental health and wellbeing. In order to enhance adolescents' wellbeing and promote mental health at school, the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether academic self-regulation mediated and moderated the effect of social exclusion on youths' mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems) and affective wellbeing at school. Participants comprised 313 adolescents (55.3% girls), ranging in age between 11 and 19 years (M = 15.678, SD = 1.739). Findings from structural equation analyses indicated a partial mediating effect of academic self-regulation on adolescents' mental health problems and affective wellbeing, and that it promoted their mental health and wellbeing in the face of social exclusion. In addition, moderation analyses supported these results, demonstrating a significant moderating role of academic self-regulation on youths' wellbeing and mental health. Taken together, these results support the importance of academic self-regulation on youths' mental health and wellbeing in the face of social exclusion, and contribute to the design of school-based services in order to protect their mental health and wellbeing. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB Despite high rates of exposure to community violence among Latino youth in urban communities, there is considerable variability in individual outcomes. This study examined (a) associations between coping and indices of Latino culture, (b) main effects of active/avoidant coping on psychopathology, and (c) whether coping moderates the impact of violence exposure on mental health in Latino youth. Participants included 168 Latino youth (56% female; ages 11-14) that took part in a short-term longitudinal study. Results indicate that youth acculturation was positively associated with active coping, but enculturation level and immigrant status were not associated with coping. Structural equation models suggested that active coping was negatively associated with internalizing problems (p = .046) while avoidant coping was positively associated with internalizing problems (p = .013) and posttraumatic stress symptoms (p = .024). Moderation analyses revealed that violence exposure was more strongly associated with internalizing problems as reliance on avoidance coping increased. However, at high levels of violence exposure, a greater reliance on active coping was related to increased posttraumatic stress problems. Findings suggest that consideration of the specific stressor, level of stress exposure, and mental health problem-type may be crucial in determining the effectiveness of a coping strategy. Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB Purpose of reviewTo provide an update of recent studies of the incidence and impact of parental substance use disorders (SUDs) on children, and to identify effective treatment programs to assist parents with SUDs and their children.Recent findingsChildren of parents with alcohol and drug use disorders (COPADs) suffer from physical, mental and behavioral problems at higher rates than other children and are more likely to develop their own SUDs in adolescence. Parenting styles and familial dysfunction contribute to the intergenerational transmission of SUDs. Studies of the negative effects of parental SUDs on children identified the effects of inconsistent, disengaged or harsh parenting practices on mother-child bonding. Exposure to violence and father's hostility contribute to children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Family- based intervention programs, as well as programs for mothers with SUDs and their young children, have shown positive results. For high-risk families with multiple needs, the ongoing support of multidisciplinary services is required.SummaryParental SUDs have a profound impact on their children, including intergenerational transmission of SUDs. A variety of interventive programs are being studied in order to devise effective programs to assist these children.

AB This paper aims to synthesize research relating to youth responses to school shootings between 2014 and 2017. The main questions it addresses are how such events impact young people psychologically, and what risk or protective factors may contribute to different trajectories of recovery?
   Recent research suggests that most young people exposed to school shootings demonstrate resilience, exhibiting no long-term dysfunction. However, a minority will experience severe and chronic symptoms. The likelihood of experiencing clinically significant reactions is influenced by pre-trauma functioning as well as peri-traumatic and post-traumatic factors. These include proximity to the trauma, peri-traumatic dissociation, post-traumatic emotional regulation difficulties, social support, and flexibility of coping styles.
   Research that separates the distinguishing features of young people with differing recovery styles is vital to tailor intervention. But methodological and design issues associated with such research necessitates caution in drawing conclusions. Variation in definitions and measures and the self-report nature of many of the studies are potential sources of bias. Greater uniformity across designs would enhance confidence and allow for improved evidence-based intervention.

AB Maternal sensitivity is a modifiable determinant of infant attachment security and a precursor to optimal child development. Contextual stressors undermine sensitivity, but research was yet to be synthesized. We aimed to identify (i) types of stress associations analyzed in studies of maternal sensitivity and (ii) the strength of effects of various stress factors. A systematic search identified all studies that used the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (MBQS) to code sensitivity in dyadic observations and that reported a coefficient for MBQS associations with contextual stress. Identified stressors cohered around three spheres: sociodemography (maternal education, family income, composite SES, maternal age and cohabitation status); parenting stress (perceived maternal stress related to parenting); and mental health (specifically maternal internalizing symptoms). Seven meta-analyses (combined ns range 223-1239) of a subset of 30 effects from 20 articles, and a multi-level meta-analysis (N = 1324) assessed aggregated correlations with sensitivity. Significant mean effects emerged in expected directions, whereby all stress indicators were negatively associated with sensitivity. Small effects were found for associations with parenting stress (r = -0.13) and mental health indicators (r = -0.12). Generally moderate effects were found for associations with socio-demographic indicators (range r = -0.12 to r = -0.32). Emerging findings support the proposition that in various contexts of stress, maternal sensitivity to infant needs can be undermined. Implications and research directions are discussed.

TI Perinatal stress moderates the link between early and later emotional

AB Background: Very preterm (VPT) birth refers to an early stressful event putting children at heightened risk for emotional difficulties. However, there is an important individual variability, leaving unexplained why some VPT children do not develop emotional difficulties, while others develop such difficulties in the early years or later in life.
   Aim: In this study, we examined whether perinatal stress is a risk factor explaining heterogeneities in emotional problems in VPT children.
   Methods: Thirty-six VPT children and 22 full-term born (FT) children participated in an 11 year-long study. Risk for perinatal stress was assessed at birth with the Perinatal Risk Inventory. Mothers reported children's emotional difficulties at 18 months of child age on the Symptom Checklist and at 11 years on the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Results indicated significant differences in emotional scores at 11 years not only between VPT and FT children but also between the low and high perinatal stress groups. More importantly, emotional scores at 18 months influenced variability in internalizing scores at 11 years only in VPT children with high perinatal stress.
   Conclusion: Although prematurity affects the emotional abilities of preadolescents, the link between emotional skills in early and later childhood is moderated by the severity of perinatal stress. In particular, VPT children who are born with more complications, and as such experience a more stressful perinatal environment, are more likely to show emotional difficulties at preadolescence.

AB Both ADHD and trauma exposure are common childhood problems, but there are few empirical data regarding the association between the two conditions. The aims of this study were to compare lifetime prevalence of trauma exposure in children with and without ADHD, and to explore the association between trauma exposure and outcomes in children with ADHD. Children aged 6-8 years with ADHD (n = 179) and controls (n = 212) recruited from 43 schools were assessed for ADHD, trauma exposure and comorbid mental health disorders using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children IV. Outcome data were collected by direct child assessment, parent report and teacher-report, and included ADHD symptom severity, internalizing and externalizing problems, quality of life, and academic functioning. Logistic and linear regression models were used to examine differences adjusted for child and family socio-demographics. Children with ADHD were more likely than controls to have ever experienced a traumatic event (27 vs 16%; OR: 1.99; 95% CI 1.21, 3.27). This difference remained significant in the adjusted model (OR: 1.76, 95% CI 1.03, 3.01) accounting for child factors (age and gender) and family socio-demographic factors (parent age, parent high school completion and single parent status). Among those with ADHD, trauma-exposed children had higher parent-reported ADHD severity and more externalizing problems than non-exposed children, however, this effect attenuated in adjusted model. Children with ADHD were more likely to have experienced a traumatic event than controls. The high prevalence of trauma exposure in our sample suggests that clinicians should evaluate for trauma histories in children presenting with ADHD.

AB A wealth of information is currently known about the epidemiology, etiology, and evaluation of drug and alcohol use across the life span. Despite this corpus of knowledge, much has yet to be learned. Many factors conspire to slow the pace of future advances in the field of substance use including the need for long-term longitudinal studies of often hard-to-reach subjects who are reporting rare and episodic behaviors. One promising option that might help move the field forward is integrative data analysis (IDA). IDA is a principled set of methodologies and statistical techniques that allow for the fitting of statistical models to data that have been pooled across multiple, independent samples. IDA offers a myriad of potential advantages including increased power, greater coverage of rare behaviors, more rigorous psychometric assessment of theoretical constructs, accelerated developmental time period under study, and enhanced reproducibility. However, IDA is not without limitations and may not be useful in a given application for a variety of reasons. The goal of this article is to describe the advantages and limitations of IDA in the study of individual development over time, particularly as it relates to trajectories of substance use. An empirical example of the measurement of polysubstance use is presented and this article concludes with recommendations for practice.

AB IMPORTANCE Bullying by peers has been associated with disordered eating behavior and symptoms of depression among adolescents as both an antecedent and an outcome. Identification of the temporal pattern of associations among bullying by peers, disordered eating behavior, and depression in adolescence is needed for the optimal targeting of intervention and prevention.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the concurrent and longitudinal associations among bullying by peers, disordered eating behavior, and symptoms of depression using a cascade model that controlled for within-time and across-time (ie, stability paths) associations while examining cross-lag effects.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this 5-year longitudinal cohort study, 612 participants of the McMaster Teen Study were included. This ongoing Canadian study examines the associations among bullying, mental health, and educational outcomes. Data collection began in 2008 when students were in grade 5 (10 years of age) and have since been collected annually. Data analysis was performed between August 20 and October 18, 2017.
   EXPOSURES Bullying by peers was assessed in grades 7 to 11 using a composite measure of 5 items.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Disordered eating behaviorwas assessed in grades 7 to 11 using the Short Screen for Eating Disorders, and depressive symptoms were assessed in grades 7 to 11 using the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition.
   RESULTS The 612 students included in the analytic sample had a mean age (SD) of 13.03 (0.38) years in grade 7; 331 (54.1%) were girls and 392 (71.1%) were white. Bullying by peers was concurrently associated with disordered eating behavior and depressive symptoms at every time point during the 5-year period (r range [SE], 0.15-0.48 [0.04-0.08]; P <.01). Disordered eating behavior was associated longitudinally with depressive symptoms at every time point (beta range [SE], 0.14-0.19 [0.06-0.08]; P <.02) and bullying by peers at 2 time points (beta range [SE], 0.12-0.22 [0.06-0.07]; P <.04) in girls and boys.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bullying by peers was proximally associated with multiple psychopathologic symptoms, whereas symptoms of disordered eating behavior were a key risk factor for future depressive symptoms and bullying by peers. Interventions aimed at reducing problematic eating behavior in adolescents may attenuate the risk of future depressive symptoms and relational problems.

AB This meta-analysis synthesizes the results of 14 independent studies conducted in the U.S. (N = 6979 participants) that examined sex differences in internalized, externalized, and PTSD symptoms associated with grief during adolescence. The mean age of participants was 12.22 years (SD = 2.31) with 50% male and 50% female sex assigned at birth. While no mean-level differences were found between adolescent females and males in externalizing behaviors associated with grief (d = 0.03), on average, females reported higher levels of internalized grief responses (d = 0.18) and higher levels of PTSD symptoms (d = 0.36) than their male counterparts. Findings suggest the need for additional, more nuanced research to investigate possible sex differences in externalized behaviors relating to grief. In addition, research should examine whether tailored therapeutic and intervention measures and resources are needed for adolescents experiencing internalized grief and PTSD symptoms given sex differences in these reactions.

AB Objective: This study documents the prevalence and impact of anxiety and depression in US children based on the parent report of health care provider diagnosis. Methods: National Survey of Children's Health data from 2003, 2007, and 2011-2012 were analyzed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety or depression among children aged 6 to 17 years. Estimates were based on the parent report of being told by a health care provider that their child had the specified condition. Sociodemographic characteristics, co-occurrence of other conditions, health care use, school measures, and parenting aggravation were estimated using 2011-2012 data. Results: Based on the parent report, lifetime diagnosis of anxiety or depression among children aged 6 to 17 years increased from 5.4% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2011-2012. Current anxiety or depression increased from 4.7% in 2007 to 5.3% in 2011-2012; current anxiety increased significantly, whereas current depression did not change. Anxiety and depression were associated with increased risk of co-occurring conditions, health care use, school problems, and having parents with high parenting aggravation. Children with anxiety or depression with effective care coordination or a medical home were less likely to have unmet health care needs or parents with high parenting aggravation. Conclusion: By parent report, more than 1 in 20 US children had current anxiety or depression in 2011-2012. Both were associated with significant comorbidity and impact on children and families. These findings may inform efforts to improve the health and well-being of children with internalizing disorders. Future research is needed to determine why child anxiety diagnoses seem to have increased from 2007 to 2012.

AB Cross-sectional studies support negative associations between children's skills in recognizing emotional expressions and their problem behaviors. Few studies have examined these associations over time, however, precluding our understanding of the direction of effects. Emotion recognition difficulties may contribute to the development of problem behaviors; additionally, problem behaviors may constrain the development of emotion recognition skill. The present study tested the bidirectional linkages between children's emotion recognition and teacher-reported problem behaviors in 1st and 3rd grade. Specifically, emotion recognition, hyperactivity, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors were assessed in 117 children in 1st grade and in 3rd grade. Results from fully cross-lagged path models revealed divergent developmental patterns: Controlling for concurrent levels of problem behaviors and first-grade receptive language skills, lower emotion recognition in 1st grade significantly predicted greater internalizing behaviors, but not hyperactivity or externalizing behaviors, in 3rd grade. Moreover, greater hyperactivity in 1st grade marginally predicted lower emotion recognition in 3rd grade, but internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not predictive of emotion recognition over time. Together, these findings extend previous research to identify specific developmental pathways, whereby emotion recognition difficulties contribute to the development of internalizing behaviors, and early hyperactivity may contribute to the development of emotion recognition difficulties, thus highlighting the importance of examining these processes and their mutual development over time.

AB The present study is the first to examine the psychometric properties of the self-report Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD-SR), and the predictive utility of its subscales for reoffending, among Australian juvenile offenders (N = 308, M age = 17.00, SD = 1.49). Exploratory factor analysis supported a modified three-factor structure in which four items loaded differently to prior studies. Total APSD-SR and modified subscale scores were positively associated with criminal history and mental health problems (e.g., internalizing and externalizing problems, alcohol and substance abuse/dependence). Survival analyses indicated that youth scoring high on the APSD-SR total score were faster to reoffend nonviolently (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.31, p = .0003) and violently (HR = 1.42, p = .0003) than those scoring low. Whereas the modified grandiose-manipulative subscale predicted faster time to nonviolent recidivism (HR = 1.18, p = .026) as a single predictor, when all subscales were simultaneously entered into the model only callous-unemotional (CU) traits and impulsivity predicted nonviolent recidivism (HR = 1.19, p = .026 and 1.22, p = .015, respectively), and only impulsivity predicted violent recidivism (HR = 1.26, p = .014). Findings inform current understanding of the relative contribution of adolescent psychopathy dimensions to designating a particularly high-risk group of Australian youth in custody.

AB The researchers examined differential outcomes related to two distinct motivations for withdrawal (preference for solitude and shyness) as well as the possibility that support from important others (mothers, fathers, and best friends) attenuate any such links. Adolescents (159 males, 171 females) reported on their motivations to withdraw, internalizing symptoms, and relationship quality in eighth grade, as well as their anxiety and depression in ninth grade. Using structural equation modeling, the authors found that maternal support weakened the association between shyness and internalizing problems; friend support weakened the association between preference for solitude and depression; and friend support strengthened the association between shyness and depression. Results suggest that shy adolescents may not derive the same benefits from supportive friendships as their typical peers.

AB This is the first systematic review of the literature on sleep and its relation to cognition and behaviour in preschool-aged children. In comparison with the literature focused on school-aged children, knowledge involving preschoolers is rather sparse. A total of 26 studies was included in this review, which revealed a high degree of heterogeneity regarding the type and means of measuring sleep variables and behavioural and cognitive variables, as well as the statistical methods employed. Amongst the 13 articles with the largest sample sizes (top 50% of the included studies, 12 different populations), 12 found that a higher quantity or quality of sleep was associated with better behavioural and/or cognitive outcomes. Results point to an association between sleep, behaviour and cognition as early as preschool years, but the strengths of associations reported in the articles were relatively small. Studies with a smaller sample size were less concordant. It is consistent with our findings that the strengths of association are small, and thus require large sample sizes to ensure statistical detection power. Different aspects of sleep were not associated with all cognitive or behavioural features in the same way, which underscores the need for specific measures rather than general ones such as sleep problems' or behaviour problems' to be able to decipher the relationships. There is also a need for large longitudinal studies using objective measures and accounting for confounding factors. The child's genotype has recently been shown to have a moderating role in the association between sleep and behaviour, and should be further explored.

AB Although exposure to natural disasters can lead to diverse mental health (MH) outcomes in youth, most child disaster MH research has focused on posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). To highlight the likelihood of other MH outcomes, we meta-analyzed studies that have examined other (non-PTSS) internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in youth exposed to natural disasters. We used PRISMA guidelines to systematically gather studies that have examined the association between natural disaster exposure and non-PTSS internalizing and/or externalizing problems in samples of children and adolescents. Analyses of random effects models of 62 studies examining non-PTSS internalizing problems and 26 studies examining externalizing problems showed exposure to natural disasters was significantly associated with non-PTSS internalizing, r(mean) = .18, k = 70, and externalizing problems, r(mean) = .08; k = 31, in youth. Moderator analyses revealed a stronger association between disaster exposure and non-PTSS internalizing problems in countries with a medium Human Development Index (HDI) ranking, r = .56, than in countries with high, r = .15, and very high, r = .16, HDI rankings. We also found a stronger association between disaster exposure and externalizing problems in countries with a medium HDI ranking, r = .54, versus high, r = .05, and very high, r = .04, HDI rankings, and based on parent, r = .16, compared to child, r = -.01, report. Results support the need for assessment of multiple postdisaster MH outcomes to inform comprehensive interventions. We also include a discussion of the state of the disaster MH research.

AB Adolescents who lack friends at school are at risk of internalizing difficulties. This study examined a social-cognitive mechanism underlying friendlessness and internalizing difficulties (i.e., depressive symptoms, social anxiety, low self-esteem). We tested whether perceived social threat (i.e., peer victimization, sense of unsafety, and peer misconduct) mediates the association between friendlessness and increased internalizing difficulties across middle school. Latent variable structural equation modeling was used to test the model among an ethnically diverse sample of 5,991 (52% female) adolescents. The results demonstrate that friendless sixth-grade students perceived their school environment as more threatening by seventh grade, which in turn, increased internalizing difficulties from sixth to eighth grade. Perceptions of threat also predicted friendlessness at the end of middle school.

AB Given adversity associated with discrimination, it is important to identify culturally relevant factors that may protect against its harmful effects. Using latent variable interactions, this study examined the moderating effects of cultural assets on the association between multiple types of discrimination and adolescents' adjustment. Participants included 174 seventh-and eighth-grade Latino adolescents (51% girls); majority were of Mexican origin. Peer discrimination was associated with higher internalizing symptoms, whereas cultural assets predicted higher academic motivation above and beyond racial-ethnic discrimination, demonstrating a promotive effect. Adolescents' Latino cultural assets also protected against higher levels of externalizing symptoms in the context of high peer discrimination and foreigner objectification. The discussion focuses on the conceptual and applied implications of these findings.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with an increased risk for school dropout. This study examined pathways from childhood adversity to school dropout through academic, behavioral, emotional, and social pathways. Data were collected prospectively from 728 adolescents and their caregivers who participated in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect and from child protective services records. Path analyses revealed a direct association between ACEs and dropout, as well as indirect effects through poor reading achievement and elevated externalizing problems. ACEs were associated with elevated internalizing problems, which were negatively associated with dropout. However, ACEs were not associated with peer influences. Implications of the identified mechanisms in the ACEs and school dropout association for future preventive interventions are discussed.

AB The present cross-sectional study aims to examine the relations between socioeconomic status (SES), parenting practices, and child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in Brazil. To achieve this aim, we begin by examining the factor structure of a parenting scale (the ACT scale) for use in the Brazilian context. Participants were 204 Brazilian mothers of 3-to 8-year-old children, who answered questionnaires about SES, parenting practices, and child behavior. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the ACT scale revealed three latent parenting practices in the Brazilian context: emotional and behavioral regulation, communication, and positive discipline. Results of the final structural equation model showed that lower socioeconomic status was directly related to higher levels of child internalizing behavior problems and more negative parenting practices in the communication and positive discipline domains. Although mothers' emotional and behavioral regulation was not related to socioeconomic status, it was negatively predictive of children's behavior problems. The findings provide evidence for the utility of the ACT scale for measuring three distinct dimensions of parenting practices in Brazil. Results also suggest nuanced relations between SES, parenting practices, and child behavior in this developing country context.

AB Family support initiatives aimed at guaranteeing children's rights and preserving the family are undergoing extensive diversification, to meet the specific needs and strengths of families. Child day-care initiatives constitute a novel approach in child welfare services, as a way to complement family service for at-risk families. They are delivered in a child-group format and follow a psycho-educational methodology. This study analyzed the impact of a novel child day-care program on children's quality of life, adjustment and development, and explored the moderating role of different child and family dimensions on the program's impact. For this purpose, we followed a pretest-posttest evaluation with a control group (N = 83). The results showed improvements in different facets of children's quality of life, as well as a positive impact in other adjustment and developmental dimensions, such as social skills, internalizing problems, and intelligence. Interaction effects were found between internalizing problems and children's sex, and between academic competence and family risk level. In conclusion, this article brings the first wave of evidence about the effectiveness of child day-care programs for supporting at-risk children from a preservation approach. Practical implications for child welfare services are discussed.

AB The stepfamily literature is replete with between-group analyses by which youth residing in stepfamilies are compared to youth in other family structures across indicators of adjustment and well-being. Few longitudinal studies examine variation in stepfamily functioning to identify factors that promote the positive adjustment of stepchildren over time. Using a longitudinal sample of 191 stepchildren (56% female, mean age = 11.3 years), the current study examines the association between the relationship quality of three central stepfamily dyads (stepparent-child, parent-child, and stepcouple) and children's internalizing and externalizing problems concurrently and over time. Results from path analyses indicate that higher levels of parent-child affective quality are associated with lower levels of children's concurrent internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 1. Higher levels of stepparent-child affective quality are associated with decreases in children's internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 2 (6 months beyond baseline), even after controlling for children's internalizing and externalizing problems at Wave 1 and other covariates. The stepcouple relationship was not directly linked to youth outcomes. Our findings provide implications for future research and practice.

AB Individuals in communities who are exposed to violence are at a greater risk for internalizing and externalizing the effects of violence. This study investigated protective and risk factors in relation to community violence exposure (CVE) and violent behaviors in a sample of Hmong American young adults. Specifically, this study investigated the moderating roles of ethnic identity, parental support, and gender in the relationship between CVE and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in 184 Hmong American young adults between the ages of 18 and 30 years. Results showed that participants reporting higher CVE also reported higher internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, results demonstrated that ethnic identity, gender, and parental support moderated the relationship between CVE and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in our Hmong American participants. Implications for research on Asian Americans and Hmong Americans and community-based research approaches are discussed.

AB Worldwide one in three women report intimate partner violence. Many of these women report long term mental health problems, especially PTSD, which is associated with negative problem solving, isolation, somatization, depression, and anxiety. Children are impacted by their exposure to domestic violence and experience internal (i.e., depression, anxiety) and external (i.e., hostility, delinquency) behavioral clinical problems. To predict which women will experience chronic PTSD symptoms, a PTSD predictor tool was developed and applied to PTSD symptom scores four years after 300 mothers with children (age 18 months to 16 years) received assistance for the violence. At four years, 266 (89%) of the 300 mother child dyads were retained. Of those, 245 met inclusion criteria for this study and 53% had scores above the clinical threshold for PTSD. The predictor tool performed well. There was a significant association, chi(2) (4) = 11.83, p =.019, Cramer's V = 0.229, between mothers predicted at low/some risk for chronic PTSD and scoring below the cut-off score for diagnostic PTSD symptoms at four years. Mothers predicted to be at extreme risk for chronic PTSD reported PTSD symptoms at or above the diagnostic level at 48 months. Children whose mothers had PTSD were at greater risk for Borderline/Clinical range behavioral problems compared to children whose mothers did not have PTSD. Relative risk values ranged from 2.07 (Externalizing) to 2.30 (Internalizing). When appropriate interventions are available, the PTSD predictor tool can assist with triage and guided referral of women at risk for chronic PTSD.

   SYMPTOMS
AB BackgroundChildren with asthma and atopic diseases have an increased risk of depression or anxiety. Each of these diseases has strong genetic and environmental components; therefore, it seems likely that there is a shared liability rather than causative risk.
   ObjectiveTo investigate the existence and nature of familial aggregation for the comorbidity of atopic diseases and depression or anxiety.
   MethodsParticipants came from the Childhood and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS), n = 14 197. Current and ever asthma, eczema, hay fever and food allergy were reported by parents. Internalizing disorders were identified using validated questionnaires. Familial co-aggregation analysis compared monozygotic (MZ) twins and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins for atopic disease in 1 twin with internalizing disorder in the other to test for genetic liability. Several familial liability candidates were also tested including parental education, recent maternal psychological stress, childhood family trauma and parental country of birth.
   ResultsFamilial co-aggregation analysis found that if 1 twin had at least 1 current atopic disease the partner twin was at risk of having an internalizing disorder regardless of their own atopic status (adjusted OR 1.22 (95% CI 1.08, 1.37). Similar results were found for each atopic disease ever and current. MZ associations were not higher than DZ associations, suggesting that the liability is not genetic in nature. Including other familial candidates to the models made little difference to effect estimates.
   Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceAtopic diseases and depression or anxiety tend to occur together in families; therefore, when treating for 1 disease, the physician should consider comorbidity in both the individual and the individual's siblings. We did not find evidence to support a genetic explanation for comorbidity, and further exploration is needed to disentangle the environmental and epigenetic reasons for familial aggregation.

AB Background: Dropout from secondary education is a major concern in many Western countries because it is associated with later adverse consequences at the individual and societal level. Efforts have thus been made to identify precursors for dropout. The aim of the study was to examine the risk for not finishing secondary education by age 20 when mental health problems were diagnosed during general practitioner (GP) consultations. Methods: National registries were linked to assess the association between GP-diagnosed internalizing and externalizing problems from the ages of 15-20 years and school dropout in a sample of 63 970 Norwegians, adjusting for health and social background factors. Relative risks (RR) were estimated by Poisson regression. Results: Dropout was bivariately related to both internalizing (RR = 2.2 among girls and 1.7 among boys) and externalizing problems (RR = 2.7 for girls and 2.0 for boys), though the associations were somewhat attenuated in the adjusted analyses. After controlling for somatic comorbidity and parent education level, the absolute risk for not fulfilling secondary education by age 20 was 43% among girls and 60% among boys with internalizing problems and approximately 15% points higher with externalizing problems. The highest absolute risk for dropout was found for boys and girls who have both externalizing and internalizing problems. However, with some overlap in the confidence intervals, the added impact of internalizing problems when added to externalizing problems is uncertain. Conclusions: Intervention for mental health problems by a GP could benefit adolescent education outcomes and mental well-being.

AB Background: Mental health problems among youth have increased in Sweden in recent decades, as has competition in higher education and the labour market. It is unknown whether the increasing emphasis put on educational achievement might negatively affect adolescents' mental health. We aimed to investigate the relationship between adolescents' academic aspirations and expectations and the risk of mental health problems. Methods: We studied 3343 Swedish 7th grade adolescents (age 13), who participated in the first two waves of the KUPOL longitudinal study; participants answered a questionnaire encompassing the five-item Future Aspirations and Goals (FG) subscale of the Student Engagement Instrument, two questions about their own academic aspirations and expectations and two mental health instruments: the Center for Epidemiological studies for Children (CES-DC) (alpha = .90) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (alpha = .78). The association between aspirations and expectations at baseline and mental health at follow-up was analysed using logistic regression models adjusting for baseline mental health, socio-demographic and family factors. Results: The FG subscale was inversely and linearly associated with the odds of high CES-DC score [adjusted OR (odds ratio) 0.71, 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.59-0.86], total Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire score (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49-0.71), and its internalizing (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.84) and externalizing problems scores (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.71). Conclusions: Adolescents with high individual academic aspirations have less mental health problems at 1-year follow-up. Future studies should investigate whether interventions aimed at increasing aspirations and engagement in school may prevent mental health problems in adolescence.

AB Background: Although the association between somatic complaints and internalizing problems (anxiety, somatic anxiety and depression) is well established, it remains unclear whether the pattern of this relationship differs by gender and in different cultures. The aim of this study was to examine cross-cultural and gender-specific differences in the association between somatic complaints and internalizing problems in youth from the Czech Republic and Russia. Methods: The Social and Health Assessment, a self-report survey, was completed by representative community samples of adolescents, age 12-17 years, from the Czech Republic (N = 4770) and Russia (N = 2728). Results: A strong association was observed between somatic complaints and internalizing psychopathology. Although the levels of internalizing problems differed by country and gender, they increased together with and largely in a similar way to somatic complaints for boys and girls in both countries. Conclusion: The association between somatic symptoms and internalizing problems seems to be similar for boys and girls across cultures.

AB Using a longitudinal, cross-lagged design, this study examined the bidirectional relations between mothers' and fathers' sensitivity and children's externalizing (EXT) and internalizing (INT) behavior from middle childhood into adolescence. The subsample comprised families (N = 578) in which the mother and father cohabitated from the study's first time point (child age = 54 months) through Age 15 in the longitudinal NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Study results revealed differential patterns for mother-child and father-child relations in the full sample and separately for males and females. The full cross-lagged models revealed that child EXT behavior predicted maternal sensitivity, but not vice versa, and fathers' sensitivity and child behavior were reciprocally interrelated. There was a significant indirect pathway from early paternal sensitivity to later EXT in males, and from early maternal sensitivity to INT in females. The results point to the important roles that fathers play in child INT and EXT behaviors and important differences between males and females.

AB Problem behaviors are of increasing public health concern. Twin studies have revealed substantial genetic and environmental influences on children's behavior, and examining birth-weight difference could allow the identification of the specific contribution of multiple non-shared prenatal environmental factors. The Twins and Multiple Births Association Heritability Study, a UK, volunteer-based study, recruited mothers of twins aged 18 months to 5 years; 960 twins (480 pairs) were included in the analysis. Twins' mothers answered questions relative to their pregnancy and their twins' characteristics, and completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 11/2-5. The association between the absolute birth-weight difference and each CBCL scale's score difference was analyzed by means of multiple linear regressions. Expected mean CBCL score differences were calculated. In monozygotic (MZ) twins, statistically and clinically significant associations were found between intrapair birth-weight difference and difference in total problems, internalizing problems, and emotional reactiveness. No significant results were observed neither in dizygotic (DZ) twins when analyzed as a separate group nor in MZ and DZ twins combined. The results of the present study suggest that with increasing the absolute birth-weight difference, the intrapair difference in total problems, internalizing behaviors and emotionality increases, with smaller twins being at major risk for later behavior problems. Moreover, these results suggest a causal association between birth weight and behavior development.

AB The objective of this study is to examine the trajectory of internalizing problems across middle childhood among a population sample of Australian children, and to understand the timing of explanatory factors related to children's development of internalizing problems, by using multiple-indicator latent growth curve modeling. Participants were children, parents, and teachers in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) Kindergarten (K) cohort (n = 3,153). Mothers reported on children's internalizing problems at 3 time points (6-7, 8-9, and 10-11 years). Explanatory factors included gender, emotional regulation skills, externalizing problems, peer relationships, parenting behaviors, socioeconomic status, and maternal mental health reported by mothers and teachers at 2 time points (4-5 years and 6-7 years). Growth modeling identified an increasing trajectory of internalizing problems over time. Initial levels were predicted by concurrent (6-7 years) emotional dysregulation, externalizing problems, angry parenting, and maternal mental health problems, as well as earlier (4-5 years) peer problems and maternal mental health. Escalation in internalizing problems was predicted by externalizing problems, peer problems, maternal mental health at 4-5 years, and emotional dysregulation and peer problems at 6-7 years. Girls had both higher initial levels and faster escalation of internalizing problems than boys. The findings provide ecological and developmental evidence and insights for effective intervention. Identifying and addressing early problems with peers may be particularly important to avoid the risk of escalating internalizing problems. Professional development sessions for educators to promote and support children's emotional regulation and peer interaction skills are likely to have a positive impact on children's well-being.

AB Purpose of reviewThe current article reviews recent research (from 2016 onward) on drinking behaviors and alcohol-related problems among young people in Asia with an emphasis on population-based evidence.Recent findingsRecent evidence concerning underage drinking in Asia was limited to certain countries and societies with most data derived from cross-sectional surveys. Measures of alcohol drinking or problems were less sophisticated. The prevalence of recent alcohol drinking varies widely with the highest estimates reported in Hong Kong and Korea (approximate to 21%). Certain emotional, behavioral, and cognitive characteristics have been linked with increased drinking behaviors, including internalizing or externalizing problems. Parents (or family) are the most studied predictors within the domain of socioenvironmental characteristics, whereas little attention has been paid to the macro environments (e.g., media, alcohol advertisement, and alcohol control policy/regulations).SummaryResearch on underage drinking behaviors in Asia is urgently needed, particularly in some emerging markets. Follow-up studies with longitudinal measurements and large diverse samples will provide a better understanding of developmental stage-dependent and ever-changing macroenvironmental factors, as well as possible mechanisms.

AB This study examined the associations between executive functioning problems, emotion regulation difficulties, and risk for perpetrating child physical abuse (CPA). It was hypothesized that: (a) poor executive functions (i.e., working memory problems and inhibition/switching problems) would be associated with higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties and CPA risk; (b) emotion regulation difficulties would be positively associated with CPA risk; and (c) emotion regulation difficulties would partially explain the association between executive functions (i.e., working memory problems and inhibition/switching problems) and CPA risk. To examine these predictions, a sample of 133 general population parents (31% fathers) completed self-report measures of CPA risk, emotion regulation difficulties, working memory problems, and a performance-based measure of inhibition/switching skills. Results revealed that executive functioning problems were linked with emotion regulation difficulties, which in turn were associated with CPA risk. Moreover, emotion regulation difficulties explained the relationship between executive functions (working memory, inhibition/switching) and CPA risk. The final model accounted for 41% of the variance in CPA risk. Although additional research is needed, the present findings suggest that enhancing parents' executive functioning and teaching them effective emotion regulation skills may be important targets for CPA prevention efforts.

AB Previous research has revealed a large prevalence of trauma experienced by children, creating high risk for the development of psychopathology. Research investigating the negative impacts of child maltreatment and other traumas has typically examined these experiences individually, controlling for co-occurring traumas, or has combined these experiences into a general variable of risk, thereby obscuring the complex relationships among environmental traumas and maltreatment. The current study expands on previous research by elucidating relationships between multiple contexts of overlapping traumas and maltreatment experienced by children, and by categorizing how these experiences join together to impact internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Participants included 316 maltreated children and 269 nonmaltreated children (M age = 9.4, SD = 0.88) who attended a summer day camp research program for low-income children. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified three differential patterns of trauma exposure across children: 1) community violence and loss; 2) pervasive trauma; and 3) low trauma. Covariate analyses demonstrated that child maltreatment was significantly associated with class membership, suggesting that maltreated children were more likely to experience diverse traumas extending beyond their maltreatment experiences (pervasive trauma class). A two-way analysis of variance also demonstrated that trauma latent class membership and child maltreatment each represented unique predictors of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with each having an independent effect on symptomatology. This investigation provides unique insight into the differential impact of patterns of trauma exposure and child maltreatment, providing support for further research and clinical practice addressing multiple levels of a child's ecology.

AB Childhood maltreatment is a key predictor of mental health problems across the life span. Yet, how maltreatment types independently and jointly influence the risk for psychiatric problems remains unclear. The aim of the study was two-fold: first, to replicate recent findings regarding the impact of maltreatment types on youth psychiatric symptoms, based on a Brazilian sample of high-risk adolescents (n = 347; age range = 11-17 yrs), and second, to extend existing findings by examining whether this relationship is mediated by bullying victimization and/or perpetration. Measures included self-report ratings of childhood maltreatment and peer victimization, as well as multi-informant reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Consistent with prior research, we found that: (i) maltreatment types often co-occurred; (ii) there was a linear association between number of maltreatment types experienced and symptom severity (i.e. cumulative effect); and (iii) emotional abuse emerged as the most consistent independent predictor of poor mental health across domains, raters, and gender. Additionally, this study extends previous findings by showing that the influence of maltreatment on psychiatric outcomes is partially mediated by peer victimization, but not by bullying perpetration. In conclusion, these findings expand our understanding of the heterogeneity in individual responses to maltreatment as well as highlighting emotional abuse as an important predictor of poor mental health.

AB Worldwide, approximately one in eight children or adolescents suffers from a mental disorder. The present study was designed to determine the self-reported prevalence of mental health problems in children aged 6-11 years across eight European countries including Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. Data were drawn from 6245 children participating in the School Children Mental Health in Europe (SCHME) study and a large cross-sectional survey in France. Self-reported child mental health was assessed using the Dominique Interactive (DI). Overall, 22.0% of children were identified per their own evaluation as having at least one mental disorder, ranging from 16.4% in the Netherlands to 27.9% in Bulgaria. The prevalence of internalizing disorders was 18.4% across countries and ranged from 11.8% in the Netherlands to 24.3% in Turkey. The prevalence of externalizing disorders was lower with an average of 7.8%, ranging from 3.5% in Turkey to 10.5% in Bulgaria. Combining samples across European countries, 1 in 5 children reported internalizing problems and 1 in 12 children externalizing problems. The net completion rates of 4.1-74.3% preclude conclusions about national differences in prevalence rates.

AB Background: Recent research indicates that the best-fitting structural model of psychopathology includes a general factor capturing comorbidity (p) and several more specific, orthogonal factors. Little is known about the stability of these factors, although two opposing developmental processes have been proposed: dynamic mutualism suggests that symptom-level interaction and reinforcement may lead to a strengthening of comorbidity (p) over time, whereas p-differentiation suggests a general vulnerability to psychopathology that gives way to increasingly distinct patterns of symptoms over time. In order to test both processes, we examine two forms of developmental stability from ages 2 to 14years: strength (i.e., consistency in the amount of variance explained by general and specific factors) and phenotypic stability (i.e., homotypic and heterotypic continuity). Methods: Data are from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed nine times between ages 2 and 14years (n = 1,253) using the Child Behavior Checklist completed by mothers. Confirmatory bifactor modeling was used to test structural models of psychopathology at each age. Consistency in strength was examined by calculating the Explained Common Variance (ECV) and phenotypic stability was investigated with cross-lagged modeling of the general and specific factors. Results: Bifactor models fit the data well across this developmental period. ECV values were reasonably consistent across development, with the general factor accounting for the majority of shared variance (61%-71%). Evidence of both homotypic and heterotypic continuity emerged, with most heterotypic continuity involving the general factor, as it both predicted and was predicted by specific factors. Conclusions: A bifactor model effectively captures psychopathological comorbidity from early childhood through adolescence. The longitudinal associations between the general and specific factors provide evidence for both the hypothesized processes (dynamic mutualism and p-differentiation) occurring through development.

AB Self-compassion has been consistently linked to psychological well-being. The ability to be self-compassionate may be shaped by early attachment experiences and associated with interpersonal difficulties. However, evidence has yet to be extended to clinical populations. This study examined the role of self-compassion and its relationship with attachment and interpersonal problems in clinical patients with anxiety and depression. Participants (N = 74; 60% female, mean age 40 years) were recruited from a primary care psychological therapies service in Scotland, UK. Participants completed four self-report questionnaires assessing self-compassion, attachment, interpersonal problems and emotional distress (including depression and anxiety). Low self-compassion, attachment-related avoidance (but not attachment-related anxiety) and high interpersonal problems were all associated with higher levels of emotional distress and anxiety. Low self-compassion and high interpersonal problems were predicted by attachment-related avoidance. Self-compassion mediated the relationship between attachment-related avoidance and emotional distress and anxiety. This was a cross-sectional design and therefore a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn regarding causal relationships between these variables. Self-reported questionnaires were subject to response bias. This study has extended the evidence base regarding the role of self-compassion in patients with clinical levels of depression and anxiety. Notably, our findings indicated that self-compassion may be a particularly important construct, both theoretically and clinically, in understanding psychological distress amongst those with higher levels of attachment avoidance. This study supports the development and practice of psychotherapeutic approaches, such as compassion-focused therapy for which there is a growing evidence base.

AB Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) persists into adulthood in over 50% of cases, although its associated symptom profiles, comorbid problems, and neuropsychological deficits change substantially across development. Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms may contribute to associations between ADHD and comorbid problems and may partially explain the substantial heterogeneity observed in its correlates. 349 adults aged 18-38 years (M = 23.2, SD = 4.5, 54.7% male, 61.03% with ADHD) completed a multi-informant diagnostic procedure and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Adults with ADHD (n = 213) were retained for analyses. Latent class analyses (LCA) revealed three profiles of SCT symptoms among those with ADHD, which we classified as minimal, moderate, or severe SCT. Multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed significant differences among these profiles, which remained when controlling for persistence of ADHD symptoms and sex. In general, adults with ADHD combined with SCT symptoms (moderate and severe) had significantly more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and persistent inattention, and had more severe professional and relational impairment compared to ADHD adults without SCT. Compared to those with moderate or minimal SCT symptoms, the severe SCT group had the most symptoms of depression and internalizing disorders, and the most impairment in the domain of daily responsibility. No significant differences based on externalizing symptoms emerged when controlling for sex and persistence of inattention symptoms, suggesting the moderate and severe SCT groups do not simply reflect more symptoms. Moreover, follow-up mediation analyses revealed that SCT might at least partially explain the heterogeneity in ADHD. Findings have implications for refinement of etiological conceptualization, assessment methods, and intervention strategies.

AB Residential care is among the most intensive forms of treatment in youth care. It serves youths with severe behavioral problems and is primarily focused on targeting externalizing problems. Despite best efforts, effect sizes remain moderate, which may be due to the disregarding of internalizing symptoms - in particular anxiety - and to limitations regarding the delivery model of interventions. This initial randomized controlled trial (n = 37) aimed to examine the effectiveness of a biofeedback videogame intervention (Dojo) as an addition to treatment as usual for youths with and without intellectual disability (ID) in residential care with clinical levels of anxiety and externalizing problems. Dojo targets both anxiety and externalizing problems, and incorporates the principles of conventional treatment, while addressing its limitations. Youths were randomly assigned to play Dojo (eight 30-min gameplay sessions) or to treatment as usual (TAU). Measurements of anxiety and externalizing problems were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 4-months follow-up through youths' self-report and mentor-report. Completers-only analyses revealed decreases in self-reported anxiety and externalizing problems, and mentor-reported anxiety at posttreatment for participants in the Dojo condition compared to the control condition. Only mentor-reported anxiety was maintained at follow-up. No effect was found for mentor-reported externalizing problems. These findings provided preliminary evidence that Dojo is a promising, innovative intervention that engages high-risk youths. Practical implications are discussed.

AB The goals of this study were to examine: (a) bidirectional associations between maternal parenting (physical punishment and guilt induction) and Chinese American preschool children's psychosocial adjustment and (b) the role of maternal cultural orientation and child temperament in moderating parenting effects. Participants were Chinese American mothers and children (N = 163, M-age = 4.56, 53% boys). Mothers reported on their parenting practices at both Wave 1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2) and their cultural orientations and children's inhibitory control at W1. Teachers rated children's prosocial, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors at both W1 and W2. A Bayesian approach to path analysis was utilized to investigate how parenting, child inhibitory control, and maternal cultural orientations work together to predict the development of children's prosociality and psychosocial problems. Results showed that for Chinese immigrant mothers who were highly acculturated toward the American culture and for children with low levels of inhibitory control, maternal use of physical punishment predicted more externalizing problems in children. Child inhibitory control and maternal enculturation were directly associated with less W2 child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Moreover, physical punishment predicted more internalizing behavior, whereas guilt induction predicted less child internalizing behavior. Maternal guilt induction also prospectively predicted more prosocial behavior but only for children with low levels of inhibitory control. Finally, only one child effect was significant: More W1 internalizing behavior predicted less W2 physical punishment. These effects held after controlling for temporal stabilities of the constructs and demographic covariates. Findings are discussed within the cultural context of the study.

Participants were 4th to 6th grade students (M-age = 11 years) in China (n = 593 and 443 for the rural and urban samples) and Canada (n = 325). A self-report measure of social sensitivity was developed for the study. In addition to data on social sensitivity, information on adjustment was obtained from multiple sources. The analyses revealed that social sensitivity was associated with positive adjustment in rural Chinese children but with adjustment problems in Canadian children. The relations were largely mixed and nonsignificant in urban Chinese children. These results indicate the role of context in defining the functional meaning of children's social sensitivity.

AB Early pubertal timing is associated with internalizing and externalizing problems during adolescence. However, few studies explicitly test whether early puberty is especially problematic for those with pre-existing problems (i.e., accentuation) and little is known about whether the negative correlates of early pubertal timing persist past young adulthood. We address these questions using longitudinal data from up to 451 participants in the Iowa Youth and Families project (e.g., Ge, Conger, & Elder, 1996, 2001). We replicated and extended previous results reported for this sample during adolescence (e.g., early maturing boys and girls reported more substance use) and found some evidence for accentuation in adolescence for psychological distress and substance use. However, correlations between early puberty and adult outcomes assessed up to two decades later were largely indistinguishable from zero including attenuation effects. These results suggest that any negative correlates of early pubertal timing are attenuated by the fourth decade of life.

AB This study identified profiles of internalizing (anxiety and depression) and externalizing (delinquency and violence against peers) symptoms among bullying victims and examined associations between bullying victimization characteristics and profile membership. The sample consisted of 1196 bullying victims in grades 8-10 (M-age = 14.4, SD = 1.01) who participated in The Context Study in three North Carolina counties in Fall 2003. Five profiles were identified using latent profile analysis: an asymptomatic profile and four profiles capturing combinations of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Associations between bullying characteristics and membership in symptom profiles were tested using multinomial logistic regression. More frequent victimization increased odds of membership in the two high internalizing profiles compared to the asymptomatic profile. Across all multinomial logistic regression models, when the high internalizing, high externalizing profile was the reference category, adolescents who received any type of bullying (direct, indirect, or dual) were more likely to be in this category than any others.

AB This study examined the associations between friend conflict, defined as arguments with friends, and affective states using a daily diary design in a community sample of adolescents. Participants were 100 U.S. adolescents (13-17 years; 40% girls; 79% white). Adolescents completed an online survey on 14 consecutive evenings. Adolescents reported significantly higher anger/hostility, confusion, and tension/anxiety and less friendliness on days during which they experienced friend conflict relative to no-conflict days. However, no same-day associations for depressed affect, fatigue, or vigor were found. Adolescents experiencing friend conflict reported increased next-day anger/hostility, depressed affect, and tension/anxiety, but not other affective states. Higher levels of anger/hostility and depressed affect predicted an increased likelihood of next day friend conflict. Conversely, higher levels of friendliness and vigor predicted a decreased likelihood of next-day friend conflict. These findings suggest that directional relationships between adolescents' friend conflicts and their affective states vary by affective domain.

AB Objective: This study investigated the role of perceived social support in promoting emotional well-being among children with ADHD. Specifically, it examined how children with ADHD perceive support from key individuals in their lives and the relationships between this support and aspects of emotional well-being. Main versus buffering models of social support in the context of social preference status were also explored. Method: Participants were 55 school-age children with ADHD-combined or hyperactive/impulsive (ADHD-C/HI). Parent and child ratings evaluated source-specific social support, social status, and aspects of self-concept, anxiety, and depression. Results: Children with ADHD reported lower social support than normative samples. Social support had moderate positive associations with self-concept, with source-specific differences, but was not associated with internalizing symptoms. Regression models with social preference status supported a main effect model of perceived social support. Conclusion: Social support may provide a target for resilience-based interventions among children with ADHD in promoting their self-concept and well-being.

AB Background: Mental health problems and sleep disturbance are prevalent in adolescents. Intrafamily conflict has been found to be associated with mental health problems and sleep disturbance in adolescents. This study examined the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the effect of intrafamily conflict on mental health problems.
   Method: Participants were 11,831 adolescent students who participated in the baseline survey of the Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and reported demographics, behavioral and emotional problems, and sleep disturbance. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the mediating effects of sleep disturbance on the association between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems, including internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems.
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 15 years (SD = 1.46) and 50.9% were males. After controlling for family demographic factors, adolescent age and sex, intrafamily conflict had significant effects on mental health problems (standardized regression coefficient = 0.28, SE = 0.009, p < 0.001) and sleep disturbance (standardized regression coefficient = 0.15, SE = 0.010, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance significantly mediated the association between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems (standardized indirect effect = 0.05, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbance had significant mediating effects on the relationship between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. The findings suggested that family-centered programs should include sleep disturbance intervention for preventing adolescent mental health problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Emotional and Behavioral Screener (EBS) is a recently developed teacher-reported brief screening instrument for identifying students who are at-risk of an emotional or behavioral disorder (EBD). Although prior research supports the technical adequacy of scores from the EBS, there is a gap in the literature regarding strong evidence of the factor structure underlying EBS scores. This study investigated the latent structure of scores from the EBS in a sample of 646 elementary students who were rated by their teachers in a 2-week screening period. Single-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and bifactor models were used to test the hypothesis that EBS scores are a measure of both overall emotional and behavioral risk and students' externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results supported a bifactor structure, in that scores from the EBS can be considered to represent a general factor (i.e., risk of EBD) and two group factors (i.e., externalizing and internalizing domains). Findings have implications for interpreting scores when using the EBS as a universal screener for the risk of EBD.

AB Background. Individual differences in neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness are associated with, and may predict onset of, internalizing disorders. These general traits can be parsed into facets, but there is a surprising paucity of research on facet risk for internalizing disorders. We examined general traits and facets of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness in predicting first onsets of depressive and anxiety disorders.
   Methods. A community sample of 550 adolescent females completed general and facet-level personality measures and diagnostic interviews. Interviews were re-administered 18 months later.
   Results. First onsets of depressive disorders were predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness. Facets predicting first onset of depression included depressivity (neuroticism facet) and lower positive emotionality and sociability (extraversion facets). First onsets of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were predicted by neuroticism, and particularly the facet of anxiousness. First onsets of social phobia were predicted at the facet level by anxiousness. First onsets of specific phobia were predicted by neuroticism, low conscientiousness, and all neuroticism facets. In multivariate analyses, first onsets of depression were uniquely predicted by depressivity, and onsets of GAD and social phobia were uniquely predicted by anxiousness over and above the general trait of neuroticism.
   Conclusions. General traits predict first onsets of depressive and anxiety disorders. In addition, more specific associations are evident at the facet level. Facets can refine our understanding of the links between personality and psychopathology risk, and provide finer-grained targets for personality-informed interventions.

AB The present study was aimed at verifying whether the presence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) affects executive functions in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two groups of children with ADHD were selected for the study according to the presence or absence of GAD. The first group of 28 children with ADHD with GAD (mean age: 9 +/- 1.2; males/females: 24/4) was matched for gender, age, IQ, psychiatric comorbidity with a second group of 29 children with ADHD without GAD (mean age: 8.8 +/- 0.7; males/females: 26/3). The two groups with ADHD were compared to 28 typically developing children (mean age: 8.3 +/- 1.3; males/females: 23/5) on different measures involving processes especially important in inhibitory control such as rule maintenance, stimulus detection, action selection and action execution. Our results indicated that, differently from children with ADHD with GAD, only the group with ADHD without GAD showed a deficit in inhibitory control. Comorbid subgroups should be differentiated, especially, to develop specific and efficient therapeutic interventions in ADHD.

AB Shame proneness (i.e., experiencing shame in a trait-like manner) and internalizing shame coping styles (e.g., withdrawing/attacking one's self when feeling shame) predict distress, psychopathology, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among emerging adults. Parental invalidation is instrumental in the development of both maladaptive shame and NSSI. In this study, we proposed that shame proneness and internalized shame coping would link perceived parental invalidation and psychological distress to NSSI functions among emerging adults. A sample of 384 Australian emerging adults with a history of NSSI (M age = 20.7 years, SD = 2.25; 81.3% female, 61.2% Caucasian) completed online self-reports assessing the relevant constructs. Hypothesized indirect effects through shame proneness and internalized shame coping were supported when participants reported using NSSI for intrapersonal (e.g., self-punishment), but not interpersonal (e.g., signaling autonomy), functions. Findings advance theories on why some young people engage in NSSI and implicate perceived parental invalidation and shame as potential clinical targets for NSSI. warranting further research.

AB We used a multigroup propensity score approach to evaluate a randomized effectiveness trial of the New Beginnings Program (NBP), an intervention targeting divorced or separated families. Two features of effectiveness trials, high nonattendance rates and inclusion of an active control, make program effects harder to detect. To estimate program effects based on actual intervention participation, we created a synthetic inactive control comprised of nonattenders and assessed the impact of attending the NBP or active control relative to no intervention (inactive control). We estimated propensity scores using generalized boosted models and applied inverse probability of treatment weighting for the comparisons. Relative to the inactive control, NBP strengthened parenting quality as well as reduced child exposure to interparental conflict, parent psychological distress, and child internalizing problems. Some effects were moderated by parent gender, parent ethnicity, or child age. On the other hand, the effects of active versus inactive control were minimal for parenting and in the unexpected direction for child internalizing problems. Findings from the propensity score approach complement and enhance the interpretation of findings from the intention-to-treat approach.

AB Purpose The aim was to investigate social competence and behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents born with CDH.
   Methods All children born with CDH, treated in Stockholm 1990-2009, were invited to participate. After written consent, the Child Behavior Checklist or Adult Self-Report questionnaires were sent to participants. Of the 145 long-term survivors, 51% returned a completed questionnaire. Both the syndrome and competence scales were used and open-ended questions were analyzed with manifest content analysis.
   Results All parents of children aged 1.5-5 years and 90% of parents of children aged 6-18 years reported a normal range on the syndrome scale. Five parents indicated internalizing, but none externalizing behavior. All young adults achieved a normal score on the syndrome scale. Eighty-five percent had normal school achievement, 79% had normal social scores and 40% had normal activity levels. Significantly fewer boys (23%) were in the normal activity range compared with 67% of girls.
   Conclusion The vast majority of all parents of children born with CDH scored no behavioral or emotional problems, furthermore, they reported normal social and school competence. However, the activity levels seemed to be reduced in children born with CDH.

AB Although it is known some youth access mental health services more readily than others, most service use studies used variable-centric approaches that produced heterogeneous groups and results that require parents and educators to understand diagnostic categories. Person-centered approaches group youth with similar patterns of behavioral and mental health concerns and thus are more homogenous and comparable to the presentation of behavioral and mental health problems noticed by parents and educators, who most typically facilitate access to care for those youth in need. We examined the behavioral and mental health symptom profiles, demographic characteristics and service use histories of youth referred for intervention in a multi-state, randomized controlled trial intervening in severe emotional/behavioral problems (n = 647; Kern et al. in Educ Treat Child 34(4):593-617, 2011). Latent profile analysis of parent-reported hyperactivity, aggression, and conduct, and adolescent-reported anxiety and depression on a broadband measure of student emotional and behavioral functioning was conducted. Model fit indices and theoretical interpretation supported five latent profiles; Class 1 showed severe externalizing behavior problems (7.18%, n = 45), Class 2 showed normative behaviors (37.78%, n = 237), Class 3 showed elevated internalizing behavior problems (12.76%, n = 80), Class 4 showed elevated externalizing behavior problems (33.01%, n = 207), and Class 5 showed elevated internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (9.25%, n = 58). We detected demographic and service use history difference between these profiles using multinomial logistic regression. Findings are discussed in relation to improving children's mental health services, including universal screening, training emphasizing recognition and concern for internalizing behavior problems, and increased availability of mental health professionals in school settings.

AB Despite promising evidence that school-based health centers (SBHCs) and school mental health (SMH) services can reduce disparities in access to mental health care for underserved populations, little is known about what predicts retention of youth in SMH services. This study aimed to identify individual- and school-level factors associated with access and retention in mental health services provided in SBHCs. Existing data were analyzed for 17,348 students (2205 who received SMH services) who attended 17 middle and high schools in an urban school district. Student-level predictors included sex, race/ethnicity, and mental health need at intake. School-level predictors included grade level (middle vs. high school), student/teacher ratio, percent of white students, and percent of students receiving free or reduced lunch. Hierarchical generalized linear modeling was used to examine the association between student- and school-level variables and retention in care. White, Latino, and Asian students were less likely to access SMH services; multiracial and Native American students were more likely to access services, and African-American students were no more or less likely. Hierarchical models found that retention in services was more likely for female students, those who presented with social/educational problems, internalizing problems, and trauma/abuse/neglect, and less likely for Asian students. Retention was also more likely for students in middle schools, schools with a lower student/teacher ratio, and schools with a smaller percentage of students eligible for free or reduced lunch. While SMH services show promise in increasing access for underserved groups, ensuring equitable retention of students in care will likely require concerted effort focused on consistently engaging students and ensuring quality of care.

AB Thirty patients aged 11 to 21 years presenting in an adolescent medicine clinic received a one-time stress management intervention. The intervention included psychoeducation on the effect stress has on the body and the positive benefits of exercise, diaphragmatic breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation. The intervention also included use of a biofeedback game to aid in relaxation. Analyses revealed an association between higher levels of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress. A clinically significant decrease in subjective distress was endorsed at post-intervention. Ninety-three percent of participants reported that the intervention was helpful and that they had the requisite knowledge to practice stress management strategies outside of the clinic. At a one-week follow-up, of the 23 participants who were able to be reached, 22 wanted to participate in additional training. Findings suggest that a one-time stress management intervention can be beneficial for patients and easily incorporated within a primary care setting.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate how patterns of maternal depressive symptoms from mid-pregnancy to 3 years postpartum are associated with children's behavior at age 3 years and executive functions. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured from mid-pregnancy to 3 years postpartum. Growth mixture modeling was used on standardized maternal depression scores (n = 147) to identify trajectories. Children's behavioral problems and mental health symptomatology (internalizing, externalizing, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) were obtained at 3 and 6 years. EFs were assessed by a laboratory-based computerized task and maternal-report at 6 years. Multivariable linear regressions of children's outcomes against maternal depressive symptom trajectories were conducted (n = 103). Three distinct patterns of maternal depressive symptom trajectories were identified: low (n = 105), increasing (n = 27), and decreasing (n = 15). Children of mothers whose depressive symptoms increased reported more problem behaviors at 3 years and poorer EFs at 6 years as assessed by both instruments, but no significant differences in mental health symptomatology at 6 years, relative to those whose mothers had consistently low depressive symptoms. Children whose mothers became less depressed over time had comparable levels of behavioral problems at age 3, executive functions, and internalizing and externalizing scores at age 6; and fewer reported ADHD behaviors at age 6, than those whose mothers remained less depressed over time. If mothers' depressive symptoms improve over the first 3 years postpartum, their children's outlook may be comparable to those whose mothers had consistently low depressive symptoms.

AB Mothers' emotion socialization practices are very important for children's later outcomes; however, we know very little about how these practices may lead to different outcomes for European American (EA) and African American (AA) children. In the current study, maternal emotion socialization practices were investigated in relation to child emotion-related outcomes in 122 pairs of mothers and preschool-age children, and differences in associations were examined for EA and AA families. Mothers were assessed for their expressions of positive emotion with their child and their responses to their child's negative emotions, including support of sadness/fear and magnification of anger, when children were 3. Children were assessed for their expression of positive emotion with their mother and their internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors when they were 4. When ethnicity was included as a moderator, results revealed that when AA mothers expressed more positive emotion, their children were also more positive 1 year later. Additionally, as AA mothers provided greater support for their children's sadness/fear, these children tended to have fewer later internalizing problems. Finally, when AA mothers responded with more magnification of their children's anger, these children tended to have greater internalizing and externalizing problems 1 year later. These associations were not found for EA families. Results highlighted differential effects based on the type of support provided by mothers and the role that mothers played in encouraging or suppressing their child's expressions. The overall findings highlight the need to consider maternal emotion socialization from a culturally-informed perspective.

AB This paper analyzes the predictive effect of recurrent maternal depression and social vulnerability indicators on internalizing behavior among schoolchildren, considering potential differences in mediator and moderator effects related to the children's gender. A cross-section of 100 mother-child pairs participated in the study and were systematically assessed: mothers were aged between 25 and 45 years old and children were at school age (7-12 years old); 50 mothers presented recurrent depression and 50 mothers presented no mental disorders. The mothers answered to a diagnostic interview, a general questionnaire and to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Prediction models assessed maternal depression and social vulnerability indicators as well as the moderator and mediator effect of the children's gender (p <=.05). The results indicate that maternal depression is directly and negatively related to emotional problems for boys and girls, maintaining its significant impact for girls in the presence of cumulative risks. For the effect of cumulative risks for such an outcome, the mothers' low educational level influence emotional problems among boys. Gender was not identified as a moderator or mediator variable. Identifying the differentiated impact of maternal depression and other vulnerable conditions for boys and girls can support public policies focused on child mental health and care delivery.

AB This study investigated associations between parental and child psychopathology with parenting stress as a possible mediator, in order to get more insight in mothers' and fathers' roles in the development of psychopathology in children. Parents of 272 clinically referred (aged 6-20, 66% boys) reported about their own and their child's behavioral problems, and about parenting stress. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Outcomes of path models demonstrated that mothers' higher internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with respectively children's higher internalizing and externalizing problems. Fathers' higher externalizing problems were associated with both children's higher internalizing and externalizing problems, but fathers' internalizing problems were only associated with children's lower externalizing problems. Parenting stress fully mediated the relation between mothers' and children's externalizing problems, and partly mediated the relation between mothers' and children's internalizing problems. For fathers, parenting stress partly mediated the relation between fathers' internalizing problems and children's externalizing problems. Findings indicate that for mothers, the association between parental and child psychopathology is specific, whereas for fathers it is non-specific. Furthermore, results suggest that reducing parenting stress may decrease child problem behavior. Longitudinal studies are needed in order to gain more insight in the direction and underlying mechanisms of the relation between parental and child psychopathology, including parental stress.

AB Parents' frequent destructive conflicts may lead children to respond to these disputes in maladaptive ways and these distressing and maladaptive responses, in turn, may lead to psychopathology in children. Child behavioral dysregulation was examined as a mediator between marital conflict and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms as well as parents' future conflicts in a sample of 235 children and their parents. Parents reported on study variables over three annual measurement occasions beginning when their children were 6 years old and autoregressive controls were included for destructive marital conflict and initial levels of children's symptoms of psychopathology. Results based on structural equation modeling showed that behavioral dysregulation mediated the relationship between destructive marital conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In addition, children's behavioral dysregulation mediated the relationship between parents' initial levels of destructive conflict and their later conflicts, indicating that children's responses did not serve to reduce parents' future conflicts, but were in fact related to an increase in destructive disputes over time. Findings of the current study suggest that children's behavioral dysregulation is a maladaptive response to marital conflict, associated with risk for children's development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and heightened destructive marital conflict. Discussion makes suggestions for future research regarding children's responses to marital conflict.

AB The current literature examining how community violence exposure (CVE) differentially relates to oppositional behaviors and conduct problems, as well as factors that impact this link, is limited. Further research is needed to examine these relationships to understand the etiologies of these disorders and what factors can buffer the effects of CVE, particularly among Latino youth.
   Accordingly, the current study examined relations between CVE, conduct problems, and oppositional behaviors, and whether academic performance moderated these effects.
   The researchers examined these relations in a sample of 144 Latino adolescents (54% male, ages 14-19). Participants completed a survey that included self-report measures on CVE and conduct problems. Participants' teachers reported on oppositional behaviors and academic performance.
   Results indicated that CVE was associated with conduct problems, but not oppositional behaviors. Additionally, academic performance was found to moderate the association between CVE and conduct problems, such that at low levels of academic performance, CVE was associated with more conduct problems.
   CVE was uniquely associated with conduct problems and not oppositional behaviors. Additionally, results of the current study contributes to the literature by suggesting CVE is associated with conduct behaviors when academic performance is low.

AB The deleterious association between various types of prenatal maternal psychological distress (PNMS, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, stress) and childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing behaviors, anxiety symptoms) has been established using both retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies across varied demographic cohorts and throughout development. Yet, the existing literature cannot claim maternal distress during pregnancy to be a specific risk factor for anxiety symptomatology, as studies utilizing such observational designs are unable to adequately account for confounding of potential genetic factors and the postnatal environment. In this review, we examine studies that attempt to minimize such confounding and thus disentangle the unique intrauterine exposure effect of varying types of PNMS on childhood anxiety symptomatology. Such methodologies include paternal versus maternal comparison studies, sibling comparisons, prenatal cross-fostering designs and timing of exposure studies (including disaster studies). Of the identified studies, findings indicate that prenatal maternal distress is likely to constitute a risk factor for anxiety symptomatology, although more studies are needed to replicate current findings in order to determine whether there are clear differences in effects across specific types of PNMS and for specific subpopulations. We review the methodological limitations and strengths of the literature prior to exploring avenues of future research and implications for theory and clinical practice.

AB The mental health of a representative sample of 230 adolescents residing in foster care in New South Wales, Australia, was estimated in a state-wide epidemiological survey from carer-report responses on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Assessment Checklist for Adolescents (ACA). Rates of CBCL total problems, externalizing and internalizing scores above the borderline range cut-points were 49, 44 and 29% respectively, representing a relative risk of 3.8, 3.7 and 2.7 respectively in comparison to Australian children at large. These rates are 10-14% lower than that previously estimated for pre-adolescent Australian children in foster care. Whereas older age is associated with poorer mental health among pre-adolescent children in foster care, the present study findings suggest that this effect does not extend into adolescence. Around half of adolescents residing in foster care have mental health difficulties requiring referral to treatment services, including attachment- and trauma-related difficulties that are uncommon among clinic-referred children at large.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine differences in: (1) mental health emotional and behavioral problems between young children experiencing PTSD with and without MDD; (2) the incidence of caregiver PTSD and MDD between children with PTSD +/- MDD; and (3) the number of traumatic events and interpersonal versus non-interpersonal nature of trauma events among children whose parents sought child trauma-focused treatment. Sixty-six caregivers of children aged 3-7 with PTSD completed semi-structured interviews regarding caregiver and child diagnoses, and caregivers completed self-report measures regarding child symptomatology. Results indicated that young children with PTSD + MDD had significantly higher internalizing symptoms, dissociative symptoms, and posttraumatic stress severity than those without comorbid MDD. There were no significant group differences in the incidence of caregiver PTSD or MDD, or the number or types of traumatic events. Future research to understand the unique contributors to the etiology of MDD in the context of PTSD among young children is needed.

AB Most children and adolescents with chronic health conditions have impaired health-related quality of life and are at high risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, few patients present clinically significant symptoms. Using a decision-tree approach, this study aimed to identify risk profiles for psychological problems based on measures that can be easily scored and interpreted by healthcare professionals in pediatric settings. The participants were 736 children and adolescents between 8-18 years of age with asthma, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, type-1diabetes or obesity. The children and adolescents completed self-report measures of health-related quality of life (DISABKIDS-10) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from their parents/physicians. Children and adolescents were classified into the normal (78.5%) or borderline/clinical range (21.5%) according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire cut-off values for psychological problems. The overall accuracy of the decision-tree model was 78.1% (sensitivity = 71.5%; specificity = 79.9%), with 4 profiles predicting 71.5% of borderline/clinical cases. The strongest predictor of psychological problems was ahealth-related quality of life standardized score below the threshold of 57.5 for patients with cerebral palsy, epilepsy or obesity and below 70.0 for patients with asthma or diabetes. Other significant predictors were low socio-economic status, single-parent household, medication intake and younger age. The model showed adequate validity (risk = .28, SE = .02) and accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = .84; CI = .80/.87). The identification of pediatric patients at high risk for psychological problems may contribute to a more efficient allocation of health resources, particularly with regard to their referral to specialized psychological assessment and intervention.

AB Adolescence is a fundamental transition phase, marked by physical, social, cognitive and emotional changes. At this stage in development two contrasting phenomena take place: brain changes cause a sensitivity to emotional aspects (Dahl, 2004); while also control processes register as well impressive improvements (e.g., Hooper et al., 2004; Best and Miller, 2010). The study is aimed to investigate the relationship between a core cognitive feature such as working memory (WM) (Diamond, 2013) and complex abilities such as emotion regulation (ER) and behavioral self-reported outcomes using a structural equation model approach. A sample of 227 typically developed adolescents between 14 and19 years of age (148 females; mean age in months 202.8, SD 18.57) participated in this study. The following tasks and self-reports were administered in a 45-min test session at school: Symmetry Span task (Kane et al., 2004). Reading Span task (Daneman and Carpenter, 1980), Mr. Cucumber (Case, 1985); Youth Self-Report (YSR, 11-18 years, Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001); Difficulties ER Scale (DERS, Gratz and Roemer, 2004; Italian version by Giromini et al., 2012). Results showed that difficulties in ER correlated with WM: high levels of ER difficulties are associated with low WM efficiency while no significant contributions of these predictors was observed on externalizing or internalizing symptoms. This study showed a significant relationship between self-reported difficulties in ER and WM, while no significant contribution of the considered predictors was showed on the outcomes, adding knowledge about how behavioral and emotional self-reported outcomes may relate to these processes.

AB Refugee children share a large number of pre-, per-, and post-migration risk factors, which make them vulnerable for developing mental health concerns. Within the last few years, a large number of families with young children have sought refuge in Germany. However, children's mental health status in Germany is mostly unclear. A central aim of developmental psychopathology is to understand how risk factors lead to the emergence of mental health concerns. One approach to investigating this association is the study of specificity, which describes the idea that specific risk factors are related to specific psychological outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess the mental health status of young refugee children in Germany, and to explore a potential refugee-specific mental health pattern. In two studies, we assessed mental health outcomes of 93 children from Syria or Iraq, aged 1.5-5 years, who recently arrived in Germany. The results were compared to U.S. norm data of typically developing children, and to norm data of a clinical sample in order to explore mental health patterns. In the first study (n = 35), we used standardized screening tools for parents (CBCL_ 1.5-5). In the second study (n = 58), mental health states of refugee children were assessed by caretakers (CTRF 1.5-5). In comparison to U.S. norm data of normally developing children, refugee parents reported more mental health concerns for their children, especially on syndrome scales of internalizing difficulties. A comparison to U.S. clinical reference data showed a specific mental health pattern, characterized by increased levels of anxiety/depression, attention problems, and withdrawal behavior. Caretakers, too, reported more mental health problems compared to typically developing children, albeit to a smaller extent. However, a comparison to clinically-referred children only led to partial confirmation of a specific mental health pattern. Our studies offer important insights into the mental health status and pattern of young refugee children, which is essential for preventing the onset of psychopathology and for offering tailored interventions.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to examine the necessity of early intervention for students with potential bulimia by investigating how the eating attitudes of college students change and examining the relation between bulimic symptoms and depressive symptoms or the ability to cope with stress.
   Methods: The study participants were students who entered Hiroshima University in 2014. This study was conducted at two time points: Time-1 in 2014 and Time-2 in 2017. The Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), Bulimic Inventory Test, Edinburgh (BITE), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) were administered at Times 1 and 2, and the responses were compared between the time points. Next, we compared the BDI-II scores of the BITE improved and worsened groups. In addition, we divided the participants into a clinical group, subthreshold group, and healthy group based on the BITE score at Time-1to compared their depressive symptoms and the ability to cope with stress.
   Results: Significantly higher BITE and BDI-II scores were recorded for both males and females at Time-2 than at Time-1. The BDI-II score at Time-1 was significantly higher in the BITE worsened group than in the BITE improved group. The BDI-II scores at Time-1 were significantly higher for both males and females in the subthreshold group than in the healthy group. Furthermore, significantly higher CISS-T and CISS-E scores were recorded at Time-1 for females in the subthreshold group than for females in the healthy group.
   Conclusions: Based on these results, intervention for students the subthreshold group is important, and the key to intervention may be to address not only eating behaviors but also depressive symptoms and stress coping.

AB Background: Internalizing psychopathology and dysregulated negative affect are characterized by dysregulation in the autonomic nervous system and reduced heart rate variability (HRV) due to increases in sympathetic activity alongside reduced vagal tone. The neurovisceral system is however, a complex nonlinear system, and nonlinear indices related to psychopathology are so far less studied in children. Essential nonlinear properties of a system can be found in two main domains: the informational domain and the invariant domain. sample entropy (SampEn) is a much-used method from the informational domain, while detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) represents a widely-used method from the invariant domain. To see if nonlinear HRV can provide information beyond linear indices of autonomic activation, this study investigated SampEn and DFA as discriminators of internalizing psychopathology and negative affect alongside measures of vagally-mediated HRV and sympathetic activation.
   Material and Methods: Thirty-Two children with internalizing difficulties and 25 healthy controls (aged 9-13) were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire, Revised, giving an estimate of internalizing psychopathology, negative affect and effortful control, a protective factor against psychopathology. Five minute electrocardiogram and impedance cardiography recordings were collected during a resting baseline, giving estimates of SampEn, DFA short-term scaling exponent alpha(1), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), and pre-ejection period (PEP). Between-group differences and correlations were assessed with parametric and non-parametric tests, and the relationships between cardiac variables, psychopathology and negative affect were assessed using generalized linear modeling.
   Results: SampEn and DFA were not significantly different between the groups. SampEn was weakly negatively related to heart rate (HR) in the controls, while DFA was moderately negatively related to RMSSD in both groups, and moderately positively related to HR in the clinical sample. SampEn was significantly associated with internalizing psychopathology and negative affect. DFA was significantly related to internalizing psychopathology.
   Conclusions : Higher invariant self-similarity was linked to less psychopathology. Higher informational entropy was related to less psychopathology and less negative affect, and may provide an index of the organizational flexibility of the neurovisceral system.

AB Background: Schizophrenia is currently considered a neurodevelopmental disorder of connectivity. Still few studies have investigated how brain networks develop in children and adolescents who are at risk for developing psychosis. 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11 DS) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis of schizophrenia from a neurodevelopmental perspective. Structural covariance (SC) is a powerful approach to explore morphometric relations between brain regions that can furthermore detect biomarkers of psychosis, both in 22q11DS and in the general population.
   Methods: Here we implement a state-of-the-art sliding-window approach to characterize maturation of SC network architecture in a large longitudinal cohort of patients with 22q11DS (110 with 221 visits) and healthy controls (117 with 211 visits). We furthermore propose a new clustering based approach to group regions according to trajectories of structural connectivity maturation. We correlate measures of SC with development of working memory, a core executive function that is highly affected in both idiopathic psychosis and 22q11DS. Finally, in 22q11DS we explore correlations between SC dysconnectivity and severity of internalizing psychopathology.
   Results: In HCs network architecture underwent a quadratic developmental trajectory maturing up to mid-adolescence. Late-childhood maturation was particularly evident for fronto-parietal cortices, while Default-Mode-Network-related regions showed a more protracted linear development. Working memory performance was positively correlated with network segregation and fronto-parietal connectivity. In 22q11DS, we demonstrate aberrant maturation of SC with disturbed architecture selectively emerging during adolescence and correlating more severe internalizing psychopathology. Patients also presented a lack of typical network development during late-childhood, that was particularly prominent for frontal connectivity.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that SC maturation may underlie critical cognitive development occurring during late-childhood in healthy controls. Aberrant trajectories of SC maturation may reflect core developmental features of 22q11DS, including disturbed cognitive maturation during childhood and predisposition to internalizing psychopathology and psychosis during adolescence.

AB Freezing behavior, a commonly observed defensive stress response, shows relatively high stability over time in animals. Given the relevance of freezing for stress-coping and human psychopathology, it is relevant to know whether freezing behavior is also stable in humans, particularly during adolescence, when most affective symptoms develop. In a prospective longitudinal study, we investigated freezing-like behavior in response to social threat in 75 adolescents at age 14, repeated 3 years later at age 17. We used a well-established method combining electrocardiography (ECG; heart rate) and posturography (body sway) in response to emotional picture-viewing of angry, happy, and neutral faces. We hypothesized that individual differences in freezing-like behavior in response to social threat-operationalized by contrasting angry vs. neutral faces-would be relatively stable over time. Our results indeed showed relative stability between ages 14 and 17 in individual differences in freezing-like behavior in heart rate (r = 0.82), as well as in combined heart rate and body sway measures (r = 0.65). These effects were not specific for the angry vs. neutral contrast; they were also visible in other emotion contrasts. Exploratory analysis in males and females separately showed stability in body sway specifically for angry vs. neutral faces only in females. Together, these results suggest moderate to strong stability in human freezing-like behavior in response to social threat from mid to late adolescence (with exception for the body sway measure in males). This relative stability was not specific for threat-induction and may reflect a general stability that is particularly strong for heart rate. The fact that this relative stability was found over a relatively long time range of 3 years is promising for studies aiming to use freezing-like behavior as a marker for internalizing symptoms in adolescent development.

AB Developing autonomy is an important developmental task that has implications for adolescent adjustment and may be impacted by adolescents' response to stress. This study examined whether stress reactivity (i.e., cortisol and heart rate reactivity) to a parent-adolescent conflict interaction moderates the effect of autonomy on adjustment assessed one year later in 100 adolescents (M age = 15.09; 68% girls). Multiple group models suggested that youth who evidenced higher stress reactivity when compared to those with lower stress reactivity were more likely to report decreased externalizing problems and internalizing problems when their parents granted more autonomy. In contrast, youth who evidenced higher stress reactivity who experienced undermining of autonomy were more likely to report increased externalizing and internalizing problems than youth who evidenced lower stress reactivity. Results support biological sensitivity to context theory and highlight the importance of considering individual differences in the effect of developmental milestones on adolescents' adjustment.

AB Research indicates that mobile phone dependency (MPD) is associated with various behavioral and internalizing problems. While a significant amount of findings points to its negative outcomes, there is a dearth of evidence concerning the determinants of MPD. This study focuses on this critical, yet understudied, subject by analyzing the associations between abusive parenting style, neighborhood characteristics, and MPD among youths in South Korea, a country with one of the highest mobile broadband penetration rates in the world. Based on the secondary analysis of two waves of Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), a government-funded multiyear study, we investigate individual- and contextual-level factors underlying MPD. Findings show that, net of a host of time-lagged controls (including baseline dependency from the previous year), abusive parenting style significantly increases adolescent MPD. After adjusting for individual level characteristics, however, no contextual-level effect is found, i.e., residing in a neighborhood with a relatively higher proportion of parental abuse is not related to greater MPD. Finally, two cross-level interaction effects are observed. First, the association between parental abuse and MPD is weaker in a neighborhood context with better educated inhabitants (more college graduates). Second, it is reinforced in demographically "aged" communities with more elderly residents.

AB Background. Exposure to threat-related early life stress (ELS) has been related to vulnerability for stress-related disorders in adulthood, putatively via disrupted corticolimbic circuits involved in stress response and regulation. However, previous research on ELS has not examined both the intrinsic strength and flexibility of corticolimbic circuits, which may be particularly important for adaptive stress responding, or associations between these dimensions of corticolimbic dysfunction and acute stress response in adulthood.
   Methods. Seventy unmedicated women varying in history of threat-related ELS completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan to evaluate voxelwise static (overall) and dynamic (variability over a series of sliding windows) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of bilateral amygdala. In a separate session and subset of participants (n = 42), measures of salivary cortisol and affect were collected during a social-evaluative stress challenge.
   Results. Higher severity of threat-related ELS was related to more strongly negative static RSFC between amygdala and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and elevated dynamic RSFC between amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Static amygdala-DLPFC antagonism mediated the relationship between higher severity of threat-related ELS and blunted cortisol response to stress, but increased dynamic amygdala-rACC connectivity weakened this mediated effect and was related to more positive post-stress mood.
   Conclusions. Threat-related ELS was associated with RSFC within lateral corticolimbic circuits, which in turn was related to blunted physiological response to acute stress. Notably, increased flexibility between the amygdala and rACC compensated for this static disruption, suggesting that more dynamic medial corticolimbic circuits might be key to restoring healthy stress response.

AB BackgroundAnxiety sensitivity (AS) reflects an individual's belief that experiencing anxiety will cause illness or embarrassment, and may be a reason individuals self-medicate with alcohol. Harsh or indulgent parenting could contribute to the development of AS. We examined the direct and indirect associations between parenting styles and alcohol-related variables through AS and impaired control over drinking (IC; i.e., perceived failure to adhere to limits on alcohol consumption in the future).
   MethodsA multiple-group structural equationmodel with 614 university students (344 men; 270 women) was examined. Structural invariance tests were conducted to evaluate moderation by gender. We used a bias corrected bootstrap technique to obtain the mediated effects.
   ResultsFather authoritarianism and mother permissiveness were directly linked to AS among women, whereas father permissiveness was directly linked to AS among men. This suggests unique parental influences based on gender regarding AS. While AS was directly linked to alcohol-related problems for both men and women, several gender-specific associations were found. AS was directly linked to IC for men but not for women. For men, father permissiveness was directly related to AS, and AS mediated the indirect link between father permissiveness and IC along both the heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems pathways. Similar to other internalizing constructs (e.g., neuroticism and depression), higher AS was directly associated with less heavy episodic drinking but more alcohol-related problems.
   ConclusionsOur findings highlight the dangers of AS for men as an important correlate of under-controlled drinking behaviors. Additionally, permissive parenting of the same-gender parent was associated with AS, which is consistent with the gender-matching hypothesis. Together, these results underscore the importance of measuring the independent influence of both parents.

   SEX-DIFFERENCES; FETAL EXPOSURE; LONG-TERM; IN-VIVO; DEPRESSION
AB Objective: The authors sought to assess associations among early-life exposure to adversity, the development and maturation of neurons and brain circuits, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Specifically, they examined whether fetal exposure to placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a molecule conveying maternal signals to the fetus, predicts brain growth and neuropsychiatric outcomes in school-age children.
   Method: In a large, well-characterized prospective cohort, concentrations of placental CRH (pCRH) in maternal plasma were determined during five intervals during gestation. When the children reached school age, their brain structures were examined using MRI, and emotional and cognitive tests assessing internalizing and externalizing behaviors and attention were administered (N=97, 49 of them girls).
   Results: Levels of pCRH during gestation predicted structural and functional brain outcomes in children. Specifically, fetal exposure to elevated pCRH levels was associated with thinning of selective cortical regions and with commensurate cognitive and emotional deficits. The relations among fetal exposure to pCRH, cortical thinning, and childhood function were sex specific.
   Conclusions: In view of the established effects of CRH on maturation and arborization of cortical neurons, and the major contribution of dendrites to cortical volume, these findings position pCRH as an important mediator of the consequences of early-life adversity on neuropsychiatric outcomes.

AB Models of the etiology of depressive disorders suggest that the onset of a depressive episode is the result of a complex phenomenon based on the interaction between genetic background, critical environmental factors such as life stressors and traumatic events, and the effects of neuroendocrine changes associated with the stress response. Numerous studies have highlighted the usefulness of morning cortisol (C) as a potential predictor of depressive episodes. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of C, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity/output, and the sAA/C ratio in predicting depressive symptoms in a community sample of 99 children aged 8-11 years old. Two saliva samples were obtained in the morning on two different school days. Teachers described their pupils' behavior by using the internalizing problems scales of the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) questionnaire. Our results indicate that, regardless of gender, the best predictor of depressive/withdrawal scores and overall internalizing scores on the TRF was lower mean morning levels of sAA activity. Hence, sAA could be proposed as a biological marker for the risk of developing a first episode of depressive illness in child samples.

AB Despite schools increasingly adopting multitiered systems of support (MTSS) for prevention and intervention of mental health concerns, many are slow to adopt universal mental health screening (UMHS), a core MTSS feature, due to concerns about their limited capacity to meet the needs of all identified. In this study, we examined differences in the number and characteristics of students who would be identified for intervention services when UMHS in an MTSS were added to those students already receiving social, emotional, and behavioral supports. In a sample of 3,744 students in Grades 1 to 5 from six schools, 679 (18.1%) additional students were identified by screening, representing a 180.1% increase in students identified with behavioral risk or need for mental health interventions. Using a series of stepwise logistic regression analyses, we identified significant predictors of newly identified students including gender, number of office discipline referrals, and externalizing, internalizing, and adaptive behavior ratings. Findings are discussed in relation to opportunities for prevention and the systems needed in an MTSS to meet the needs of newly identified students.

AB In recent years, an increasing amount of research has identified various parenting dimensions related to childhood depression among Chinese children and adolescents. However, much of the extant literature reports inconsistent findings, and lacks methodological rigor and theoretical guidance. The purpose of this review is to synthesize and critically assess the existing literature on the association between parenting and childhood depression among Chinese children and adolescents. The included studies were investigated based on choice of methodology and the use of appropriate theoretical underpinnings in order to inform insightful directions for future inquiries. Literature was systematically searched using eight English and three Chinese electronic databases. The review included quantitative peer-reviewed articles that focused on parenting behaviors and childhood depression among Chinese children and adolescents 0 to 18 years. Quality assessments were adapted based on existing validated instruments and the study characteristics in order to assess the implemented methodologies and theory utilization. The search concluded with thirty-eight articles identified for inclusion. Findings suggest the associations between parenting and childhood depression were generally small to moderate but non-trivial. Various dimensions of parenting were differentially associated with childhood depression. Authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles were most consistently related to childhood depression, however, the former reduced childhood depression, while an authoritarian style resulted in more childhood depression. Based on the detailed methodological and theory utilization quality assessment, several limitations of the reviewed studies were noted, such as the lack of prospective studies; the use of single informant and questionnaire measures; insufficient use of theoretical frameworks; and unclear conceptualization and operationalization of the parenting constructs. This review provides recommendations for social workers and public health practitioners to better incorporate consideration of varying parenting dimensions into family-based interventions designed to reduce depression among Chinese children and adolescents.

AB Highly-visual social media (HVSM), such as Instagram and Snapchat, have experienced a significant increase in popularity among adolescents in recent years. Findings indicate use of social media is related to body image concerns and poorer mental health in adolescence. However, previous research on HVSM is scant and mainly focus on female samples. In this view, the present study investigated the association between time spent on HVSM, body image concerns and internalizing symptoms, in sample of adolescents attending grades 6-11 in Northern Italy. Data for this study were based on 523 students, 54.2% female; Mean age (SD) = 14.82 (1.52). Multiple linear regression was used to examine the associations between time spent using social media, body image concerns, and internalizing symptoms. Overall, students reporting using Facebook and HVSM for more than 2 h were 7.1% and 28.9% of the sample. Students reporting frequent use of HVSM (>2 h/day) reported significantly higher body image concerns and internalizing symptoms than peers reporting no use of HVSM. Further, we found the positive link between use of HVSM and internalizing symptoms to be mediated by participants' body image concerns problems. These findings suggest that adolescents reporting high use of HVSM might be at risk for increased body image concerns, which in turn might lead to poorer psychological adjustment.

AB In this study, we used a stress test to investigate endocrinological and subjective stress responses of 8- to 14-year-old children with internalizing or externalizing disorders and healthy controls. The sample (N = 170) consisted of clinical and community children. Parents were given a diagnostic interview to diagnose their children's psychiatric condition. We measured saliva cortisol and subjectively experienced arousal in children before and after the Trier Social Stress Test for Children. Children also rated their performance immediately after the stress test, and 1 hr later they rated their positive and negative thoughts about this stressful event. Children with internalizing or externalizing disorders exhibited a blunted cortisol response compared to healthy controls. Depressed children rated their test performance lower and reported more negative thoughts after the test in comparison to healthy controls, anxious children reported more arousal before and after the task, and children with externalizing disorders reported more positive thoughts. In regression analyses, cortisol and subjective stress responses were both predictive of psychiatric disorders. The study extends previous work on the relation between psychiatric disorders and children's stress responses to an experimentally induced stress task by including a broad range of psychiatric disorders and by integrating endocrinological and subjective stress responses.

AB The offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (OBD) are at high risk for developing mental disorders. In addition to genetic factors, environmental risk is purported to be associated with these negative outcomes. However, few studies have examined this relation. Using concurrent and longitudinal data, we examined if support, structure, and control provided by parents in middle childhood mediated the relation between having a parent with or without bipolar disorder, and offspring mental health. The sample included 145 offspring (77 OBD, 68 controls) aged 4 to 14 years and their parents. Parent and teacher ratings of child behavior were collected, and diagnostic assessments were conducted in offspring 12 years later (n = 101). Bootstrapping analyses showed that low levels of structure mediated the relation between having a parent with bipolar disorder and elevated internalizing and externalizing difficulties during middle childhood. For the longitudinal outcomes, parental control emerged as the strongest mediator of the relation between parents' bipolar disorder and offspring psychopathology. Suboptimal childrearing may have different immediate and enduring consequences on mental health outcomes in the OBD. Parental structure has robust effects on emotional and behavioral problems in middle childhood, while levels of control promote psychological adjustment in the OBD as they mature.

AB The increasing prevalence of postnatal anxiety highlights the need for summarizing the recent research on this condition to inform screening and intervention efforts. This narrative review of the literature was derived from a search on PubMed and PsycINFO for papers published since 2010. The demographic risk factors for postnatal anxiety include being a young mother, having more education and being employed. Childbirth risk factors include being primiparous in one sample and multiparous in another, caesarean delivery, fear of the birth and of death during delivery, lack of control during labor, low self-confidence for the delivery and the delivery staff, and premature delivery. Social support problems include the lack of family support, marital/family conflict, and social health issues. Psychiatric history risk factors include prenatal depression and anxiety. Postnatal anxiety has negative effects on breast-feeding, bonding, mother-infant interactions, infant temperament, sleep, mental development, health and internalizing behavior and on conduct disorder in adolescents. Unfortunately, only six postnatal anxiety intervention studies could be found including paternal education, music therapy during labor, mothers massaging their infants, cognitive behavior therapy and administering oxytocin. The negative effects of postnatal anxiety and the limitations of the research in this review highlight the need for further research.

AB Black American youth are vulnerable to the consequences of repeated exposure to racial discrimination, particularly through hampered coping abilities and greater internalizing and externalizing problems. One way in which Black American parents have protected their children from these deleterious consequences is through racial socialization, or communication regarding aspects of racialized experiences and contexts. Less is known, however, about the potential therapeutic benefits of racial socialization via clinical intervention. The five-week Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race (EMBRace) racial socialization intervention was developed to enhance coping strategies for parents and adolescents and reduce adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. The purpose of this study is to describe a case study of one family through a mixed methods approach. Variables of interest included racial discrimination, racial socialization, coping, and psychological well-being. Quantitative and qualitative assessments were performed two weeks prior to and one week after the implementation of EMBRace, with qualitative data collected throughout the intervention. Results indicate a developing sense of coping for the adolescent and parent and reduced adolescent psychosocial problems despite increased racialized stress. Results will be used to further investigate the hypotheses proposed in the pilot with a powered sample, and future studies will explore how sociodemographic and biopsychosocial variables relate to policy recommendations, program implementation, and psychosocial outcomes.

AB Child depression is an impairing condition for which psychotherapies have shown modest effects. Parental depression is a risk factor for development of child depression and might also be negatively associated with child depression treatment outcomes. To explore this possibility, we analyzed data from a study in which children were treated for depression after parental depressive symptoms had been assessed at baseline. Among children treated for depression in a randomized controlled trial, we identified 31 who had child- and parent-report pre- and post-treatment data on child symptoms and parent-report of pre-treatment parental depressive symptoms. Children were aged 8-13, 77% boys, and 52% Caucasian, 13% African-American, 6% Latino, and 29% multi-racial. Analyses focused on differences in trajectories of change (across weekly measurements), and post-treatment symptoms among children whose parents did (n = 12) versus did not (n = 19) have elevated depressive symptoms at baseline. Growth curve analyses showed markedly different trajectories of change for the two groups, by both child-report (p = 0.03) and parent-report (p = 0.03) measures: children of parents with less severe depression showed steep symptom declines, but children of parents with more severe depression showed flat trajectories with little change in symptoms over time. ANCOVAs showed lower post-treatment child symptoms for children of parents with less severe depression versus parents with more severe depression (p = 0.05 by child report, p = 0.01 by parent report). Parental depressive symptoms predict child symptom trajectories and poorer child treatment response, and may need to be addressed in treatment.

AB A longstanding hypothesis is that some alcohol use problems (AUP) develop and are maintained through the "self-medication" of internalizing (INT; depression and anxiety) problems. However, their high rate of co-occurrence with one another and with externalizing (EXT; antisocial behavior and impulse control) problems obscures any causal association because EXT may account for the INT-AUP link. Using a large community sample, we estimated prospective effects of INT and EXT on AUP via latent cross-lagged mediation panel spanning 14 years from childhood (ages 9-11) to young adulthood (ages 21-23). After adjusting for the cross-lagged, concurrent, and stability effects across factors, INT decreased AUP risk through its direct and indirect effects and increased AUP risk through shared variance with EXT. Between childhood and young adulthood, unique aspects of INT reduced risk for AUP while aspects of INT shared with EXT increased risk for AUP.

AB Objective: Maternal antenatal depression may compromise the fetal developmental milieu and contribute to individual differences in aging and disease trajectories in later life. We evaluated the association between maternal antenatal depression and a novel biomarker of aging at birth, namely epigenetic gestational age (GA) based on fetal cord blood methylation data. We also examined whether this biomarker prospectively predicts and mediates maternal effects on early childhood psychiatric problems.
   Method: A total of 694 mothers from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) Study provided information on history of depression diagnosed before pregnancy; 581 completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale throughout pregnancy, and 407 completed the Child Behavior Checklist at child's age 3.7 years (SD = 0.75 year). DNA methylation (DNAm) GA of fetal cord blood DNA was based on the methylation profile of 148 selected cytosine linked to guanine by phosphate (CpG) sites. Epigenetic GA was calculated as the arithmetic difference between DNAm GA and chronological GA and adjusted for chronological GA.
   Results: Maternal history of depression diagnosed before pregnancy (mean difference = -0.25 SD units, 95% CI = -0.46 to -0.03) and greater antenatal depressive symptoms (-0.08 SD unit per I-SD unit increase, 95% CI = -0.16 to -0.004) were associated with child's lower epigenetic GA. Child's lower epigenetic GA, in turn, prospectively predicted total and internalizing problems and partially mediated the effects of maternal antenatal depression on internalizing problems in boys.
   Conclusion: Maternal antenatal depression is associated with lower epigenetic GA in offspring. This lower epigenetic GA seems to be associated with a developmental disadvantage for boys, who, in early childhood, show greater psychiatric problems.

AB Attention and working memory symptoms are among the most common late effects in survivors of pediatric brain tumors, and are often associated with academic and psychosocial difficulties. Diagnostic and treatment approaches derived from the literature on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have frequently been applied to survivors, yet the extent of overlap in cognitive profiles between these groups is unclear. The objective of the present study is to compare neurocognition in survivors of brain tumors and children with neurodevelopmental ADHD.
   Neuropsychological data were abstracted from clinically referred brain tumor survivors (n = 105, M-age = 12.0 y, 52.4% male) and children with ADHD (n = 178, M-age = 11.1 y, 64.0% male). Data consist of a battery of parent-report questionnaires and performance-based neuropsychological measures.
   Twenty-five survivors (23.8%) of pediatric brain tumors met symptom criteria for ADHD. Participants with neurodevelopmental ADHD and survivors who met ADHD criteria had significantly greater parent- (P < 0.001) and teacher-reported (P < 0.001) working memory and behavior regulation difficulties than survivors of tumor who did not meet criteria. Children with ADHD symptoms also performed worse on measures of sustained attention than survivors without ADHD symptoms (P < 0.001). Additionally, survivors with ADHD symptoms had greater performance-based working memory difficulties than either survivors without attention problems or children with neurodevelopmental ADHD (P = 0.002).
   Nearly a quarter of survivors with attention symptoms have functional profiles that are similar to children with neurodevelopmental ADHD. They also experience more neurocognitive impairments than survivors without attentional difficulties, particularly in working memory. Screening for ADHD symptoms may help providers triage a subset of individuals in need of earlier or additional neuropsychological assessment.

AB Past studies have identified various risk and protective factors for problem gambling (PG). However, no study has examined the interplay between these factors using a combination of person-centered and variable-centered approaches embedded within a longitudinal design. The present study aimed to (a) identify distinct profiles in early adolescence based on a set of risk factors commonly associated with PG (impulsivity, depression, anxiety, drug-alcohol use, aggressiveness, and antisociality), (b) explore the difference in reported gambling problems between these profiles during midadolescence and early adulthood, and (c) identify family-and peer-related variables that could operate as protective or compensatory factors in this context. Two samples were used: (a) a population sample (N = 1,033) living in low socioeconomic-status neighborhoods and (b) a population sample (N = 3,017) representative of students attending Quebec schools. Latent profile analyses were conducted to identify at-risk profiles based on individual risk factors measured at age 12 years. Negative binomial regression models were estimated to compare profiles in terms of their reported gambling problems at ages 16 and 23. Finally, family-and peer-related variables measured at age 14 were included to test their protective or compensatory role with respect to the link between at-risk profiles and gambling problems. Four profiles were identified: well-adjusted, internalizing, externalizing, and comorbid. Compared to the well-adjusted profile, the externalizing and comorbid profiles reported more gambling problems at ages 16 and 23, but the internalizing profile did not differ significantly. Various protective and compensatory factors emerged for each profile at both time points.

AB The comorbidity between depression and physical and verbal aggression is a phenomenon capable of altering the intensity of the expression of its symptomatology and, thus, canceling out any typical treatment. Despite this fact, few longitudinal studies have been developed to test the effect of primacy and the magnitude of intensity resulting from the comorbid effect. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze longitudinally in a Spanish child-juvenile sample, whether it is depression that predicts physical or verbal aggression and vice versa, as well as the degree of magnitude between such disorders. For this purpose, a sample of 525 children between 10 and 13 years old (58.9% girls) was followed up for 3 years. Participants completed the Children's Depression Questionnaire (Short version) and the Physical and Verbal Aggression Questionnaire. The longitudinal results indicated a predominance effect of depression at 10.86 years on verbal aggression at 11.86 and 12.86 year. Moreover, cross-sectional data indicated at 11.86 years, aggression (physical and verbal) predicted the onset of depression, while at 12.86 years old an effect of shared risk factor (e.g., belonging to a single parent family and having a low socioeconomic status) and verbal aggression predicted depression. These results suggest the need to consider the longitudinal course of depression and aggression to improve the diagnosis and treatment of depression and physical and verbal aggression in comorbidity.

AB Aim The aim of this study was to examine difficulties in emotion regulation in alcohol dependent patients with comorbid complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) compared to alcohol dependent patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method N = 106 patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid PTSD according to DSM-5 were included in the study. Diagnosis of CPTSD was assessed by the Interview for Assessing CPTSD, difficulties in emotion regulation were measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Results Patients with comorbid CPTSD as well as patients with comorbid PTSD showed difficulties in emotion regulation. Difficulties in emotion regulation increased with increasing severity of PTSD. Patients with comorbid CPTSD showed greater difficulties in the domain of attention to one's own emotions, compared with patients with comorbid PTSD. Conclusion Difficulties in emotion regulation should be addressed in the treatment of patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder. For patients with CPTSD, the ability to attend to one's own emotions should be trained.

AB Objective: Excessive screen media exposure in childhood is associated with parent-reported self-regulation difficulties. No studies have used laboratory-based or teacher-reported measures of child self-regulatory behaviors. This study examines cross-sectional associations between preschooler screen media exposure and multiple measures of self-regulatory behaviors. Methods: Preintervention data were used from 541 preschoolers in the Growing Healthy study, an obesity prevention trial (2011-2015). Screen media exposure was measured by daily screen media exposure (hr/d), television (TV) in the bedroom, frequency of background TV, and TV with meals (1 = rarely/never, 4 5 frequently). Child self-regulatory behaviors were measured by the following: child ability to delay gratification, a standardized waiting paradigm; teacher-reported Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation; and parent-reported difficult temperament on the Child Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). Multivariate regression analyses modeled screen media exposure predicting each self-regulatory measure, adjusting for child age, sex, parent age, education, marital status, income-to-needs ratio, number of adults in household, parent depressive symptoms, and sensitivity. Results: Children were aged 4.1 years (SD = 0.5), parents were aged 29.6 years (SD = 6.8), 48% had high school education or less, and 67% were married. Daily screen media exposure and background TV were associated with weaker observed self-regulation (beta: -10.30 seconds for each hr/d media, -12.63 seconds for 1-point increase, respectively). Background TV and TV with meals were associated with greater parent-reported difficult temperament (beta: 0.04 and 0.05 CBQ, respectively, for 1-point increase). Conclusion: Greater screen media exposure had small but significant associations with weaker observed and parent-reported, but not teacher-reported, self-regulatory behaviors. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the directionality of associations.

AB Objectives. This study is aimed at validating the dimensional internalizing and externalizing approach to personality in a sample of adolescents with suicidal behavior and analyzing the psychopathological and syndromic differences between adolescents from each dimension.
   Method. It is a descriptive and cross-sectional study of 75 adolescents (75% women) who attended the emergency service of a pediatric hospital due to suicidal behavior. Sociodemographic, clinical and psychopathological data and personality profiles (MACI) were gathered.
   Results. The factorial analysis found two factors (total variance of 77.65%): an internalizing (28% of the cases) and an externalizing profile (72% of the cases). Statistically significant differences were obtained between the two profiles in the expressed concerns and the clinical syndromes of the MACI.
   Conclusions. Two differentiated personality profiles were found in our sample of adolescents with suicidal behavior. The externalizing profile was more prevalent. These profiles should guide clinical decisions and help plan therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of suicidal behavior relapse.

AB Self-report instruments to assess situations of daily stress in childhood are scarce and it is important to have tools that allow greater knowledge of this stage of development. The paper presented the Spanish adaptation of the Children's Hassles Scale (CHS), a self-report questionnaire to assess daily stressors in childhood and adolescence. The instrument was administrated to a sample of 579 children between 10-12 years of age from the city of Madrid (54.2% were boys). Participants were from clinical group (n = 94) and community group (n = 485). Confirmatory factor analysis showed validity evidence based on the internal structure, with four first level factor, peer comparison, parent, school and family, and a second level factor. Internal consistency was good for CHS (ordinal alpha = .88), although somewhat lower for the factors (peer comparison = .79; school = .69; parents = .67; family = .63). Good evidences of divergent validity were found when daily hassles were compared to other stressors. Some differences between clinical group and community group in peer comparison and school stressors and sex differences in peer comparison and parental stressors were found. Daily hassles were significantly related with externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. Results indicate that CHS is a valid and reliable instrument that can be useful in clinical and educational research and practice.

AB In Colombia, externalizing and internalizing behaviors in children are highly prevalent and interfere in their personal, school and social adaptation. This justifies effective psychological interventions for its management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological intervention program (called "Programa Entre Tres") aimed at parents, children and teachers for the management of externalized and internalized behaviors in children from 8 to 12 years of age in Bogota, Colombia. This study used a pretest-posttest design, without a control group. Through a semi-structured interview and the questionnaire "childhood behavior check list" [CBCL]. A total of 207 children were evaluated (M = 9.81; SD = 1.25; 48% children); of them, 49 met the inclusion criteria of age 8 to 12 years, presence of internalizing or externalizing behaviors, and parental consent. Twenty-two parents, 13 children and 14 teachers completed a 9-session program that emphasizes the beliefs, expectations and attributions of adults about children, and it trains in the principles of social learning, self-control, empathy, self-regulation, cognitive flexibility and problem solving. A significant decrease was found, with a medium size effect, in the total behaviors measured by the CBCL (p < .01; r = .33, d = .70), total of externalizing behaviors (p < .01; r = .55), in withdrawn /depressive (p < .01; r = .29; d = .61) and aggressive behavior (p < .01; r = .66), and a large size effect in social problems (p <. 01; r = .39; d = .87). Multidimensional, multicomponent and tetrad psychological interventions as the one evaluated in this pilot study, are probably a good alternative for the management of these behaviors.

AB Objective: Sexual abuse experienced in childhood and adolescence is associated with severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties. The current study examined the relationships among these factors in a sample of adolescents with sexual abuse-related PTSD. It was hypothesized that (a) self-perceived emotion regulation difficulties would predict severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms, and that (b) depressive symptoms would mediate the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD. Method: Ninety treatment-seeking female adolescents with a history of sexual abuse were evaluated using the Child PTSD Symptom Scale-Interview and completed the Negative Mood Regulation Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory as part of a baseline evaluation. Results: Greater emotion regulation difficulties were associated with greater severity of PTSD and depressive symptoms. In addition, the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and PTSD severity was mediated by depressive symptoms. However, the reverse was also true: the relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms was mediated by PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Mediation analyses showed that emotion regulation difficulties were associated with both PTSD and depressive symptoms rather than fitting a unidirectional model. These findings are consistent with and extend previous research and highlight the importance of emotion regulation in adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

AB This article presents the findings of a study that examined the rates and the consequences of exposure to community violence (ECV) as reflected in witnessing and experiencing such violence, among Palestinian adolescents from Israel. In particular, it examined the extent to which these adolescents exhibit high levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms as consequences of such exposure, and the extent to which self-efficacy and collective efficacy moderate these consequences. A systematic random sample of 760 Palestinian adolescents in Israel (320 boys, and 440 girls) filled out a self-administered questionnaire. The results show that most of the adolescents had witnessed community violence during the last year and during lifetime, and more than one third had directly experienced such violence during their lifetime compared with 19.6% during the last year. Boys were exposed to community violence more often than girls. Moreover, participants' ECV predicted high levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that collective efficacy moderated the correlation between experiencing community violence and internalizing symptoms, whereas self-efficacy moderated the correlation between witnessing community violence and externalizing symptoms. There is a need for providing support for youth from close adults as well as from formal and informal resources in the community before and after their ECV.

AB Child welfare involvement has been linked to child behavioral health issues, including increased likelihood of internalizing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, and externalizing behavioral problems such as oppositional behaviors and substance use problems. One predictor of child behavioral health is caregiver mental health. Although, there remains a specific gap associated with identification of factors among caregivers that are associated with longitudinal child behavioral health trajectories. Using LONGSCAN, we explore the effects of caregiver depression on the behavioral health of children over time. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models showed that children with a caregiver who reported depression showed significantly higher internalizing behavioral problems over time, and significantly larger decreases in externalizing behavioral problems over time, compared to children with a caregiver who reported no depression. These findings emphasize that early interventions geared towards jointly assessing and treating parent and child mental health issues in the child welfare system may be successful at improving future behavioral health outcomes.

AB School bullying is negatively associated with self-esteem, but psychological mediators of bullying have yet to be clarified. We examined regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) as a possible mediator in the association between self-esteem and school bullying. A cross-sectional study of 995 adolescents was conducted in two middle schools of Xi'an. All of the participants completed the Chinese version of the School Bullying Experience Questionnaire (C-SBEQ), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy Scale (RESE). Descriptive statistics analysis, the bias corrected percentile Bootstrap CI method, and structural equation modelling were used to analyze the data. The results showed that 418 students (42.0%) reported that they were involved in school bullying in the past year. Self-esteem was negatively associated with school bullying (total effect: = -0.275, 95% CI = -0.381--0.034), and RESE mediated the association between self-esteem and school bullying (indirect effect: = -0.136, 95% CI = -0.245--0.037). Furthermore, self-esteem had an indirect effect through perceived self-efficacy in managing negative affect, while self-esteem had no indirect effect through self-efficacy in the expression of positive affect. The present study suggests that school authorities and the related education departments should not only focus on improving students' self-esteem, but should also pay more attention to students' RESE, in order to mitigate, and potentially reduce, the occurrence of bullying.

AB Objective: The current study examined the extent of gun exposure, referring to the mere presence of guns in youth's lives, in a sample of Black American adolescents residing in low-income urban neighborhoods. The relationship of gun exposure to internalizing and externalizing outcomes was also explored. Method: Data were collected from a sample of 185 Black American eighth-grade students (M = 13.58 years old, 59% female). Results: Just under half of the youth reported some type of gun exposure with youth most often exposed to guns outside of the home. Overall gun exposure was related to externalizing but not internalizing symptoms, while knowing someone who owns a gun was related to both externalizing and internalizing symptoms. However, the majority of youth reported exposure to guns in a safe manner (stored locked and unloaded). Conclusions: In addition to gun violence and gun carrying, general gun exposure is a factor that should be accounted for when attempting to address consequences associated with guns.

AB Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are recognized neurotoxicants, but the extent to which PBDEs influence various domains of behavior in children is not fully understood. As such, we reviewed epidemiologic studies published to date to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PBDEs' potential role in behavioral development. We identified 19 epidemiologic studies reporting on associations of prenatal and childhood concentrations of PBDEs with behaviors assessed in children from 1 to 12 years, including executive function, attention, externalizing and internalizing behaviors, adaptive skills, and social behaviors/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While the mechanisms of PBDE neurotoxicity in humans are still not clearly elucidated, findings from this review indicate that PBDE exposure during fetal development is associated with impairments in executive function and poorer attentional control in children. Results from large prospective cohorts demonstrate that prenatal and postnatal PBDE exposure adversely impacts externalizing behavior (e.g., hyperactivity and conduct problems). Additional studies are needed to determine whether PBDEs are associated with internalizing problems, adaptive skills, and social behaviors/ASD in children. Future studies will help better understand the potential neurotoxic effects of PBDE exposures during adolescence, possible sex-dependent effects, and the impact of exposure to BDE-209 and alternative flame retardants. Future studies should also examine chemical mixtures to capture real-world exposures when examining PBDEs and their impact on various behavioral domains in the context of multiple chemical exposures.

AB Poor motor skills have been associated with a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal difficulties, including poor self-competence, peer problems, and internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression. The Elaborated Environmental Stress Hypothesis provides a theoretical framework for understating these relationships. Studies have recently begun to evaluate this framework; however, ongoing empirical investigation is required. Currently, the extent to which these relationships may differ across factors such as gender remains unclear. The current study tests an indirect effect of motor skills on internalizing problems via peer problems and perceived self-competence in a community sample of 164 children (81 males; 83 females) aged 7 to 12years. A combination of clinician-administered, self-report, and parent-rated measures were used. Regression analysis using PROCESS indicated that the relationship between motor skills and internalizing problems was not moderated by gender. Motor skills did have an indirect effect on internalizing problems via perceived scholastic competence and peer problems. Results provide partial support for part of the Elaborated Environmental Stress Hypothesis; perceived scholastic competence and peer problems are mechanisms through which motor skills are related to internalizing problems in school-aged children. This study highlights potentially important targets for psychomotor interventions for this age group.
   Highlights The Environmental Stress Hypothesis suggests that motor skills may have an indirect effect on internalizing problems via factors such as peer problems and perceived self-competence. A community sample of 164 children aged 7-12 years provided measures of motor skills and psychosocial functioning. Motor skills had an indirect effect on internalizing problems via perceived scholastic competence and peer problems. This relationship was not moderated by gender.

AB Somatic complaints are frequent among preadolescents with impaired emotion awareness and maladaptive coping strategies. In addition, coping strategies in response to stressful events have been suggested to affect the association between emotion awareness and somatic complaints. However, empirical support for this assumption is missing. In this study, we examined the extent to which emotion awareness and coping contributed uniquely to somatic complaints and the indirect effect of emotion awareness on somatic complaints through coping strategies, among preadolescent boys and girls. Self-reports were administered to 265 preadolescents (137 boys; M-age=12.04) to investigate somatic complaints, emotion awareness, and coping strategies to deal with peer victimization. A subsample (N=97) was assessed after a 12-month time-span. Cross-sectional results indicated that more somatic complaints were associated with less emotion awareness and problem-solving and with more internalizing and externalizing coping. Poor emotion awareness was indirectly associated with somatic complaints through internalizing for boys and through distraction, externalizing, and internalizing for girls. Emotion awareness was longitudinally associated with somatic complaints through distraction for boys. Overall, findings suggested that less emotion awareness was associated with more maladaptive coping strategies, which in turn contributed to more somatic complaints. Implications for research and intervention are discussed.
   Highlights The present study investigated the associations between somatic complaints, emotion awareness, and coping strategies among preadolescent boys and girls. Self-report data were collected. Results showed that poor emotion awareness was indirectly associated with somatic complaints through internalizing for boys and through distraction, externalizing, and internalizing for girls. Improving emotion awareness and effective coping strategies may reduce somatic complaints among preadolescents and offer them a better social and psychological adjustment.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) in adolescents is highly complex and heterogeneous. Within the disorder, research has suggested the existence of at least two subgroups: one with predominantly internalizing psychopathology features and one with predominantly externalizing psychopathology features. One process that may differentiate these groups is executive functioning (EF), given that poor EF is linked to externalizing psychopathology. Against this background, the current study used a multi-informant approach to examine whether adolescent patients with predominantly externalizing BPD presentations experience greater deficits in EF than adolescent patients with predominantly internalizing presentations. The sample included inpatient adolescents ages 12-17 (M=15.26; SD=1.51). Analyses revealed that multiple EF domains distinguished the BPD subgroups. More specifically, adolescents with externalizing presentations exhibited greater difficulties in broad domains related to global executive functioning, metacognition and behavioural regulation and specific domains related to inhibitory control, working memory, planning/organizing, monitoring and organization of materials. While this study is the first to examine EF and adolescent BPD in the context of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, alternative approaches to examining this question are discussed.

AB Purpose: Smoking behaviors and intent to quit have not been well studied among adolescent psychiatric patients. The current study examined the relationships between smoking-related variables (smoking status/heaviness and intent to quit), psychiatric diagnoses and symptomatology, and substance use among adolescents receiving psychiatric inpatient care.
   Methods: Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial, testing the effect of a brief intervention on substance use, with 151 psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents with comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders (diagnosed using semi-structured interviews) were examined for this study.
   Results: Of 151 inpatients aged 13-17 years, 112 (74.2%) were smokers (self-report), of whom 59 (52.7%) expressed intent to quit within 3 months and 36 (32.1%) within 30 days. There were no differences in psychiatric diagnoses or alcohol, marijuana, or any drug use among smokers and nonsmokers. On the other hand, smokers reported significantly greater occurrences of negative consequences from alcohol use, drug use, and total substance use than nonsmokers. Separate analyses also revealed that heavier smokers reported greater negative consequences from alcohol/drug/total use. Similarly, while no difference in externalizing or internalizing symptoms was observed across smokers vs. nonsmokers, heavier smokers reported significantly more severe externalizing symptoms, but not internalizing symptoms, than lighter smokers. Intention to quit smoking did not vary as a function of psychiatric symptomatology or substance use.
   Conclusions: Smoking was related to several psychiatric and substance use problems. Notably, adolescent psychiatric inpatient smokers reported intention to quit smoking regardless of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric symptom severity, or other substance use.

AB ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the brief loss of control over eating scale (LOCES-B) in a community sample of adolescents.
   MethodParticipants were 1,116 adolescents (11-15 years; 53% girls; 53% non-Hispanic White) recruited from middle schools in the Northeast United States. Participants were administered self-report surveys during school in the fall of 2016.
   ResultsConfirmatory factor analyses indicated that the LOCES-B total score was unidimensional, which was invariant across gender and weight status. The LOCES-B had excellent internal consistency (=.92). The LOCES-B total score had large, positive relationships with the frequency of LOC eating episodes, objective bulimic episodes, and subjective bulimic episodes, and a small, positive relationship with objective overeating episode frequency. After adjusting for demographics, anthropometrics, and LOC eating frequency, adolescents reporting higher scores on the LOCES-B total score had greater body image dissatisfaction, more internalizing symptoms, and lower trait effortful control.
   DiscussionFindings suggested that the LOCES-B is a reliable and valid measure of LOC eating in early adolescents. The availability of the LOCES-B has the potential to elucidate the developmental trajectories, predictors, and outcomes of LOC eating across the full severity spectrum in large cohort studies of youth.

AB Psychosocial care systems have been designed so that specific problems are treated by specific care types. There is insufficient evidence as to which problem types are actually presented to the various care types. This study assessed types and severity of problems among children and adolescents upon enrolment in psychosocial care, compared to children not enrolled; also outcomes after 3 and 12 months, overall and per care type. We obtained data on a cohort of 1382 Dutch children aged 4-18 years (response rate 56.6%), included upon enrolment in psychosocial care, and on 443 not-enrolled children (response rate 70.3%), all from one region. Results showed that enrolled children had more problems than children not enrolled in care. In child and adolescent mental healthcare (CAMH), relatively many children had internalizing problems, and in child and adolescent social care (CASC) relatively many children had externalizing, parenting, family and multiple problems. Regardless of the type of problem, care duration in preventive child healthcare (PCH) was relatively short; and in CASC and CAMH longer. After 3 and 12 months, rates of problem solution were highest in PCH. These rates were also substantial among children not in care. To conclude, our findings show that the system of psychosocial care functions as intended regarding the distribution of problems across care types. Extended demarcation of clients by problem type and severity towards type and contents of care may further improve the system.

AB Objective: To examine (1) the 12-month prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SOC), separation anxiety disorder (SEP) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in a large, nationally representative sample of Australian youth; (2) patterns of comorbidity between these disorders; (3) demographic and socio-environmental correlates and (4) the psychosocial impact and service use associated with each condition.
   Method: Data are from the 2013/2014 Australian national, face-to-face household Young Minds Matter survey of mental health and wellbeing. Informants were parents or carers reporting on 6310, 4- to 17-year-olds (55% of eligible households). The presence of each of the three anxiety disorders was determined based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV.
   Results: In the past 12months, 6.6% of youth had experienced at least one of SOC, SEP or GAD, with rates of 2.3% for SOC, 4.3% for SEP and 2.3% for GAD. Rates did not differ by gender but were significantly higher for SOC and GAD and lower for SEP in 12- to 17-year-olds than 4- to 11-year-olds. Comorbidity between these disorders was high, although lower for SEP. Having SOC, SEP or GAD was associated with not living with both biological parents, having a parent with a mental health problem, elevated negative family events, low carer employment and peer victimization. The association with family risk factors was greater for SEP than for SOC and GAD. Although the majority of anxious youth had received professional help, this was less likely in the younger cohort.
   Conclusion: Social, separation and generalized anxiety disorders in young people are relatively common and impairing, with a high level of comorbidity. There are both commonalities and differences in socio-environmental correlates. The majority of anxious youth received some form of professional assistance, although the rate was lower among children compared to adolescents.

AB Objective This article examined the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (K-ITSEA).
   Methods Translation and back-translation of the K-ITSEA were conducted after obtaining a permission. Two thousand two hundred thirty six Korean community infants (1,199 boys and 1,037 girls) between the ages of 12 and 36 months (M=34.23, SD=3.80) and 90 clinical infant samples (60 boys and 30 girls) between the ages of 12 and 36 months (M=26.84, SD=6.24) participated in the present study.
   Results Confirmatory factor analyses supported the Internalizing, Externalizing, Dysregulation, and Competence domains as well as the 17 individual scales that comprise the K-ITSEA, Young children's sex and age differences emerged for some problem and most competence scales. All domains showed adequate intrascale reliability and test-retest reliability. Scale intracorrelation analyses and associations between the K-ITSEA and Korean version of PSI, Korean version of CBCLl,5-5 supported the validity of the assessment Comparisons of the K-ITSEA scores for the Autism Spectrum Disorder, Psychiatric Disorders and Matched control groups supported the discriminant validity of the K-ITSEA.
   Conclusion This preliminary results indicate that the K-ITSEA would be a useful assessment for detecting the early childhoods behavior problems and competences in Korean population.

AB Adolescence is the peak age for both victimization and mental disorder onset. Previous research has reported associations between victimization exposure and many psychiatric conditions. However, causality remains controversial. Within the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, we tested whether seven types of adolescent victimization increased risk of multiple psychiatric conditions and approached causal inference by systematically ruling out noncausal explanations. Longitudinal within-individual analyses showed that victimization was followed by increased mental health problems over a childhood baseline of emotional/behavioral problems. Discordant-twin analyses showed that victimization increased risk of mental health problems independent of family background and genetic risk. Both childhood and adolescent victimization made unique contributions to risk. Victimization predicted heightened generalized liability (the "p factor") to multiple psychiatric spectra, including internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorders. Results recommend violence reduction and identification and treatment of adolescent victims to reduce psychiatric burden.

The underlying modeling ideas are described and explained in this article. As an example, change in internalizing problem behaviors between the age of 8 and 13 years is modeled and predicted by gender. The example data stems from a large German cohort sequential study and comprises 806 children in three birth cohorts (2001, 2000, 1999). Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of this modelling approach are discussed. Annotated syntax is provided online for the models.

AB Background: Iron deficiency (ID) in infancy is related to subsequent behavior problems. The effects of micronutrient status in middle childhood are uncertain.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the associations of micronutrient status biomarkers in middle childhood with externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in adolescence.
   Methods: We assessed whether ID (ferritin <15 mu g/L), anemia (hemoglobin <12.7 g/dL), or blood concentrations of zinc, vitamins A and B-12, and folate at ages 5-12 y were associated with externalizing or internalizing behavior problems in adolescence in 1042 schoolchildren from Bogota, Colombia. Behavior problems were assessed with the Youth Self-Report questionnaire after a median 6.2 y of follow-up. Mean problem score differences with 95% Cls were estimated between categories of micronutrient status biomarkers with the use of multivariable linear regression.
   Results: Mean +/- SD externalizing and internalizing problems scores were 52.6 +/- 9.6 and 53.8 +/- 9.9, respectively. Among boys, middle-childhood ID, anemia, and low plasma vitamin B-12 were associated with 5.9 (95% CI: 1.0, 10.7), 6.6 (95% CI: 1.9, 11.3), and 2.7 (95% CI: 0.4, 4.9) units higher mean externalizing problems scores in adolescence, respectively-after adjustment for baseline age, time spent watching television or playing video games, mother's height, and socioeconomic status. Also in boys, ID was related to an adjusted 6.4 (95% CI: 1.2, 11.6) units higher mean internalizing problems score. There were no associations among girls. Other micronutrient status biomarkers were not associated with behavior problems.
   Conclusions: ID, anemia, and low vitamin B-12 in middle childhood are related to behavior problems in adolescent boys.

AB This study provides evidence regarding the relatedness of multi-informant agreement and perceived observability of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Based on 2 distinct but comparable samples of children/adolescents (Sample 1: 58.2% female and mean age of 12.51 years; Sample 2: 56.4% female and mean age of 12.35 years) and their mothers, cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analyses were conducted. Although often suggested in the literature, the results of the study do not indicate that-in general-internalizing behavior is less observable than externalizing behavior. Moreover, the results do not corroborate the suggestion that multi-informant agreement regarding internalizing behavior is lower than that of externalizing behavior. However, apart from the broad distinction of internalizing versus externalizing behavior, observability and multi-informant agreement are positively correlated with respect to reports on actual state (cross-sectional) as well as change (longitudinal) of problem behavior. The results are discussed in the context of research on multi-informant reports on problem behavior and with respect to practical implications for the assessment of problem behavior.

AB OBJECTIVES: To investigate the developmental impact of a prenatal-to-age-5 multicomponent early intervention program targeting families living in low socioeconomic conditions.
   METHODS: Pregnant women from a disadvantaged Irish community were randomly assigned into a treatment group (home visits, baby massage, and parenting program; n = 115) or control group (n = 118). Children's behavioral problems (externalizing, internalizing), cognitive skills (general, vocabulary), and health service use (number of health clinic visits), were regularly assessed (6 months to 4 years of age). Children's developmental trajectories were modeled by using latent class growth analyses to test whether certain subgroups benefited more than others.
   RESULTS: high and low developmental trajectories were identified for each outcome. Treated children were more likely to follow the high-level trajectory for cognition (odds ratio = 2.89; 95% confidence interval = 1.55-5.50) and vocabulary skills (odds ratio = 2.02; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-3.82). There were no differences by treatment condition in the risk of belonging to a high externalizing or high health clinic visit trajectory. however, within the high externalizing trajectory, treated children had lower scores than controls (Hedges' g range (2-4 years) = 0.45-0.58; P < .05) and, within the high health clinic visit trajectory, only children in the control group experienced an increasing number of visits.
   CONCLUSIONS: This program revealed moderate positive impacts on trajectories of cognitive development and number of health clinic visits for all children, whereas positive impacts on externalizing behavior problems were restricted to children with the most severe problems.

AB This study compared three groups of various age and health status (total N = 732) with respect to their identity status, stress level, and parental behavior. As expected, patients were characterized by delayed identity development, particularly ruminative exploration. Further, patients experienced high identity stress and described high levels of anxious paternal rearing and intrusive maternal psychological control. The patients' levels of both internalizing and externalizing symptomatology were high, and the impact of externalizing symptoms on identity arrest was strong. Identity status was delayed, albeit age adequate in both groups of healthy youths, with comparably high levels of anxious parental monitoring. Compared to adolescents, young adults were particularly active in their identity development, showing a high level of identity stress but no increase in psychopathology.

AB Children and their caregivers often disagree when reporting on child behavioural and emotional difficulties. But how does parent-child discordance relate to outcomes, particularly among children undergoing trauma therapy? This study examined parent-child discordance in relation to children's trauma symptoms and therapy outcomes. Participants included 96 trauma-exposed children and their caregivers, who received Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Discordance was calculated using absolute difference scores between child- and parent- reported psychological symptoms. Parent-child discordance, calculated at pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at a six-month follow-up, predicted the severity of children's posttraumatic stress, dissociation, and internalizing and externalizing difficulties at each respective time-point. Pre-therapy discordance predicted improvements in externalizing behaviours after therapy and at follow-up. Improvements in discordance predicted improvements in trauma-specific symptoms over the course of treatment and at follow-up. The findings underscore how changes in parent-child discordance are related to child trauma symptoms and treatment response. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB We examined associations between specific self-regulatory mechanisms and externalizing behavior patterns from ages 2 to 15 (N = 443). The relation between multiple self-regulatory indicators across multiple domains (i.e., physiological, attentional, emotional, and behavioral) at age 2 and at age 5 and group membership in four distinct externalizing trajectories was examined. By examining each of these self-regulatory processes in combination with one another, and therefore accounting for their shared variance, we aimed to better understand which specific self-regulatory skills were associated most strongly with externalizing behavioral patterns. Findings suggest that behavioral inhibitory control and emotion regulation are particularly important in distinguishing between children who show normative declines in externalizing behaviors across early childhood and those who demonstrate high levels through adolescence.

AB We present a developmental cascade model of the longitudinal relationships between internalizing symptoms, externalizing problems, and academic performance in middle childhood, utilizing a large sample (N = 1,771) from the United Kingdom in a 3-year, cross-lag design. Three hypotheses were tested: adjustment erosion, academic incompetence, and (cumulative) shared risk. In addition, we sought to examine whether developmental cascade pathways varied across gender, while also statistically exploring indirect, mediation pathways. Structural equation models that accounted for within-time covariance, data nesting, and temporal stability provided evidence of gender-specific effects as follows: externalizing-attainment adjustment erosion pathways were found only in boys, while attainment-internalizing/externalizing academic incompetence pathways were found only in girls. Analysis of mediation pathways provided further support for these gender-specific longitudinal profiles. Protective longitudinal internalizing-externalizing and externalizing-internalizing pathways were found for both boys and girls. Finally, while it improved model fit for both genders, the influence of cumulative shared risk on the aforementioned pathways was relatively meager, substantively affecting only one (externalizing-attainment adjustment erosion pathway in boys). The implications of these findings are discussed, and study limitations noted.

   REPORTS
AB Research shows that childhood dysregulation is associated with later psychiatric disorders. It does not yet resolve discrepancies in the operationalization of dysregulation. It is also far from settled on the origins and implications of individual differences in dysregulation. This study tested several operational definitions of dysregulation using Achenbach attention, anxious/depressed, and aggression subscales. Individual growth curves of dysregulation were computed, and predictors of growth differences were considered. The study also compared the predictive utility of the dysregulation indexes to standard externalizing and internalizing indexes. Dysregulation was indexed annually for 24 years in a community sample (n = 585). Hierarchical linear models considered changes in dysregulation in relation to possible influences from parenting, family stress, child temperament, language, and peer relations. In a test of the meaning of dysregulation, it was related to functional and psychiatric outcomes in adulthood. Dysregulation predictions were further compared to those of the more standard internalizing and externalizing indexes. Growth curve analyses showed strong stability of dysregulation. Initial levels of dysregulation were predicted by temperamental resistance to control, and change in dysregulation was predicted by poor language ability and peer relations. Dysregulation and externalizing problems were associated with negative adult outcomes to a similar extent.

AB This study explored the significance of grandparents in middle childhood and assessed the level of grandparental support provided to children in relation to other social network members. The association between grandparental support and grandchildren's mental and behavioural health was also examined. We conducted structured interviews with 120 grade 4 and 5 learners (mean age=10.41 years) from four schools in Cape Town, South Africa. Results indicated that subsequent to parents, children perceived grandparents as the most important and close relationship category. Furthermore, grandparents provided the highest levels of support to grandchildren after parents. Grandmothers provided more support than grandfathers. No associations between grandparental support and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviours were found. However, results revealed that grandparental support was positively associated with children's prosocial behaviour, independent of child gender, and the amount of support provided by other relationship categories (p=.04). Findings underscore a need for research to move beyond the nuclear family when considering potential influences on children's well-being.

AB Background: Group Mindfulness Therapy (GMT) is a program tailored for adolescents that targets anxiety with mindfulness skills including present moment awareness, mindfulness in everyday life (breathing, eating, walking), body scan, loving-kindness, and self-acceptance. Youth with anxiety may benefit from mindfulness exercises precisely because they learn to redirect their mind, and presumably their attention, away from wandering in the direction of worry and negative self-appraisals and toward greater acceptance of internal states. This open trial assessed the feasibility and initial effectiveness of GMT in a school setting. Method: Twelve 6th and 7th grade adolescents with elevated anxiety [Screen for Child Anxiety Disorders (SCARED) >= 30] participated in GMT after school. Youth completed measures of anxiety and perceived stress and their parents completed measures of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at pretreatment and posttreatment. We hypothesized that GMT would significantly reduce youth anxiety and stress. Results: Significant improvements were observed in anxiety, internalizing, stress, and attention, with effect sizes ranging from .88 to 1.34. Conclusions: We demonstrate that GMT is feasible and acceptable to adolescents presenting with anxiety as a primary concern. We provide further support for the use of a mindfulness-based intervention for anxiety reduction. The group format suggests a cost-effective way to deliver services in a school setting.

AB Background: Adolescent hip preservation surgery (HPS) candidates typically present with chronic pain, which can negatively affect psychological function and surgical outcomes. A previous study demonstrated high rates of psychological symptoms and maladaptive behaviors in this population. This study quantified psychological and functional improvements in these patients from preoperative presentation to postoperative follow-up. An integrated interdisciplinary approach is also described.
   Methods: A total of 67 patients undergoing HPS were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 year by staff psychologists. Perioperative psychological intervention consisted of education, counseling, and administration of self-report measures. Self-report measure scores were compared preoperatively and postoperatively, grouped by orthopaedic diagnoses. Frequency analysis, correlational analysis, and analysis of variance were conducted.
   Results: Psychological function improved significantly at follow-up: decreased emotional symptomatology (46.1 to 43.6, P = 0.013), anxiety (49.6 to 45.8, P < 0.001), school problems (46.6 to 44.7, P = 0.035), internalizing problems (46.3 to 44.1, P = 0.015), social stress (44.5 to 42.3, P = 0.024), sense of inadequacy (49.0 to 46.0, P = 0.004), and increased self-concept (51.1 to 54.1, P = 0.003). Resiliency factors also significantly improved: increased mastery (50.3 to 52.9, P = 0.001) and resourcefulness (49.7 to 52.0, P = 0.046), decreased emotional reactivity (46.3 to 42.9, P = 0.001), and vulnerability (47.7 to 44.7, P = 0.011). Physical function and return to activity also significantly improved (University of California-Los Angeles: 7.1 to 8.7, P = 0.017; modified Harris Hip Score: 67.3 to 83.8, P < 0.001). Return to activity positively correlated with optimism and self-efficacy (P = 0.041). Femoroacetabular impingement and hip dysplasia patients consistently reported feeling less depressed (P = 0.036), having fewer somatic complaints (P = 0.023), fewer internalized problems (P = 0.037), and exhibiting fewer atypical behaviors (P = 0.036) at follow-up. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis patients did not demonstrate improvements in psychological functioning postoperatively.
   Conclusions: Perioperative psychological education and counseling, in combination with HPS, improved postoperative psychological and physical function. Patients reported reduced anxiety, school problems, and social stress, with marked increase in resilience. Increased mobility and return to activity significantly correlated with improved optimism and self-efficacy.

TI Validation of the Pain Coping Questionnaire in Finnish
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN
LA English
DT Article
ID MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; STRATEGIES; CHILDHOOD;

AB ObjectiveThe Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ), the first validated pain coping measurement developed specifically for children, has lacked proper validation in Finnish. The original PCQ by Reid etal. (Pain 1998; 76; 83-96) comprises eight-first-order and three higher-order scales. The aim herein was to determine the factor structure and validity of the Finnish PCQ translation in Finnish children.
   MethodsExploratory factor analysis was used for the first-order and higher-order classification of 91 recruited patients aged 8-15. Cronbach's alpha was used for reliability. Relationships between the Children's Depression Inventory, patient-reported pain frequency and pain coping strategies were examined.
   ResultsAnalyses were executed with 38 items; one was excluded. A structure of eight-first-order (Internalizing/Catastrophizing [IC], Positive Self-Statements [PSS], Information Seeking [IS], Seeking Social Support [SSS], Cognitive Distraction [CD], Externalizing [EXT], Behavioural Distraction [BD], Problem Solving [PS]) and three higher-order scales (Approach [APP], Emotion-Focused Avoidance [EFA], Distraction [DIS]) proved the most consistent. Four first-order scales (PSS, CD, EXT, BD) emerged as identical to the original solution. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for all individual first- and second-order scales were satisfactory. A higher CDI score was positively related to EFA and negatively to DIS, and pain frequency positively related to APP and EFA.
   ConclusionThe exploratory factor analysis of the PCQ provided a both culturally and statistically satisfactory structure in the Finnish translation. This supports the reliability and validity of the PCQ in future national use and the value of the questionnaire also outside English-speaking countries.
   SignificanceThis study showed both culturally and statistically satisfactory factor structure of PCQ in the Finnish translation. This result supports reliability and validity of the PCQ in the national use in the future. The result shows that the PCQ is a reliable method to be used in different linguistic and cultural surroundings and, thus, encourages using it in various countries. The data consist of two patient groups, adolescents with JIA and musculoskeletal pain. Pain and specifically coping with pain are important aspects of clinical work. A valid pain coping scale may enhance distinguishing vulnerable pain coping style in children and adolescent before pain becomes chronic.

AB Background: Preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety, but it is not known if this is due to greater exposure to risk, or if perinatal adversity amplifies the impact of traditional risk factors. This study sought to determine if exposure to perinatal adversity modifies associations between traditional risk and resilience factors and depression and anxiety in adulthood. Methods: A sample of 142 extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW < 1,000 g) survivors and 133 sociodemographically matched normal birth weight (NBW) control participants was followed longitudinally to 22-26 years of age. Separate postnatal risk and resilience scales were created using eight risk and seven resilience factors, respectively. Depression and anxiety were assessed using the internalizing scale of the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR). This scale was also dichotomized at the 90th percentile to define clinically significant psychopathology. Results: While the average number of risk exposures did not differ between groups, ELBW survivors were more susceptible to risk than NBW control participants. For the ELBW group, each additional risk factor resulted in a 2-point increase in internalizing scores, and two and a half times the odds of clinically significant internalizing symptoms (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.63, 3.76). The protective effect of resiliency factors was also blunted among ELBW survivors. Conclusions: Extremely low-birth-weight survivors may be more sensitive to traditional risk factors for psychopathology and less protected by resiliency factors. Intervention strategies aimed at preventing or reducing exposure to traditional childhood risk factors for psychopathology may reduce the burden of mental illness in adult survivors of prematurity.

AB The purpose of this study was to elucidate possible cognitive mechanisms involved in the intergenerational transmission of trauma from maltreatment-survivor mothers to their toddler/preschool-aged children. This study investigated whether maternal trauma-related cognitionsposttrauma appraisals and disorganized memory for maltreatmentwere associated with higher levels of toddler internalizing and externalizing symptoms and more dysfunction in the mother-child relationship. A community sample of mothers with histories of maltreatment and a child between the ages of 2 and 5 years was recruited for a study on maternal attachment, coping, and health (N = 113). Path analysis results showed that posttrauma appraisals and disorganized memory were significantly related to toddler internalizing symptoms, even with maternal trauma symptoms included in the model. Maternal posttrauma appraisals and disorganized memory were also linked to more dysfunction in the mother-child relationship. These findings provide preliminary evidence in support of maternal trauma-related cognitions as potential mechanisms for the intergenerational transmission of trauma.

AB This study examined maternal depressive symptoms, social support, parenting, and adult attachment as mediators explaining the relation between maternal childhood maltreatment and child behavior in offspring. We assessed a community sample of 96 mother-child dyads. At child age 16 months, mothers self-reported maltreatment history, adult attachment, depressive symptoms, and social support, and maternal sensitivity was assessed via 2 hr of direct behavioral observation. Maternal reports of child behavior were collected at 5 years. Single and parallel mediation models were constructed. Only maternal depressive symptoms mediated the relation between maternal maltreatment history and children's internalizing problems. Maternal sensitivity emerged as a suppressor variable. With respect to the relation between maternal maltreatment history and children's externalizing problems, when entered singly, maternal depressive symptoms, social support, and avoidant attachment emerged as mediators. When examined in parallel, only maternal depressive symptoms and avoidant attachment accounted for unique mediating variance. Findings have implications with respect to important maternal factors that might be targeted to reduce the probability of maladaptive child behavior.

AB Children who experience early adversity are at increased risk for developing psychopathology, and dysfunction of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is a possible mechanism conferring this risk. This study sought to characterize the association between morning cortisol during different developmental periods and deficits in children's emotion regulation, a core feature of many psychological disorders. Morning cortisol was collected at two time points (i.e., during infancy, M = 13.0 months old, and during early childhood, M = 36.8 months old) from 120 children with histories of child protective services (CPS) involvement. Children completed a lab visit during early childhood (M = 38.6 months old) that involved an observational measure of anger regulation. Results showed that low morning cortisol during infancy, but not early childhood, predicted increased anger dysregulation during early childhood. These results highlight the importance of developmental timing in assessing the effects of HPA axis functioning and suggest that low cortisol during infancy is a risk factor for later emotion regulation difficulties.

AB This paper reports on the effects on parenting and on children's mental health problems and competencies from a randomized trial of a parenting program for divorced and separated fathers. The program, New Beginnings Program-Dads (NBP-Dads), includes ten group sessions (plus two phone sessions) which promote parenting skills to increase positive interactions with children, improve father-child communication, use of effective discipline strategies, and skills to protect children from exposure to interparental conflict. The program was adapted from the New Beginnings Program, which has been tested in two randomized trials with divorced mothers and shown to strengthen mothers' parenting and improve long-term outcomes for children (Wolchik et al. 2007). Fathers were randomly assigned to receive either NBP-Dads or a 2-session active comparison program. The sample consisted of 384 fathers (201 NBP-Dads, 183 comparisons) and their children. Assessments using father, youth, and teacher reports were conducted at pretest, posttest, and 10-month follow-up. Results indicated positive effects of NBP-Dads to strengthen parenting as reported by fathers and youth at posttest and 10-month follow-up. Program effects to reduce child internalizing problems and increase social competence were found at 10 months. Many of the program effects were moderated by baseline level of the variable, child age, gender, and father ethnicity. This is the first randomized trial to find significant effects to strengthen father parenting following divorce. In view of recent changes in family courts to allot fathers increasing amounts of parenting time following divorce, the results have significant implications for improving outcomes for children from divorced families.

AB Self-regulation is a well-known construct in educational and psychological research, as it is often related to academic success and well-being. Drawing from criticisms of a lack of context applied to the investigation of this construct, the current study examined the multi-dimensional role of social support (teachers, parents, peers) and coping skills as predictors of self-regulated learning among a diverse sample of urban youth (N = 229). Based on a cross-sectional and longitudinal design, structural equation modeling was used to test two models. Social support predicted self-regulated learning at Time 1 and Time 2 after controlling for grades. Results further indicated that coping skills did not predict self-regulated learning in either model. The implications for practice, limitations of the study, and future directions for research are discussed.

With secondary data from the Developmental Victimization Survey, we utilized latent profile analysis to identify subgroups of youth, ages 12-17, based on clusters of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. We also examined how the behavioral outcome clusters were associated with different forms of victimization. Four behavioral subscales were included within the latent profile analysis and a four-class model had the best fit. Youth in Class 3 (high depression, anxiety, anger, and delinquency) were significantly more likely to have experienced peer/sibling victimization and to have experienced indirect victimization than youth in Class 2 (high depression, anxiety, and anger). The study findings indicate that certain types of victimization have greater consequences on mental health and that the unique clustering of symptoms is at least partially accounted for by the types of victimization experienced.

AB Co-rumination has been shown advantageous for friendship quality, but disadvantageous for mental health. Recently, two components have been distinguished, with co-brooding predicting increases in depressive symptoms and co-reflection decreases. The current study aimed to replicate these findings and investigated whether both components also show differential relations with friendship quality. Gender was investigated as a moderator. Path analyses were used on data of 313 adolescents aged 9-17 (50.5% girls). Co-brooding was related to more concurrent and prospective depressive symptoms in girls. Co-reflection predicted less concurrent and prospective depressive symptoms in girls and higher concurrent positive friendship quality for boys and girls. This study underscores the value of studying co-rumination components and suggests that boys and girls in this context differ in their pathways towards depression.

AB Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) increases risk for most psychiatric disorders. There is evidence that the structure of psychopathology can be explained by a number of latent dimensions of psychopathology including a 'General Psychopathology' (P) factor. The objective of the current study was to provide the first assessment as to whether P is identifiable, and what its correlates might be in a clinical sample.
   Methods: An adult, clinical sample of Danish CSA survivors (N = 420) was assessed using the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III. Confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) was used to assess the latent structure of nine psychiatric disorders, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to determine correlates of the bestfitting dimensional model.
   Results: CFA results favoured a bifactor model including three specific dimensions of psychopathology, "Internalizing", "Externalizing", and "Thought Disorder", and a bi-factor "P". A SEM model that included ten predictors was a good fit to the data and explained 55% of variance in 'P'. The 'P' factor was significantly associated with emotional coping, negative self-worth, traumatic life events, and anxious attachments.
   Limitations: Psychiatric disorders were assessed using self-report measures, and the sample was predominately female.
   Conclusions: Results provide initial evidence of P in a clinical sample and several unique correlates of this factor were identified.

AB Background. Child mental health problems are now recognised as a key public health concern. Parenting programs have been developed as one solution to reduce children's risk of developing mental health problems. However, their potential for widespread dissemination is hindered by low parental engagement, which includes intent to enrol, enrolment, and attendance. To increase parental engagement in preventive parenting programs, we need a better understanding of the predictors of engagement, and the strategies that can be used to enhance engagement.
   Method. Employing a PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of the predictors of parent engagement and engagement enhancement strategies in preventive parenting programs. Key inclusion criteria included: (1) the intervention is directed primarily at the parent, (2) parent age >18 years, the article is (3) written in English and (4) published between 2004-2016, Stouffer's method of combining p-values was used to determine whether associations between variables were reliable.
   Results. Twenty-three articles reported a variety of predictors of parental engagement and engagement enhancement strategies. Only one of eleven predictors (child mental health symptoms) demonstrated a reliable association with enrolment (Stouffer's p < .01).
   Discussion. There was a lack of consistent evidence for predictors of parental engagement. Nonetheless, preliminary evidence suggests that engagement enhancement strategies modelled on theories, such as the Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behaviour, may increase parents' engagement.

AB Background. This paper reports on: (1) an evaluation of a common elements treatment approach (CETA) developed for comorbid presentations of depression, anxiety, traumatic stress, and/or externalizing symptoms among children in three Somali refugee camps on the Ethiopian/Somali border, and (2) an evaluation of implementation factors from the perspective of staff, lay providers, and families who engaged in the intervention.
   Methods. This project was conducted in three refugee camps and utilized locally validated mental health instruments for internalizing, externalizing, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. Participants were recruited from either a validity study or from referrals from social workers within International Rescue Committee Programs. Lay providers delivered CETA to youth (CETA-Youth) and families, and symptoms were re-assessed post-treatment. Providers and families responded to a semi-structured interview to assess implementation factors.
   Results. Children who participated in the CETA-Youth open trial reported significant decreases in symptoms of internalizing (d = 1.37), externalizing (d = 0.85), and posttraumatic stress (d = 1.71), and improvements in well-being (d = 0.75). Caregivers also reported significant decreases in child symptoms. Qualitative results were positive toward the acceptability and appropriateness of treatment, and its feasibility.
   Conclusions. This project is the first to examine a common elements approach (CETA: defined as flexible delivery of elements, order, and dosing) with children and caregivers in a low-resource setting with delivery by lay providers. CETA-Youth may offer an effective treatment that is easier to implement and scale-up versus multiple focal interventions. A fullscale randomized clinical trial is warranted.

AB There is a significant need to develop objective measures for identifying children under the age of 8 who have anxiety and depression. If left untreated, early internalizing symptoms can lead to adolescent and adult internalizing disorders as well as comorbidity which can yield significant health problems later in life including increased risk for suicide. To this end, we propose the use of an instrumented fear induction task for identifying children with internalizing disorders, and demonstrate its efficacy in a sample of 63 children between the ages of 3 and 7. In so doing, we extract objective measures that capture the full six degree-of-freedom movement of a child using data from a belt-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) and relate them to behavioral fear codes, parent-reported child symptoms and clinician-rated child internalizing diagnoses. We find that IMU motion data, but not behavioral codes, are associated with parent-reported child symptoms and clinician-reported child internalizing diagnosis in this sample. These results demonstrate that IMU motion data are sensitive to behaviors indicative of child psychopathology. Moreover, the proposed IMU-based approach has increased feasibility of collection and processing compared to behavioral codes, and therefore should be explored further in future studies.

AB Background: Preventive efforts targeting childhood anxiety and depression symptoms have the potential to alter the developmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders across the lifespan. Substantial previous research suggests that modifiable parenting factors such as parental aversiveness and over-involvement are associated with childhood anxiety, depressive and internalising symptoms, indicating that parents can play a critical role in prevention. The Parenting Resilient Kids study is a new evidence-based online parenting program designed to prevent anxiety and depression problems in primary school-aged children by reducing family-based risk factors and enhancing protective factors through increased positive interactions between parent and child.
   Methods/design: The current study is a parallel group superiority randomised controlled trial with parent-child dyads randomised to the intervention or active-control group in a 1: 1 ratio. The intervention group will receive the Parenting Resilient Kids program consisting of a feedback report on parenting behaviours and up to 12 interactive online modules personalised based on responses to the parent survey. The active-control group will receive a standardised package of online educational materials about child development and wellbeing. The trial website is programmed to run a stratified random allocation sequence (based on parent gender) to determine group membership. We aim to recruit 340 parent-child dyads (170 dyads per group). We hypothesise that the intervention group will show greater improvement in parenting risk and protective factors from baseline to 3-month follow-up (primary outcome), which will in turn mediate changes in child depressive and anxiety symptoms from baseline to 12 and 24 months (co-primary outcomes). We also hypothesise that the intervention group will show greater benefits from baseline to 3-, 12- and 24-month follow-up, with regard to: child depressive and anxiety symptoms (co-primary outcomes); and child and parent health-related quality of life, and overall family functioning (secondary outcomes).
   Discussion: This randomised controlled trial will examine the efficacy of the Parenting Resilient Kids program as a preventive intervention for anxiety and depression symptoms in primary school-aged children, as well as changes in child and parent health-related quality of life. Findings from this study will examine design features that render web-based prevention programs effective and the extent to which parents can be engaged and motivated to change through a minimally guided parenting program.

TI Emotional availability in mothers with borderline personality disorder

AB Background: Both, maternal borderline personality disorder (BPD) and maternal major depressive disorder (MDD) are often associated with adverse consequences for children, including increased risk for child behavior problems. Reduced maternal emotional availability might play a critical role in transmitting maternal psychopathology on the child. Our aim was to investigate the association between emotional availability and maternal BPD and MDD in remission (rMDD), and if this interrelatedness mediates the association between maternal mental disorders and child behavior problems.
   Methods: The interaction of 178 mother-child dyads was assessed during a play situation using the Emotional Availability Scales. Children were between 5 and 12 years old. Regression analyses were used to investigate the impact of maternal BPD and maternal rMDD on emotional availability. Ordinary least squares regression analyses using bootstrapping were conducted to investigate the mediating effect of emotional availability on the association between maternal mental disorders and child behavior problems.
   Results: Mothers with BPD showed increased hostility during mother-child interaction, whereas history of MDD was associated with reduced sensitivity. Maternal hostility was a mediator between maternal BPD and number of child psychiatric disorders, as well as externalizing and internalizing behavior. Maternal sensitivity mediated the association between maternal rMDD and number of child psychiatric disorders, as well as internalizing child behavior.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that mothers with BPD show a qualitatively different pattern of emotional availability compared to mothers with rMDD. These patterns might reflect two separate pathways of transgenerational transmission of aspects of maternal mental disorders, where intervention and training programs could start: maternal rMDD impacts on child behavior problems via reduced sensitivity, and maternal BPD via increased hostility, which could both be addressed with specific therapeutic interventions.

AB Background: Internalizing problems are the most prevalent mental health problems in adolescents. Transdiagnostic programs are promising manners to treat multiple problems within the same protocol, however, there is limited research regarding the efficacy of such programs delivered as universal prevention programs in school settings. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the efficacy of a video-based transdiagnostic rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT) universal prevention program, for internalizing problems. The second objective of the present paper will be to investigate the subsequent mechanisms of change, namely maladaptive cognitions.
   Methods: A two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial will be conducted, with two groups: a video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program and a wait list control. Power analysis indicated that the study will involve 338 participants. Adolescents with ages between 12 and 17 years old, from several middle schools and high schools, will be invited to participate. Assessments will be conducted at four time points: baseline (T-1), postintervention (T-2), 3 months follow-up (T-3) and 12 months follow-up (T-4). Intent-to-treat analysis will be used in order to investigate significant differences between the two groups in both primary and secondary outcomes.
   Discussion: This is the first randomized controlled trial that aims to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of change of a video-based transdiagnostic REBT universal prevention program, delivered in a school context. The present study has important implications for developing efficient prevention programs, interactive, that will aim to target within the same protocol both anxiety and depressive symptoms.

   METAANALYSIS; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB Background
   Most evidence of the association between maternal depression and children's development is limited by being cross-sectional. To date, few studies have modelled trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms from pregnancy through the early postpartum years and examined their association with social emotional and behavior functioning in preschool children. The objectives of this study were to: 1) identify distinct groups of women defined by their trajectories of depressive symptoms across four time points from mid-pregnancy to one year postpartum; and 2) examine the associations between these trajectories and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from the All Our Families (AOF) study, a large, population based pregnancy cohort of mother-child dyads in Alberta, Canada. The AOF study is an ongoing pregnancy cohort study designed to investigate relationships between the prenatal and early life period and outcomes for children and mothers. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Children's behavioral functioning at age 3 was assessed using the Behavior Scales developed for the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Longitudinal latent class analysis was conducted to identify trajectories of women's depressive symptoms across four time points from pregnancy to 1 year postpartum. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and children's behavior, while adjusting for other significant maternal, child and psychosocial factors.
   Results
   1983 participants met eligibility criteria. We identified four distinct trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms: low level (64.7%); early postpartum (10.9%); subclinical (18.8%); and persistent high (5.6%). In multivariable models, the proportion of children with elevated behavior symptoms was highest for children whose mothers had persistent high depressive symptoms, followed by mothers with moderate symptoms (early postpartum and subclinical trajectories) and lowest for minimal symptoms. After accounting for demographic, child and psychosocial factors, the relationships between depression trajectories and child hyperactivity/inattention, physical aggression (subclinical trajectory only) and separation anxiety symptoms remained significant.
   Conclusion
   These findings suggest both externalizing and internalizing children's behaviors are associated with prolonged maternal depressive symptoms. There is a good case for the need to move beyond overly simplistic clinical cutoff approaches of depressed/not depressed in screening for perinatal depression. Women with elevated depressive symptoms at clinical and subclinical levels need to be identified, provided with evidence-based treatment, and monitored with repeat screening to improve maternal mental health outcomes and reduce the risk of associated negative outcomes on children's early social-emotional and behavior development.

AB This paper focuses on the longitudinal relationships between foster children's mental health problems and parental stress across a 1-year interval with three measurements. A sample of 94 foster children and a comparison group of 157 biological children and their families participated in this study. The age of the children was between 2 and 7 years. At the initial assessment, the foster children had been in their foster families since 2-24 months. Based on Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores, the results indicated increased internalizing and externalizing mental health problems in the foster children group. Both mental health scores remained rather stable across the longitudinal assessments in foster as well as in biological children. Internalizing as well as externalizing scores were substantially correlated with parental stress in both samples. Moreover, changes in mental health scores were associated with changes in parental stress. However, cross-lagged panel analyses showed no clear pattern of temporal relationships between children's mental health scores and parental stress. Implications as well as strengths and limitations of the current study are addressed in the Discussion section.

AB In the United States, parental incarceration (PI) has been increasingly recognized as an understudied adverse childhood experience. In response, a rapidly expanding body of research has begun to investigate the effects of PI on youth mental and physical health outcomes.
   Objective: The purpose of this integrative review was to synthesize recent quantitative evidence investigating the effects of PI on youths' mental and physical health outcomes.
   Design andMeasures: Electronic strategies were used to find relevant quantitative articles published between September 2006 and 2016 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- AnalysesEquity guidelines. Articles in the review (N = 17) varied in study design and methodologic rigor, complicating the analysis.
   Results: In general, U. S. youth exposed to PI are more likely than their unexposed peers to exhibit internalizing and externalizing behavioral difficulties. There is substantially less evidence on the associations between PI and the physical health of youth, in addition to the proposed linkages between exposure to PI and poor health. Overall, there is limited inclusion of contextual specifics of PI (e. g., type and duration of incarceration, relationship quality), which hampers generalizability. Conclusion: Future research could investigate the biological and social linkages between PI and health outcomes. Forensic nurses could help build supportive environments and meaningful behavioral health interventions to assist the health of those youth with a parent incarcerated.

AB Although the effect of physical and relational (i.e., traditional) victimization on psychopathology is established, the interdependent contribution of cybervictimization is unclear. We test a longitudinal path model theorizing that (a) children's physical and relational victimization in Grade 4 or 5 is associated with more cybervictimization experiences when they are in Grade 5 or 6 (when independent access to cybertechnology typically begins to increase), and (b) cybervictimization and traditional victimization experiences are associated with internalizing symptoms and aggressive behaviors at the end of Grade 5 or 6 (controlling for prior levels). Five waves of data were collected from children, parents, and teachers in 27 rural Canadian schools involved in an evaluation of a bullying-prevention program. Analyses for this study were based on the subsample of participants in Grades 5 and 6 (n = 714, M-age = 11.0) who completed cybervictimization questionnaires in the final two waves (i.e., fall and spring of 1 academic year). Participants also completed all other measures at each assessment point. All forms of victimization were correlated with internalizing symptoms and aggressive behaviors, within time. Across time, relational victimization was independently associated with more cybervictimization and physical victimization. Relational victimization was also independently associated with more aggressive behaviors for boys only, but not with internalizing symptoms for girls or boys. Physical and cybervictimization was not related to aggressive behaviors or internalizing symptoms over time. Prevention efforts that target relational victimization may reduce cybervictimization and physical victimization and aggressive behaviors in elementary school.

AB This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of parent training group interventions to treat child externalizing and/or internalizing problems. A search identified 21 randomized controlled trials of parent group interventions aimed at ameliorating child externalizing and/or internalizing problems in children aged 4-12 years. Random effects meta-analyses yielded significant pooled treatment effect size (g) estimates for child externalizing (g = -0.38) and internalizing problems (g = -0.18). Child anxiety symptoms or internalizing problems evident in children with externalizing behavior problems did not change significantly following intervention. Study quality was a statistically significant moderator of treatment response for child externalizing problems, however hours of planned parent group treatment and treatment recipient were not. Findings support the use of parent group interventions as an effective treatment for reducing externalizing problems in children aged 4-12 years. Whilst statistically significant, programs had a limited impact on internalizing symptoms, indicating a need for further investigation.

AB Objectives: Intergenerational acculturation conflict in immigrant families has been implicated as a risk factor for adolescent maladjustment. However, the directionality and specific family related mediators of this association have not been identified. The present study prospectively examined relations between adolescent reports of perceived acculturation conflict and internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms. Perceived parent-adolescent relationship strain and perceived parental psychological control were examined as potential mediators. Method: Survey measures were administered to 375 Vietnamese American adolescents (48.8% males; M = 15.55 years, SD = .59) at 3 time points over 6 months. Results: Using cross-lagged path analysis, perceived acculturation conflict predicted externalizing symptoms, whereas internalizing symptoms predicted perceived acculturation conflict. Perceived maternal psychological control mediated the association between perceived acculturation conflict and later externalizing symptoms, whereas maternal psychological control, parental unresponsiveness, and unmet parent expectations mediated the association between internalizing symptoms and later acculturation conflict. Conclusion: Culturally competent enhancement of parental sensitivity and responsiveness might be targeted as a modifiable protective factor in family-based preventive interventions for at-risk immigrant families.

AB Certain psychopathologies are often linked to dysregulation of specific emotions (e.g., anxiety is associated with dysregulation of fear), but few studies have examined how regulatory repertoires for specific emotions (e.g.. the strategies a person uses to regulate fear) relate to psychopathology, and fewer still have examined this in childhood. A total of 106 7- to 11-year-olds (M = 9.37 years; SD = 1.30; 44% girls) participated in a multimethod investigation of emotion regulation and psychopathology. Parents reported on family characteristics and children's symptoms. Resting parasympathetic function (respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) was measured to assess physiological regulation. Children were interviewed about past experiences that made them feel anger, fear, and sadness, and reported what they had done to make themselves feel better in each emotion context. The strategies children described were summed to create an emotion regulation strategy repertoire measure for each emotion. Children's resting RSA interacted with age to predict externalizing symptoms, such that low resting RSA was associated with more externalizing symptoms for younger children only. In contrast, the link between RSA and anxiety was qualified by both strategy repertoire for fear and age, such that higher resting RSA was most strongly associated with fewer anxiety symptoms for older children with larger strategy repertoires for fear. Contrary to our expectations, neither resting RSA nor strategy repertoire for sadness related to children's depressive symptoms. Findings underscore the importance of considering children's discrete emotion regulation strategy repertoires to more fully characterize the dysregulated affective processes associated with psychopathology in childhood.

AB A number of cross-sectional studies have consistently shown a correlation between childhood physical maltreatment, perceived social isolation and internalizing symptoms. Using a longitudinal, three-wave design, this study sought to assess the mediating role of perceived social isolation in adulthood in the association between childhood physical maltreatment and internalizing symptoms in adulthood. The study has a three-wave design. We used data collected from 1994 to 2008 within the framework of the Tromso Study (N = 4530), a representative prospective cohort study of men and women. Perceived social isolation was measured at a mean age of 54.7 years, and internalizing symptoms were measured at a mean age of 61.7 years. The difference-in-coefficients method was used to assess the indirect effects and the proportion (%) of mediated effects. Childhood physical maltreatment was associated with an up to 68% [relative risk (RR) = 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-2.13] higher risk of perceived social isolation in adulthood. Childhood physical maltreatment and perceived social isolation in adulthood were associated with greater levels of internalizing symptoms in adulthood (p < 0.01). A dose-response association was observed between childhood physical maltreatment and internalizing symptoms in adulthood (p < 0.001). Perceived social isolation in adulthood mediated up to 14.89% (p < 0.05) of the association between childhood physical maltreatment and internalizing symptoms in adulthood. The results of this study indicate the need to take perceived social isolation into account when considering the impact of childhood physical maltreatment on internalizing symptoms.

AB This study aims to estimate the prevalence of behavioral problems among left-behind children, migrant children and local children in China, and to compare the risks of behavioral problems among the three types of children. Data on 4479 children aged 6-16 used in this study were from a survey conducted in China in 2017. The school-age version of the Children Behavior Checklist was used to measure children's behavioral problems. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and logistic regressions were conducted. The prevalence of behavioral problems was 18.80% and 13.59% for left-behind children and migrant children, respectively, both of which were higher than that of local children. Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustments for individual and environmental variables, the likelihood of total, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems for left-behind children and migrant children were higher than those for local children; left-behind children had a higher likelihood of internalizing problems than externalizing problems, while migrant children had a higher prevalence of externalizing problems. Left-behind children had a higher prevalence of each specific syndrome than migrant and local children. Both individual and environmental factors were associated with child behavioral problems, and family migration may contribute to the increased risks. Left-behind and migrant children were more vulnerable than local children to behavioral problems.

AB Research has demonstrated an association between parenting stress and child behavior problems, and suggested levels of parenting stress are higher among parents of children at risk for behavior problems, such as those with autism and developmental delay (ASD/DD). The goal of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of parenting stress and child behavior problems among different clinical groups (i.e., ASD/DD, chronic illness, with or at-risk for behavioral and/or mood disorders). We also examined demographic and methodological variables as moderators and differences in overall levels of parenting stress between the clinical groups. This systematic review documents a link between parenting stress and child behavior problems with an emphasis on externalizing behavior. One-hundred thirty-three studies were included for quantitative analysis. Parenting stress was more strongly related to child externalizing (weighted ES r = 0.57, d = 1.39) than internalizing (weighted ES r = 0.37, d = 0.79) problems. Moderation analyses indicated that the association between parenting stress and behavior problems was stronger among studies which had mostly male and clinic-recruited samples. Overall, parenting stress levels were higher for parents of children with ASD/DD compared to parents of children from other clinical groups. Findings document the association between parenting stress and child behavior problems and highlight the importance of assessing parenting stress as part of routine care and throughout behavioral intervention programs, especially for groups of children at high risk for behavior problems, such as children with ASD/DD, in order to identify support for both the parent(s) and child.

AB This study investigated gender differences in the roles of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and substance use as pathways linking child physical and sexual abuse to risky sexual behavior among youth at risk of maltreatment. Path analysis was performed with 862 adolescents drawn from Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect Four waves of data collected in the United States were used: childhood physical and sexual abuse experiences (from ages 0-12) were assessed by Child Protective Services reports, internalizing and externalizing symptoms were measured at age 14, substance use was measured at age 16, and risky sexual behavior was measured at age 18. Physical abuse was directly associated with risky sexual behavior in boys but not girls. For girls, physical abuse had a significant indirect effect on risky sexual behavior via externalizing symptoms. Gender-focused preventive intervention strategies may be effective in reducing risky sexual behavior among at-risk adolescents.

AB Background: Research on early adversity, stress biology, and child development has grown exponentially in recent years. Findings: We review the current evidence for the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis as a stress-mediating mechanism between various forms of childhood adversity and psychopathology. We begin with a review of the neurobiology of the axis and evidence for relations between early adversity-HPA axis activity and HPA axis activity-psychopathology, as well as discuss the role of regulatory mechanisms and sensitive periods in development. Conclusions: We call attention to critical gaps in the literature to highlight next steps in this research including focus on developmental timing, sex differences, stress buffering, and epigenetic regulation. A better understanding of individual differences in the adversity-HPA axis-psychopathology associations will require continued work addressing how multiple biological and behavioral systems work in concert to shape development.

AB Previous studies have found evidence that interparental conflict, parents' coparenting behavior, and children's adjustment are reciprocally related. Most prior research, however, has failed to empirically distinguish between-family differences from within-family changes, limiting our understanding of how within-family fluctuations in each construct may be interrelated over time. In the present study, we focused on within-family associations among interparental conflict factors (i.e., verbal aggression and withdrawing), coparenting conflict, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Longitudinal data were drawn from 5 annual waves of survey data from 537 German families (i.e., mothers, fathers, and a focal child) in the German Family Panel (pairfam) study (Bruderl et al., 2015; Huinink et al., 2011). Data were analyzed with random intercept cross-lagged panel models, which partition variance into between-and within-person (or family) components in longitudinal data. Cross-lagged analyses of within-family variance revealed that fluctuations in interparental conflict did not predict child problems, but higher than typical child externalizing problems increased fathers' withdrawal and coparenting conflict in the future. Higher than average coparenting conflict within a given family predicted reductions in interparental verbal aggression, less maternal withdrawal, and fewer child externalizing problems. The findings demonstrate that analyses of within-family associations may provide new insights on mutual influences that unfold across time within families and are of particular importance for informing practice.

AB Background: Depression and anxiety disorders are significant contributors to burden of disease in young people, highlighting the need to focus preventive efforts early in life. Despite substantial evidence for the role of parents in the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders, there remains a need for translation of this evidence into preventive parenting interventions. To address this gap, we developed a single-session, Web-based, tailored psychoeducation intervention that aims to improve parenting practices known to influence the development of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of the intervention on parenting risk and protective factors and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescent participants.
   Methods: We conducted a single-blind, parallel group, superiority randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention with a 3-month waitlist control. The intervention is fully automated and consists of two components: (1) completion of an online self-assessment of current parenting practices against evidence-based parenting recommendations for the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders and (2) an individually tailored feedback report highlighting each parent's strengths and areas for improvement based on responses to the self-assessment. A community sample of 349 parents, together with 327 adolescents (aged 12-15 years), were randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control condition. Parents and adolescents completed online self-reported assessments of parenting and adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline, 1-month (parent-report of parenting only), and 3-month follow-up.
   Results: Compared with controls, intervention group parents showed significantly greater improvement in parenting risk and protective factors from baseline to 1-month and 3-month follow-up (F2,331.22=16.36, P<.001), with a small to medium effect size at 3-month follow-up (d=0.33). There were no significant effects of the intervention on adolescent-report of parenting or symptoms of depression or anxiety in the adolescents (all P>.05).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that a single-session, individually tailored, Web-based parenting intervention can improve parenting factors that are known to influence the development of depression and anxiety in adolescents. However, our results do not support the effectiveness of the intervention in improving adolescent depression or anxiety symptoms in the short-term. Long-term studies are required to adequately assess the relationship between improving parenting factors and adolescent depression and anxiety outcomes. Nonetheless, this is a promising avenue for the translation of research into a low-cost, sustainable, universal prevention approach.

AB Early life stress has been associated with disrupted functional connectivity between the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but it is unknown how early in development stress-related differences in amygdala-mPFC connectivity emerge. In a resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) analysis with 79 four-to seven-year-old children, we found a significant correlation between more adverse experiences and weaker amygdala-mPFC rs-FC. We also found that weaker amygdala-mPFC rs-FC was associated with higher levels of aggressive behavior and attention problems. These findings suggest that the impact of stress on emotional circuitry is detectable in early childhood and that this impact is associated with mental health difficulties. Connectivity in this circuit may be useful as a marker for mental health risk and for tracking the efficacy of early interventions.

AB Using data from the Child Supplement of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we compare trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors among children exposed to five patterns of poverty from birth to age 14: always or never poor - stable patterns; a single transition into or out of poverty, or repeated fluctuations in and out of poverty - changing patterns. We also examine how low maternal education and single parenthood interact with these poverty exposures to compound their adverse effects. Finally, we compare the magnitude of effects associated with the patterns of poverty exposure, as well as their interactions with low maternal education and single parenthood, on trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors to determine if they are significantly different. Results reveal that initial levels and rates of change in children's trajectories of externalizing and internalizing behaviors are similar across the three changing patterns of poverty exposure, leading us to combine them into a single group representing intermittent poverty. Initial disparities between children who are never poor and their counterparts who are always or intermittently poor are constant over time for internalizing behaviors and grow in magnitude for externalizing behaviors. The cumulative negative effect of poverty exposure over time is stronger for externalizing vs. internalizing behaviors. Low maternal education compounds the adverse effects of persistent poverty, an effect that is similar for externalizing and internalizing behaviors.

AB The negative effects of community violence exposure on child and adolescent mental health are well documented and exposure to community violence has been linked both to a number of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Our aim was, therefore, to investigate cross-cultural and gender differences in the relationship between community violence exposure and substance abuse. A self-report survey was conducted among 10,575, 12-18 year old adolescents in three different countries, Czech Republic (N = 4537), Russia (N = 2377) and US (N = 3661). We found that in all three countries both substance use and problem behavior associated with it increased similarly along with severity of violence exposure and this association was not gender-specific. It was concluded that in spite of the differences in the levels of violence exposure and substance use cross-culturally and by gender, the pattern of their association is neither culturally nor gender bound.

AB This article provides a quantitative and conceptual review of emotion regulation difficulties in trauma-exposed young people, and informs future directions in the field. Despite long-standing interest in the influence of emotion regulation difficulties on different internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders in childhood, several questions remain unresolved with respect to children and adolescents with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Meta-analytic data from adult victims suggest that emotion regulation problems are associated with PTSD, but this has never been studied in children and young people. We therefore provide a conceptual review of features related to the phenomenology, assessment, severity and treatment of emotion regulation difficulties in trauma-exposed children and young people. We combine this with a meta-analysis of published literature. We searched studies in Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase databases based on pre-selected criteria. Eight hundred and eighty-six papers were identified and 41 were included. We found that children and adolescents with a diagnosis of PTSD reported more emotion regulation difficulties than those who did not develop PTSD, and that the overall association between the two symptom dimensions was moderately strong. We identify a number of research priorities: the development of instruments to assess emotion regulation difficulties in children, the design of studies that describe its prevalence in young epidemiological traumatized samples, its predictive role in the onset, severity and persistence of post-traumatic symptoms, and its relevance as a moderator, outcome or treatment target for young survivors.

AB Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are associated with increased emotional problems which, in turn, exacerbate functional impairment. However, irritability, which relates both to internalizing and externalizing problems, has not been specifically examined in these youths. Irritability may be common and adversely impact functioning in pediatric FAPD, particularly for males who are more likely to experience such symptoms. The current study examined the relationship between irritability and psychosocial and pain-related impairment in youth with FAPD. Data were gathered as part of a larger study examining a psychological treatment for youth with FAPD and were compared to previously published data on irritability in healthy controls and in youth with severe emotional dysregulation. For the current study, participants (ages 9-14) with FAPD and caregivers completed measures of child irritability, pain-related and psychosocial functioning, and parent functioning. Pearson correlations revealed significant positive associations between irritability and anxiety, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and caregiver distress. Results also indicated that parents reported significantly greater irritability in males, but males and females reported similar rates of irritability. Gender moderated the relationship between child-report of irritability and anxiety only. Future research may include tailoring of behavioral intervention approaches for pediatric FAPD to specifically target symptoms of irritability.

AB Background: The co-occurrence of disordered eating and alcohol use and misuse has frequently been highlighted in literature.
   Method: The first aim of the present study was to examine the association of drunkorexia with various disordered eating behaviors and alcohol consumption in a sample of male and female adolescents. The second goal was to investigate the motivations underlying drunkorexia and the third goal was to examine the relationship between drunkorexia and different dimensions of emotion regulation. One thousand adolescents (608 females and 392 males; range 16-21) completed a survey of self-report measures.
   Results: Results from hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that fasting and engaging in binge drinking and getting drunk were significant predictors of drunkorexia in both males and females; furthermore, females were found to engage in drunkorexia mainly for enhancement motives. Conversely, drunkorexia in males was significantly predicted by difficulties regulating emotions.
   Conclusion: This research suggests that disordered eating and alcohol use similarly contribute to drunkorexia in male and female adolescents, even though highlights important gender differences.

AB Emotion differentiation is the ability to identify and label emotional experiences into discrete categories. The present study examined the influence of emotion regulation difficulties, emotion differentiation, and emotional state-specifically sad versus positive mood-on caloric intake in a laboratory setting. Undergraduate participants completed a series of questionnaires, including measures of emotion regulation difficulties and emotion differentiation, and then underwent a randomly assigned sad or positive mood induction. Afterwards, they participated in a taste test. Food was counted before and after the taste test to determine total caloric intake. Results showed that negative emotion differentiation was significantly inversely associated with overall caloric intake, such that low negative emotion differentiators ate more regardless of mood induction group. Positive emotion differentiation was not associated with caloric intake. Additional analysis found that negative emotion differentiation mediated the relation between emotion regulation difficulties and caloric intake. An alternative model found that emotion regulation difficulties did not mediate the relation between negative emotion differentiation and caloric intake. Our results suggest that reducing caloric intake among individuals with emotion regulation difficulties may involve incorporating strategies to specifically target the ability to differentiate between emotions.

AB The molecular bases of behavior problems in young infants are related to genetic and epigenetic determinants of children's behavior. It has been estimated that 7% of preschoolers and 13-20% of school-aged children and adolescents suffer from internalizing and/or externalizing problems. Researchers in the field are involved in the search for specific epigenetic patterns related to the prenatal environment using cutting-edge approaches like the candidate gene, the genome-wide, and epigenome-wide approaches. The present review article will discuss all these latest innovations in order to better understand molecular bases of behavior problems in young infants that shall definitely result in better treatment planning.

AB Abnormalities in reward and punishment processing are implicated in the development of conduct problems (CP), particularly among youth with callous-unemotional (CU) traits. However, no studies have examined whether CP children with high versus low CU traits exhibit differences in the neural response to reward and punishment. A clinic-referred sample of CP boys with high versus low CU traits (ages 8-11; n = 37) and healthy controls (HC; n = 27) completed a fMRI task assessing reward and punishment processing. CP boys also completed a randomized control trial examining the effectiveness of an empirically-supported intervention (i.e., Stop-Now-And-Plan; SNAP). Primary analyses examined pre-treatment differences in neural activation to reward and punishment, and exploratory analyses assessed whether these differences predicted treatment outcome. Results demonstrated associations between CP and reduced amygdala activation to punishment independent of age, race, IQ and co-occurring ADHD and internalizing symptoms. CU traits were not associated with reward or punishment processing after accounting for covariates and no differences were found between CP boys with high versus low CU traits. While boys assigned to SNAP showed a greater reduction in CP, differences in neural activation were not associated with treatment response. Findings suggest that reduced sensitivity to punishment is associated with early-onset CP in boys regardless of the level of CU traits.

AB An individual's internalizing symptoms have been shown to relate to greater symptoms in family members. However, an examination of how family members' symptoms are associated with one another is needed with a model including mothers, fathers, and children. Using 633 families from the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, the current study examines relations between different family members' internalizing symptoms over time. In the archival data set, mothers', fathers', and children's internalizing symptoms at first, third, and fifth grades were assessed during home and laboratory visits. We tested a cross-lagged path model to assess transactional associations with family income-to-needs ratio and child gender as covariates. In the model, more maternal internalizing symptoms at first and third grades were associated with greater child symptoms at third and fifth grades. More child symptoms at first and third grades were associated with greater maternal symptoms at third and fifth grades. Additionally, more child symptoms at third grade were associated with greater paternal symptoms at fifth grade. These results highlight the importance of examining how family members' internalizing symptoms are associated longitudinally in understanding family systems processes.

AB Aims: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age.
   Results: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.
   Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

AB Using data of 40 native Dutch teachers and their native majority (n = 112) and ethnic minority students (n = 180), this study examined to what extent teachers experience differences in self-efficacy in teaching individual majority and minority students. We hypothesized that teachers would feel less self-efficacious in relation to ethnic minority students and that the difference in self-efficacy would be more pronounced when ethnic group differences are more salient (i.e., in the context of behavioral problems, ethnically less diverse classrooms, and for teachers with high ethnic identification). Our results show that teachers feel somewhat less self-efficacious with ethnic minority versus majority students. And, the difference in self-efficacy with minority versus majority students was more pronounced in relation to internalizing problem behaviors and somewhat more distinct in classrooms with relatively few ethnic minority students. The findings indicate the importance of a student specific assessment of teacher self-efficacy in diverse school contexts.

AB Risk for neuropsychiatric disorders is complex and includes an individual's internal genetic endowment and their environmental experiences and exposures. Embryonic development captures a particularly complex period, in which genetic and environmental factors can interact to contribute to risk. These environmental factors are incorporated differently into the embryonic brain than postnatal one. Here, we comprehensively review the human and animal model literature for studies that assess the interaction between genetic risks and one particular environmental exposure with strong and complex associations with neuropsychiatric outcomes prenatal maternal stress. Gene-environment interaction has been demonstrated for stress occurring during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Additional work demonstrates that prenatal stress risk may be similarly complex. Animal model studies have begun to address some underlying mechanisms, including particular maternal or fetal genetic susceptibilities that interact with stress exposure and those that do not. More specifically, the genetic underpinnings of serotonin and dopamine signaling and stress physiology mechanisms have been shown to be particularly relevant to social, attentional, and internalizing behavioral changes, while other genetic factors have not, including some growth factor and hormone-related genes. Interactions have reflected both the diathesis stress and differential susceptibility models. Maternal genetic factors have received less attention than those in offspring, but strongly modulate impacts of prenatal stress. Priorities for future research are investigating maternal response to distinct forms of stress and developing whole-genome methods to examine the contributions of genetic variants of both mothers and offspring, particularly including genes involved in neurodevelopment. This is a burgeoning field of research that will ultimately contribute not only to a broad understanding of psychiatric pathophysiology but also to efforts for personalized medicine.

AB Child abuse and neglect can lead to difficulties regulating responses to threatening and emotional situations. Exposure to childhood maltreatment has been linked to conflicting findings of both attention biases toward and away from threat-related information. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether emotion regulation moderated the association between history of childhood maltreatment and attention bias in a sample of postpartum women. One hundred forty women participated in the study at 7 months postpartum. Selective attention to both negative emotional and attachment-related negative emotional words was assessed using the Emotional Stroop task. The latent variable of difficulties with emotion regulation was found to significantly moderate the association between history of childhood maltreatment and attention bias to both negative emotional beta = -0.15, r = -2.04. p < .05) and attachment-related negative emotional stimuli (beta = -0.16, t = -2.98, p < .05). In women with higher childhood trauma scores, those with greater emotion regulation difficulties displayed decreased attention to negative emotional and attachment-related emotional stimuli. In contrast, women reporting higher exposure to childhood maltreatment with greater emotion regulation capacity, displayed increased attention toward negative emotional and attachment-related emotional stimuli. This study provides evidence for attentional avoidance of emotional material in postpartum women with greater experiences of maltreatment and difficulties with emotion regulation. As the postpartum period has significant implications for maternal well-being and infant development, these findings are discussed in terms of maternal responsiveness, sensitivity to threat, and the intergenerational transmission of risk.

AB Risk for traumatic sequelae is conveyed directly by risk factors (i.e., exposure to trauma), and via the disruption of developmental competencies. Exposure to caregiver trauma is an especially salient risk factor, as its early and pervasive nature is likely to undermine multiple facets of development, most notably the emergence of cognitive controls (i.e., executive function [EF]). Deficits in EF have been observed among youth exposed to multiple types of trauma and are associated with a range of functional impairments, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and behavioral disorders; they represent a mechanism by which the negative impact of caregiver trauma is conveyed. This study included 672 youth in residential placement, and examined the associations between both caregiver and noncaregiver trauma, measured by the Trauma History Profile (THP); executive dysfunction, measured by the Behavioral Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF); PTSS, measured by the UCLA Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Reaction Index (PTSD-RI); and externalizing and internalizing problems, measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A structural equation model demonstrated direct associations between caregiver trauma and PTSS, beta = .15; noncaregiver trauma and externalizing problems, beta = .14; gender and PTSS, beta = .26, externalizing problems, beta = .12, and internalizing problems, beta = .26; and age and externalizing problems, beta = -.11. We observed indirect effects via deficits in EF between caregiver trauma and PTSS, beta = .04 and externalizing problems, beta = .19. Results indicate for screening for executive dysfunction among trauma-impacted youth is needed, as it represents a critical therapeutic target.

AB Sexual minority youth experience elevated rates of internalizing disorders; it is, therefore, important to identify protective factors that decrease risk for psychological distress in this population. In this study, we examined whether involvement in a romantic relationship, a well-established protective factor for mental health among heterosexual adults, is also protective for young sexual minorities. Using eight waves of data provided by a community sample of 248 racially diverse sexual minority youth (ages 16-20 years at baseline), we assessed within-person associations between relationship involvement and psychological distress. Results from multilevel structural equation models indicated that, overall, participants reported less psychological distress at waves when they were in a relationship than when they were not. However, findings differed as a function of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. Specifically, although relationship involvement predicted lower psychological distress for Black and gay/lesbian participants, the association was not present for White participants and, for bisexuals, relationship involvement predicted higher distress. In addition, relationship involvement reduced the negative association between victimization based on sexual minority status and psychological distress, suggesting a stress-buffering effect that did not differ based on demographic factors. Together, these findings suggest that being in a romantic relationship may promote mental health for many, but not all, young sexual minorities, highlighting the importance of attending to differences among subgroups of sexual minorities in research, theory, and efforts to reduce mental health disparities.

AB Despite nonoverlapping criterion sets, conduct disorder and depression co-occur at much higher rates than expected by chance. Contemporary model-based approaches to explaining heterotypic comorbidity use factor analysis and its variants to evaluate interrelations among symptoms in large population-based and twin samples. These analyses invariably yield broadband internalizing and externalizing factors, which load on a higher-order general liability factor-findings that are robust across age and informant. Although model-based approaches elucidate structural aspects of comorbidity, they are variable-centered, and usually cross-sectional. Most therefore do not assess developmental continuity of comorbidity, or whether noncomorbid individuals are prospectively vulnerable to heterotypic comorbidity. We use an accelerated longitudinal design to evaluate growth in parent-reported conduct problems (CPs) and depression among children, ages 8-15 years, who were recruited at study entry into depressed only (n = 27), CPs only (n = 28), comorbid (n = 81), and control (n = 70) groups based on levels of symptoms. Consistent with normative developmental trends across this age range, steep growth in depression was exhibited by all groups, including those who reported only CPs at study entry. In contrast, growth in CPs was restricted to those who reported high symptoms at intake (with or without comorbid depression), compared with low and stable among depressed only and control participants. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, using carefully ascertained "pure" versus comorbid groups who were followed naturalistically, that comorbid depression is likely to develop among those with pure CPs, but comorbid CPs are not likely to develop among those with pure depression.

AB Objective: The current study investigates the correlational structure of psychopathology in a large sample of Canadian adolescents and highlights the association between the psychopathological dimensions and gender.
   Method: Data came from 3826 Canadian adolescents aged 12.8 0.4 y. Five alternative dimensional models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis, and the association between gender, language, and the mean level of psychopathological dimensions was examined using a multiple-indicators multiple-causes model.
   Results: A bifactor model with 1 general psychopathology factor and 3 specific dimensions (internalizing, externalizing, thought disorder) provided the best fit to the data. Results indicated metric invariance of the bifactor structure with respect to language. Females reported higher mean levels of internalizing, and males reported higher mean levels of externalizing. No significant sex differences emerged in liability to thought disorder or general psychopathology. The presence of a general psychopathology factor increased the association between gender and specific dimensions.
   Conclusions: The current study is the first to highlight the bifactor structure including a specific thought disorder factor in a Canadian sample of adolescents. The findings further highlight the importance of transdiagnostic approaches to prevention and intervention among young adolescents.

AB A dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) group has been conducted for a number of years at a public outpatient clinic for adolescents suffering with emotional regulation difficulties and their families. A detailed account of the rationale, design, and content of both the adolescent and parent groups are provided. Data from these groups adds to the limited evidence regarding the efficacy of such groups. A retrospective analysis of changes in the adolescent participants' emotional dysregulation, depression, anxiety and stress, following their participation in the group (N = 12) was conducted. Several substantial improvements were noted across the measures of psychopathology, following the completion of the group. These findings support the teaching of DBT skills to adolescents and their families, with some modifications being appropriate for their application to this population. Future avenues for research stemming from the group program are also discussed.

AB A person-centered approach applied to the Inventory of Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEA) would provide a holistic outlook on this developmental period. This study aimed to (1) determine the presence of distinct profiles based on the IDEA scales and (2) compare these profiles with regard to sociodemographic indicators, internalizing problems, and problematic alcohol use. Participants (N = 307; mean age = 21) filled out the IDEA and questionnaires assessing internalizing problems and problematic alcohol use. Four profiles were identified: stalled transition (5%), moderate transition (43%), positive transition (35%), and transitional time (17%). Individuals in the transitional time profile reported higher internalizing problems and higher problematic alcohol use than youths assigned to the other profiles. These results suggest that applying a person-centered approach to the IDEA allows for the identification of distinct profiles with regard to the features of emerging adulthood and reported adjustment issues.

Participants were 534 early adolescents (T1: M age = 10.89, SD = .70; 50% female), their mothers (n = 534), and their fathers (n = 431). Families were drawn from Colombia, Italy, and the USA. Follow-up data were obtained two (T2) and three (T3) years later. At T1 and T3, parents' self-efficacy beliefs were self reported and internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed via mothers', fathers', and early adolescents' reports. At T2, early adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs were self-reported Within the overall sample, mothers with higher self-efficacy beliefs about anger regulation had children with similar beliefs. Early adolescents' low self-efficacy beliefs were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB This study aimed to characterize adolescent family functioning typologies using latent profile analysis (LPA). A secondary aim was to examine profile associations with adolescent internalizing symptoms at one-year follow-up. Students (N = 1029; 53% female; mean age = 16.14, SD = .75 years) completed measures of family functioning, anxiety, and depressive symptoms at two time points. LPA was conducted to characterize family functioning typologies at Time 1, revealing five profiles: 1) Low Family Functioning, 2) Only Close to Father, 3) Average Family Functioning, 4) Only Close to Mother, and 5) High Family Functioning. Results indicated that the Low and Only Close to Mother profiles had greater depressive symptoms at Time 2, compared with the Average profile. The High profile had fewer depressive symptoms at Time 2. The Low and Only Close to Mother profiles also had significantly more anxiety symptoms at Time 2. Findings highlight the utility of examining family functioning profiles.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between ADHD and comorbid psychiatric disorders among adults from a population-based birth cohort. Method: Participants were recruited from all children born between 1976 and 1982 remaining in Rochester, Minnesota, after age 5. Participants with childhood ADHD (n = 232; M age = 27.0 years; 72% men) and non-ADHD controls (n = 335; M age = 28.6 years; 63% men) completed a structured interview (M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview) assessing current ADHD status and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Results: Among 232 with childhood ADHD, 68 (49 men, 19 women) had persistent adult ADHD. Compared with non-ADHD controls and non-persistent ADHD participants, adults with persistent ADHD were significantly more likely to have any or each of 12 psychiatric comorbidities. The associations retained significant or marginally significant when stratified by gender. Externalizing psychiatric disorders were more common in men (74%) and internalizing disorders in women (58%). Conclusion: Persistent ADHD is associated with an increased risk of comorbid psychiatric disorders in adult men and women.

AB The goals of the present study were to (a) develop and validate a new self-report measure of social avoidance for use among early adolescents in mainland China and (b) explore the links between subtypes of social withdrawal (i. e., shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance) and indices of socio-emotional difficulties in this cultural context. Participants were 663 early adolescents (350 boys, 313 girls) attending elementary schools (X age = 10.25 years) and middle schools (X age = 12.53 years) in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Measures of social withdrawal subtypes and adjustment were collected using multi-source assessments, including self-reports, peer nominations, and teacher ratings. The results provided evidence in support of the reliability and validity of the new scale of self-reported social avoidance. Shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance were also all uniquely associated with emotion dysregulation and self-reported internalizing problems. However, only social avoidance was uniquely associated with teacher-rated emotion symptoms and peer problems (as rated by both peers and teachers). Results are discussed in terms of the reasons why social avoidance may have particularly negative implications for early adolescents in China.

AB PurposeTo investigate predictors of conduct problem (CP) treatment in an outpatient child psychiatry clinic.
   Design and MethodsMedical records (N = 78) of youth with CPs (71% male; mean age = 9.9 years) were analyzed to determine how treatment history, race, gender, travel distance, aggression symptoms, internalizing disorder symptoms, and age of diagnosis influenced initial treatment decisions.
   FindingsSeverity of aggression symptoms and travel distance significantly increased the likelihood that initial treatments included psychotropic medication. Travel distance also moderated the relationship between history of psychosocial intervention for CPs and treatment recommendations.
   Practice ImplicationsAdhering to treatment guidelines for youth with CPs is essential for furthering evidence-based psychiatric nursing care.

TI Associations of Gross Motor Delay, Behavior, and Quality of Life in
   Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder
SO PHYSICAL THERAPY
LA English
DT Article

AB Background. Young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have gross motor delays that may accentuate problem daytime behavior and health-related quality of life (QoL).
   Objective. The objective of this study was to describe the degree of gross motor delays in young children with ASD and associations of gross motor delays with problem daytime behavior and QoL. The primary hypothesis was that Gross motor delays significantly modifies the associations between internalizing or externalizing problem daytime behavior and QoL.
   Design. This study used a cross-sectional, retrospective analysis.
   Mathods. Data from 3253 children who were 2 to 6 years old and who had ASD were obtained from the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network and analyzed using unadjusted and adjusted linear regression. Measures included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 2nd edition, gross motor v-scale score (VABS-GM) (for Gross motor delays), the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (for Problem daytime behavior), and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) (for QoL).
   Results. The mean VABS-GM was 12.12 (SD = 2.2), representing performance at or below the 16th percentile. After adjustment for covariates, the internalizing CBCL t score decreased with increasing VABS-GM (beta = -0.64 SE = 0.12). Total and subscale PedsQL scores increased with increasing VABS-GM (for total score: beta = 1.79 SE = 0.17; for subscale score: beta = 0.9-2.66 SE = 0.17-0.25). CBCL internalizing and externalizing t scores decreased with increasing PedsQL total score (beta = -0.39 SE = 0.01; beta = -0.36 SE = 0.01). The associations between CBCL internalizing or externalizing t scores and PedsQL were significantly modified by VABSGM (beta = -0.026 SE = 0.005]; beta = -0.019 SE = 0.007).
   Limitations. The study lacked ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. Measures were collected via parent report without accompanying clinical assessment.
   Conclusions. Cross motor delay was independently associated with Problem daytime behavior and QoL in children with ASD. Gross motor delay modified the association between Problem daytime behavior and QoL. Children with ASD and co-occurring internalizing Problem daytime behavior had greater Gross motor delays than children without internalizing Problem daytime behavior; therefore, these children may be most appropriate for early physical therapist evaluation.

AB The influence of relationship skills education on pathways of associations between paternal depressive symptoms and intimate partner violence and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors via paternal warmth and avoidance of destructive conflict behavior was assessed. Participants were 3,045 low-income Hispanic American, European American, and African American fathers from the Building Strong Families Study. Families were drawn from 8 urban and rural areas across the United States and randomly assigned to a treatment and a control group. The treatment group received relationship skills education in group sessions. Assessments were conducted when children were 15 months and 36 months of age postintervention. Avoidance of destructive conflict behavior mediated the associations between intimate partner violence and children's externalizing behavior for compliers. Links between intimate partner violence and children's behavioral difficulties were direct for fathers in the noncomplier and control groups. Data are discussed in terms of the possible influence of relationship skills education on the associations between fathers' personal functioning and children's behavioral difficulties.

AB The current study examined whether students' perceptions of school disorder influenced their psychosocial outcomes directly and indirectly via connectedness to school. The current study also explored moderation by the presence of a supportive figure in the school and investigated gender differences. Participants were 28,104 high school students. Results indicated that students' perceptions of school disorder predicted more externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms directly and indirectly via reduced connectedness to school. Perceived school disorder also indirectly predicted lower academic grades. The presence of a supportive figure in the school lessened the detrimental influence of school disorder on student outcomes. Results also indicated that male students may stand to benefit more from the protective influence of a supportive figure in the school.

AB Although studies have documented the pronounced and negative impact of adolescent maltreatment on short and long-term development, there is limited research about the risk factors and experiences of adolescents who are reported to the child welfare system. This study addresses this knowledge gap by using data from the provincially representative Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (OIS-2013) to identify the characteristics of the alleged maltreatment, functioning concerns, caregiver risk factors, and socioeconomic conditions associated with the decision to provide ongoing child welfare services to adolescents and their families. In 2013, there were an estimated 34,968 investigations of maltreatment-related concerns involving adolescents and 26.5% of these cases were transferred to ongoing services. A number of factors were associated with this decision, including: adolescents' race/ethnicity, internalizing problems, and difficulties in the quality of the relationship with their primary caregiver; investigations involving potential abandonment, exposure to intimate partner violence, and co-occurring maltreatment; and caregivers' social isolation, mental health concerns, and substance abuse. A multivariable tree-classification found that the presence of internalizing problems was a primary factor influencing the decision to provide ongoing child welfare services, followed by caregiver social isolation, relationship difficulties between the caregiver and the adolescent, caregiver mental health concerns, and co-occurring maltreatment. The results suggest that adolescents investigated by Ontario child welfare authorities are experiencing troubling circumstances coupled with their caregivers' challenges, which may be impacting their relationships to the point that it determines their need for ongoing child welfare services.

AB Background Chronic pain is a pervasive condition in adolescence and is associated with significant psychological distress, functional disability, social isolation, and decreased quality of life for a subset of affected youth. There is a paucity of research examining potential resilience factors and adaptive processes in pediatric chronic pain. Benefit finding refers to the process of perceiving positive consequences in the face of adversity. Previous research on benefit finding in pediatric samples (e.g., oncology; acute injury) has yielded inconsistent results. This is the first study to examine this construct in youth with chronic pain. Objective The objective of the current investigation was to extend previous research on benefit finding to adolescents with chronic pain and to assess relationships between benefit finding, internalizing mental health symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder [ PTSD]), pain outcomes (pain intensity and interference), and quality of life. Methods Psychometrically sound self-report measures of benefit finding, anxiety, depressive, and PTSD symptoms, pain intensity, pain interference, and quality of life were completed by 145 youth (67.4% female, M-age = 13.3 years, SD = 2.6), referred to a tertiary-level chronic pain program. Results Benefit finding was significantly correlated with internalizing mental health symptoms, pain outcomes, and quality of life. Further, benefit finding significantly predicted children's self-reported pain intensity, pain interference, and quality of life when controlling for age and sex. Conclusions Findings suggest that benefit finding is associated with internalizing mental health symptoms, pain outcomes, and quality of life in youth with chronic pain. Future research examining this construct is warranted.

AB Objective Identifying factors contributing to high medical utilization and productivity loss is important, given the high cost of pediatric chronic pain. The current study examined chronic pain acceptance as a predictor of medical utilization and school absenteeism in adolescents with chronic pain. Methods: In all, 122 adolescents (aged 12-21 years) with chronic pain and their parents/guardians completed questionnaires assessing medical visits (past 6 months), medication usage, and number of school absences (past month). Homebound school status was also reported. Adolescents completed the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire and pain intensity ratings, and underwent a diagnostic psychological evaluation. Results: Multivariate generalized linear model analyses indicated lower pain acceptance predicted increased inpatient hospitalizations and higher number of opioid and nonopioid prescription medications, controlling for pain intensity, age, and sex. Pain acceptance was not associated with outpatient consultations or number of nonprescription medications. Exploratory moderation analyses indicated lower pain acceptance significantly predicted increased emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations for patients diagnosed with an internalizing psychological disorder. Patients in homebound schooling reported low pain acceptance and for those in school full-time, linear regression indicated lower pain acceptance significantly predicted higher number of school absences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that lower pain acceptance contributes to the use of higher-level medical care (especially for adolescents with internalizing disorders) and increased productivity loss owing to school absences or homebound school status. Clinical implications exist for recommending acceptance-based interventions for pain acceptance promotion and continued development of cost-effective, easily disseminated acceptance-based therapy modules to curb the economic burden of chronic pain.

AB Objective To determine whether the experience of persistent epigastric pain is associated with sleep disturbances in children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). We hypothesized that children with EoE and persistent epigastric pain would (1) self-report greater current and worst pain severity, and (2) experience more disturbed sleep on objective and subjective measures in comparison with children with EoE but no persistent pain and healthy children. Methods Fifty children with EoE were recruited for this cross-sectional study, of which 24 (48%) reported experiencing persistent epigastric pain. The remaining 26 (52%) children with EoE denied experiencing persistent pain. An additional 25 healthy children without EoE or persistent pain were included. All children provided severity ratings of current pain and worst pain experienced over the past week. Children then completed 12 consecutive nights of ambulatory sleep monitoring via actigraphy in the home. Caregivers provided information regarding their child's sleep patterns and internalizing symptoms. Results Children with EoE and persistent pain reported significantly greater severity of current pain (p<. 001) and worst pain over the past week (p<. 001) compared with EoE without persistent pain and healthy children. Compared with the other groups, children with EoE and persistent pain also demonstrated greater actigraphic sleep disturbances, lower sleep efficiency (p = .004) and greater wake after sleep onset (p = .034). Conclusions This study provides novel evidence that a significant proportion of children with EoE experience persistent symptoms of epigastric pain. Persistent pain was associated with significant sleep disturbances in children with EoE.

AB Although research has shown fade-out of the cognitive benefits of classroom-based preschool interventions, less is known regarding the durability of social-emotional impacts. This study examines the extent to which the multicomponent Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP) intervention lowered risk of internalizing, externalizing, attention, and social difficulties from Head Start through elementary school for 602 low-income children. Results suggest that most children in this sample showed few social-emotional difficulties over time. However, one quarter of the sample exhibited profiles of transitory or building difficulties over six years. Random assignment to the CSRP preschool intervention significantly reduced children's odds of transitory attention and social difficulties in middle childhood, with preliminary evidence suggesting stronger impacts for children attending elementary schools characterized by low academic rigor and high neighborhood crime. CSRP was not found to be effective in preventing more robust, increasing forms of difficulty in the externalizing and attention domains. Implications for early childhood intervention and policy are discussed.

ID ANEMIA; BEHAVIOR; SCALE
AB Objective To evaluate associations between iron supplementation and iron deficiency in infancy and internalizing, externalizing, and social problems in adolescence.
   Study design The study is a follow-up of infants as adolescents from working-class communities around Santiago, Chile who participated in a preventive trial of iron supplementation at 6 months of age. Inclusionary criteria included birth weight >= 3.0 kg, healthy singleton term birth, vaginal delivery, and a stable caregiver. Iron status was assessed at 12 and 18 months of age. At 11-17 years of age, internalizing, externalizing, and social problems were reported by 1018 adolescents with the Youth Self Report and by parents with the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results Adolescents who received iron supplementation in infancy had greater self-reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder but lower parent-reported conduct disorder symptoms than those who did not (Ps<.05). Iron deficiency with or without anemia at 12 or 18 months of age predicted greater adolescent behavior problems compared with iron sufficiency: more adolescent-reported anxiety and social problems, and parent-reported social, posttraumatic stress disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant, conduct, aggression, and rule breaking problems (Ps <.05). The threshold was iron deficiency with or without anemia for each of these outcomes.
   Conclusions Iron deficiency with or without anemia in infancy was associated with increased internalizing, externalizing, and social problems in adolescence.

AB The effects of witnessing and experiencing crime have seldom been disaggregated. Little research has assessed the effect of multiple exposures to crime. We assess independent contributions of self-reported crime and area-level crime to adolescent behavioral health outcomes. Cross sectional data on 5519 adolescents from the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and their Families Program was linked to FBI crime rate data to assess associations of mutually exclusive categories of self-reported crime exposure and area-level crime rates with mental health and substance abuse. Self-reported crime exposure was significantly associated with poorer behavioral health. Violent victimization had the largest association with all outcomes except internalizing scores. All self-reported crime variables were significantly associated with three of the outcomes. Area-level crime rates were associated with one mental health outcome. Providers should assess direct and indirect crime exposure rather than only focusing on violent victimization.

AB How do joint measures of premorbid cognitive ability and familial cognitive aptitude (FCA) reflect risk for a diversity of psychiatric and substance use disorders? To address this question, we examined, using Cox models, the predictive effects of school achievement (SA) measured at age 16 and FCA-assessed from SA in siblings and cousins, and educational attainment in parents-on risk for 12 major psychiatric syndromes in 1 140 608 Swedes born 1972-1990. Four developmental patterns emerged. In the first, risk was predicted jointly by low levels of SA and high levels of FCA-that is a level of SA lower than would be predicted from the FCA. This pattern was strongest in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, and weakest in bipolar illness. In these disorders, a pathologic process seems to have caused cognitive functioning to fall substantially short of familial potential. In the second pattern, seen in the internalizing conditions of major depression and anxiety disorders, risk was associated with low SA but was unrelated to FCA. Externalizing disorders-drug abuse and alcohol use disorders-demonstrated the third pattern, in which risk was predicted jointly by low SA and low FCA. The fourth pattern, seen in eating disorders, was directly opposite of that observed in externalizing disorders with risk associated with high SA and high FCA. When measured together, adolescent cognitive ability and FCA identified four developmental patterns leading to diverse psychiatric disorders. The value of cognitive assessments in psychiatric research can be substantially increased by also evaluating familial cognitive potential.

AB Caregivers of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience elevated distress. The current study examined potential protective factors against caregiver distress when child externalizing and internalizing behaviors are present: family resources, perceived social support, parenting efficacy, knowledge of ASD, and the agreement between actual and perceived knowledge of ASD. Caregivers of a child with ASD completed an online questionnaire. Results demonstrated main effects for externalizing behavior, family resources, and perceived social support. Significant interactions were found among parenting efficacy and internalizing behavior, and the agreement between actual and perceived knowledge with both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results indicate important factors that should be emphasized when working with families of a child with ASD.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the influence of parental intolerance of Uncertainty (IU), sensory sensitivity (SS) and Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP), as well as the severity of their children's autism symptoms and co-morbid symptoms, on the mental health of Chinese parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). One hundred and twenty-two parents (86.9% mothers; M (age) = 35.64 years, SD = 4.21) of children with ASD took part. Regression and mediation analyses showed that children's internalizing difficulties, parental BAP and IU had a direct effect, and SS had an indirect effect through IU, on parental mental health. We did not find a significant relationship between parental mental health and children's ASD severity. Our findings emphasise the need to focus on parental traits when considering their well-being and mental health, and have implications for the design of evidence-based services to support the needs of parents.

AB The potential clinical needs of typically developing (TD) siblings of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain disputed. A total of 239 mothers of youth aged 6-17, including one youth with ASD (M = 11.14 years; simplex families) and at least one other youth (M = 11.74 years) completed online standardized measures of various familial factors and TD youth outcomes. Overall, only 6-23% of siblings were identified within the clinical range of emotional, behavioral, or social functioning. Both maternal depression and sibling relationship were identified as key pathways in predicting siblings' functioning within a good-fitting path analysis model. The current model is presented as a novel base for the development of future research and services for this unique population of children.

AB A dyadic microanalysis approach was used to examine emotion coregulation processes in mother-child interactions in relation to children's maladaptive behaviors. Seventy-two mother-child dyads (46 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); 26 neurotypical children) were previously videotaped in a semi-structured play procedure at home and mothers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Mother-child interactions were reliably coded in 5-second intervals and analyzed using Space State Grid software. Regression analyses supported moderation, whereby greater dyadic flexibility and more mutual-positive engagements were significantly associated with lower levels of maladaptive outcomes for children with ASD. Results have implications for initiating positive interactions and promoting effective parenting that help improve behavior in young children with ASD.

AB Parental adjustment, parenting behaviors, and child routines have been linked to internalizing and externalizing child behavior. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a comprehensive model examining relations among these variables in children with ASD and their parents. Based on Sameroff's Transactional Model of Development (Sameroff in: The transactional model of development: How children and contexts shape each other, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, 2009), researchers hypothesized that these factors would collectively predict child behavior. Parents (n = 67) completed measures of parental adjustment, parenting behaviors, child routines, and child behavior using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, Alabama Parenting Questionnaire, Child Routines Inventory, and Child Behavior Checklist, respectively. Results indicated that parental adjustment predicted harsh/disengaged parenting (B = 0.17, p < .01) and internalizing behavior (B = 0.32, p < .01). Harsh/disengaged parenting and warm/supportive parenting predicted externalizing behavior (B = 0.59, p < .01) and internalizing behavior (B = - 0.49 p < .01), respectively.

AB Children with autism experience challenges with emotion regulation. It is unclear how children's management of their emotions is associated with their family's quality of life. Forty-three preschoolers with autism and 28 typically developing preschoolers were coded on emotion regulation strategies used during low-level stress tasks. Parents reported on their quality of life and family functioning, and their child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. More externalizing behaviors across groups and use of two emotion regulation strategies (self-soothing, deep exhalation) in the autism group predicted lower family quality of life. Findings suggest that children's emotional outbursts and reduced use of passive comforting strategies are linked to lower family quality of life.

AB Adolescents experiencing social anxiety often experience co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Yet, assessing for social anxiety poses challenges given the already time-consuming task of distinguishing social anxiety from other commonly co-occurring internalizing conditions (e.g., generalized anxiety, major depression). Assessors need short screening devices to identify socially anxious adolescents in need of intensive ADHD assessments. A six-item version of the ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-6) was originally developed to identify adults who likely meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD, but its psychometric properties have yet to be examined among adolescents. We tested the psychometric properties of the ASRS-6 when administered in clinical assessments for adolescent social anxiety. Eighty-nine 14-15 year old adolescents and their parents (67.4% female; 62.1% African American; 30 Clinic-Referred; 59 Community Control) completed the ASRS-6, measures of adolescent social anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent-adolescent conflict. Adolescent self-reported and parent-reported ASRS-6 positively related with scores from established measures of social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and parent-adolescent conflict. Further, adolescent self-reported (but not parent-reported) ASRS-6 scores significantly discriminated adolescents on referral status. Adolescent self-reported (but not parent-reported) ASRS-6 scores incrementally predicted social anxiety over-and-above depressive symptoms, which commonly co-occur with social anxiety. Conversely, parent-reported (but not adolescent self-reported) ASRS-6 scores incrementally predicted parent-adolescent conflict over-and-above depressive symptoms, which commonly co-occur with conflict. When assessing adolescent ADHD symptoms, adolescents' and parents' reports meaningfully vary in their links to validity indicators. As such, among adolescents assessed for social anxiety, clinical assessments of adolescent ADHD symptoms should include both parent reports and adolescent self-reports.

AB This study investigated whether the schema therapy constructs of schema coping and schema modes have validity in adolescents. We examined the validity and reliability of the Schema Coping Inventory (SCI) and an 80-item version of the Schema Mode Inventory (SMI) in a mixed sample of adolescents. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the first-order factor structures of the SCI and SMI were replicated, but that the hypothesized higher-order models of the SMI were not confirmed. Instead, we proposed an alternative higher-order model of Internalizing, Externalizing, Overachieving, and Healthy modes. In general, the SCI and SMI scales were able to distinguish the clinical sample from the community sample, and meaningful relationships were found between coping styles, schema modes, and behavior problems. In conclusion, our study supports the theorized relationships between schema coping styles, schema modes, and behavior problems in adolescents, and provides initial validation for the SCI and the 80-item SMI in adolescent populations.

AB High levels of family accommodation (FA), or parental involvement in child symptoms, are associated with child anxiety symptom severity. The strength of associations has varied across studies, however, highlighting the need to identify moderating variables. We investigated whether anxiety sensitivity (AS) moderated the FA-anxiety symptom severity association in clinically anxious children (N = 103, ages 6-17; mean age 11.07 years). We collected child and mother ratings of FA, child anxiety symptom severity, and child AS ratings. AS significantly moderated the FA-child anxiety severity link. Specifically, this link was significant for low-AS but not high-AS children. Findings suggest that FA may operate in the typically observed fashion for low-AS children-alleviating immediate distress while inadvertently exacerbating longer-term anxiety-whereas high-AS children may experience distress following anxiety-provoking stimuli regardless of FA. Assessing AS in research and clinical settings may help identify subsets of children for whom FA is more closely tied to anxiety severity.

AB This study aimed to examine: (1) the relationship between parental psychopathology and child psychopathology in military families and (2) parenting sense of competence as a mediator of the relationship between veteran psychopathology and child psychopathology. As part of their standard clinical evaluations, 215 treatment-seeking veterans who reported having a child between the ages of 4 and 17 were assessed for psychopathology (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, and stress), their sense of competence as a parent, and their child's psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing, and attentional symptoms). A path analysis model examining parenting sense of competence as a mediator of the relationship between veteran psychopathology and child psychopathology showed significant indirect effects of veteran depression on all child psychopathology outcomes via parenting sense of competence. Parental sense of competence may be a critical mechanism linking veteran depression and child psychopathology, and may therefore be an important target for intervention.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the impact of Family Foundations, a transition-to-parenting intervention, on parent and child outcomes 2 years after birth.
   BackgroundCouples transitioning to parenthood face many stressors and challenges that are not typically addressed through commonly available childbirth preparatory classes. The Family Foundations program was designed for couples expecting their first child and addresses family stressors related to coparenting, parenting, and mental health.
   MethodThe recruited sample of 399 couples expecting their first child were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Data were obtained through home observation and parent surveys before and after intervention.
   ResultsIntent-to-treat analyses indicated effects on several targeted domains including coparenting, parenting, and relationship quality, as well as on child sleep habits and internalizing behavior problems at 2 years of age. Effects for several outcomes were larger for those couples at greater risk based on pretest-observed negative dyadic communication styles.
   ConclusionLonger-term impact found here on parent and child outcomes provides new evidence of the effectiveness of this program for first-time parents.
   ImplicationsPrograms directed toward broader issues related to aspects of coparenting, parenting, and mental health have the potential to have longer-term positive impact on the couples and the developing child.

AB Examining emotion reactivity and recovery following minor problems in daily life can deepen our understanding of how stress affects child mental health. This study assessed children's immediate and delayed emotion responses to daily problems at school, and examined their correlations with psychological symptoms. On 5 consecutive weekdays, 83 fifth graders (M = 10.91 years, SD = 0.53, 51% female) completed brief diary forms 5 times per day, providing repeated ratings of school problems and emotions. They also completed a one-time questionnaire about symptoms of depression, and parents and teachers rated child internalizing and externalizing problems. Using multilevel modeling techniques, we assessed within-person daily associations between school problems and negative and positive emotion at school and again at bedtime. On days when children experienced more school problems, they reported more negative emotion and less positive emotion at school, and at bedtime. There were reliable individual differences in emotion reactivity and recovery. Individual-level indices of emotion responses derived from multilevel models were correlated with child psychological symptoms. Children who showed more negative emotion reactivity reported more depressive symptoms. Multiple informants described fewer internalizing problems among children who showed better recovery by bedtime, even after controlling for children's average levels of exposure to school problems. Diary methods can extend our understanding of the links between daily stress, emotions and child mental health. Recovery following stressful events may be an important target of research and intervention for child internalizing problems.

AB Reactions to sensory experiences are an overlooked correlate of affective regulation, despite the importance of bodily states on psychological processes. Children who display sensory over-responsivity (i.e., adverse reactions to typical sensations) are at greater risk for developing affective disorders. We extended this literature to adolescents and their middle-aged parents. Participants in a birth record-based study of families of adolescent twins (N = 506 families; 1012 adolescents; 53% female) completed a subset of items from the Adult Sensory Profile. We derived adolescent self-reported internalizing disorder symptoms and parent affective diagnoses from structured diagnostic interviews. Structural equation models tested the relationship between parent sensory over-responsivity symptoms and affective diagnoses and their adolescent offspring's sensory over-responsivity and internalizing symptoms. Adolescent sensory over-responsivity symptoms were correlated with internalizing disorder symptoms. Parents with a diagnosis of anxiety or depression (mothers only) reported more frequent SOR symptoms than parents without a diagnosis. Parent depression was significantly related to adolescent sensory over-responsivity symptoms, over and above parent sensory over-responsivity symptoms (beta = 0.26, p < 0.001 for mothers; beta = 0.13, p = 0.004 for fathers). Father alcohol abuse/dependency also predicted offspring sensory over-responsivity symptoms. Offspring of parents with affective disorders were at additional risk for sensory dysregulation via parents' influence on offspring internalizing problems.

AB Difficulties with emotion regulation are a core feature of anxiety disorders (ADs) in children and adults. Interventions with a specific focus on emotion regulation are gaining empirical support. Yet, no studies to date have compared the relative efficacy of such interventions to existing evidence-based treatments. Such comparisons are necessary to determine whether emotion-focused treatments might be more effective for youth exhibiting broad emotion-regulation difficulties at pretreatment. This study examined an emotion-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (ECBT) protocol in comparison to traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a sample of children with a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis. Moderation analyses examined whether children with higher levels of emotion dysregulation at pretreatment would show greater levels of improvement in ECBT than CBT. Ninety-two youth ages 7 to 12 years (58% male) with a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia were included. Participants were randomly assigned to ECBT or CBT. Results showed that youth in both conditions demonstrated similar improvements in emotion regulation and that pretreatment levels of emotion dysregulation did not moderate treatment outcomes. Additional analyses showed that ECBT and CBT were similarly effective on diagnostic, severity, and improvement measures. Future work is needed to further explore the ways that emotion regulation is related to treatment outcome for anxious youth.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth worldwide, and depressed adolescents are at a significantly elevated risk to report suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts. Peer victimization is a robust predictor of adolescent suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), but little research has focused on why bullying leads to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. To address this empirical gap, we recruited 340 (246 female) depressed adolescents ages 13-19 (M = 15.59, SD = 1.41) within 48 h of admission for acute psychiatric treatment. At the initial assessment, participants were administered clinical interviews characterizing psychopathology, nonsuicidal self-injury, and STBs (ideation, plans, and attempts). Further, they completed questionnaires assessing 3 forms of victimization (overt, relational, and reputational), recent risky behavior engagement, and psychiatric symptom severity. Controlling for internalizing symptoms and age, overt and reputational bullying were associated with more frequent past month suicide attempts, but not suicide ideation. Past month risky behavior engagement, but not NSSI, mediated the relation between victimization and attempts. However, sex differences revealed that this effect only held for males whereas bullying was directly associated with suicide attempts among females. In contrast, overt and relational bullying were non-linearly associated with suicide plans, and these relations were not mediated by risky behaviors or NSSI. Results highlight the complex network of factors that lead victimized adolescents to engage in STBs and may inform targeted suicide prevention and intervention programs.

AB The appearance of positive adjustment is a theoretically relevant element of psychopathy, and is valuable for demonstrating its incremental validity over a broader antisocial orientation. We examined associations between psychopathic-like features and two measures of adaptive functioning: psychometric intelligence and (immunity to) internalizing problems. Ratings of psychopathy and behavioral problems were obtained in a community sample of children (N = 1210). A bifactor model was fit to the psychopathic personality items to capture the underlying variance common to all traits (i.e., general factor) and to isolate a unique cluster of interpersonal traits. We hypothesized that the general psychopathy factor and specific interpersonal factor would exhibit opposing patterns of associations with external criteria. As expected, the general psychopathy factor was associated with greater anxiety/depression and lower cognitive ability. Contrary to hypothesis, the interpersonal factor was not associated with adaptive functioning (i.e., reduced internal distress or superior cognitive ability), although the predicted relations emerged after controlling for antisocial behavior. Hence, in a large representative sample of children, there is limited support for the premise that psychopathic traits are associated with positive adjustment and enhanced intelligence. Implications regarding the construct validity of psychopathy are discussed, including the role of heterogeneity in sample characteristics and instrument.

AB Research on restrictive mediation seldom considers whether parents work together to regulate their child's media use. As an initial investigation, one parent per family (an MTurk sample of 1201 US parents of 2- to 17-year-olds) completed an online survey reporting on consistency and conflict between themselves and their partner with regard to their child's media restrictions. When one parent was more restrictive than the other, participants reported more inter-parent conflict about media rules and more child exposure to media violence. These two variables in turn predicted the child's physical and relational aggression, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. When both parents were highly restrictive, there was less conflict and exposure to media violence, which predicted lower levels of all four negative outcomes. Rule disparities and media-related conflict did not vary by child's age. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study assessed which moderators influenced the effectiveness of a low-intensive behavioral teacher program for children with symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
   Methods: Primary school children (N = 114) with ADHD symptoms in the classroom were randomly assigned to the intervention program (n = 58; 91% male) or control group (n = 56; 77% male). Multilevel regression analyses assessed differential treatment gains of the intervention program in terms of ADHD symptoms and social skills. Moderators included demographic characteristics (gender, age, parental educational level), severity and comorbidity of problem behavior (ADHD symptoms, conduct and internalizing problems), social functioning, and classroom variables (teaching experience, class size).
   Results: Results revealed larger program effects for older children and children from highly educated families and smaller beneficial effects for children with comorbid conduct or anxiety problems.
   Conclusion: The intervention program seems more beneficial for highly educated families and children without comorbid problem behavior, but more intensive treatments appear necessary for children facing additional challenges.

AB Although numerous studies have described the relationship between HPA axis dysregulation and internalizing symptoms among adolescents, research using hair cortisol concentrations in pre- and young adolescent samples has not been reported. We investigated the association of self-reported internalizing symptoms with cortisol concertration in hair among pre-and young adolescents aged 10-12 years. Forty-six boys and 39 girls supplied a hair sample of at least 3 cm in length for an analysis of this period (3 months) cortisol excretion. Saliva cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C) also was assessed. The study found a positive association between ratings of depressive symptoms and cumulative levels of hair cortisol only in boys. Furthermore, higher ratings of anxiety symptoms were associated with lower hair cortisol concertration and lower saliva cortisol reactivity among girls. This study provides the first evidence for the notion that depressive symptoms in boys are associated with long-term cortisol concertration in hair, whereas anxiety symptoms in girls are associated with HPA-axis hypoactivity, when hair cortisol concentrations and saliva cortisol reactivity to acute stress are assessed concurrently.

AB Research has demonstrated that adequate parenting is an important determinant of a healthy social-emotional development in children. There is a need for valid assessment tools for measuring parenting quality, particularly in clinical settings. The Caregiver Wish List (CWL) is a new 53-item interview-based scale for assessing parenting practices. We examined the CWL's factor structure in a sample of 348 parents of children (4-11 years), 220 were drawn from the general population and 128 from a clinical setting. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five factors, which did not fully correspond with the hypothesized, original factor structure. Nonetheless, the extracted factors were meaningful and could be labeled as follows: adequate discipline, controlled responding, focus on positive behavior, consistency, and monitoring. All factors demonstrated adequate internal consistency. The factor structures in community and clinical samples were comparable, supporting the generalizability of the factor structure. Furthermore, the factors differentiated between community and clinical samples, with better parenting skills observed in the community sample. Finally, all factors were significantly and negatively related to child psychopathology, with stronger correlations for externalizing than for internalizing problems. Only 23 of the 53 original CWL items loaded on at least one of the five factors, indicating that the original CWL can probably be reduced in length without losing important content. Future research needs to examine if the extracted CWL factors are sensitive to change. The CWL's interview format provides opportunities for rapport building between parent and interviewer, and for reflection on parenting skills in terms of strengths and vulnerabilities.

AB This meta-analysis examined the associations between cyber-victimization and internalizing problems controlling for the occurrence of traditional victimization. Twenty independent samples with a total of 90,877 participants were included. Results confirmed the significant intercorrelation between traditional and cyber-victimization (r=.43). They both have medium-to-large bivariate correlations with internalizing problems. Traditional victimization (sr=.22) and cyber-victimization (sr=.12) were also uniquely related to internalizing problems. The difference in the relations between each type of victimization and internalizing problems was small (differential d=.06) and not statistically significant (p=.053). Moderation of these effect sizes by sample characteristics (e.g., age and proportion of girls) and study features (e.g., whether a definition of bullying was provided to participants and the time frame used as reference) was investigated. Results are discussed within the extant literature on cyber-aggression and cyber-victimization and future directions are proposed.

AB Subjection to sexual harassment is associated with a number of negative outcomes, such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms and a disinclination to attend school. Among adolescents, sexual harassment may increase with both their emerging sexual desires and increased socializing in mixed-gender peer groups during early adolescence. We set out to study the possible associations between normative and risk-taking sexual behavior and subjection to sexual harassment among adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 years. The informants included 90,953 boys and 91,746 girls, with a mean (SD) age of 16.3 (1.2) years, who responded to a classroom survey (School Health Promotion Study 2010-2011) in Finland. We found that even early steps in romantic and erotic experiences were associated with experiences of sexual harassment. The more advanced the adolescents' sexual experiences were, the more commonly they reported differing experiences of sexual harassment. These associations were particularly strong among the girls. Among the sexually active adolescents, the more partners the adolescents had for intercourse, the more commonly they reported experiences of sexual harassment. Adolescents actively interested in romantic and sexual relationships may socialize in contexts where sexual harassment is more likely to occur. They may be more sensitive to sexual cues than their non-interested peers, or sexual harassment may be a traumatic experience predisposing adolescents to risk-taking sexual behavior as a form of acting out. A double standard regarding the appropriate expression of sexuality received some support in our data.

AB The adverse effects of institutionalized care and psychosocial deprivation have been documented for more than 100 years. Children who have been raised in institutions are at heightened risk of developing internalizing and externalizing disorders. Given the profound biological and psychological effects of institutional rearing, identifying neural and cognitive factors that influence the emergence of psychopathology in institutionalized children is of great interest. Using data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized control study on the effects of institutional care and a foster care intervention, this article examines two factors that appear to influence the emergence of psychopathology in children who have been institutionalizedneural indices of cognitive control and visual attention biases.

AB Premature infants have significant risk for later behavior problems. This study examined growth trajectories of three problem behaviors across five developmental age points from preschool to early adulthood in a well-characterized sample of premature infants. The effects of neonatal risk, gender, and socioeconomic context were modeled on these trajectories. The longitudinal sample was comprised of preterm infants (N = 160) with full variation of neonatal morbidity and birth weight (640-1,950 g). Trajectories of externalizing, internalizing and attention problem behaviors from 4 to 23 years, measured by the Child Behavior Checklist, were tested using latent growth curve modeling. The results indicate individual variation in the number of externalizing and internalizing problems over time. Externalizing problems were not significantly different for males and females, but male scores were consistently higher. Neonatal risk was significantly associated with higher internalizing problems at age 4, but was not predictive at school age and beyond. Attention-problem scores increased from early preschool through adolescence for males, but females had little change over the same ages. SES was not predictive of any problem behavior trajectories and no significant two-way interactions were found. The results advance understanding of stability and change of three important problem behaviors through preschool, childhood, and adolescence to young adulthood in prematurely born infants in order to inform clinicians about timely assessment and the refinement of effective interventions.

AB Assessments of child psychopathology are often derived from parental and teacher reports, yet there is substantial disagreement. This study utilized data from 7 European countries to examine parent-teacher agreement and possible explanatory factors for parent-teacher disagreement such as child and family characteristics, parenting dimensions, and maternal distress were explored. Parent-teacher agreement of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were assessed using a cross-sectional survey of 4,894 school aged children 6-11 from the School Children Mental Health Europe Project. Parent-teacher agreement was low to moderate (Pearson correlation ranging from .24 (Prosocial) to .48 (Hyperactivity) for the 5 subscales across 7 countries); kappa coefficient ranged from .01 (Turkey) to .44 (Italy) for internalizing problems and .19(Romania) to .44(Italy) for externalizing problems. Child's gender and age, mother's employment status, single parent home, number of children in household, and selected parenting dimension were found to be explanatory of informant disagreement. This study not only serves to advance our understanding of parent-teacher agreement of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in 7 European countries but provides a novel approach to examining the factors that contribute to informant disagreement.

AB The investigation was an exploratory study that examined the association of externalizing and internalizing problems with school achievement and school engagement in a sample of African American mothers and adolescents (N = 200). The study also assessed whether demanding kin relations moderated the relations between these variables. Hypotheses were examined with structured interviews administered to mothers and adolescents. Results revealed that externalizing problems were negatively associated with adolescents' school achievement. Also, the negative relations of externalizing problems with school achievement and school engagement were especially apparent in families with demanding kin relations. Additional research is needed on potential antecedents of demanding kin relations as well as the processes mediating the effects of negative relations with kin.

AB The goal of this three-wave longitudinal study was to analyze foster parent stress and foster children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors in a transactional framework. Participants in this study were 237 children in foster care in the Netherlands with, mostly, long placement durations (M = 56.86 months, SD = 49.10 months). We examined concurrent, prospective unidirectional and bidirectional relations between foster children's behavior and foster parent stress by using cross-lagged structural equation modeling and examined whether the results were stable across different subgroups of foster children. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found no bidirectional relations. There were unidirectional prospective pathways from foster children's internalizing and externalizing problems to foster parent stress, but no significant prospective pathways from foster parent stress to foster children's internalizing and externalizing problems. The results were fairly stable across different subgroups of foster children. The lack of bidirectional relations was unexpected given the presence of transactional relations in biological parent-child dyads. Foster parents seem not to influence their foster children when it comes to regulating problem behavior. Therefore, the question is whether foster parents can, in more general terms, help their foster children benefit from their improved home environment.

AB Background. Associations between parenting and child outcomes are often interpreted as reflecting causal, social influences. However, such associationsmay be confounded by genes common to children and their biological parents. To the extent that these shared genes influence behaviours in both generations, a passive genetic mechanismmay explain links between them. Here we aim to quantify the relative importance of passive genetic v. social mechanisms in the intergenerational association between parent-offspring relationship quality and offspring internalizing problems in adolescence.
   Methods. We used a Children-of-Twins (CoT) designwith data fromthe parent-based Twin andOffspring Study of Sweden (TOSS) sample [ 909 adult twin pairs and their offspring; offspringmean age 15.75 (2.42) years], and the child-based Swedish Twin Study of CHild and Adolescent Development (TCHAD) sample [ 1120 adolescent twin pairs; mean age 13.67 (0.47) years]. A composite of parent-report measures (closeness, conflict, disagreements, expressions of affection) indexed parent- offspring relationship quality in TOSS, and offspring self-reported internalizing symptoms were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in both samples.
   Results. A social transmissionmechanism explained the intergenerational association [ r = 0.21 (0.16-0.25)] in our best-fitting model. Apassive genetic transmission pathwaywas not found to be significant, indicating that parental genetic influences on parent-offspring relationship quality and offspring genetic influences on their internalizing problemswere non-overlapping.
   Conclusion. These results indicate that this intergenerational association is a product of social interactions between children and parents, withinwhich bidirectional effects are highly plausible. Results fromgenetically informative studies of parentingrelated effects should be used to help refine early parenting interventions aimed at reducing risk for psychopathology.

AB In recent years, the influence of emotion-related factors on disordered eating behaviors have received a great deal of attention. Depression and difficulties in emotion regulation are important factors in development and maintaining of disordered eating behaviors. However, the mechanisms linking negative affect to disordered eating are not yet fully understood. It has been suggested that difficulties in regulating negative emotions may play a role in this relation. Therefore, our hypothesis was that difficulties in emotion regulation mediate the relationship between different disordered eating behaviors and depression. The sample consisted of 269 healthy women (mean age=23.87, SD=6.98) who filled in online measures assessing these variables. Results revealed that depression and difficulties in emotion regulation predict overall and specific disordered eating patterns (restrained, emotional and uncontrolled eating). Moreover, the relationships of depression with disordered eating overall or with specific restrained, emotional and uncontrolled eating respectively is mediated by difficulties in emotion regulation. Our data support the need for studies testing the efficacy of emotion regulation skills training in eating disorders.

AB Introduction: Maternal depression has been shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental, emotional and behavioural disorders in offspring. We aimed to describe the proportion of psychological problems among children of mothers with depression in Sri Lanka and to describe the association with the characteristics of the mothers' illness.
   Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 100 children and adolescents between 4-16 years whose mother has a diagnosis of depression and currently in remission. Specifically designed instruments were used to extract socio-demographic details and data on mother's illness. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to detect psychological problems in children.
   Results: 14% of the children scored abnormally high in hyperactivity, 13% in conduct problems, 12% in emotional problems, 9% in peer problems. Hyperactivity, internalizing problems, and total difficulties were significantly higher in where mothers' had a history of a moderate depressive episode and recurrent depressive disorder. Children whose mothers had no attempts of self-harm scored significantly higher in both emotional problems and internalizing problems. Children whose mothers have comorbid illness scored significantly higher in hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional problems, externalizing problems, internalizing problems and total difficulties.
   Conclusions: Screening for psychological problems in children and developing a holistic management plan which include steps to ensure the well-being of the children is important in managing mothers with depression.

AB Borderline personality pathology typically onsets during adolescence. An important consideration in understanding adolescent psychopathology is pubertal development. Perceived pubertal timing is one facet of puberty that is especially relevant to adolescent psychopathology, especially when timing is perceived to be early. Despite links between early pubertal timing and core features of borderline personality disorder, and between early pubertal timing and disruptions in the interpersonal context, perceived pubertal timing has yet to be studied in relation to adolescent borderline pathology. This preliminary study aimed to test the association between perceived pubertal timing and borderline symptoms in adolescent girls, controlling for internalizing and externalizing pathology. Forty-two female adolescent inpatients (ages 12-15, M-age = 14.02, 81% White) completed measures of perceived pubertal development and borderline symptoms and a diagnostic interview. Results indicated that earlier perceived pubertal timing was uniquely associated with higher borderline symptoms even when internalizing and externalizing disorders were covaried.

AB The purpose of this research is to find out the connection between mother and teacher relationships and externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems of 48-60-month-old children. In this regard, a correlational study was conducted with teachers (n=59) and mothers (n=252) of 48-60-month-old pre-school children in a metropolitan city in Turkey. Data collected through Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale (PKBS), Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (STRS), and Child-Parent Relationship Scale (CPRS). Study results showed that children's internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems have direct connection with their relationships with their mothers and teachers. When children's conflicts with their teachers and mothers increase, their intimacy decrease with them. It was also found that as the children's conflicts with their mothers increase, conflicts with their teachers also increase. According to findings of the study; there is a need to provide in service and pre-service trainings for teachers and pre-service teachers about the importance of quality relation with children, methods, problem solving skills and especially right approaches to problematic children. Also, as one of the pre-conditions of positive teacher-child relationship is a positive teacher-family relationship, both parents' and teachers' awareness should be raised about family involvement.

AB Clinical assessments involve understanding displays of mental disorder symptoms in the contexts in which they display. Contextual information plays a large role in externalizing disorder assessments. Yet we know little about contextual information's impact within internalizing disorder assessments. Panic disorder symptoms develop outside environmental effects, but over time symptoms become conditioned responses to one's environment, making this disorder an interesting test case. In two experiments (N = 269), lay participants read vignettes about children displaying a single symptom of panic disorder embedded in contextual information that either conformed or did not conform to the presence of panic disorder. Contextual information changed interpretations of panic disorder symptoms and reduced judgments of the likelihood of panic disorder. This effect held when participants made judgments about panic disorder only (Experiment 1) and when alongside externalizing disorder symptoms (Experiment 2). These findings have important implications for understanding interpretive judgments about symptoms within diagnostic assessments of mental health.

AB On the basis of a sample of 109 Chinese children, aged approximately 3years, and their parents in Hong Kong, this study examined how paternal parenting interacted with 2 aspects of child temperament (i.e., negative emotionality and persistence) to predict children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Paternal supportive and aversive parenting practices were reported by fathers, and child temperament and behavioural problems were reported by both mothers and fathers. The results showed that paternal aversive parenting interacted with temperamental emotionality and persistence in the prediction of children's externalizing problems, controlling for maternal parenting. Specifically, young Chinese children who were more emotionally reactive and those who had lower attentional capacities were more vulnerable to aversive parenting from fathers, exhibiting more externalizing problems. Practical implications are discussed.
   Highlights
   This study examined the interplay between child temperament and paternal parenting with regard to problem behaviour among Chinese preschoolers. Both mothers and fathers reported child behaviour problems, emotionality, persistence, and their parenting behaviour. Both emotionality and persistence interacted with aversive paternal parenting in relation to child externalizing behaviours, controlling for maternal parenting.

AB Although interparental conflict (IPC) has been linked directly and indirectly (via adolescents' appraisals) with a wide range of adolescent outcomes, little is known about the implications of IPC and related adolescent threat appraisals for substance use. Drawing on the cognitive-contextual framework, we test competing hypotheses about how IPC may impact adolescent substance use outcomes, specifically testing whether (a) threat appraisals are directly related to escalation in alcohol and tobacco use over adolescence, or (b) threat appraisals are indirectly associated with substance use through their impact on adolescent internalizing problems. Family data from 768 2-caregiver families were analyzed for this study. Adolescents (53% female) were followed on 7 occasions starting in the fall of 6th grade (mean age = 11.3 years) through the spring of 11th grade. IPC and family demographic data were collected from parents. Youth provided data on their appraisals of conflict, internalizing problems, and substance use. Using longitudinal growth curve models, findings supported threat appraisals as a direct risk factor for escalating cigarette use, but not escalating alcohol use, during adolescence. In the alcohol trajectory model, IPC was a direct predictor of increases in alcohol use over time. These findings indicate that high levels of threat appraisals are a specific and direct risk for greater increases in cigarette use over the course of adolescence and that IPC confers risk for increasing rates of alcohol use over adolescence.

AB We investigated the bidirectional associations between mother-child discrepancies in their perceptions of maternal rejection and children's internalizing problems over 10 years from pre/early adolescence to early adulthood. Mothers' reports of rejection and involvement in the parent-child relationship, the children's perception of the mother's rejection, and children's self-report of internalizing problems were collected from a sample of 360 low-income ethnically diverse urban mother-child dyads at three time points (T1, T2, and T3) with 5-year intervals. Children were on average 12.6 years old at T1 (54% girls). Using a series of nested path analyses, we found that mother-child discrepancies while reporting maternal rejection at T1 were predictive of lower ratings of maternal involvement at T2 (beta = -.14), which predicted higher levels of internalizing problems at T3 (beta = -.16). The presence of mother's affective disorder was related to T1 mother-child discrepancies (beta = .14). Regarding bidirectional associations, children's internalizing problems predicted maternal involvement across all time points, whereas T2 maternal involvement predicted T3 child internalizing problems. Discrepancies showed small associations with child internalizing problems both concurrently and over time. The findings highlight the importance of early discrepancies in the perception of maternal rejection for child internalizing symptoms.

AB This study explored the longitudinal relationships among maternal depressive symptoms, children's depressive symptoms, aggression, and rule breaking and tested the moderating effects of maltreatment and child sex. A sample of 175 biological mother-child dyads (86 maltreated and 89 comparison) were seen at three time points, beginning at an average child age of 10.87 years. Results from cross-lagged models showed maternal depressive symptoms were related to higher levels of children's depressive symptoms but not children's aggression or rule breaking. Rule breaking predicted maternal depressive symptoms only in the comparison group. Child sex moderated some relationships. Boys' depression predicted maternal depressive symptoms, whereas maternal depressive symptoms predicted aggression among girls. There was no evidence in this sample that child maltreatment increased the effects of maternal depressive symptoms on child outcomes. These results suggest that attention in clinical practice to the importance of addressing maternal depression as well as addressing children's functioning should continue into adolescence.

AB As interest in sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) increases, a primary limitation for the field is the lack of a unified set of symptoms for assessing SCT. No existing SCT measure includes all items identified in a recent meta-analysis as optimal for distinguishing between SCT and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattention. This study evaluates a new self-report measure for assessing SCT in adulthood, the Adult Concentration Inventory (ACI), which was developed in response to the meta-analytic findings for assessing SCT. Using a large, multiuniversity sample (N = 3,172), we evaluated the convergent and discriminant validity and reliability of the ACI. We also evaluated the ACI measure of SCT in relation to self-reported demographic characteristics, daily life executive functioning, socioemotional adjustment (i.e., anxiety/depression, loneliness, emotion dysregulation, self-esteem), and functional impairment. Exploratory confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 10 ACI items demonstrating strong convergent and discriminant validity from both anxiety/depressive and ADHD inattentive symptom dimensions. SCT was moderately to-strongly correlated with daily life EF deficits, poorer socioemotional adjustment, and greater global functional impairment. Moreover, SCT remained uniquely associated in structural regression analyses with most of these external criterion domains above and beyond ADHD. Finally, when internalizing symptoms were also covaried, SCT, but not ADHD inattention, remained significantly associated with poorer socioemotional adjustment. These findings support the use of the ACI in future studies examining SCT in adulthood and make a major contribution in moving the field toward a unified set of SCT items that can be used across studies.
   Public Significance Statement
   This study provides initial validation of a new self-report measure for assessing sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms in adults, the Adult Concentration Inventory (ACI), and moves the field toward a unified set of SCT items that can be used in both research and clinical settings.

AB The current study shows that parental punitive discipline places children at risk of developing internalizing and externalizing problems. Although some studies have analyzed the reasons for the use of discipline methods, little to no research has analyzed the moderating effects. In this study, we examine the relationship between maternal negative emotional expression and mothers' use of disciplinary methods (psychological aggression, corporal punishment and physical maltreatment) and the moderating effects of educational attainment in Chinese societies. Five hundred and sixteen mothers with preschool-aged children were recruited to participate in this research. The Chinese versions of the Self-Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire (SEFQ) and the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales (CTSPC) were used to measure the mothers' negative emotional expression and discipline, respectively. The results suggested that the mothers' negative emotional expression was positively related to their disciplinary behaviors. Moreover, maternal educational attainment moderated the association between negative emotional expression and discipline. The findings of the current study highlight the importance of considering how mothers' educational backgrounds may interact with their emotions to influence maternal disciplinary behaviors.

AB Young children are at significant risk of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), and vulnerable to exposure-related psychopathology, yet few studies investigate the effects of exposure to IPV on children under the age of 5 years. The current study investigated the role of maternal PTSD symptoms and parenting strategies in the relationship between mothers' IPV experiences and psychopathology in their young children, ages 3-6 years in a community-based cohort of 308 mother-child dyads at high risk for family violence. Data were collected from 2011 to 2014. IPV history and maternal PTSD symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires. Children's symptoms were assessed with a developmentally-sensitive psychiatric interview administered to mothers. Punitive/restrictive parenting was independently-coded from in-depth interviews with mothers about their disciplinary practices. Hypothesized direct and indirect pathways between physical and psychological IPV, maternal PTSD, maternal parenting style, and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined with mediation models. Results indicated that neither physical nor psychological IPV experienced by mothers was directly associated with children's symptoms. However, both types of victimization were associated with maternal PTSD symptoms. Examination of indirect pathways suggested that maternal PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship between mothers' psychological and physical IPV experiences and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms and mothers' restrictive/punitive parenting mediated the relationship between mothers' psychological IPV and children's externalizing symptoms. In addition, there was a path from maternal physical IPV to child externalizing symptoms through both maternal PTSD symptoms and restrictive/punitive parenting. Findings highlight the importance of supporting parents in recovering from the sequelae of their own traumatic experiences, as their ensuing mental health symptoms and parenting behaviors may have a significant impact on their children's emotional health.

AB Complex trauma exposure has been operationalized as multiple or chronic interpersonal traumas that begin early in life and is thought to result in widespread self-regulation difficulties across several domains of functioning. Prior research has demonstrated that there are gender differences in trauma exposure as well as trauma-related symptoms; however, gender discrepancies have not previously been examined in the context of child survivors of complex trauma. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have experienced complex trauma (3-18 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67% female). Male children were somewhat more likely to have been exposed to domestic violence, while female children were more likely to have experienced sexual abuse as well as more likely to have been abused by a caregiver. Gender differences were observed for several of the caregiver-reported symptom domains, with female children exhibiting higher levels of depression, dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal symptoms, and total PTSD symptoms. Female children also self-reported higher levels of sexual concerns, and marginally more re-experiencing and total PTSD symptoms. Secondary analyses utilizing only children who experienced sexual abuse revealed that gender differences largely remained, again with females manifesting higher levels of symptoms. Thus, following complex trauma, female children may be at higher risk for trauma-related difficulties, which has implications for research and clinical interventions.

   METAANALYSIS
AB A growing body of research suggests that, compared to normative adolescence, adoptive adolescence could be considered a specific risk condition characterized by more psychiatric problems, attachment insecurity, and emotional regulation difficulties as consequences of negative experiences in preadoption relationships. The current study explores (a) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between attachment representations (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and disorganized) and behavioural problems and (b) a moderation model of adoption status on the association between emotion regulation processes (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and behavioural problems. Both the moderation models were controlled for verbal skills. Forty-six adopted adolescents and a control group of 34 nonadopted peers (12-16years old) living with both their biological parents were assessed using the Friends and Family Interview, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents, the Child Behaviour Check List 6-18, and the verbal subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the latter as control measure. Results showed that adoption status (but not attachment) positively predicted externalizing and total behaviour problems, whereas attachment disorganization (but not adoption status) positively predicted internalizing problems in both group. Moreover, low cognitive reappraisal had a negative impact on externalizing problems only for adopted adolescents, but not for nonadopted youths. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in order to enhance effective intervention with adopted adolescents and their parents.

AB Introduction: Numerous studies have identified the importance of parenting behaviors to the well-being of children with chronic physical conditions. Synthesizing the findings of these studies has potential to identify which parenting behaviors are associated with specific aspects of child well-being. Method: We retrieved research reports addressing the relationship between parenting behaviors and well-being in children with chronic physical conditions, and categorized parenting behaviors based on Skinner, Johnson, and Snyder's (2005) core dimensions of parenting (warmth, rejection, structure, chaos, autonomy support, and coercion) Through meta-analysis, we examined relationships between parenting dimension and child well-being variables. Results: Fifty-four reports from 47 unique studies met inclusion criteria. Parent warmth was associated with less child depression, better quality of life, better physical functioning, and fewer externalizing behavior problems. Parent rejection was associated with more child depression, internalizing/externalizing behavior problems, and poorer physical functioning. Parent structure was associated with better child physical functioning. Parent chaos was associated with poorer child physical functioning. Parent autonomy support was associated with better quality of life and fewer externalizing behavior problems. Parent coercion was associated with more child depression, poorer quality of life, poorer physical function, and more internalizing behavior problems. Conclusion: The results identify multiple, potentially modifiable parenting dimensions associated with well-being in children with a chronic condition, which could be targeted in developing family-focused interventions. They also provide evidence that research using Skinner's core dimensions could lead to conceptualization and study of parenting behaviors in ways that would enable comparison of parenting in a variety of health and sociocultural contexts.

AB This article presents practical tools for evidence-based assessment of students' behavioral/emotional/social difficulties and strengths in culturally sensitive ways. The assessment instruments obtain teacher, parent, and student ratings, plus observations in classrooms and other group settings, in interviews, and in testing sessions. To document differences in students' functioning in school and other contexts, plus differences between teacher, parent, and student perspectives, users can display cross-informant comparisons of ratings of specific difficulties items. Users can also display cross-informant comparisons between bar graphs of scores on empirically derived syndromes, DSM-oriented scales, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. Scale scores are standardized according to norms for students' gender and age, type of informant (teacher, parent, student), and multicultural norms. Multicultural norms are based on teacher, parent, and student ratings of population samples of students in many societies. The ratings were used to construct gender-, age-, and informant-specific norms for societies having relatively low difficulties scores, medium scores, or high scores. The assessment instruments can be used to identify students who need help and to tailor interventions to students' needs. The same instruments can be used to measure changes by comparing pre-versus post-intervention scores. Brief instruments assess progress over short periods.

AB This research examined the longitudinal association between parent socialization of coping and child adjustment, as well as the moderating role of children's skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR). Participants were a community sample of children (n = 64, M age = 9.02, 54.5% females, 93.2% Caucasian) and their parent(s). Parent coping suggestions were observed while their child engaged in a stressful challenge task, during which the child's SCLR, a measure of children's physiological reactivity to stress, was also measured. Parent(s) completed the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) at baseline and a 6-month follow-up to assess internalizing and externalizing problems. Results revealed that secondary control engagement suggestions predicted fewer internalizing problems over time. In addition, disengagement suggestions predicted fewer externalizing problems over time among children with high SCLR. This study provides evidence that parent coping suggestions serve as a resource that protects youth from developing adjustment problems.

AB Objective: This study examines the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of Positive Adaptations for Trauma and Healing (PATH), a manualized treatment for Latino youth and their caregivers. PATH is a culturally adapted program that incorporates a trauma model, positive psychology, and resilience. Method: Latino youth (N = 16) recruited from an urban community clinic participated in PATH with their caregiver. Pre- and postintervention measures on trauma symptoms, resilience, depression, caregiver's view of their youth's well-being, and positive and negative emotions were gathered. Following the intake meetings (1 to 3), the families participated in 10 90-minute weekly group sessions (total of 3 groups). Caregiver groups were conducted in Spanish, and youth in English. Results: At pretest, 56% of the youth endorsed clinically significant symptoms on the UCLA PTSD Index (M = 34.2, SD = 11.2); the percentage dropped to 0% at posttest (M = 17.3, SD = 7.6). Youth reported pre- to posttest reductions on the Child Depression Inventory (mean difference [Mdiff] = 7.3; p = .004) and externalizing (Mdiff = 6.1; p < .001) and internalizing (Mdiff = 9.4; p < .001) behaviors on the caregiver-reported Child Behavior Checklist. Overall, there was high treatment engagement (93% attendance over 10 weeks). Conclusion: This novel treatment engaged a community-based Latino sample. The results suggest high acceptability and significant reduction in trauma symptoms and associated symptoms. This study included a small number of participants and results should be interpreted with caution. Future iterations will target larger number of participants to further assess feasibility.

AB Objective: Early adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked to the development of both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. In our prior work, we found that ACEs predicted reductions in the volume of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), a brain region important for impulse control and emotion regulation. Here we tested the hypothesis that ACES might influence child behavioral outcomes through an impact on IFG functional connectivity, which may influence impulsive or risk-taking behavior.
   Method: We examined the effects of prospectively assessed ACEs on IFG connectivity in childhood, and their relationship to the trajectory of subsequent psychopathology from late school age and early adolescence, using data from an 11-year longitudinal study of children starting in preschool that included 3 waves of resting state functional connectivity across childhood and early adolescence.
   Results: ACEs predicted functional connectivity of both left and right IFG. Multi-level modeling of symptoms across 3 waves of assessments indicated that more ACEs predicted both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. However, altered IFG connectivity specifically predicted greater externalizing symptoms over time in middle childhood and early adolescence, as compared to internalizing symptoms. Longitudinal modeling indicating that the relationships between externalizing and functional connectivity were maintained across 3 waves of functional connectivity assessment.
   Conclusion: These findings underscore the relationship of ACEs to later psychopathology, and suggest that connectivity of the IFG, a region known to play an important role in impulse control and emotion regulation, may play a key role in the risk trajectory of ACEs to externalizing problems. However, further work is needed to understand whether these relationships reflect a direct effect of ACEs or whether ACEs are a marker for other environmental or genetic factors that may also influence brain development and behavior.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on children's behavioral, emotional, and social development by age 5 years, and over time since age 1.5 years.
   Method: The prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study was linked to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We included women who reported depressive/anxiety disorders before and/or during pregnancy. Children born to women who used SSRIs in early (weeks 0-16), mid- (weeks 17-28), or late (> week 29) pregnancy were compared to those who were unexposed. Children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors (Child Behavior Checklist) and temperament traits (Emotionality, Activity and Shyness Temperament Questionnaire) were measured at 1.5, 3, and 5 years. Mean scores were calculated and standardized. General linear marginal structural models were fitted to account for time-varying exposure and Qconfounders, and censoring; 3-level growth-curve models were used.
   Results: A total of 8,359 mother child dyads were included, and 4,128 children had complete outcome data at age 5 years. Children exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy had an increased risk of anxious/depressed behaviors by age 5 years compared with unexposed children (adjusted beta = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.96). Such risk was not evident for earlier timings of exposure. There was no evidence for a substantial prenatal SSRI effect on externalizing, social, and emotional problems.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest no substantial increased risk for externalizing, emotional, or social problems in preschool-aged children following prenatal SSRI exposure. Although the role of chance and potential unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out, late-pregnancy SSRI exposure was associated with greater anxious/depressed behaviors in the offspring.

AB Temperamental negative affect and insufficient sleep have been independently associated with behavior problems during early childhood. However, it is unknown whether these factors interact to contribute to behavioral difficulties in young children. The current study examined the interactions between temperamental negative affect and both sleep onset time and sleep midpoint, assessed by actigraphy, in predicting externalizing and internalizing behaviors in a sample of 117 children (34-69months of age). Children with high temperamental negative affect and either later sleep onset time or later sleep midpoint were more likely to exhibit externalizing and internalizing behaviors. These results emphasize the association between temperamental negative affect and behavioral difficulties, particularly for children with insufficient sleep.

AB To inform public health recommendations for adolescent sleep, the amounts of sleep associated with the highest levels of academic achievement and mental health were examined. The degree to which daily variability in sleep duration represents an underappreciated but functionally significant sleep behavior also was tested. A total of 421 adolescents (M-age=15.03years) with Mexican-American backgrounds reported nightly sleep times for 2weeks; approximately 80% repeated the same protocol 1year later. Multilevel modeling indicated that the amount of sleep associated with the lowest levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms was more than 1hr greater than the amount associated with the highest levels of academic performance. Greater daily variability in sleep duration predicted greater symptomatology and mixed academic outcomes.

AB Objective: The consequences of maternal depressed mood on children's growth, health, and cognitive and language development are examined over the first 3 years of life. Method: Pregnant women in 24 periurban township neighborhoods in Cape Town, South Africa (N = 1,238 mothers) were randomized by neighborhood to a home visiting intervention or a standard care condition. Reassessments were conducted for 93%-85% of mothers at 2-weeks, 6-, 18-, and 36-months postbirth. Regressions were conducted on measures of children's growth, behavior, language, and cognition to examine the impact of four patterns of depressed mood: antenatal only (n = 154, 13.8%), postnatal only (n = 272, 24.3%), antenatal and postnatal (n = 220, 19.7%), and no depressed mood on any assessment (n = 473, 42.3%). Results: Patterns of depressed mood were similar across intervention conditions. Depressed mothers were significantly less educated, had lower incomes, were less likely to be employed or to have electricity; were more likely to report problematic drinking of alcohol, experience food insecurity, interpersonal partner violence, and to be HIV seropositive. At 36 months, the pattern of maternal depressed mood over time was significantly associated with children's compromised physical growth, both in weight and height, and more internalizing and externalizing symptoms of behavior problems. Measures of language and cognition were similar across maternal patterns of depressed mood. Conclusions: Mothers who report depressed mood face significantly more life challenges, both environmental stressors related to poverty and other problematic behaviors. More proximal, postnatal depressed mood appears to have a larger influence on their children, compared with antenatal depressed mood.

AB BackgroundPast research has indicated that both sleep difficulties and a parental history of alcoholism increase the risk of behavioral problems. But it is not known whether sleep difficulties differentially increase the risk of problem behaviors among children of alcoholics (COAs) and controls. We compared multiple measures of sleep and the relationships between sleep and behavioral problems in these 2 groups of children.
   MethodsOne hundred and fifteen children aged 8 to 12 (67% COAs; 56% girls; M-age=10.85, SDage=1.51) participated in this study. Data presented here were taken from Time 1 of a larger prospective study designed to understand the relationship between sleep and alcohol use. All participants were naive to alcohol and other illicit drugs. Participants were asked to wear an actigraph watch on their nondominant wrist for 1week. Parents completed the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist.
   ResultsParents of COAs were more likely to rate their children as overtired compared with parents of non-COAs. Structural equation modeling analyses focusing on overall internalizing and externalizing problems did not reveal any group differences on the relationships between sleep measures and behavioral problems. Regression analyses focusing on specific behavioral problems showed that longer total sleep time, parental ratings of sleep more and sleep less than other children interacted with COA status to predict specific behavioral problems.
   ConclusionsSleep difficulties and duration appear to be a general risk factor for behavioral problems in both COAs and non-COAs, yet the relationships between specific sleep parameters and behavioral problems appear to be different between the 2 groups.

AB There is evidence that models of psychopathology specifying a general factor and specific second-order factors fit better than competing structural models. Nonetheless, additional tests are needed to examine the generality and boundaries of the general factor model. In a selected second wave of a cohort study, first-order dimensions of psychopathology symptoms in 499 23- to 31-year-old twins were analyzed. Using confirmatory factor analysis, a bifactor model specifying a general factor and specific internalizing and externalizing factors fit better than competing models. Factor loadings in this model were sex invariant despite greater variances in the specific internalizing factor among females and greater variances in the general and specific externalizing factors among males. The bifactor structure was robust to the exclusion of any single first-order dimension of psychopathology. Furthermore, the results were essentially unchanged when all overlapping symptoms that define multiple disorders were excluded from symptom dimensions. Furthermore, the best-fitting bifactor model also emerged in exploratory structural equation modeling with freely estimated cross-loadings. The general factor of psychopathology was robust across variations in measurement and analysis.

AB Objective: The study examined clinical correlates of quality of life (QoL), impact of treatment on QoL, and predictors of QoL change among children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Methods: One hundred forty-two children with primary OCD who were enrolled as part of a larger clinical trial participated. Children were administered a structured diagnostic interview, as well as clinician-administered measures of OCD and depression symptom severity. Children and parents completed reports of QoL, as well as measures of impairment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Youth received 10 sessions of family-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Results: At baseline, QoL was inversely related to obsessive-compulsive symptom severity, impairment, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and severity of depression symptoms according to children and parents. After CBT, QoL improved according to parent ratings, but not child ratings. None of the predictors examined were associated with changes in QoL scores over time. Impairment, and externalizing and internalizing symptoms predicted QoL after accounting for OCD symptom severity. After accounting for OCD symptoms, externalizing symptoms inversely predicted changes in QoL. Conclusion: These data suggest that QoL is related to more severe clinical presentation and improves with evidence-based treatment, but QoL improvements may be inversely related to externalizing symptomology.

AB Because of the frequent comorbidities, clinicians need to get a comprehensive picture of the behavioral and emotional problems presented by their patients, but structured interviews allowing for such a survey are time consuming and sometimes tedious, and no French language self-report questionnaire is currently available. The aim of the present study was to verify the factorial structure and some psychometric properties of the French version of the Achenbach and Rescorla's (2003) adult self-report (ASR), which is designed to assess 120 behavioral and emotional problems. We collected ASR forms completed by 905 students enrolled in a university having schools of humanities, social sciences, sports, laws and economics (699 women, 669 students in psychology, 862 aged 18-35 years). The confirmatory factor analyses yielded the expected eight-factor structure (RMSEA=.037; CFI =.931). The internal consistency was similar to the original, and the test-retest reliability was satisfactory. French subjects, especially men, scored higher than their American counterparts on several scales, but the effect sizes were small to medium. French women and men's scores differed only on the Rule-Breaking Behavior scale, with men scoring higher; however, students in psychology, whichever was their gender, scored higher than other students on scales measuring internalizing problems and attention problems. Despite some limitations, the main of which is that all participants were students from the same university, these results speak in favor of the use of the French adult self-report in both research and clinical practice.

AB The study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese revision of the Emotional and Behavioral Screener (EBS), and to extend its application to preschoolers (4-7 years old). Teachers and parents of 216 preschoolers (age M = 5.11, SD = 0.9) were invited to complete the EBS, and some of the teachers were also asked to complete the Preschool Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale (PreBERS) (N = 80) and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) (N = 90). Results of confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the original single-factor model of the EBS didn't fit the data well. Based on the results of a series of exploratory factor analyses, we proposed a two-factor model instead, representing externalizing and internalizing problems respectively. The Chinese revision demonstrated satisfactory internal reliability, inter-rater reliability, convergent validity and divergent validity. All these evidences supported its use among Chinese preschoolers to identify those who will be at risk of suffering from emotional and behavioral disturbances.

AB Given the well documented relationship between childhood trauma and the regulation of stress and emotion, it is likely that childhood trauma also will have important implications for parenting. As a result, the current study aimed to understand the relationships among mothers' attributions, self-efficacy, and parenting competence within the context of childhood trauma experiences. In particular, mothers' self-efficacy was examined as a mediator in the relationship between attributions and parenting competence. The sample was divided into low and high trauma subsamples. Mediation analyses indicated that, for mothers in the low childhood trauma subsample, the model was not supported. In contrast, among mothers in the high childhood trauma subsample, the model was supported. Additionally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that self-efficacy was a strong unique predictor for young children's internalizing and externalizing problems in mothers from the low childhood trauma subsample. In contrast, the examined variables worked more collectively in the prediction of young children's internalizing and externalizing problems for mothers in the high childhood trauma subsample. These findings suggested that mothers' understanding of their young children's problems and their own parenting were related differently when the context of childhood trauma experiences was considered and may be important to target in parenting interventions.

AB The current study tested a transactional model including children's (N = 122, 10-13 years old) emotional reactivity, maternal responsiveness, and attachment-related interpretation bias to explain childhood externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behaviors. Children's emotional reactivity was related to externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behaviors. Maternal responsiveness was related to externalizing and total problem behaviors. Attachment-related interpretation bias was not directly related to any type of problem behavior. In line with the transactional model's prediction, a three-way interaction between these factors was found for internalizing and total problem behaviors, suggesting that children, who are more emotionally reactive, experience little maternal responsiveness, are more vulnerable to experience distress, and have learned to interpret mother's ambiguous behavior as unsupportive, are most at risk to display internalizing and total problem behaviors. Results suggest that attachment-related interpretation bias appears to play a role in childhood problem behaviors in the presence of other risk factors.

AB Among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who have a history of parent-reported developmental regression, or early skill loss, little is known about core-ASD symptoms (i.e., social communication, restricted/repetitive behaviors) and emotional/behavioral (E/B) symptoms during the school-age years. Study aims were to investigate whether early skill loss (i.e., <= 36 months old) was an indicator of heightened risk for later, school-based emotional and behavioral difficulties during the school-age years. Differences in teacher ratings for students with ASD from various age ranges (early elementary, late elementary/middle school, high school), with and without parent-reported developmental regression, were examined. Data were analyzed from teacher ratings for students with ASD (n = 951) on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and ASEBA Teacher Rating Form (TRF). Students' families were participants in the multi-site Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), and students had study-confirmed clinical diagnoses of ASD. Overall, ANCOVA indicated few significant effects of developmental regression on teacher ratings of core-ASD symptoms or on ratings of internalizing or externalizing behavior problems, even when controlling for cognitive ability. These results, based on the perspective of teachers who are unaware of (i.e., "blinded" to) child regression status, were surprising yet suggest that early skill loss may not be an indicator of greater risk for some difficulties during the school-age years. Future work is needed to further investigate long-term outcomes among those with ASD who had an early skill loss, and teachers offer unique and important perspectives that may enhance future research in this area.

AB Manifestations of internalizing problems, such as specific symptoms of anxiety and depression, can change across development, even if individuals show strong continuity in rank-order levels of internalizing problems. This illustrates the concept of heterotypic continuity, and raises the question of whether common measures might be construct-valid for one age but not another. This study examines mean-level changes in internalizing problems across a long span of development at the same time as accounting for heterotypic continuity by using age-appropriate, changing measures. Internalizing problems from age 14-24 were studied longitudinally in a community sample (N = 585), using Achenbach's Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Young Adult Self-Report (YASR). Heterotypic continuity was evaluated with an item response theory (IRT) approach to vertical scaling, linking different measures over time to be on the same scale, as well as with a Thurstone scaling approach. With vertical scaling, internalizing problems peaked in mid-to-late adolescence and showed a group-level decrease from adolescence to early adulthood, a change that would not have been seen with the approach of using only age-common items. Individuals' trajectories were sometimes different than would have been seen with the common-items approach. Findings support the importance of considering heterotypic continuity when examining development and vertical scaling to account for heterotypic continuity with changing measures.

AB The roles of help-seeking from informal sources and social support in their association with psychosocial outcomes during adolescence remain unclear. Yet, help-seeking behavior within informal and supportive social contexts brings young people into contact with a range of important resources with the potential to reduce the likelihood for poor psychosocial outcomes. This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring both help-seeking behavior from informal sources and social support in their association with psychosocial outcomes in adolescence. The meta-analysis examines 79 effect sizes from 8 studies, analyzing data on informal help-seeking from 5285 youth aged 12-19 years. For social support, the meta-analysis examines 378 effect sizes from 51 studies, analyzing data from 196,247 youth aged 12-19 years. The results of a series of random effects models showed significant associations between help seeking from informal sources and each of externalizing behavior (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34, 0.56, p < .0001), educational outcomes (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.84, 2.73, p < .0001) and other help seeking behavior (e.g. help-seeking for peers; OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.97, 3.00, p < .0001). Results showed social support was significantly associated with internalizing behavior (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.48, 0.68, p < .0001) and substance use (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65, 0.84, p < .0001). Social support also showed significant associations with bullying perpetration and victimization with effect sizes ranging from odds ratios of 0.55 to 0.68. Moderator analyses showed variation in results based on methodological-level (e.g. study design) and sample-level (e.g. gender) variables. Although it is difficult to draw overarching conclusions regarding help-seeking from informal sources, given the small number of included studies, findings of the meta-analysis showed that both help-seeking from informal sources and social support may have potential benefits in reducing the likelihood of poor psychosocial outcomes among adolescents. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB Objective: To determine the specific protective factors that seem to be related to psychological adjustment in child and youth victims of direct and indirect forms of caregiver victimization. Method: A total of 1,105 children and youth (590 male and 515 female) from northeastern Spain and aged between 12 and 17 years were assessed regarding their experiences of caregiver victimization, symptoms of psychopathology, and protective factors. Results: Caregiver victimization during lifetime was reported by 26.8% of the overall sample. The results showed that any form of caregiver victimization was related to higher levels of emotional and behavioral problems. Some aspects of the Self domain (e.g., Social Skills or low Negative Cognition) were related to lower levels of internalizing problems. In the case of externalizing problems, several factors from different domains (i.e., Self, Family, and School) were relevant, and a significant interaction between caregiver victimization and Connectedness to School was observed. Conclusions: The results show that protective factors play a role in the explanation of emotional and behavioral problems. The findings reveal some of the protective factors that should be regarded as key intervention targets in children and youth with a history of caregiver victimization.

AB Objectives: The MBL2 gene is the major genetic determinant of mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-an acute phase reactant. Low MBL levels have been associated with adverse outcomes in preterm infants. The MBL2(Gly54Asp) missense variant causes autosomal dominant MBL deficiency. We tested the hypothesis that MBL2(Gly54Asp) is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes after cardiac surgery in neonates.
   Methods: This is an analysis of a previously described cohort of patients with nonsyndromic congenital heart disease who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass before age 6 months (n = 295). Four-year neurodevelopment was assessed in 3 domains: Full-Scale Intellectual Quotient, the Visual Motor Integration development test, and the Child Behavior Checklist to assess behavior problems. The Child Behavior Checklist measured total behavior problems, pervasive developmental problems, and internalizing/externalizing problems. A multivariable linear regression model, adjusting for confounders, was fit.
   Results: MBL2(Gly54Asp) was associated with a significantly increased covariate-adjusted pervasive developmental problem score (beta = 3.98; P = .0025). Sensitivity analyses of the interaction between age at first surgery and MBL genotype suggested effect modification for the patients with MBL2(Gly54Asp) (P-interaction = .039), with the poorest neurodevelopment outcomes occurring in children who had surgery earlier in life.
   Conclusions: We report the novel finding that carriers of MBL2(Gly54Asp) causing autosomal dominant MBL deficiency have increased childhood pervasive developmental problems after cardiac surgery, independent of other covariates. Sensitivity analyses suggest that this effect may be larger in children who underwent surgery at earlier ages. These data support the role of nonsyndromic genetic variation in determining postsurgical neurodevelopment-related outcomes in children with congenital heart disease.

AB Involvement in dating violence has been linked with negative health outcomes including depressive symptomology, substance use, and later expressions of aggressing and victimizing behaviors. Less is known about the prevalence and mental health correlates of teen dating violence in countries like Mexico where adult partner violence is high. Additional research on teen dating violence is also needed, as it may be an important precursor to adult partner violence and linked to other mental health problems. The current study used self-report ratings to assess the similarities and differences in risk factors associated with dating violence among middle school students in Mexico and the United States. The US sample (N-us = 15,099; M-us = 12.8; 49.5% female) included non-Hispanic Caucasian (24.9%), Hispanic American (20.3%), and African American (24.2%) adolescents. The Mexican sample (N-Mexico = 2211; M-Mexico = 13.67; 51% female) included 93.1% adolescents of Hispanic or Latin descent. Logistic regressions showed that dating violence victimization was reported at similar rates in the cross-national samples, though exposure to risk factors like deviant peers and substance use differed significantly by country. Our analyses indicated that, although the country of residence was not significantly associated with dating violence victimization, the strength of the association between some known risk factors and dating violence victimization varied as a function of nationality, such that there was a significant interaction between country of residence, Mexico or the US, and experiencing internalizing symptoms on experiencing physical dating violence victimization. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on dating violence, both inside and outside the US.

AB This study investigated the association between inter-parental conflict at a single occasion, or repeated over early childhood, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems at 10-11 years; and examined potential mechanisms via social risk, maternal mental health, and parenting. Data were five time points from the Baby cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N = 3696, recruited in 2004). Verbal or physical inter-parental conflict was measured at 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, and 6-7 years. Internalizing and externalizing problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) were measured via mother-, father-, teacher-, and child-report at 10-11 years. A series of regression models accounted for social risk at 0-1 years, parenting, and maternal psychological distress at 8-9 years. Physical and verbal inter-parental conflict (reported by 16 and 33% of mothers, respectively) consistently predicted mother-, father-, and child-reported externalizing and internalizing problems, and teacher-reported externalizing (but not internalizing) problems (adjusted regression coefficients [beta] = 0.4-1.1). Repeated compared to single report of verbal conflict was associated with more behavior problems (adjusted mean = 0.8-1.1 compared to 0.4-0.6).
   Conclusion: Children are sensitive to inter-parental conflict, with long-term negative effects for child mental health even when reported at one time point within the first 6 years of life.
   What is Known: ; Studies of children born prior to 1990 show that children exposed to verbal conflict or severe forms of family violence are at greater risk of mental health problems. What is New: ; Physical and verbal inter-parental conflict reported once or at multiple time points over the first 6 years of life was associated with externalizing and internalizing problems reported by mothers, fathers, children, and teachers. ; Associations between inter-parental conflict and child problems were not explained by family social risk, maternal mental health, or parenting.

AB Substance use (SU) and sleep problems appear interrelated, but few studies have examined the influence of adolescent sleep patterns on development of SU disorders. This study prospectively examined the influence of sleep habits on subsequent SU in youth who later transitioned into heavy drinking. At time 1 (T1), participants (n=95) were substance-naive 12- to 14-year-olds. Path-analytic models examined whether the effects of T1 risk factors (familial SU disorder, inhibition control, and externalizing and internalizing traits) on time 3 (M=19.8 years old) tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis were mediated by time 2 (M=15.1 years old) sleep chronotype, daytime sleepiness, and erratic sleep/wake behaviors. Significant direct path effects of T1 risk factors and time 2 sleep behaviors on time 3 SU were found, Ps<0.05. In models that examined the effect of each individual sleep behavior separately on SU, more erratic sleep/wake and greater daytime sleepiness predicted higher lifetime use events for all substances (Ps<0.01). Higher evening chronotype tendencies predicted lower tobacco and higher alcohol and cannabis lifetime use events (Ps<0.01). Erratic sleep/wake behaviors mediated the effect of inhibitory control on subsequent SU; less erratic sleep/wake behaviors predicted better inhibition control (<(beta)over cap>=-0.20, P<0.05). Early-mid adolescent psychiatric health and sleep behaviors prior to drinking onset predicted greater SU 5 years later. Participants were substance-naive at baseline, allowing for the examination of temporal order in the relationship between sleep problems and alcohol use. Early adolescent sleep problems may be an important risk factor for SU in later life.

AB IntroductionAdolescents who live in rural areas have been found to experience more mental health problems than those who live in urban areas. In Indonesia, adolescents who live in rural areas have limited facilities to access mental health services. On the other hand, there is still a strong belief in the rural communities that mental health problems are the consequence of demonic possession, having committed a sin, lack of faith, etc. Rural communities tend to seek traditional remedies such as advice from traditional healers or witchdoctors. Unfortunately, previous studies have indicated that the onset of most mental health problems is during adolescence, and this includes psychotic symptoms that are often manifested as psychotic-like experiences (PLEs).
   MethodsThe Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to examine internalizing problems. PLEs were used to examine psychotic symptoms. Data were collected in 3 junior high schools in Karawang. A total of 270 adolescents (aged between 11 and 16years old) who live in the rural area in Karawang participated in this research.
   ResultsThe study found that the prevalence of adolescents with at least 2 symptoms of PLEs was 7%. The result of the study indicated that there is no significant correlation between psychotic-like experiences and internalizing problems (r=.075, P=.22).
   DiscussionPLEs significantly correlated with peer-relationship problems rather than with internalizing problems. Further investigation is needed to examine the factors that contribute to PLEs in rural settings.

AB Neural and temperamental mechanisms through which a genetic risk marker in the -amino butyric acid 2 receptor subunit (GABRA2) impacts adolescent functioning were investigated. Participants (N=80; 29 female) completed an emotional word task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral control, negative emotionality, and resiliency temperament constructs were assessed. Externalizing and internalizing problems were the outcomes. Those with the GABRA2 minor allele had reduced activation to positive words in the angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and cerebellum, and to negative words in frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices. Reduced activation in the angular gyrus predicted greater negative emotionality and, in turn, elevated externalizing problems. Reduced activation in the inferior parietal cortex predicted greater resiliency and, in turn, low externalizing problems.

AB We examined whether cognitive control moderates the effects of emotion on adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptomatology in a longitudinal study of 138 adolescents. Self-reported positive affect (PA) and negative affect and behavioral and neural indicators of cognitive control, indexed by performance and prefrontal hemodynamic response during a cognitive interference task, were collected at Time 1. Self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptomatology were collected at Time 1 and Time 2 (1year later). Results indicated that higher PA predicted decreases in externalizing symptomatology, but only for adolescents with poor neural cognitive control. No moderation effects were found for behavioral cognitive control. Findings imply the beneficial effects of PA on the development of externalizing problems among adolescents with poor prefrontal functioning.

AB Research suggests that altered emotion processing may be one important pathway linking social risk factors and depressive symptoms. We examined the extent to which neural response to negatively valenced social information might help to account for the relationship between social risk and depressive symptoms in youth. Forty-nine youth were scanned while identifying the emotional valence of words that connoted social status. They also completed questionnaires assessing self-reported social risk factors and depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis revealed that reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in response to negative social status words explained the positive association between social risk and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that social risk factors present during adolescence may contribute to depressive symptoms by influencing the neural substrates of emotion processing.

AB Although community violence is an established risk factor for youth aggression, less research has examined its relation with internalizing psychopathology. This study examined associations of community violence exposure with internalizing symptoms, and state and trait emotion dysregulation as mechanisms underlying these associations, in 287 adolescents aged 16-17 (45.6% male; 40.8% White). Community violence exposure was associated with internalizing symptoms, negative affect during peer evaluation, trait emotional reactivity, and infrequent problem solving. Multiple emotion dysregulation indices were also associated with internalizing symptoms. In simultaneous multiple mediator models, indirect effects of community violence on internalizing problems were significantly explained by state and trait emotion dysregulation. Findings implicate emotion dysregulation as one mechanism linking community violence exposure to adolescent internalizing symptoms.

AB Cortisol synchrony is the degree to which mother-toddler cortisol levels are mutually regulated within a dyad. Synchrony's impact on toddler development is not well understood, so this study investigated how synchronous cortisol levels (reactivity and total concentration) in mother-toddler dyads moderate the association between risk factors (i.e., maternal worry, toddler inhibition) and early internalizing symptoms. Seventy mothers and their 2-year-old toddlers provided interpretable saliva samples. Behavioral observations were made to assess the toddler's temperament at age 2, and mothers reported on their toddler's internalizing symptoms when toddlers were 2 and 3years old. Results suggest that mother-toddler synchrony in total cortisol concentration moderates the relation between risk factors and internalizing symptoms. Specifically, toddler inhibition and maternal worry were less associated with concurrent toddler internalizing symptoms when dyads demonstrated greater cortisol synchrony in total concentration. Further, synchrony in total cortisol levels marginally moderated the association between toddler inhibition and future internalizing symptoms, such that inhibited toddlers were less likely to demonstrate internalizing symptoms at age 3 when dyads demonstrated more cortisol synchrony. This suggests that cortisol synchrony may serve as an advantageous context that reduces the risk of developing of internalizing symptoms and augments the field's understanding of the implications of shared physiological responses within mother-toddler dyads.

AB Background: This study quantifies the dynamics of maternal mood focusing on unpredictability, and to assess if greater unpredictability of prenatal maternal mood predicts child temperament and internalizing symptoms through early adolescence.
   Methods: The association between prenatal mood predictability and child internalizing symptoms were assessed in two longitudinal cohorts (N's = 227 and 180). Maternal mood was assessed repeatedly during pregnancy as early as 15 weeks' gestation. Predictability of maternal mood was calculated by applying Shannon's entropy to the distribution of responses on mood questionnaires. Maternal reports of child negative affectivity (a predictor of later internalizing) were collected at 6, 12, 24 months and 7 years of age. Child self-reports of anxiety symptoms were collected at 10 years and reports of depression symptoms at 13 years.
   Results: Fetal exposure to more elevated maternal mood entropy predicted higher levels of child negative affectivity at 12 months (r =.36; p< 01), 24 months (r =.31; p< 01) and 7 years (r =.32; p< 01) of age. In addition, children exposed to higher prenatal maternal mood entropy, reported higher levels of anxiety symptoms at 10 years (r =.24; p< 01) and elevated depressive symptoms at 13 years (r =.29; p<. 01). These associations persisted after adjusting for maternal pre and postnatal mood valence (e. g. depression levels) and for other relevant demographic characteristics.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide strong support for the notion that patterns of maternal mood influence the developing brain. More specifically, they suggest that prenatal maternal mood predictability may be a critical predictor of developmental mental health trajectories and should be considered when assessing early life influences on lifespan mental health.

ID DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CHILDREN; CRITERIA; MODEL; ADHD
AB Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous condition for which multiple efforts to characterize brain state differences are underway. The objective of this study was to identify distinct subgroups of resting electroencephalography (EEG) profiles among children with and without ADHD and subsequently provide extensive clinical characterization of the subgroups. Methods: Latent class analysis was used with resting state EEG recorded from a large sample of 781 children with and without ADHD (N=620 ADHD, N=161 Control), aged 6-18years old. Behavioral and cognitive characteristics of the latent classes were derived from semistructured diagnostic interviews, parent completed behavior rating scales, and cognitive test performance. Results: A five-class solution was the best fit for the data, of which four classes had a defining spectral power elevation. The distribution of ADHD and control subjects was similar across classes suggesting there is no one resting state EEG profile for children with or without ADHD. Specific latent classes demonstrated distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles. Those with elevated slow-wave activity (i.e. delta and theta band) had higher levels of externalizing behaviors and cognitive deficits. Latent subgroups with elevated alpha and beta power had higher levels of internalizing behaviors, emotion dysregulation, and intact cognitive functioning. Conclusions: There is population-level heterogeneity in resting state EEG subgroups, which are associated with distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles. EEG measures may be more useful biomarkers of ADHD outcome or treatment response rather than diagnosis.

AB Employing a multi-method approach, we investigated observed and parent-rated child behavioral inhibition (BI) and maternal reports of their own negative affectivity (NA) as predictors of young children's internalizing problems. Participants were 201 children who were siblings between 2.5 and 5.5 years of age (mean = 3.86, standard deviation = 1.04) and their mothers. Due to the nested research design, multilevel model-fitting analyses were used to examine associations between predictors and internalizing problems, and to test a mediational process between maternal NA and internalizing problems. High levels of both observed and parent-rated child BI and greater maternal NA significantly predicted internalizing problems. Child age also moderated the association between parent-rated child BI and internalizing problems, with the association stronger for younger and mean age children, but not for older children. Additionally, parent-rated child BI was found to mediate the association between maternal NA and internalizing problems, and the mediational effect was stronger for younger children.

AB There is evidence that the major anxiety and depressive disorders could reflect a single underlying internalization factor. For a group of 1,031 clinic-referred children, the study examined support for this factor, and used the two-parameter logistic model to examine the item response theory properties of the disorders in this factor. For the set of anxiety and depressive disorders, confirmatory factor analysis supported a one-factor model. The two-parameter logistic model analysis indicated that all the internalizing disorders in this factor were strong discriminators of the internalizing dimension. Also, they measured more of the internalizing dimension and with more precision in the upper half of the trait continuum. There was also support for the convergent validity of the internalizing dimension, in that it had large-to-medium effect size correlations with internalizing scores of other measures. The implications of the findings for clinical practice and clinical classification are discussed.

AB Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the association between changes in ADHD symptoms, executive functions (EFs), and depression symptoms in girls and boys with ADHD over a 2-year period. Method: Thirty-six girls and 39 boys with ADHD, 18 typically developing (TD) girls and 29 TD boys (ages 9-16) were included. Assessments of EFs, ADHD symptoms, and self- and parent-report of depression symptoms were carried out. Results: For girls, a reduction of inattention symptoms was associated with a decline in parent-rated depression symptoms. A reduction in hyperactivity/impulsivity was associated with a reduction in self-rated depression symptoms in boys, and an increase in girls. A reduction in inattention symptoms was associated with a modest increase in self-rated depression symptoms in both boys and girls. Conclusion: Gathering information from both the parents and the child with ADHD is important in determining how gender may be influencing symptom profiles.

AB This study explored the longitudinal relations among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement in Chinese primary school students. Participants were N=945 fourth-grade students (485 boys, 460 girls; M-age=10.16years, SD=2months) attending elementary schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Three waves of data on peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement were collected from peer nominations, self-reports, and school records, respectively. The results indicated that peer victimization had both direct and indirect effects on later depression and academic achievement. Depression also had both direct and indirect negative effects on later academic achievement, but demonstrated only an indirect effect on later peer victimization. Finally, academic achievement had both direct and indirect negative effects on later peer victimization and depression. The findings show that there are cross-cultural similarities and differences in the various transactions that exist among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement.
   Statement of contribution
   What is already known on this subject?
   Peer victimization directly and indirectly relates to depression and academic achievement. Depression directly and indirectly relates to academic achievement. Academic achievement directly and indirectly relates to depression.
   What the present study adds?

AB There is a growing appreciation that child functioning in different domains, levels, or systems are interrelated over time. Here, we investigate links between internalizing symptoms, externalizing problems, and academic attainment during middle childhood and early adolescence, drawing on two large data sets (child: mean age 8.7 at enrolment, n=5,878; adolescent: mean age 11.7, n=6,388). Using a 2-year cross-lag design, we test three hypotheses - adjustment erosion, academic incompetence, and shared risk - while also examining the moderating influence of gender. Multilevel structural equationmodels provided consistent evidence of the deleterious effect of externalizing problems on later academic achievement in both cohorts, supporting the adjustment-erosion hypothesis. Evidence supporting the academic-incompetence hypothesis was restricted to the middle childhood cohort, revealing links between early academic failure and later internalizing symptoms. In both cohorts, inclusion of shared-risk variables improved model fit and rendered some previously established cross-lag pathways non-significant. Implications of these findings are discussed, and study strengths and limitations noted.
   Statement of contribution
   What is already known on this subject? Longitudinal research and in particular developmental cascades literature make the case for weaker associations between internalizing symptoms and academic performance than between externalizing problems and academic performance. Findings vary in terms of the magnitude and inferred direction of effects. Inconsistencies may be explained by different age ranges, prevalence of small-to-modest sample sizes, and large time lags between measurement points. Gender differences remain underexamined.
   What does this study add?
   The present study used cross-lagged models to examine longitudinal associations in age groups (middle child and adolescence) in a large-scale British sample. The large sample size not only allows for improvements on previous measurement models (e.g., allowing the analysis to account for nesting, and estimation of latent variables) but also allows for examination of gender differences. The findings clarify the role of shared-risk factors in accounting for associations between internalizing, externalizing, and academic performance, by demonstrating that shared-risk factors do not fully account for relationships between internalizing, externalizing, and academic achievement. Specifically, some pathways between mental health and academic attainment consistently remain, even after shared-risk variables have been accounted for. Findings also present consistent support for the potential impact of behavioural problems on children's academic attainment. The negative relationship between low academic attainment and subsequent internalizing symptoms for younger children is also noteworthy.

AB BackgroundExtreme prematurity or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) can adversely affect behaviour. Nondisabled ELBW children are at risk of behavioural problems, which may become a particular concern after commencement of formal education. This study explored the frequency of behavioural and emotional problems amongst nondisabled ELBW children at 4 to 5years of age and whether intervention had a positive influence on behaviour. The relationship between behaviour, gender, and other areas of performance at 5years was explored.
   MethodsFifty 4-year-old children (born <28weeks gestation or birth weight <1,000g) with minimal/mild motor impairment were randomly allocated to intervention (n=24) or standard care (n=26). Intervention was 6 group-based physiotherapy weekly sessions and home programme. Standard care was best practice advice. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for preschool children was completed at baseline and at 1-year post-baseline. Other measures at follow-up included Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition, Beery Visual-Motor Integration Test 5th Edition, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4th Edition.
   ResultsThe whole cohort improved on CBCL total problems score between baseline (mean 50.0, SD 11.1) and 1-year follow-up (mean 45.2, SD 10.3), p=.004. There were no significant differences between groups over time on CBCL internalizing, externalizing, or total problems scores. The intervention group showed a mean difference in total problems score of -3.8 (CI [1.5, 9.1]) between times, with standard care group values being -4.4 (CI [1.6, 7.1]). Males had higher total problems scores than females (p=.026), although still performed within the normal range. CBCL scores did not correlate with other scores.
   ConclusionsThe behaviour of nondisabled ELBW children was within the normal range at 4 to 5years, and both intervention and standard care may have contributed to improved behavioural outcomes. Behaviour was not related to performance in other developmental domains.

AB Several studies have reported high comorbidity for reading disability (RD) and psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the comorbidity of subthreshold and full psychiatric disorders with RD while comparing subgroups based on age of RD recognition (early vs. late). We analyzed data from 130 children with RD and 82 typically developing children aged 7 to 18 years. RD was assessed with the Dyslexia Differential Diagnosis Maastricht-Hungarian Standard Test. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Kid. Chi-square tests were used for group comparisons of the prevalence of subthreshold and full disorders. A higher proportion of children in the RD group were assessed as having internalizing or externalizing disorders. When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, the prevalence of internalizing but not externalizing pathology was higher in the RD group than the control group. The prevalence of internalizing pathology was similar in the early and late RD subgroups, but externalizing pathology was more common in the late RD subgroup. When subthreshold and full diagnoses were considered together, mood disorder and externalizing pathology were more prevalent in the late RD subgroup than the early RD subgroup. This study demonstrated that early recognition of RD may play a role in determining comorbid psychopathology and should therefore be an educational and clinical priority. Clinicians should routinely screen children with RD for comorbid disorders, including subthreshold pathology.

AB There is a demand for interventions aimed at adolescent girls with psychosomatic problems. In 2013, positive results were reported from a dance intervention programme addressing girls with internalizing problems. The research team behind the intervention immediately received requests from municipalities and county councils interested in using the intervention. From an implementation point of view it is unclear what made the intervention spread without an active plan. The aim of this study was to explore adopters' experiences about the diffusion and initiation of a public health intervention targeting adolescent girls with internalizing problems. Interviews were conducted with 12 people who were engaged in initiating the intervention in different settings. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis, yielding three categories: perceived appeal and trustworthiness, convenient information, and contextual factors. The results reflected that the participants found that there was a need for an intervention and found the dance intervention to be evidence based and not too complex to perform. Further, there was available information on the project which could easily be distributed to decision makers and others. When initiating the intervention, factors related to economy, possibility for collaboration and recruitment were of importance.

AB Background and Aims: Since alcohol use disorders are among the most prevalent and destructive mental disorders, it is critical to address factors contributing to their development and maintenance. Drinking motives are relevant driving factors for consumption. Identifying groups of drinkers with similar motivations may help to specialize intervention components and make treatment more effective and efficient. We aimed to identify and describe distinct motive types of drinkers in dependent males from two diverse cultures (Uganda and Germany) and to explore potential differences and similarities in addiction-related measures. Moreover, we investigated specific links between motive types and childhood maltreatment, traumatic experiences, and symptoms of comorbid psychopathologies.
   Methods: To determine distinct drinking motive types, we conducted latent class analyses concerning drinking motives (Drinking Motive Scale) in samples of treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent men (N = 75). Subsequently we compared the identified motive types concerning their alcohol consumption and alcohol-related symptoms (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), history of childhood maltreatment (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), trauma exposure (Violence, War and Abduction Exposure Scale), psychopathology (Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, Depression-section of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and Brief Symptom Inventory) and deficits in emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale).
   Results: We found two congruent drinking motive types in both contexts. Reward-oriented drinking motives like the generation of positive feelings and enhancing performance were endorsed almost equally by both motive types, whereas high relief motive endorsement characterized one group, but not the other. The relief motive type drank to overcome aversive feelings, withdrawal, and daily hassles and was characterized by higher adversity in general. Emotional maltreatment in childhood and psychopathological symptoms were reported to a significantly greater extent by relief drinkers (effect sizes of comparisons ranging from r = 0.25 to r = 0.48). However, the motive types did not differ significantly on alcohol consumption or alcohol-related symptoms and traumatic experiences apart from childhood maltreatment.
   Conclusion: The chronology of addiction development and patterns of drinking motivation seem to be similar across cultures, i.e., that motive targeting interventions might be applicable cross-culturally. Addressing comorbid symptomatology should be a key treatment component for relief drinkers, whereas finding alternatives for the creation of positive feelings and ways to counteract boredom and inactivity should be a general treatment element.

AB Background
   Sexuality is a physiological component of adolescent development, though early initiation is associated with reproductive health risk. This study aimed at identifying correlates and predictors of sexual initiation in a large multinational cohort of European adolescents.
   Methods
   A questionnaire addressing socio-demographics, behaviours, mental health and sexual activity, was delivered to 11,110 adolescents recruited from 168 randomly selected schools in 10 European countries between 2009 and 2011. A follow-up questionnaire was delivered after 12 months. The longitudinal association of baseline risk behaviors, psychological attributes and contextual vulnerabilities, with sexual initiation during follow-up was evaluated through simple and multivariable age/sex stratified logistic regression. Multinomial logistic regression measured the association between predictors and sexual initiation with or without coexisting reproductive risk factors, such as multiple partners or infrequent condom use.
   Results
   Baseline sexual experience was reported by 19.2% of 10,757 respondents (median age 15; IQR 14-5; females 59.6%). This was significantly more frequent among pupils older than 15 (41%) and males (20.8%). Of 7,111 pupils without previous experience who were available at follow-up (response rate 81.8%), 17% reported sexual initiation, without differences between females and males. Baseline smoking (age/sex adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.63), alcohol use (aOR 2.95), illegal drugs use (aOR 2.72), and poor sleep (aOR 1.71) predicted sexual initiation. Stratified analyses showed a particularly strong association in case of younger and female pupils, and, among girls, when initiation was reported together with multiple partners and/or infrequent condom use. Externalizing (i.e. conduct and hyperactivity) symptoms independently predicted sexual initiation. Internalizing difficulties (i.e. emotional and peer problems) were negatively associated with early and risky sexual initiation among boys. Significant predictors included also being bullied, fighting, truancy, and low parental involvement.
   Conclusions
   Adolescent sexual behaviours are related to non-sexual risk behaviours, psychological difficulties and contextual vulnerabilities. While gateway effects explain some associations, a comprehensive model is needed to understand adolescent sexual behaviours, their physical, mental, and social health outcomes, and their potential positive effects on wellbeing. Tailored interventions may need to consider younger girls as a particularly vulnerable group in view of a strong association between non-sexual and sexual behaviors.

AB Objective: Executive and motivational dysfunction have been associated with pediatric obesity. Poor sleep quality and psychopathology, often comorbid with obesity, are also associated with executive and motivational dysfunction. We examined the contribution of these comorbid factors to the association between obesity and executive function and reward-related decision-making.
   Methods: Seven- to 18-year-old children with and without obesity performed a working memory task with low and high loads, a response inhibition task, and a probabilistic reward-related decision-making task. Parents filled out standardized measures of executive function in everyday behavior, sleep health, and psychiatric symptoms. Analyses controlled for age, gender, IQ, and parental education.
   Results: Children with obesity showed worse working memory performance under higher load (p = 0.007), and worse parent-reported behavioral regulation (p = 0.05) and metacognition (p = 0.04) in everyday behavior and their reward-related decision-making was less consistent with learned probabilistic conditions (p = 0.04). Response inhibition did not differ between groups. Children with obesity had worse parent-reported sleep health (p < 0.01) and 4.27 greater odds of clinically relevant internalizing symptomology (p = 0.03), both of which mediated the effect of obesity on behavioral regulation (p's < 0.01) and metacognition (p's < 0.01). Performance-based assessments were not associated with sleep health or psychopathology.
   Conclusions: Sleep quality and internalizing psychopathology were worse in children with obesity and contributed to parent-reported executive dysfunction in their everyday behavior. Performance-based measures of working memory and decision-making were not associated with those comorbidities of obesity.

AB Individuals with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders (FH +) are at increased risk for developing substance use disorders themselves relative to those with no such histories (FH -). Here we sought to identify key characteristics associated with FH + status and alcohol and other drug use disorder status in a large cohort of FH + and FH - young adults.
   We conducted principal component analyses on demographic, temperament, and cognitive measures differentiating 506 FH + and 528 FH - young adults. Three principal components were identified, and these component scores were then used to predict the odds of being FH + and the odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Component 1 consisted of measures indexing internalizing traits, with higher component scores indicating greater depressive, anxious, and emotional instability tendencies. Component 2 consisted of measures of externalizing traits as well as exposure to early life adversity (ELA), with higher scores indicating less impulse control, more antisocial behavior, and greater ELA exposure. Component 3 consisted of estimated intelligence, delay discounting, and demographic characteristics, with higher scores indicating lower estimated intelligence, greater discounting of delayed rewards, less education, and lower childhood socioeconomic status. For each 1 point increase in the Component 1, 2, and 3 scores, the odds of being classified FH + increased by 2%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. Similar findings were observed when individuals with alcohol or other drug use disorders were removed from the analyses. Finally, greater Component 2 scores were also associated with increased odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Collectively, these findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the FH + phenotype in young adults and help form a basis for further studies on biological mechanisms underlying risk for substance use disorders. The present findings also provide further support for a prominent role of ELA in promoting risk for problem alcohol and other drug use.

AB Purpose: Studies among youth suggest that physical inactivity, sedentary behaviors, and poor diet quality are associated with poor mental health. Few population-based studies have investigated these relationships longitudinally. We examined the association between physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and diet quality in childhood and the incidence of internalizing and externalizing disorders throughout adolescence.
   Methods: We linked health behavior survey data from 2003 among 10- to 11-year-old children across Nova Scotia, Canada, with administrative health care data from 2003 to 2011. Students' diet quality was assessed using the Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Physical activity and sedentary behaviors were self-reported, and internalizing and externalizing disorders were diagnosed by a physician. We applied Cox regression to examine the associations of the health behaviors with the incidence of internalizing and externalizing disorders between 2003 and 2011.
   Results: Of the 4861 participating students, 23.7% and 9.4% had a diagnosis of internalizing and externalizing disorders, respectively. The incidences of internalizing and externalizing disorders were higher among students who were less physically active and spent more time using computers and video games.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that promoting an active lifestyle in childhood may contribute to the prevention of both internalizing and externalizing disorders during adolescence. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although there is a substantial amount of literature documenting the relationship between child abuse and behavioral problems in China, there is, on the other hand, a limited number of studies on the joint and unique associations of maternal and paternal physical abuse with child behaviors within the Chinese context. The present study, using the family systems theory as the theoretical framework, aims to examine these joint and the unique associations of maternal and paternal physical abuse with externalizing and internalizing behaviors among a community sample of Chinese children. A total of 296 children (54.7% boys, mean age 12.31 +/- 0.56 years) from two parent families participated in the study, and they reported their physical abuse experience by their mother and father in the previous year using the Chinese version of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale. Participants, using the Youth Self Report, reported personal externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and, similarly, their mothers, using the Child Behavior Checklist, assessed children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Linear mixed effect models with random intercept and slope were used to examine the joint and unique associations of maternal and paternal physical abuse with child externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results revealed that physically abused children were more likely to be simultaneously abused by both mothers and fathers. Furthermore, when compared with their non-abused counterparts, children with physical abuse that was carried out solely by mothers (externalizing behaviors: beta = 6.71, 95% CI = 2.45-10.98, p < 0.01; internalizing behaviors: beta = 4.52, 95% CI = 0.37-8.66, p < 0.05) or by both mothers and fathers (externalizing behaviors: beta = 4.52, 95% CI = 1.80-7.24, p < 0.001; internalizing behaviors: beta = 2.98, 95% CI = 0.34-5.61, p < 0.05) reported more externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Externalizing and internalizing behaviors of children who were physically abused solely by fathers did not significantly differ from those of their non-abused counterparts, which may result from the small sample size. The present findings suggest that maternal physical abuse may have a dominant and unique association with child behaviors, regardless of whether paternal physical abuse occurs within the family. Implications for future research and practice within the Chinese context regarding the subject of child behaviors and parental abuse are discussed.

AB This study examined the effect of parenting on the association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and psychiatric resilience in adulthood in a large female twin sample (n = 1423) assessed for severe CSA (i.e., attempted or completed intercourse before age 16). Severe CSA was associated with lower resilience to recent stressors in adulthood (defined as the difference between their internalizing symptoms and their predicted level of symptoms based on cumulative exposure to stressful life events). Subscales of the Parental Bonding Instrument were significantly associated with resilience. Specifically, parental warmth was associated with increased resilience while parental protectiveness was associated with decreased resilience. The interaction between severe CSA and parental authoritarianism was significant, such that individuals with CSA history and higher authoritarianism scores had lower resilience. Results suggest that CSA assessment remains important for therapeutic work in adulthood and that addressing parenting may be useful for interventions in children with a CSA history.

AB Background: There remains a dearth of research examining the "buffering" effect of resilience, wherein resilience at one point in time would be expected to protect an individual against development of psychopathology following future adverse life events.
   Methods: Using longitudinal data from an epidemiological twin sample (N = 7463), this study tested whether resilience would act as a buffer for stressful life events (SLEs) against risk for major depressive disorder(MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Resilience, demographics, and psychopathology were measured at Time 1 and recent SLEs and current MDD and GAD were measured at Time 2.
   Results: Final models, controlling for demographic covariates and Time 1 diagnosis, examined the impact of Time 1 resilience, recent SLEs, their interaction, and a three-way interaction adding sex on MDD and GAD.
   Conclusions: The pattern of findings was the same for MDD and GAD, wherein main effects and two-way interactions of resilience and SLEs were significant, such that greater resilience was protective even in the context of high numbers of past-year SLEs. The three-way interaction was not significant, suggesting that the relationship between SLEs and resilience on psychopathology was the same for both men and women. Findings support the conceptualization of resilience as a buffer against the impact of future life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology. Longitudinal designs and trajectory-based studies that include recurring measures of SLEs could inform conceptualizations of resilience in the context of ongoing adversity and aid in developing interventions aimed at fostering healthy adaptation in the face of stressors.

AB To examine whether the cultural normativeness of parents' beliefs and behaviors moderates the links between those beliefs and behaviors and youths' adjustment, mothers, fathers, and children (N = 1,298 families) from 12 cultural groups in 9 countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States) were interviewed when children were, on average, 10 years old and again when children were 12 years old. Multilevel models examined 5 aspects of parenting (expectations regarding family obligations, monitoring, psychological control, behavioral control, warmth/affection) in relation to 5 aspects of youth adjustment (social competence, prosocial behavior, academic achievement, externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior). Interactions between family level and culture-level predictors were tested to examine whether cultural normativeness of parenting behaviors moderated the link between those behaviors and children's adjustment. More evidence was found for within-than between-culture differences in parenting predictors of youth adjustment. In 7 of the 8 instances in which cultural normativeness was found to moderate the link between parenting and youth adjustment, the link between a particular parenting behavior and youth adjustment was magnified in cultural contexts in which the parenting behavior was more normative.

AB Introduction: Psychiatric and behavioral problems are frequent comorbidities of epilepsy, although their clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates remain uncertain. In this study, we have assessed the frequency of psychopathological problems in a cohort of children with epilepsy, and established their main clinical and EEG-associated features.
   Methods: One hundred fifty-nine young patients with epilepsy were recruited and assessed through the Child Behavior Checklist for preschool-aged children (CBCL 1 1/2-5) or for school-aged children (CBCL 6-18). Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) results were then correlated to the main clinical and EEG data.
   Results: We found emotional and behavioral problems in about half of the children in our sample. Internalizing, social, and attention problems were more common than externalizing features. Moderate intellectual disability, a nonidiopathic etiology of epilepsy, a poor control of seizures, and antiepileptic polytherapies, as well as an early age at seizure-onset and a longer duration of the disorder, were all associated with specific behavioral and emotional problems. A temporal site of interictal EEG abnormalities also enhanced the risk for psychiatric comorbidities, especially in the externalizing domain.
   Conclusions: Several clinical and EEG features are associated with an increased risk for emotional and behavioral comorbidities in children with epilepsy. Their identification may foster an early diagnosis and appropriate care, limiting the worsening of psychiatric symptoms and their impact on quality of life and health status. A better understanding of the underlying clinical and molecular mechanisms is needed to further improve prevention and treatment interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Bidirectional Associations Between Child Sleep Problems and
   Internalizing and Externalizing Difficulties From Preschool to Early
   Adolescence
SO JAMA PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROSPECTIVE COHORT; DISORDERS; ANXIETY; HEALTH; AGE
AB IMPORTANCE Although multiple cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have established that sleep problems and behavioral difficulties are associated in children, the directionality of this association and whether sleep problems are differentially associated with different types of childhood behavioral difficulties are unclear. Understanding these associations will inform the focus and timing of interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether longitudinal and reciprocal associations exist between child sleep problems and externalizing, internalizing, or both behavioral difficulties.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study using nationally representative data from the first 5 waves (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012) of the kindergarten cohort (4983 children aged 4-5 years in 2004) collected for the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Associations were evaluated using cross-lagged structural equation model analyses performed from May 25, 2016, to September 20, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child sleep problems and internalizing and externalizing behavioral difficulties. Sleep problems were defined using parent-reported child sleep problem severity and specific difficulties (ie, difficulty getting to sleep at night, not happy sleeping alone, waking during the night, and restless sleep) on 4 or more nights of the week. Child behavioral difficulties were defined using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for externalizing difficulties (conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention subscales) and internalizing difficulties (emotional problems subscale).
   RESULTS The 4983 children enrolled in 2004 had a mean (SD) age of 4.7 (0.2) years and comprised a similar percentage of boys (2536 [50.9%]) and girls. In 2012, 3956 children (79.4%) aged 12 to 13 years were retained. Significant bidirectional associations were detected between sleep problems and externalizing difficulties during the elementary school transition period, with greater sleep problems associated with later externalizing behavior and vice versa (cross-lagged path coefficient, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.08] to 0.09 [95% CI, 0.06-0.13]). Although sleep was a significant driver of later internalizing difficulties (coefficient, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.07-0.14] to 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12-0.19]), the reverse association was not significant. In the final model that included all 3 constructs, the associations were attenuated but remained significant over time.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that future studies should investigate whether implementing sleep problem intervention decreases the occurrence of both externalizing and internalizing difficulties. Interventions targeting externalizing, but not internalizing, difficultiesmay benefit childhood sleep.

AB Externalizing symptoms robustly predict adolescent substance use (SU); however, findings regarding internalizing symptoms have been mixed, suggesting that there may be important moderators of the relationship between internalizing problems and SU. The present study used a longitudinal community sample (N = 387, 55% female, 83% White) to test whether externalizing symptoms moderated the relationship between internalizing symptoms and trajectories of alcohol and marijuana use from early (age 11-12 years old) to late (age 18-19 years old) adolescence. Two-part latent growth models were used to distinguish trajectories of probability of use from trajectories of amount of use among users. Results suggested that externalizing symptoms moderated the association between internalizing symptoms and probability of alcohol, but not marijuana use. The highest probability of alcohol use was observed at high levels of externalizing symptoms and low levels of internalizing symptoms. A negative protective effect of internalizing symptoms on probability of alcohol use was strongest in early adolescence for youth high on externalizing symptoms. Although moderation was not supported for amount of use among users, both domains of symptomology were associated with amount of alcohol and marijuana use as first-order effects. High levels of externalizing symptoms and low levels of internalizing symptoms were associated with high levels of amount of use among users. These findings suggest that developmental models of substance use that incorporate internalizing symptomology should consider the context of externalizing problems and distinguish probability and amount of use.

AB This study analyzed the unique effects of gender and culture on psychopathology in adolescents from seven countries after controlling for factors which might have contributed to variations in psychopathology. In a sample 2259 adolescents (M = 15 years; 54% female) from France, Germany, Turkey, Greece, Peru, Pakistan, and Poland identity stress, coping with identity stress, maternal parenting (support, psychological control, anxious rearing) and psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing and total symptomatology) were assessed. Due to variations in stress perception, coping style and maternal behavior, these covariates were partialed out before the psychopathology scores were subjected to analyses of variance with gender and country as factors. These analyses leveled out the main effect of country and revealed country-specific gender effects. In four countries, males reported higher internalizing and total symptomatology than females. Partialing out the covariates resulted in a clearer picture of culture-specific and gender dependent effects on psychopathology, which is helpful in designing interventions.

AB Background: This study aimed to determine whether there were sensitive periods when a first exposure to trauma was most associated with emotion dysregulation symptoms in adulthood.
   Methods: Adult participants came from a public urban hospital in Atlanta, GA (n = 1944). Lifetime trauma exposure was assessed using the Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI). Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between the developmental timing of first trauma exposure, classified as early childhood (ages 0-5), middle childhood (ages 6-10), adolescence (ages 11-18), and adulthood (ages 19+), on adult emotion dysregulation symptoms, measured using the abbreviated Emotion Dysregulation Scale.
   Results: Participants exposed to trauma at any age had higher emotion dysregulation scores than their unexposed peers. However, participants first exposed to child maltreatment or interpersonal violence during middle childhood had higher emotion dysregulation scores relative to those first exposed during other developmental stages; these developmental timing differences were detected even after controlling for socio-demographic factors, exposure to other trauma, and frequency of exposure to trauma. Further, after controlling for current psychiatric symptoms, the effect of other interpersonal trauma exposure in middle childhood was diminished and first exposure to other interpersonal violence in early childhood was associated with significantly lower emotion dysregulation symptoms.
   Limitations: Limitations of this study include the use of retrospective reports and absence of complete information about trauma severity or duration.
   Conclusion: These findings should be replicated in other population-based samples with prospective designs to confirm the importance of developmental timing of trauma on later emotion dysregulation.

AB This study investigated patterns of the developmental trajectories of externalizing behavior problems among 449 young maltreated children (ages 4-5) over a period of approximately eight years and examined the roles of maltreatment and protective factors in shaping various trajectory patterns. Secondary research was conducted using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-I). Latent class growth analysis identified three distinctive externalizing trajectory groups: high-decreasing (10%); moderate-increasing (13%); low-stable (77%). Physically or sexually abused children were more likely to be in the high-decreasing group whereas male and Black children were more likely to be in the moderate-increasing group. Child prosocial skills and caregiver well-being decreased the probability of membership in the high-decreasing group compared to the low-stable group. The findings suggest that, despite early exposure to trauma, many maltreated children display a low or normal level of externalizing behavior problems over time, providing empirical evidence of resilience in maltreated children. Interventions focusing on enhancing child prosocial skills and caregiver well-being may be helpful in lowering the risk of clinically significant externalizing behavior problems over the course of childhood among maltreated children.

AB Although there is a well-established connection between father involvement and children's positive behavioral development in general, this relation has been understudied in more vulnerable and high-risk populations. The aims of this study were to examine how the quantity (i.e., the amount of shared activities) and quality (i.e., perceived quality of the father-child relationship) of father involvement are differently related to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems among preadolescents at risk of maltreatment and test if these associations are moderated by father type and child maltreatment. A secondary data analysis was conducted using data from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Generalized estimating equations analysis was performed on a sample of 499 preadolescents aged 12 years. The results indicated that higher quality of father involvement was associated with lower levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems whereas greater quantity of father involvement was associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The positive association between the quantity of father involvement and behavior problems was stronger in adolescents who were physically abused by their father. The association between father involvement and behavior problems did not differ by the type of father co-residing in the home. The findings suggest that policies and interventions aimed at improving the quality of fathers' relationships and involvement with their children may be helpful in reducing behavior problems in adolescents at risk of maltreatment.

AB Prevention programs that strengthen parenting and family functioning have been found to reduce poor behavioral outcomes in adolescents, including substance use, HIV risk, externalizing and internalizing problems. However, there is evidence that not all youth benefit similarly from these programs. Familias Unidas is a family-focused intervention designed to prevent substance use and sexual risk among Hispanic youth and has recently demonstrated unanticipated reductions in internalizing symptoms for some youth. This paper examines variation in intervention response for internalizing symptoms using individual-level data pooled across four distinct Familias Unidas trials: (1) 266 eighth grade students recruited from the general school population; (2) 160 ninth grade students from the general school population; (3) 213 adolescents with conduct, aggression, and/or attention problems; and (4) 242 adolescents with a delinquency history. Causal inference growth mixture modeling suggests a threeclass model. The two largest classes represent youth with low (60 %) and medium (27 %) internalizing symptoms at baseline, and both intervention and control participants show reductions in internalizing symptoms. The third class (13 %) represents youth with high levels of baseline internalizing symptoms who remain at steady levels of internalizing symptoms when exposed to the intervention, but who experience an increase in symptoms under the control condition. Female gender, low baseline levels of parent-adolescent communication, and older age were associated with membership in the high-risk class. These synthesis analyses involving a large sample of youth with varying initial risk levels represent a further step toward strengthening our knowledge of preventive intervention response and improving preventive interventions.

AB This paper presents the first findings of an integrative data analysis of individual-level data from 19 adolescent depression prevention trials (n = 5210) involving nine distinct interventions across 2 years post-randomization. In separate papers, several interventions have been found to decrease the risk of depressive disorders or elevated depressive/internalizing symptoms among youth. One type of intervention specifically targets youth without a depressive disorder who are at risk due to elevated depressive symptoms and/or having a parent with a depressive disorder. A second type of intervention targets two broad domains: prevention of problem behaviors, which we define as drug use/abuse, sexual risk behaviors, conduct disorder, or other externalizing problems, and general mental health. Most of these latter interventions improve parenting or family factors. We examined the shared and unique effects of these interventions by level of baseline youth depressive symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics of the youth (age, sex, parent education, and family income), type of intervention, and mode of intervention delivery to the youth, parent(s), or both. We harmonized eight different measures of depression utilized across these trials and used growth models to evaluate intervention impact over 2 years. We found a significant overall effect of these interventions on reducing depressive symptoms over 2 years and a stronger impact among those interventions that targeted depression specifically rather than problem behaviors or general mental health, especially when baseline symptoms were high. Implications for improving population-level impact are discussed.

AB We examined attendance trajectory profiles among 335 Mexican-American families participating in an 11-week universal intervention to explore if heterogeneity in attendance and thus dosage was associated with intervention response, defined as pre-to-2-year post (T2) reductions in child report of internalizing symptoms. We estimated trajectories accounting for the influence of baseline covariates, selected based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Latino family research, to understand covariate associations with trajectories. Results supported six attendance trajectory groups: nonattenders (NA), early dropouts-low internalizing (EDO-LI), early dropouts-high internalizing (EDO-HI), mid-program dropouts (MPDO), sustained attenders-low internalizing (SA-LI), and sustained attenders-high internalizing (SA-HI). All groups except EDO-HI showed significant pre-to-post change on child report of internalizing; however, trajectory groups reflecting more attendance did not have greater preto-post change. Nonetheless, child report of internalizing differentiated two subgroups of sustained attenders and two subgroups of early dropouts. These results suggest heterogeneity among families with similar patterns of attendance and highlight the importance of modeling this heterogeneity. Although life stress was a barrier to participation, there was minimal support for the HBM. Cultural influences, acculturation, and familism, played a more prominent role in distinguishing trajectories. As expected, the EDO-HI group was less acculturated than both sustained attender groups and reported weaker familism values than the SA-HI group. However, unexpectedly, the SA-LI group had lower familism than the EDO-LI group. The results suggest that the influence of culture on participation is nuanced and may depend on child symptomatology.

AB The parasympathetic nervous system supports social interaction and varies in relation to psychopathology. However, we know little about parasympathetic processes from a dyadic framework, nor in early childhood when parent-child social interactions become more complex and child psychopathology first emerges. We hypothesized that higher risk for psychopathology (maternal psychopathology symptoms and child problem behavior) would be related to weaker concordance of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) between mothers and children (M = 31/2 years old; N = 47) and that these relations could vary by social contextual demands, comparing unstructured free play, semistructured cleanup, and structured teaching tasks. Multilevel coupled autoregressive models of RSA during parent-child interactions showed overall dynamic, positive concordance in mother-child RSA over time, but this concordance was weaker during the more structured teaching task. In contrast, higher maternal psychological aggression and child externalizing and internalizing problems were associated with weaker dyadic RSA concordance, which was weakest during unstructured free play. Higher maternal depressive symptoms were related to disrupted individual mother and child RSA but not to RSA concordance. Thus, risk for psychopathology was generally related to weaker dyadic mother-child RSA concordance in contexts with less complex structure or demands (free play, cleanup), as compared to the structured teaching task that showed weaker RSA concordance for all dyads. Implications for the meaning and utility of the construct of parent-child physiological coregulation are discussed.

AB Low resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and to a lesser extent excessive RSA reactivity to emotion evocation, are observed in many psychiatric disorders characterized by emotion dysregulation, including syndromes spanning the internalizing and externalizing spectra, and other conditions such as nonsuicidal self-injury. Nevertheless, some inconsistencies exist. For example, null outcomes in studies of RSA-emotion dysregulation relations are sometimes observed among younger participants. Such findings may derive from use of age inappropriate frequency bands in calculating RSA. We combine data from five published samples (N = 559) spanning ages 4 to 17 years, and reanalyze RSA data using age-appropriate respiratory frequencies. Misspecifying respiratory frequencies results in overestimates of resting RSA and underestimates of RSA reactivity, particularly among young children. Underestimates of developmental shifts in RSA and RSA reactivity from preschool to adolescence were also observed. Although correlational analyses revealed weak negative associations between resting RSA and aggression, those with clinical levels of externalizing exhibited lower resting RSA than their peers. No associations between RSA reactivity and externalizing were observed. Results confirm that age-corrected frequency bands should be used when estimating RSA, and that literature-wide overestimates of resting RSA, underestimates of RSA reactivity, and underestimates of developmental shifts in RSA and RSA reactivity may exist.

AB Background: Early childhood self-control and parenting are suggested to play key roles in the development of child problem behavior. The current study aims to 1) replicate earlier work by examining the unique and combined effects of child self-control and parenting on child problem behavior and 2) extend earlier work by including both mother and father reports.& para;& para;Methods: Data were used from 107 Dutch families: mothers, fathers, and their two-year old child. Child self-control was measured using both father's and mother's reports of effortful control and with an observed behavioral task (i.e., gift-in-bag task). Similarly, parenting (i.e., emotional availability and discipline) and child problem behavior (i.e., externalizing and internalizing problems) were measured by using both father's and mother's reports.& para;& para;Results: Child self-control reported by fathers and mothers, but not observed self-control, was related to fewer externalizing and (mother-reported) internalizing problems. Paternal emotional availability showed a modest association with fewer child externalizing problems, maternal emotional availability was related to fewer internalizing problems. Finally, there was an interaction between father- (but not mother) reported self-control and paternal emotional availability in the prediction of child internalizing problems. No main or interaction effect was revealed for discipline.& para;& para;Conclusion: Findings confirm prior work on self-control, parenting, and child problem behavior. Most importantly however, the current study adds to the literature by highlighting the need for additional research including maternal as well as paternal data. Specifically, insight in the unique role of fathers may shed light on aspects of child adjustment not covered by mother reports alone.

AB Objective: Although predictors of the prevalence of behavioral problems in preterm-born children have been frequently studied, predictors of behavioral change in these children remain unknown. Therefore, in this study we explore predictors of short-term changes in problem behavior in preterm-born preschoolers, an age period characterized by rapid behavioral change.& para;& para;Method: Two- to 5-year-old children born with a gestational age < 32 weeks and/or birth weight < 1500 g were eligible, because of their high risk for behavioral problems. Following screening, 59 children with a t-score >= 60 on either the internal, external or total problem scale of the Child Behavior Checklist were included in the study. Linear mixed modeling was used to investigate predictors of change in behavior over a 1-year period.& para;& para;Results: Higher levels of parenting stress, parent perceived child vulnerability, and parental hostility towards the child and lower educational levels of the mother significantly predicted increases in externalizing behavior. The higher the age of the child, the more internalizing problems decreased.& para;& para;Conclusions: Parenting stress, parent perceived child vulnerability and parental hostility towards the child were the only modifiable predictors of increases in externalizing behavior, whilst no modifiable predictors of internalizing behavior were found. There may be a reciprocal interaction between stress in parents and child externalizing problems. Furthermore, stress and worries may directly influence parents' reports on behavioral measures, because it could cause them to be concerned by behavior otherwise perceived as normal. Therefore, future interventions for parents of preterm-born children should primarily address parental stress and concerns regarding their child.

AB This study examined the array of associations among the emotional valence and the coherence of mothers' representations of their relationship with their toddlers, mothers' reported parenting stress, and toddlers' internalizing and externalizing behaviors. To evaluate maternal representations, 55 mothers were interviewed using the Five Minute Speech Sample procedure (FMSS; Magana et al., 1986), which was coded for criticism and positive comments (Magana-Amato, 1993), as well as coherence (Sher-Censor & Yates, 2015). Mothers also completed the Parenting Stress Index - Short Form (PSI; Abidin, 1997) to evaluate their parenting stress and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/1.5-5; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) to assess their toddlers' internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results indicated that parenting stress was associated with maternal criticism and fewer positive comments in the FMSS, but not with the coherence of mothers' FMSS. Parenting stress, criticism, and lower coherence in the FMSS were associated with maternal reports of externalizing behaviors. Only parenting stress and lower coherence in the FMSS were related to mothers' reports of internalizing behaviors of the child. Thus, the emotional valence and the coherence of mothers' representations of their relationship with their child and parenting stress may each constitute a distinct aspect of parenting and contribute to the understanding of individual differences in toddlers' internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Implications for research and practice with families of toddlers are discussed.

AB The main aim of the present study was to examine differences in behavioral problems in toddlers born very preterm in Brazil and Italy. The sample comprised 154 toddlers (18-24 months of age) born very preterm, including 76 toddlers from Brazil and 78 toddlers from Italy. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess behavioral problems. Specific sociodemographic factors (i.e., maternal age at childbirth and maternal education) and neonatal factors (i.e., gestational age, sex, and length of hospitalization) were tested as potential mediators of country-related differences in behavioral problems. Brazilian toddlers presented more internalizing, externalizing, and total behavioral problems compared with their Italian counterparts. The effect of country on the toddlers' internalizing and total behavioral problems was mediated by maternal age at childbirth and education. Independent effects of country, maternal age at childbirth, and maternal education emerged for externalizing behavioral problems. No significant effect emerged for neonatal variables. These findings suggest that sociodemographic factors, in addition to country-related differences, should be considered when assessing the risk of behavioral problems in preterm toddlers.

AB Parents' emotional functioning represents a central mechanism in the caregiving environment's influence on adolescent affective brain function. However, a paucity of research has examined links between parental emotional arousal and regulation and adolescents' affective brain function. Thus, the present study examined associations between parents' self-rated negative emotion, parent emotion regulation difficulties, and adolescent brain responsivity to negative and positive emotional stimuli. Participants included 64 12-14 year-old adolescents (31 females) and their female primary caregivers. Adolescents viewed negative, positive, and neutral emotional stimuli during an fMRI scanning session. Region of interest analyses showed that higher parent negative emotion was related to adolescents' greater ACC and vmPFC response to both negatively- and positively-valenced emotional stimuli; whereas, parent negative emotion was related to adolescents' greater amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli only. Furthermore, parent emotion regulation moderated the association between parent negative emotion and adolescents' brain response to negative emotional stimuli, such that parents with high negative emotion and high emotion regulation difficulties had adolescents with the greatest affective brain response. Findings highlight the importance of considering both parent emotional arousal and regulation in understanding the family affective environment and its relation to adolescent emotion-related brain development.

AB The goals of the present research were to: (a) develop and provide preliminary validation of a parent-rated measure of social avoidance in early childhood; and (b) to evaluate a conceptual model of the direct and indirect links among young children's social withdrawal (shyness, unsociability, social avoidance), peer problems, and indices of internalizing problems (social anxiety, depression). Participants were N = 564 children (272 boys, 292 girls; M-age = 67.29 mos, SD = 11.70) attending kindergarten and Grade 1 classes in public schools in southeastern Ontario, Canada. A new subscale assessing social avoidance was added to an existing parent-rated measure of children's social withdrawal. Indices of children's socioemotional functioning were provided by parents and teachers. Among the results, the revised measure of multiple forms of social withdrawal demonstrated good psychometric properties, moderate stability 16 months later, and evidence of validity. Shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance also displayed differential patterns of associations with indices of children's socioemotional functioning. Results are discussed in terms of the assessment and implications of different forms of social withdrawal in early childhood.

AB Emotional investment may be defined as a willingness to accept and become committed to a child, and being aware of influencing the child's development. Research in this field is limited, and has shown that commitment in particular is associated with foster children's socio-emotional functioning. Our aim was therefore to investigate 60 foster parents' acceptance, commitment and awareness of influence to their early placed foster children at 2 years, as well as to investigate the association between these three concepts and the foster children's social-emotional functioning (externalizing, internalizing, dysregulation and competence) at 2 (T1) and 3 (T2) years of age. The caregivers were interviewed with "This is My Baby", and completed the questionnaire "Infant Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment". Results showed that on average the foster parents were rated quite high on emotional investment. Linear regressions, including one predictor and one outcome variable, revealed associations between emotional investment and foster children's socio-emotional functioning. Moreover, in regressions including all three predictors, commitment significantly negatively predicted externalizing behavior in the foster children at Tl, while acceptance significantly negatively predicted dysregulation at T2. Lastly, among others for externalizing, the coefficient of commitment was significantly higher at Tl than at T2. Our results indicate a possible short-term influence of commitment on externalizing- and a possible long-term influence of acceptance on dysregulation behavior in foster children. We will therefore highlight the clinical importance of emotional investment in foster care, in order to help the young foster child towards a healthy social-emotional functioning.

AB The relationships among social-emotional learning (SEL), academics, and school behaviors have been widely established. However, it is less clear how patterns of co-occurring SEL needs among high school freshmen students relate to grades, behaviors, and their perceptions about the importance of social skills. This study uses latent class analysis to identify patterns of SEL needs among ninth grade students (n = 323), their associations with prior and current academic and school behavioral performance, and their perception of the importance of social skills. Five patterns of SEL needs emerged: (1) low-all, (2) high-all, (3) social skills problems only, (4) assertion, externalizing, and internalizing problems, and (5) high behavioral needs. Consistent with other research, students with more SEL needs experienced greater academic and behavioral problems. Additionally, importance ratings of social skills had varying associations with membership across the patterns of SEL needs. Findings highlight the importance for school practitioners to understand patterns and mindsets of students' social skills to improve programming efforts targeting academic and behavioral outcomes.

AB Pwpose: In the current study we examined associations between children's pre-adoption experiences (type of pre-adoption care and early deprivation) and their adaptive and maladaptive behavioral adjustment. Associations with prosocial behavior, attention problems, internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems were investigated.
   Methods: Parental ratings of pre-adoption experiences and behavioral adjustment of 891 adopted Chinese girls aged between 4 and 12 year were obtained. The children were adopted from institutional care (n = 595), foster care (n = 66) or a combination of institutional and foster care (n = 228). Prosocial behavior was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Attention problems, internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 4-18 (CBCL). In addition to the main effects of pre-adoption experiences, we tested interaction effects between pre-adoption experiences and age at adoption, controlling for several family and child background variables.
   Results: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that type of pre-adoption care was not associated with behavioral adjustment. Early deprivation, on the other hand, was negatively associated with prosocial behavior, and positively associated with attention problems, internalizing and externalizing problems. Interaction analyses revealed no significant associations.
   Conclusions: The results showed that pre-adoption deprivation increased the risk for less optimal behavioral adjustment. The effects however were small, leaving room for other explaining factors both in the pre- and post adoption environment of the child.

AB Although not part of its stated aims, current welfare legislation is assumed to benefit children through increased parental employment and self-sufficiency. Research findings on the extent to which parental welfare participation improves child well-being are inconclusive. This study investigates the behavioral outcomes of young children whose mothers have received TANF using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2169). Controlling for maternal demographic characteristics, current financial status, and health risks, we found that the difference between children's externalizing behaviors in families of former TANF recipients relative to children of mothers who had never been on welfare decreased the longer mothers had been off welfare. However, overall, externalizing behaviors were significantly higher among children of former TANF recipients relative to children whose mothers had never received welfare. The findings suggest that ensuring healthy development for children requires long-term supports to help mothers as they transition off welfare.

AB Introduction. - Interest in the study of early feeding disorders (FD) has steadily increased during recent decades. During this period, research described the importance of the transactional relationships and the complex interplay between caregiver and child over time. On the basis of the previous studies, our study tried to explore the associations between the characteristics of the parents and the temperamental characteristics of the infants with early FD.
   Goals. - A first aim of the present study was to show if parental perception of child temperament (including ability for arousal self-regulation) and parental characteristics (emotional and eating attitudes) are associated with early FD. A second aim was to identify emotional/behavioral difficulties in children with early FD by comparing children with a normal development and children with a diagnosed FD, and to investigate whether there are any correlations between parental emotional and feeding characteristics and a child's eating and emotional-behavioral development. A final aim was to explore if feeding conflict is bound to both infant ability for arousal self-regulatation and caregiver emotional status during meals.
   Method. - Participants: 58 clinical dyads (children aged 1-36 months) and 60 in the control group participated in the study. The sample of 58 infants and young children and their parents was recruited in a pediatric hospital. They were compared to healthy children recruited in several nurseries. Procedure: all parent-child pairs in the clinical sample were observed in a 20-minute video-recording during a meal using the procedure of the Chatoor Feeding Scale. After the videotaping, parents completed a battery of self-report questionnaires assessing their child's and their own psychological symptom status. Measures: Child's malnutrition assessment was based on the Waterlow criteria. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 11/2-5) was used to assess a child's emotional behavioral functioning. The Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised (IBQ-R), a widely used parent-report measure of infant temperament, was used to identify the structure of infant temperament. The Eating Attitude Test-40, a self-report symptom inventory, was used to identify concerns with eating and weight in the adult population. The Chatoor Feeding Scale was used to assess mother-child feeding interactions during a meal based on the analysis of the videotaped feeding session.
   Results. - Analyses revealed that children with FD did not have a difficult temperament, especially no disability for arousal of self-regulatation, but their emotional-behavioral functioning is characterized by internalizing problems. Analyses of the EAT-40 showed that mothers of the children diagnosed with FD had significantly higher scores than mothers of the control sample; it means these mothers showed more dysfunctional eating attitudes. In addition, meals were characterized by negative effects in parents in the clinical group. When compared to the control sample, the feeding interactions between children with FD and their parents were characterized by low dyadic reciprocity, high maternal non-contingency, great interactional conflict and struggles with food. However, no significant correlation emerged either between the severity of malnutrition in infants or the conflict during feeding.
   Conclusion. - Our study confirms the relations established in previous research. Finally, future longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify and investigate others factors that may be involved in early feeding disorders. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.

AB Objectives. - In Switzerland, adolescents are responsible for many crimes. In 2014, almost 13,000 juvenile offenders were convicted by the courts (mainly convicted under the Swiss Criminal Code and Narcotics Act Consumption). Although a decrease trend was observed for 2008, these delinquent behaviors remain a concern for public health, politics and educational authorities. In addition to repressive measures, the implementation of an effective and appropriate treatment program appears necessary. Indeed, the admission to an educational center is a "time-window" useful to establish short and specific interventions (rehabilitation programs, psychological treatment and educational measures). In order to propose interventions and appropriate educational measures, it is essential to know the situation of juvenile offenders. The aim of the present study is to describe adolescents admitted in an educational center for youth delinquents. The study highlighted gender-specific differences in sociodemographic data and psychiatric disorders.
   Methods. - The sample is composed of 43 delinquent adolescents with 32.6% of girls and 67.4% of boys. During a structured interview, each youth answered about social-economic, and sociodemographic questions. Psychiatric disorders were assessed with the French version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime version (K-SAD-PL).
   Results. - The results indicated that almost two-third of youths (61%) had dropped out of school. Additionally, results revealed that there are not gender differences in sociodemographic data. Furthermore, whereas girls presented a mix of internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders, boys where more exclusively externalizing psychiatric disorders. More specifically, girls showed a significantly higher level of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder than boys. Girls showed a higher risk for suicide. In contrast, boys used more illegal substances than girls (mostly cannabis). Overall, in 40% of adolescents, illegal substances use started before the age of 14 years.
   Conclusion. - This study highlighted gender differences in psychiatric disorders related to delinquent behaviors. Indeed, girls showed more complex psychiatric disorders than boys. Thus, a therapeutic program should target gender-specific needs of young offenders, focusing on the most relevant aspects of psychiatric disorder such as internalizing problems in girls.

AB Empirically validated interventions addressing childhood psychological problems are now readily available, but success likely depends in part on accurately identifying which children will benefit from which intervention. This pilot study examined the stress activation and response system, first as a way to differentiate high versus low-risk children, and second to explore indicators of the stress system associated with favorable intervention response. Method. Participants (N = 43, 58% male) were school-aged children who qualified for inclusion in the Early Risers Skills for Success Prevention Program based on their elevated levels of aggressive and/or socially withdrawn behavior and a normally developing comparison group. Compared to the normally developing group, children who were participants in the intervention exhibited a more blunted cortisol response to the stress paradigm. However, for the children in the intervention group, elevated cortisol levels at the start of the stress paradigm were concurrently associated with internalizing problems and predictive of improvement in internalizing problems over time. These findings provide preliminary evidence that hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis biological variables may be helpful tools for identifying children who would benefit from intervention and personalizing interventions.

AB Objective: The evidence accumulated in the relevant literature suggests that the presence and evolution of gambling could be correlated with the internalizing and externalizing problems and with the attachment style. This paper aims at exploring this perspective further. In particular, it analyses how such risk factors interact within the specific context of adolescent gambling disorder.
   Method: The sample comprises 91 adolescents, 61 male and 30 female, in the 17-22 age range (M = 17.77; SD = 0.98). A structural equation model was used to examine the relationship between the Youth Self-Report latent factors and pathological gambling, and the mode of attachment was assumed to act as a moderator.
   Results: Our results suggest that in the group characterized by a fearful attachment style there was a positive relationship between somatization and propensity to risk (p = 0.008), whereas in the dismissing attachment group there was a positive relationship between a greater tendency to delinquent behaviour and gambling risk (p = 0.042).
   Conclusions: The various insecure attachment stylespatterns may contribute in different ways to the development of oppositional-provocative behaviour and problems of conduct in adolescents.

AB A body of literature connects parental emotion socialization behaviors to child outcomes, though little research attention has been devoted to parents' culturally embedded socialization goals that influence their socialization behaviors in diverse samples. In the present study, we examined interrelations among maternal socialization goals, emotion socialization behaviors, and child functioning in families from 2 major Asian countries, China and India. A total of 305 6th and 7th grade children and their mothers across both countries participated. Mothers completed measures of their socialization goals, their responses to children's emotions, child behavior problems, and children completed a measure of emotion regulation (ER) at a single point in time. Factor analysis of the measure of parental responses to children's emotions yielded 2 factors (supportive and nonsupportive responses), with some items from the commonly used parent-report measure Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale (Fabes, Eisenberg, & Bernzweig, 1990), while others reflected culturally salient socialization approaches in Asia (i.e., child training, explanation). Using these data-driven supportive and nonsupportive response composites, mediation models were tested for the full sample. Reports of mothers' supportive responses and child ER sequentially mediated the relation between maternal relational socialization goals and child internalizing problems. Reports of child emotion dysregulation mediated the relation between maternal nonsupportive responses and child externalizing problems. Findings of this study highlight the relevance of culturally salient parental socialization goals and socialization behaviors in understanding child functioning in diverse cultural groups.

AB This study aimed at identifying specific clusters of maladaptive emotional-behavioral symptoms in adolescent victims of motorbike collisions considering their scores on alexithymia and impulsivity in addition to examining the prevalence of clinical binge eating behaviors (respectively through the Youth Self-Report (YSR), Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), and Binge Eating Scale (BES)). Emotional-behavioral profiles, difficulties in identifying and describing feelings, impulsivity, and binge eating behaviors have been assessed in 159 adolescents addressing emergency departments following motorbike collisions. Our results showed a cluster of adolescents with clinical binge eating behaviors, high rates of motorbike accidents, and high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems, alexithymia, and impulsivity (23.3% of the sample); a second cluster of adolescents with clinical binge eating behaviors, a moderate number of collisions, and moderate levels of emotional and behavioral problems on the above four dimensions (25.8% of the sample); and a third cluster of youth without clinical binge eating behaviors, with a moderate number of accidents, and with low scores on the four dimensions (50.9% of the sample). Adolescents of Cluster 1 showed a higher likelihood to be involved in motorbike collisions than the youth in Clusters 2 and 3 (p < 0.0001). We suggest that adolescents' motor collisions could be associated with their difficulties in emotion regulation and with their impaired psychological profiles, which could also underpin their disordered eating. The identification of specific clusters of psychopathological symptoms among this population could be useful for the construction of prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing motor collision recidivism and alleviating co-occurring psychopathologies.

AB Objective: This prospective longitudinal study investigated sleep disturbance (SD) and internalizing problems after traumatic injury, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) or extracranial/bodily injury (EI) in children and adolescents, relative to typically developing (TD) children. We also examined longitudinal relations between SD and internalizing problems postinjury. Method: Participants (N = 87) ages 8-15 included youth with TBI, EI, and TD children. Injury groups were recruited from a Level 1 trauma center after sustaining vehicle-related injuries. Parent-reported SD and internalizing problems were assessed at preinjury/baseline, and 6 and 12 months postinjury. Linear mixed models evaluated the relation of group and time of assessment on outcomes. Results: Controlling for age, the combined traumatic injury group experienced significantly higher postinjury levels of SD (p = .042) and internalizing problems (p = .024) than TD children; however, TBI and EI injury groups did not differ from each other. Injury severity was positively associated with SD in the EI group only, but in both groups SD was associated with additional postinjury sequelae, including fatigue and externalizing behavior problems. Internalizing problems predicted subsequent development of SD but not vice versa. The relation between injury and SD 1 year later was consistent with mediation by internalizing problems at 6 months postinjury. Conclusions: Children with both types of traumatic injury demonstrated higher SD and internalizing problems than healthy children. Internalizing problems occurring either prior to or following pediatric injury may be a risk factor for posttraumatic SD. Consequently, internalizing problems may be a promising target of intervention to improve both SD and related adjustment concerns.

AB Prior research demonstrates a link between exposure to childhood adversity and psychopathology later in development. However, work on mechanisms linking adversity to psychopathology fails to account for specificity in these pathways across different types of adversity. Here, we test a conceptual model that distinguishes deprivation and threat as distinct forms of childhood adversity with different pathways to psychopathology. Deprivation involves an absence of inputs from the environment, such as cognitive and social stimulation, that influence psychopathology by altering cognitive development, such as verbal abilities. Threat includes experiences involving harm or threat of harm that increase risk for psychopathology through disruptions in social-emotional processing. We test the prediction that deprivation, but not threat, increases risk for psychopathology through altered verbal abilities. Data were drawn from the Child Development Project (N = 585), which followed children for over a decade. We analyze data from assessment points at age 5, 6, 14, and 17 years. Mothers completed interviews at age 5 and 6 on exposure to threat and deprivation experiences. Youth verbal abilities were assessed at age 14. At age 17, mothers reported on child psychopathology. A path analysis model tested longitudinal paths to internalizing and externalizing problems from experiences of deprivation and threat. Consistent with predictions, deprivation was associated with risk for externalizing problems via effects on verbal abilities at age 14. Threat was associated longitudinally with both internalizing and externalizing problems, but these effects were not mediated by verbal abilities. Results suggest that unique developmental mechanisms link different forms of adversity with psychopathology.

AB A considerable amount of research has been conducted on the aversive impact of prolonged interpersonal childhood trauma, but data on possible associations with motivational concepts (self-efficacy, self-esteem and locus of control) in adult survivors is scarce. The purpose of this study is to investigate specific coherences between childhood abuse and adult life events with (a) motivational concepts (MC), (b) the emotion regulation strategy "goal-directed behavior" and (c) the possible mediation of emotion regulation (ER) on motivational concepts. We use data from a cross-sectional survey in Vienna (VIA-S) obtained from 220 adult survivors of prolonged interpersonal childhood trauma. In addition, we assess the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5, the subscale "Goals" (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), the Short Scale for Measuring General Self-Efficacy Beliefs, the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale, and an extended version of the Internal-External Control Beliefs-4 Scale. An estimated multi-group path-model, divided by gender, was also conducted with the measures indicated above. Our results show that prolonged interpersonal childhood trauma directly relates to reduced self-efficacy, self-esteem, and difficulties in ER. Concurrently, ER serves as a mediator for all MC. No gender differences were observed. Associations with adult life events were only found regarding self-efficacy. This study supports the notion that prolonged interpersonal childhood trauma in institutional settings impacts ER, which further mediates MC. Despite several study limitations (e.g. lack of a control group) the presented findings underline the importance of broadening the perception of trauma sequelae as well as integrating inhibited ER strategies and MC.

AB Sexual abuse has the potential to generate serious emotional consequences for its victims, but there is high variability in the symptoms reported by different victims. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain the factors associated with the symptoms presented by sexual abuse victims. The aim of the study was to use a single model to evaluate the relationship between sexual abuse characteristics (frequency, violence, relation with the aggressor and physical commitment), cognitive and behavioral factors (self-efficacy, active coping and perceived family support) and internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress) in a group of sexually abused adolescents. The participants included 106 female adolescent victims of sexual abuse (M = 14.25 years, SD = 1.74). The results of a path analysis indicated that sexual abuse characteristics were unrelated to symptomatology. Only a negative relationship was observed between the victim's relationship with the aggressor and PTSD symptomatology. The violence of the sexual abuse was negatively related to self-efficacy, and self-efficacy was positively related to active coping and negatively related to symptomatology. Finally, the perception of family support was positively related to self-efficacy and negatively related to symptomatology. These results suggest the need to consider the studied factors in the process of psychotherapy with victims of sexual abuse.

AB Researchers have shown that parents often disagree in their ratings of their children's behavior, and that these discrepancies are typically related to child and family characteristics (e.g., child's age, parent psychopathology). Few studies, however, have examined discrepancies in how mothers and fathers rate child behavior during a stressful family context such as a parent's wartime deployment. The present study of 174 military families (children aged 6 to 11 years; 54.0% female) examined whether family factors (parental sense of control, marital satisfaction) and contextual risk factors related to a parent's wartime deployment (number and length of deployments, battle experiences, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms) were associated with discrepancies in how mothers and fathers rated internalizing and externalizing behaviors in their children. Using a latent congruency model, our results showed that when parents self-reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms, both mothers, = -.33, p = .021, and fathers, = .41, p = .026, tended to also report higher levels of internalizing symptoms in their child, relative to what their spouse reported. In comparison to mothers, fathers also tended to report higher levels of child externalizing symptoms, = .44, p = .019. Our findings may help clinicians understand how parent mental health within a stressful family context relates and/or informs a parent's ratings on assessments of his or her child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

AB Food insecurity remains a persistent problem in the United States. Several studies have shown that food insecurity is associated with child externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. However, some potential methodological limitations remain. For example, most studies use a household measure of food insecurity while there is evidence that children, especially younger ones, tend to be shielded by their parents from experiencing food insecurity. In addition, the mechanisms through which food insecurity affects children are not well understood. This study uses longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to address these limitations. Fixed-effects models show that the association is even larger using a measure of child food insecurity instead of a household one. Correlated-random effects models show a large difference in child behavior problems between food secure and food insecure children due to unobserved heterogeneity. In addition, the association between child food insecurity and child externalizing behaviors remains largely unexplained while food insecurity among adults explains almost all the variation in the association with child internalizing behaviors. Food insecure children and parents are at risk of micronutrient deficiencies, which may lead to behavior problems in young children. These findings underscore the need for greater focus on reducing the risk of food insecurity, especially for children in fragile families, in order to reduce behavior problems and improve their educational attainment.

AB Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) demonstrate challenges with executive function (EF), adaptive behavior, and mental health, all of which place long-term wellbeing at risk. In the current study we examined the relation between parent-rated EF and adaptive functioning and internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depression), as we expected that identifying the specific EF domains most closely related to these indices of functioning would illuminate opportunities for targeted intervention. Participants included 59 children and adolescents with ASD (M=10.1 years) and 67 who were typically developing (TD) (M=9.4 years) matched on age, IQ, mental age, and maternal education. Caregivers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of EF (BRIEF) and Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2). Parents rated children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more challenges across most of the examined BRIEF and BASC-2 indices and scales, with the exception of organization of materials (BRIEF) and anxiety (BASC-2). For both groups, metacognitive EF processes emerged as strongly associated with practical, conceptual, and social skills, though different BRIEF scales emerged as significant across the component subdomains. In terms of the relation with mental health, BRIEF index scores were unrelated to anxiety for both groups. Behavior regulation, however, was significantly associated with depression symptoms for children with and without ASD. The findings highlight the possibility that targeting particular EF domains among individuals with and without ASD may not only have direct benefit for behavior regulation and metacognitive abilities, but may also extend to other areas of life, including adaptive behavior and concomitant internalizing symptomatology.

   Lay SummaryWe examined whether parents' ratings of their children's flexibility and ability to monitor their behavior predicted adaptive skills (e.g., ability to complete day-to-day personal tasks, communicate, and socialize) and symptoms of anxiety and depression among children with and without autism spectrum disorder. For both groups, children's abilities to manage and monitor their behavior were strongly related to adaptive skills. Children's flexibility and ability to inhibit inappropriate behavior and control their emotions was associated with depression symptoms for both groups.

AB The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related potential occurring when individuals make mistakes, and is increased in children with internalizing psychopathology. We recently found that harsh parenting predicts a larger ERN in children, and recent work has suggested that variation in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene may moderate the impact of early life adversity. Parents and children completed measures of parenting when children were 3 years old (N = 201); 3 years later, the ERN was measured and diagnostic interviews as well as dimensional symptom measures were completed. We found that harsh parenting predicted an increased ERN only among children with a methionine allele of the BDNF genotype, and evidence of moderated mediation: the ERN mediated the relationship between parenting and internalizing diagnoses and dimensional symptoms only if children had a methionine allele. We tested this model with externalizing disorders, and found that harsh parenting predicted externalizing outcomes, but the ERN did not mediate this association. These findings suggest that harsh parenting predicts both externalizing and internalizing outcomes in children; however, this occurs through different pathways that uniquely implicate error-related brain activity in the development of internalizing disorders.

AB BackgroundThe objective was to evaluate a supposed clinical interdependency of myofascial trigger points and migraine in children. Such interdependency would support an interaction of spinal and trigeminal afferences in the trigemino-cervical complex as a contributing factor in migraine.
   MethodsChildren 18years with the confirmed diagnosis of migraine were prospectively investigated. Comprehensive data on medical history, clinical neurological and psychological status were gathered. Trigger points in the trapezius muscle were identified by palpation and the threshold of pressure pain at these points was measured. Manual pressure was applied to the trigger points, and the occurrence and duration of induced headache were recorded. At a second consultation (4weeks after the first), manual pressure with the detected pressure threshold was applied to non-trigger points within the same trapezius muscle (control). Headache and related parameters were again recorded and compared to the results of the first consultation.
   ResultsA total of 13 girls and 13 boys with migraine and a median age of 14.5 (Range 6.3-17.8) years took part in the study. Manual pressure to trigger points in the trapezius muscle led to lasting headache after termination of the manual pressure in 13 patients while no patient experienced headache when manual pressure was applied to non-trigger points at the control visit (p<0.001). Headache was induced significantly more often in children 12years and those with internalizing behavioural disorder.
   ConclusionWe found an association between trapezius muscle myofascial trigger points and migraine, which might underline the concept of the trigemino-cervical complex, especially in adolescents.
   SignificanceIn children with migraine headache can often be induced by pressure to myofascial trigger points, but not by pressure to non-trigger points in the trapezius muscle. This supports the hypothesis of a trigemino-cervical-complex in the pathophysiology of migraine, which might have implications for innovative therapies in children with migraine.

AB This study aims to (1) investigate the neuropathology of mild to severe pediatric TBI and (2) elucidate the predictive value of conventional and innovative neuroimaging for functional outcome. Children aged 8-14 years with trauma control (TC) injury (n = 27) were compared to children with mild TBI and risk factors for complicated TBI (mild(RF+), n = 20) or moderate/severe TBI (n = 17) at 2.8 years post-injury. Neuroimaging measures included: acute computed tomography (CT), volumetric analysis on post-acute conventional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and post-acute diffusion tensor imaging (DTI, analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics and voxel-wise regression). Functional outcome was measured using Common Data Elements for neurocognitive and behavioral functioning. The results show that intracranial pathology on acute CT-scans was more prevalent after moderate/severe TBI (65%) than after mild(RF+) TBI (35%; p = .035), while both groups had decreased white matter volume on conventional MRI (ps ae<currency> .029, ds ae<yen> -0.74). The moderate/severe TBI group further showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in a widespread cluster affecting all white matter tracts, in which regional associations with neurocognitive functioning were observed (FSIQ, Digit Span and RAVLT Encoding) that consistently involved the corpus callosum. FA had superior predictive value for functional outcome (i.e. intelligence, attention and working memory, encoding in verbal memory and internalizing problems) relative to acute CT-scanning (i.e. internalizing problems) and conventional MRI (no predictive value). We conclude that children with mild(RF+) TBI and moderate/severe TBI are at risk of persistent white matter abnormality. Furthermore, DTI has superior predictive value for neurocognitive out-come relative to conventional neuroimaging.

AB The study investigated longitudinal relations between teacher-perceived children's personality traits and teacher aide-assessed children's adjustment. Questionnaire data on 5-year-old kindergarteners' (N = 240; 47 % boys) Extraversion, Neuroticism, Disagreeableness, Conscientiousness, Social Competence, Internalizing Problems, and Externalizing Problems were collected. One year later, the children's schoolteachers and their aides completed identical assessments. Using a cross-lagged design, the results showed that the trait- and adjustment measures from age 5 to age 6 were moderately and modestly stable, respectively. Simultaneous testing of the vulnerability and the scar model provided support to the vulnerability model for Social Competence. The children's Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and low Neuroticism predicted subsequent Social Competence, but not vice versa. Consistent with the vulnerability model, low Extraversion and low Conscientiousness also predicted later Internalizing Problems. Further results for problem behavior suggested bidirectional associations of Neuroticism and Disagreeableness with Internalizing and Externalizing Problems, respectively, supporting both the scar and the vulnerability model.

AB BackgroundDuring adolescence, peer victimization is a potent type of social stressor that can confer enduring risk for poor mental and physical health. Given recent research implicating inflammation in promoting a variety of serious mental and physical health problems, this study examined the role that peer victimization and cognitive vulnerability (i.e. negative cognitive styles and hopelessness) play in shaping adolescents' pro-inflammatory cytokine responses to an acute social stressor.
   MethodsAdolescent girls at risk for psychopathology (n=157; M-age=14.73years; SD=1.38) were exposed to a laboratory-based social stressor before and after which we assessed salivary levels of three key pro-inflammatory cytokines - interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-).
   ResultsAs hypothesized, adolescents with greater peer victimization exposure exhibited greater increases in IL-6 and IL1- in response to the laboratory-based social stressor. Moreover, for all three cytokines individually, as well as for a combined latent factor of inflammation, peer victimization predicted enhanced inflammatory responding most strongly for adolescents with high levels of hopelessness.
   ConclusionsThe findings reveal a biological pathway by which peer victimization may interact with cognitive vulnerability to influence health in adolescence.

TI A single-session growth mindset intervention for adolescent anxiety and

AB BackgroundSingle-session interventions (SSIs) show promise in the prevention and treatment of youth psychopathology, carrying potential to improve the scalability and accessibility of youth psychological services. However, existing SSIs have conferred greater benefits for youths with anxiety, compared to depression or comorbid problems, and their effects have generally waned over time - particularly for follow-ups exceeding 3months.
   MethodTo help address these discrepancies, we tested whether a novel SSI teaching growth mindset of personality (the belief that personality is malleable) could reduce depression and anxiety and strengthen perceived control in high-risk adolescents (N=96, ages 12-15). At baseline, youths were randomized to receive a 30-min, computer-guided growth mindset intervention or a supportive-therapy control. Youths and parents reported youth anxiety and depressive symptoms, and youths reported their levels of perceived control, at baseline and across a 9-month follow-up period.
   ResultsCompared to the control program, the mindset intervention led to significantly greater improvements inparent-reported youth depression (d=.60) and anxiety (d=.28), youth-reported youth depression (d=.32), andyouth-reported perceived behavioral control (d=.29) by 9-month follow-up. Intervention effects were nonsignificant for youth-reported anxiety, although 9-month effect sizes reached the small-to-medium range (d=.33). Intervention group youths also experienced more rapid improvements in parent-reported depression, youth-reported depression, and perceived behavioral control across the follow-up period, compared to control group youths.
   ConclusionsFindings suggest a promising, scalable SSI for reducing internalizing distress in high-risk adolescents. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT03132298.

AB In the literature, bully-victims report a wider range of adjustment problems than "pure" bullies or victims. This may not be confined to the school context, but might be found in other settings as well. Involvement in mutually hostile interactions across everyday settings may more reflect adolescents' characteristic way of handling conflicts with others. We used data from a longitudinal study of a community sample of adolescents (N = 992). Cluster analyses for specific everyday settings and across settings yielded clusters high on both exposing others and being exposed to hostility. Adolescents in these clusters, and particularly across settings, reported a wider range of externalizing, internalizing, and academic problems, than adolescents in other cluster groups. Longitudinal analyses showed support for bidirectional relationships between mutually hostile conditions and problematic adjustment. We conclude that adolescents' mutual hostility experiences are associated with profoundly problematic adjustment.

AB Research in parents of youngsters with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) increasingly documents associations between children's problem behaviors and symptom severity and more dysfunctional and less adaptive parenting behaviors. However, the mechanisms underlying these associations have not been examined thoroughly. This study examines the mediating role of parental need frustration in the relation between child maladjustment (i.e., problem behavior and autism severity) and parenting behavior (i.e., controlling and autonomy-supportive parenting). The sample included 95 parents of adolescents/emerging adults with ASD M-age = 18.8 years, SD = 2.3). Parents completed questionnaires assessing their parenting strategies and psychological need frustration as well as the internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors and autism severity of their child. Results indicate that the association between externalizing problems and controlling parenting was partially mediated by need frustration. This suggests that externalizing problems go together with lower feelings of parent-child closeness, lower parental competence, and a decreased sense of volitional functioning, feelings that, in turn, relate to more controlling strategies. Symptom severity has a direct negative association with autonomy support, suggesting that parents lower their autonomy support when their child has high levels of autism symptoms, without experiencing these symptoms as a threat to their own psychological needs.

AB The genetic and environmental contributions of negative valence systems (NVS) to internalizing pathways study (also referred to as the Adolescent and Young Adult Twin Study) was designed to examine varying constructs of the NVS as they relate to the development of internalizing disorders from a genetically informed perspective. The goal of this study was to evaluate genetic and environmental contributions to potential psychiatric endophenotypes that contribute to internalizing psychopathology by studying adolescent and young adult twins longitudinally over a 2-year period. This report details the sample characteristics, study design, and methodology of this study. The first wave of data collection (i.e., time 1) is complete; the 2-year follow-up (i.e., time 2) is currently underway. A total of 430 twin pairs (N = 860 individual twins; 166 monozygotic pairs; 57.2% female) and 422 parents or legal guardians participated at time 1. Twin participants completed self-report surveys and participated in experimental paradigms to assess processes within the NVS. Additionally, parents completed surveys to report on themselves and their twin children. Findings from this study will help clarify the genetic and environmental influences of the NVS and their association with internalizing risk. The goal of this line of research is to develop methods for early internalizing disorder risk detection.

AB Children and adolescents who are victims or perpetrators of bullying victimization are at elevated risk for maladjustment problems, concurrently and in the long run. Previous studies suggest that this correlation is partly explained by genetic influence. However, whether the genetic correlation is independent of a causal effect of victimization on maladjustment remains unclear. Using data from 2,510 females from the TwinsUK registry, we applied an innovative extension of the Cholesky decomposition to investigate to what extent the association between victimization in adolescence and self-reported depressive episodes in adulthood is caused by shared genetic effects (pleiotropy), and to what extent it is due to a phenotypic causal relationship. We find that around 60% of the association between victimization and self-reported depressive episodes is due to a causal effect of victimization on depressive episodes, and 40% is due to pleiotropic effects. These findings underline the importance of integrating genetic information into social science research and demonstrate a neat strategy to elucidate causal mechanisms in the absence of experimental designs.

AB This study adopted a person-centered approach to identify preadolescent salivary cortisol (sC) and alpha-amylase (sAA) co-activation response patterns and examine links to behavioral functioning and coping. Children (N = 151, 51.7% male) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and one of two randomly-assigned, post-TSST coping conditions: distraction or avoidance. Multi-trajectory modeling yielded four child subgroups. Child internalizing and externalizing positively predicted High sC-High sAA relative to Low sC-Low sAA and Low sC-High sAA relative to High sC-Low sAA subgroup membership, respectively. Low sC-Low sAA children demonstrated more efficient sC recovery when primed with distraction and more protracted sC recovery when primed with avoidance. For High sC-High sAA, internalizing children, the opposite was true. Findings illustrate adjustment-linked variability in preadolescent sC-sAA co-activation response patterns that further articulates for whom effortful coping works to effectively manage stressor-induced neuroendocrine activation.

The lower order internalizing factors were depressed affect, anxious-fearfulness, and asocial behavior (i.e., social withdrawal) and the lower order externalizing factors were deception and hyperactivity. The forms and functions of aggression were crossed to create four factors: reactive relational, reactive physical, proactive relational, and proactive physical aggression. Seven confirmatory factor models were tested. Results supported a two-factor externalizing model where reactive and proactive relational aggression and deception loaded on one externalizing factor and reactive and proactive physical aggression and hyperactivity loaded on another externalizing factor.

AB This study examined whether psychological treatment for youth with comorbid externalizing and internalizing disorders targets externalizing rather than internalizing pathology. Therapist-reported treatment targets for youth (N = 679) with (a) only internalizing diagnoses (n = 195); (b) only externalizing diagnoses (n = 314); (c) a primary internalizing diagnosis and at least 1 additional externalizing diagnosis (n = 75); and (d) a primary externalizing diagnosis and at least 1 additional internalizing diagnosis (n = 95) receiving treatment-as-usual in a public mental health system of care were examined. Treatment targets that appeared significantly more often in the externalizing-only and internalizing-only diagnostic groups were empirically determined, and a derived proportional measure of these targets was analyzed across all 4 diagnostic groups, controlling for effects of additional client and treatment characteristics. As required by the target selection method, the proportion of externalizing targets selected in treatment was greatest for youth with externalizing-only diagnoses and least for youth with internalizing-only diagnoses. Importantly, the co-occurrence of a secondary externalizing disorder with a primary internalizing disorder resulted in a large increase in the proportion of externalizing targets endorsed, whereas the co-occurrence of an internalizing disorder with a primary externalizing disorder resulted in a comparatively small decrease in the proportion of externalizing targets endorsed. Results persisted despite several covariates also predicting increased focus on externalizing targets, including male gender and younger age. These findings suggest that community therapists tend to prioritize externalizing over internalizing problems during treatment for such comorbid youth. Implications for practice, research and dissemination/implementation efforts are discussed.

AB To effectively allocate mental health services, agencies must be able to predict what proportion of youth will have a mental disorder. Prevalence estimates are available for juvenile offenders at intake, detained youth, and incarcerated youth, but there is limited research on prevalence of mental disorders for juvenile offenders who are low-risk to reoffend, many of whom are first time offenders (i.e., low-risk youth). To complicate matters, ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in the justice system, and specifically, little is known about culturally sensitive clinical interviewing. To aid service providers and administrators in allocating mental health resources for low-risk offenders and to contribute to knowledge on culturally sensitive clinical assessment techniques, the present study reports the prevalence of mental disorders for a mostly Mexican American sample of 503 low-risk youth in diversion programming. We found that approximately 1 of every 6 (17.1%) low-risk juvenile offenders had a current affective, anxiety, or psychotic disorder, and 24.9% of low-risk juvenile offenders met criteria for a current substance/alcohol abuse disorder. These results suggest that allocating a portion of specialty mental health services and substance abuse treatment for low-risk juvenile offenders may help agencies combat the issue of repeat offending by offering public health interventions proactively to indirectly prevent recidivism rather than reacting afterward. Lastly, recommendations are given to help service providers incorporate culturally sensitive techniques into clinical assessment in order to better identify Mexican American juvenile offenders with mental health needs.

AB Early poverty is associated with a cumulative load of family and community risk factors that can impact the development of self-regulatory abilities and result in socio-emotional and achievement gaps which begin early and persist across the lifespan. Ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among children living in poverty. The longitudinal trajectories of self-regulation are important to understand in this population, in order to best inform prevention efforts. This study examines patterns of self-regulation over time among young, ethnic minority children living in low income, urban households. A stratified, random sample of 555 children, ages 2 to 4 years, (46% Black, 46% Hispanic; 47% female) were followed over three waves (including 1 and 5 year follow-ups). Internalizing and externalizing behaviors at approximately age nine were predicted by children's early self-regulation. Latent class analyses revealed low, medium, and high levels of self-regulatory abilities at wave 1 (mean age: 2.99, SD = .81) and low and high levels, 1 year later (mean age: 4.39 (SD = .94). A gender effect was found whereby girls were more likely than boys to be in the high self-regulation class relative to the low at both waves. Using Latent Transition Analysis, distal outcomes were examined approximately 5 years after the initial assessment (mean age: 8.83, SD = .93). Children who sustained a higher level of self-regulation over time had the lowest internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Transition to low self-regulation at wave 2, regardless of initial self-regulation status, was related to greater severity of internalizing symptoms. Implications for prevention and future research are discussed.

AB This study examined emotional and behavioral symptoms of children in Shanghai, China whose parents and/or grandparents had experienced potentially traumatic events (PTE). The sample was comprised of 2282 first-grade children who were rated by their teachers and parents. We compared children whose parents reported if they themselves and/or their parents had experienced a PTE, with children whose parents and grandparents had not been exposed to a PTE. We also paid attention to parental attributes including depression, overall physical health, and evaluation of the parent-child and marital relationships in order to determine their potential influence in the link between PTE exposure in a previous generation and children's emotional and behavioral symptoms. Ordinary least square regression results indicate that children whose parents reported that they or one of their parents had PTE exposure had significantly higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behavior with effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranging from 0.18 to 0.45. Parental depression, physical health symptoms, negative description of the parent-child relationship, and marital conflict were associated with heightened levels of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors and accounted for some of the links between parental PTE exposure and children's symptoms.

AB There is scant research on how the parenting practices of custodial grandmothers affect the psychological adjustment of grandchildren in their care. Yet, the findings from a handful of prior studies suggest the relevance of the Family Stress Model (FSM) to these caregivers. The present study further tested the FSM with baseline data from 343 custodial grandmothers (M-age = 58.5 years) enrolled in a clinical trial of the efficacy of interventions for improving the well-being of their families. Not only was this "help-seeking" sample atypical of prior FSM studies, but also unique to the present study was our addition of multiple parenting practices, self-reported and clinical ratings of grandmothers' distress, and reports of grandchildren's internalizing and externalizing difficulties from grandchildren and grandmothers. Mplus 7.31 was used to test a model where the effect of grandmother distress on grandchildren's internalizing and externalizing difficulties was hypothesized to be indirect through five distinct parenting practices. The findings regarding both the measurement and structural models fit the observed data well, and invariance was largely found across grandchildren's gender and age (4-7 vs. 8-12). Although grandchildren's self-reported internalizing and externalizing difficulties were unrelated to grandmothers' distress and parenting practices, the grandmothers' reports of these outcomes were generally related to their own distress and parenting practices as hypothesized. However, considerable variation was found across the five parenting practices in terms of their relationships to the other FSM constructs. We conclude that data from multiple informants and measures of assorted parenting practices are essential to future research and practice.

AB As an important aspect of self-regulation, behavioral regulation contributes to young children's academic and social-emotional outcomes. In this study, we examined the relations between young Chinese children's behavioral regulation and their mathematics competence, language skills, and behavior problems. We further explored the role of both maternal and paternal parenting in these relations. We tested two competing frameworks. We examined whether behavioral regulation would mediate the relations between parenting and aforementioned child outcomes. We also tested whether parenting would moderate the relations between children's behavioral regulation and their outcomes. A total of 109 Chinese children approximately at three years of age living in Hong Kong participated in the study with their parents. Children's behavioral regulation, number competence, receptive vocabulary, and phonological awareness were tested individually using direct assessments. Parents reported their own parenting and their children's internalizing and externalizing problems. The results showed that paternal supportive parenting moderated the relation between children's behavioral regulation and their number competence, as well as the relation between behavioral regulation and externalizing problems. The findings add to the literature by demonstrating the importance of behavioral regulation for early learning and social-emotional outcomes of young Chinese children. The findings also suggest the crucial role of fathers in helping children utilize their behavioral regulation skills to acquire early mathematics skills and reduce behavior problems.

AB The current study examined the mediating role of both mother and child interactive behaviors, which granted or undermined autonomy and relatedness, on the bidirectional and longitudinal association between maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing behaviors, as well as the association between maternal substance use and child externalizing behaviors. Child's sex and mother's drug of choice were explored as potential moderators of the mediation relationship. Data were collected from 183 dyads including treatment-seeking substance using mothers and their children (95 males, aged between 8 and 16 years old). Structural equation modeling analysis showed girls' internalizing and externalizing behaviors at the 3-month follow-up were negatively associated with the same behaviors at the 12-month follow-up through increased relatedness undermining behaviors from their mothers at the 6-month follow-up. Among mothers with opioids as their drug of choice (DOC), children's externalizing behaviors at the 3-month follow-up were positively associated with mothers' substance use at the 12-month follow-up through the elevated levels of mothers' relatedness undermining behaviors at the 6-month follow-up. Among mothers with alcohol as their DOC, maternal depressive symptoms at the 3-month follow-up were positively related to children's internalizing behaviors at the 12-month follow-up through reduced relatedness undermining behaviors exhibited by mothers at the 6-month follow-up. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to attempt to unravel these longitudinal and bidirectional influences as well as the moderated mediation pathways among families with a substance using mothers.

AB Children who live in the context of maternal incarceration (MI) are exposed to both general environmental risk and incarceration-specific risk increasing the probability of their developing externalizing and internalizing behaviors problems. Little research has examined the socio-emotional mechanisms that account for the psychological effects of MI. This research examined children's anger and sadness regulation as mediators between environmental and incarceration-specific risk and psychological functioning. Participants were 117 children (60% Black; 52% boys; M age = 9.85 years, SD = 1.65 years), their incarcerated mother, and current caregiver. All informants completed questionnaires assessing children's anger and sadness regulation as well as externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Mothers and caregivers provided information concerning children's exposure to environmental risk and all three reporters provided information on incarceration-specific risk experiences (ISRE). Structural equation modeling was used to test indirect effects of risk variables (ISRE, environmental) on psychological functioning (externalizing, internalizing behaviors) via emotion regulation (anger, sadness). Gender, age, and race were covariates. The analyses revealed significant indirect effects of incarceration-specific risk on both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems via anger regulation but not via sadness regulation. The findings highlight the centrality of emotion regulation as a mechanism that helps explain the negative psychological outcomes experienced by children exposed to ISRE with implications for preventive interventions.

AB Peer victimization is predictive of serious problems in adjustment, especially among children who are both victimized and aggressive. This study investigated how different types of aggression contribute to later victimization. Specifically, we examined prospective relationships between the types of aggression that children perpetrated and the types that they experienced at the hands of others. Trained observers coded schoolyard behavior of 553 children in grades 3-6 during the initial year of a bullying intervention program. Both observed aggression and victimization were specified by form (direct, indirect) and function (proactive, reactive). Total hourly rates of victimization were highest in the upper grades. Direct-reactive aggression uniquely predicted increases in victimization, while direct-proactive aggression predicted decreases, particularly in direct-proactive victimization. Indirect-proactive aggression (e.g., derogatory gossip) predicted increases in indirect-proactive victimization only in the control group. Indirect-reactive aggression and victimization occurred too rarely to detect change. Aggression-victimization relationships did not differ for boys and girls. Discussion considers why children might risk direct reactive aggression in the face of increased victimization. Different sequelae for different forms and functions of aggression highlight the need to resolve theoretical ambiguities in defining proactive and reactive aggression.

AB Maternal stress during pregnancy has been linked to premorbid abnormalities associated with depression (e.g., difficult temperament, cognitive deficits) in offspring. However, few studies have looked across developmental periods to examine maternal stress during pregnancy and offspring depression during adolescence and whether these associations differ by sex. The current study used data from 1711 mother-offspring dyads (offspring sex: 49.8% male) in a longitudinal birth cohort study. Maternal narratives collected during pregnancy were qualitatively coded for stress-related themes by independent raters. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified distinct subgroups of offspring based on exposure to maternal prenatal stress and other developmental factors from the prenatal, childhood, and adolescent periods that have been associated with depression and/or maternal prenatal stress. LCA identified subgroups that were compared to determine whether and to what extent they differed on adolescent depressive symptoms. LCA revealed a subgroup of "high-risk" individuals, characterized by maternal factors during pregnancy (higher ambivalence/negativity and lower positivity towards the pregnancy, higher levels of hassles, lower maternal education and higher maternal age at birth, higher pre-pregnancy BMI) and offspring developmental factors (decreased cognitive functioning during childhood and adolescence, lower perceived parental support during adolescence, and higher levels of maternal depression during adolescence). High-risk females exhibited elevated conduct symptoms and higher birth order, while high-risk males exhibited decreased internalizing symptoms and lower birth order. Both high-risk males and females reported elevated depressive symptoms during adolescence relative to their "low-risk" counterparts.

AB Analyses of the relationship between levels of implementation and outcomes of school-based social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions are relatively infrequent and are typically narrowly focused. Thus, our objective was to assess the relationship between variability in a range of implementation dimensions and intervention outcomes in the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) curriculum. Implementation of PATHS was examined in 69 classrooms across 23 schools in the first year of a major randomized controlled trial. Implementation data were generated via classroom-level structured observations. In addition to factual data on dosage and reach, exploratory factor analysis of observer ratings revealed two distinct implementation dimensions, namely, "quality and participant responsiveness" and "procedural fidelity." Student social-emotional skills, pro-social behavior, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing problems were captured through child self-report and teacher informant-report surveys (N = 1721). Hierarchical linear modeling of study data revealed that higher implementation quality and participant responsiveness was associated with significantly lower ratings of students' externalizing problems at 12-month follow-up. Conversely, and contrary to expectations, higher dosage was associated with significantly lower pro-social behavior and social-emotional skills at 12-month follow-up. No significant associations were found between variability in either procedural fidelity or reach and any intervention outcomes. The implications of these findings are discussed, and study limitations are noted.

AB OBJECTIVE: To provide a prospective developmental model for behavioral outcomes in preterm infants in relation to developmental care (DC) practices and postnatal maternal depression.
   STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal, multicenter, follow-up study conducted in 25 Italian tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Participants were 162 healthy very preterm infants and their mothers. The level of quality of DC was assessed for each hospital. Infant's neurobehavioral profile was evaluated twice: at discharge (T1) and at 18 months for behavioral problems (T3). Maternal depressive symptomatology was measured at T1 and at 6 months (T2).
   RESULTS: Low-quality DC in NICUs was associated with lower levels of infant neurobehavioral adaptability and higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms. Maternal depressive symptomatology in conjunction with higher infant dysregulation predicted more internalizing problems at 18 months of age.
   CONCLUSION: DC interventions and postnatal maternal depression, as well as infant behavior have an impact on short- and longterm infant outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: Externalizing behaviors are negative behaviors expressed outwardly, including rule breaking, aggression, and risk taking; internalizing behaviors are expressed inwardly, including depression, withdrawal, and anxiety. Such behavior can cause problems in early life and predict difficulties across the lifespan. There is evidence for a relationship between executive function and both externalizing and internalizing. However, although these behaviors occur along a spectrum, there is little neuroimaging research on this relationship in typically developing youth.
   METHODS: We assessed 41 youth (10-19 years of age) using the Multi-Source Interference Task during functional magnetic resonance imaging and related the findings to self-reported externalizing and internalizing scores as measured by the Youth Self-Report. We performed a general linear model using FSL software; externalizing, internalizing, age, and sex were included in the model.
   RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, the more difficult Multi-Source Interference Task interference condition was associated with greater engagement of the frontoparietal cognitive control system and decreased engagement of regions in the default mode network, based on a cluster threshold of Z > 3.1 (p = .01). When we examined regions uniquely associated with either internalizing or externalizing, we found that within the same group of subjects, higher externalizing behavior was associated with hyperactivity in the parietal lobe; in contrast, higher internalizing behavior was associated with increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that externalizing and internalizing may be associated with altered, but different, patterns of activation during cognitive control. This has implications for our understanding of the relationship between cognitive control and behavioral problems in youth.

AB A common critique of empirically supported treatments for abuse-related psychopathology is attrition during critical phases of therapy (i.e., exposure). The goal of this study was to examine whether child and caregiver symptoms were predictive of attrition among families in abuse-specific cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs). Children (N = 104) and their caregivers completed baseline assessments of internalizing symptoms, externalizing problems, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and were enrolled in abuse-specific CBTs. Logistic regressions were conducted with baseline symptoms as predictor variables and treatment status (attrition vs. completion) as the criterion variable. Caregiver report of child internalizing symptoms showed the predicted quadratic relation to attrition. Caregiver report of child externalizing symptoms at moderate and high (vs. low) levels was associated with attrition. Child self-report and caregiver self-report of symptoms were not associated with the dyad's attrition. These results underscore the importance of attending to caregivers' initial perceptions of children's symptoms in abuse-specific therapy.

AB Although frequently observed in individuals with ASD, little is known about the nature of developmental regression amongst this population. Previous studies have found varying results in differences in ASD symptoms, cognitive functioning, and comorbid problems between individuals who have and have not regressed in skills. The purpose of the present study was to examine potential differences in ASD symptom domains (i.e., nonverbal communication/socialization, verbal communication, social relationships, insistence on sameness/restricted interests) and challenging behaviors across groups. Participants included 160 total children with ASD (M = 8.17, SD = 4.12), of which 70 reported a history of developmental regression. Results indicated significant differences between groups on ASD severity, nonverbal communication/socialization, verbal communication, social relationships, and internalizing problems. No difference was found on insistence on sameness/restricted interests and externalizing problems. Implications of these data are discussed.

AB ObjectiveTo establish whether previously identified early-life antecedents of suicide mortality (i.e. low birthweight, younger maternal age, higher birth order, externalizing problems and adversities) are associated with proximal psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation, which are themselves associated with an increased risk of suicide.
   MethodsParticipants were from the 1958 British birth-cohort (N = 8905) with information on prenatal/childhood experiences and the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised at age 45 years. Outcomes were as follows: any internalizing disorder (anxiety disorder/depressive episode), depressive episode, alcohol use disorder and suicidal ideation.
   ResultsAfter adjustment, higher birth order (P-trend = 0.043), younger maternal age (P-trend = 0.017) and increased number of childhood adversities (P-trend = 0.026) were associated with an increased risk of internalizing disorders. For example, the OR (95% CI) in fourth- or later-born children was 1.48 (1.06-2.07) and for young maternal age (<19 years) was 1.31 (0.89-1.91). Effect sizes were similar in magnitude for depressive episode and suicidal ideation, although associations did not reach conventional significance levels. No associations were found for low birthweight and externalizing problems (in males) and investigated outcomes.
   ConclusionAssociations for younger maternal age, higher birth order and adversities with adult internalizing disorders suggest that psychiatric disorders may be on the pathway linking some early-life factors and suicide.

AB Objective: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinal pathways to impairment as outlined in the cognitive-behavioral model of ADHD in a sample of 59 college students diagnosed with ADHD. Method: Serial mediation models were used to test whether underachievement, defined as prior year GPA, would longitudinally predict self-reported impairment at the end of the next school year, through negative self-concept and associated changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression, while controlling for baseline impairment and changes in ADHD symptoms. Results: Findings supported the cognitive-behavioral model of ADHD. The association between prior year GPA and overall impairment at the end of the year was fully mediated through self-concept and symptoms of depression. Conclusion: These results help explain why impairment often persists even when ADHD symptoms remit and suggests that internalizing symptoms may be an important target for intervention in college students with ADHD.

AB Nolen-Hoeksema proposed that rumination increases stressful events and circumstances; however, few studies have examined this question. Thus, we explored whether (a) rumination predicted increases in the generation of chronic and acute stress, (b) excessive reassurance seeking (ERS) mediated links between rumination and stress generation, (c) rumination increased exposure to acute independent (uncontrollable) stress, and (d) rumination predicted chronic stress generation in certain domains, but not others. These questions were examined in a 1-year study of 126 early adolescent girls (M-age = 12.39 years) using contextual objective stress interviews. Findings indicated that rumination predicted increases in acute dependent interpersonal stress and chronic interpersonal stress, and ERS mediated these associations. Moreover, rumination was not associated with acute independent stress. Finally, the effect of rumination on chronic stress generation was most salient in adolescents' romantic lives and in parent-adolescent relationships. These findings suggest that ruminators create stressful interpersonal environments.

AB Most studies on the mental health consequences of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) focus predominantly on CSA survivors who do not commit sexual offenses. The current study examined the effects of CSA on 498 male adolescents adjudicated for sexual offenses who represent the small portion of CSA survivors who engage in sexual offenses. The prevalence of internalizing symptoms, parental attachment difficulties, specific sexual offending behaviors, and risk for sexually offending were compared among participants with and without a history of CSA. Results indicated that participants with a history of CSA were more likely to be diagnosed with major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder than those who did not report a history of CSA. A history of CSA was also positively correlated with risk for sexually offending and with specific offense patterns and consensual sexual behaviors. No significant differences emerged on parental attachment difficulties. These results highlight that adolescents adjudicated for sexual offenses with a history of CSA present with differences in sexual and psychological functioning as well as markedly different offending patterns when compared with those without a CSA history. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB In this article, a narrative inquiry approach is used to investigate how mothers report their experiences of parenting children with learning disability (LD) within the culture of American motherhood and to explore what impact such experiences of motherhood might have upon their relationships with school professionals. Analysis of the mothers' narratives yields two overarching themes: The Private Mother (inner thoughts and feelings about her own mothering) and The Public Mother (outward responses to others' comments and behaviors about her mothering). Two subcategories are discussed within each overarching theme: Internalizing and Resisting Social Messages and Inside the Family (The Private Mother), and Judgment in Public Spaces and Mother as Outcast (The Public Mother). The author addresses implications of these findings and offers recommendations for collaborating with mothers of children identified as LD.

AB The current study took a novel approach to examining peer victimization experiences on a continuum in early childhood. A bifactor approach was used to examine co-occurring victimization as well as the relative contribution of subtypes of victimization, including both physical and relational victimization. To date, no known research has examined co-occurring victimization in early childhood. The fit of a bifactor model, as well as the utility of the model in testing associations with internalizing problems, was examined. The short-term longitudinal study (N = 231; 109 girls; M-age = 47.46 months, SD = 735) found support for a hierarchical structure of victimization, including co-occurrence and "pure" victimization dimensions, in early childhood. Regression analyses supported that both co-occurring victimization and relational victimization were associated with internalizing adjustment outcomes. These associations differed by gender. A bifactor model may be a useful statistical technique to address the common finding of co-occurrence of victimization to better understand peer harassment experiences and risk for adjustment problems.

AB Background: Dialectical behaviour therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (DBT-PTSD), which is tailored to treat adults with PTSD and co-occurring emotion regulation difficulties, has already demonstrated its efficacy, acceptance and safety in an inpatient treatment setting. It combines elements of DBT with trauma-focused cognitive behavioural interventions.Objective: To investigate the feasibility, acceptance and safety of DBT-PTSD in an outpatient treatment setting by therapists who were novice to the treatment, we treated 21 female patients suffering from PTSD following childhood sexual abuse (CSA) plus difficulties in emotion regulation in an uncontrolled clinical trial.Method: The Clinician Administered PTSD Symptom Scale (CAPS), the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the Borderline Section of the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE) and the Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) were used as primary outcomes. For secondary outcomes, depression and dissociation were assessed. Assessments were administered at pretreatment, post-treatment and six-week follow-up.Results: Improvement was significant for PTSD as well as for borderline personality symptomatology, with large pretreatment to follow-up effect sizes for completers based on the CAPS (Cohens d=1.30), DTS (d=1.50), IPDE (d=1.60) and BSL-23 (d=1.20).Conclusion: The outcome suggests that outpatient DBT-PTSD can safely be used to reduce PTSD symptoms and comorbid psychopathology in adults who have experienced CSA.

AB Primary headache is a frequent and disabling disorder, common among children and adolescents, and it is a painful syndrome often accompanied by functional impairment and associated with emotional and behavior problems. The aim of this study was to investigate parenting stress and emotional/behavioral problems in adolescents affected by primary headache compared with healthy adolescents. The study population consisted of 35 adolescents and a control group of 23 healthy subjects. The assessment included the administration of clinical standardized scales such as Parent Stress Index-Short Form, Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score Questionnaire, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Headache group and control group did not differ in terms of parenting stress (p = 0.29). On the contrary, headache group showed more internalizing problems (p = 0.023), affective problems (p = 0.01), anxious (p = 0.001), and somatic complaints (p < 0.001) compared with control group. In addition, we found a significant correlation between PSI domains and specific CBCL subscales in the headache group. The findings emphasize the need for expanded intervention in the clinical treatment of pediatric headache, a treatment that may also include the family members. Further research is needed.

AB Conduct disorder (CD) and anxiety disorders (ADs) are often comorbid and both are characterized by hyper-sensitivity to threat, and reduced structural and functional connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Previous studies of CD have not taken account of ADs nor directly compared connectivity in the two disorders. We examined three groups of young women: 23 presenting CD and lifetime AD; 30 presenting lifetime AD and not CD; and 17 with neither disorder (ND). Participants completed clinical assessments and diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI scans. The uncinate fasciculus was reconstructed using tractography and manual dissection, and structural measures extracted. Correlations of resting-state activity between amygdala and OFC seeds were computed. The CD + AD and AD groups showed similarly reduced structural integrity of the left uncinate compared to ND, even after adjusting for IQ, psychiatric comorbidity, and childhood maltreatment. Uncinate integrity was associated with harm avoidance traits among AD-only women, and with the interaction of poor anger control and anxiety symptoms among CD + AD women. Groups did not differ in functional connectivity. Reduced uncinate integrity observed in CD + AD and AD-only women may reflect deficient emotion regulation in response to threat, common to both disorders, while other neural mechanisms determine the behavioral response.

AB BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that prenatal maternal stress may increase the risk of childhood externalizing disorders, yet no large cohort study has investigated this association across a large range of acute stressors. Our objective was to estimate the association between prenatal stressful events and risk of offspring conduct disorder and hyperactivity.
   METHODS: We used data from 10,184 mother-offspring pairs from the United Kingdom-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Mothers self-reported 42 prenatal stressful life events at 18 weeks' gestation. Symptoms of conduct disorder and hyperactivity in their offspring were measured at 6, 9, 11, 13, and 16 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The primary outcome was membership in high-symptom trajectories of 1) conduct disorder and 2) hyperactivity throughout childhood, identified using latent class growth modeling. Multinomial logistic regression models estimated the association between prenatal stress and both conduct disorder and hyperactivity, after adjusting for sex, parental education, low birth weight, preterm birth, parental social class, maternal smoking and drinking, maternal mental health, offspring stressful life events, and offspring depressive and anxious symptoms.
   RESULTS: Those exposed to the highest quartile of prenatal stress were more likely to belong to the high symptom trajectory for hyperactivity (B = 0.46, p < .05) and conduct disorder (B = 0.88, p < .01), respectively. Prenatal stress further demonstrated a positive, dose-response relationship with symptoms of externalizing disorders at independent time points.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that prenatal stressful events may be an independent risk factor for offspring externalizing symptoms, regardless of maternal mental health and offspring internalizing.

AB Background: Suicide attempts (SA) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are prevalent in adolescents and important risk factors of suicide death. Both SA and NSSI are associated with multiple psychosocial, behavioral, biological and genetic factors. This study examined similarities and differences in psychological vulnerability and internalizing and externalizing problems between adolescents with SA and NSSI.
   Methods: Participants consisted of 11,831 students and had a mean age of 14.97 (SD = 1.46) years. Students completed a structured questionnaire to report their demographic information, psychological characteristics, internalizing and externalizing problems, SA and NSSI. Based on the history of NSSI and SA in the last year, the sample was divided into four groups: non-self-harm (NSH), NSSI only, SA only, and NSSI + SA. Multivariate analyses of covariance and post-hoc pairwise comparisons were performed for multiple comparisons.
   Results: Compared with NSH group, adolescents with either NSSI or SA scored significantly higher on trait anger, impulsiveness, hopelessness, internalizing and externalizing problems. NSSI + SA group and SA only group scored significantly higher than NSSI only group but both did not score significantly different on most psychological and behavioral variables. Limitations: Limitations include reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional survey.
   Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral profiles between adolescents with SA and NSSI are similar but are more severe in suicide attempters. The findings highlight the necessity of assessing psychological and behavioral problems for prevention and early intervention of adolescent self-harm.

AB Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy predict increased psychiatric problems in children. The underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. Hence, we examined whether alterations in the morphology of 88 term placentas were associated with maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and psychiatric problems in 1.9-3.1-years old (Mean = 2.1 years) toddlers. Maternal depressive symptoms were rated biweekly during pregnancy with the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (n = 86). Toddler psychiatric problems were mother-rated with the Child Behavior Checklist (n = 60). We found that higher maternal depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy [B = -0.24 Standard Deviation (SD) units: 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -0.46; -0.03: P = 0.03; Mean difference = -0.66 SDs; 95% CI = -0.08; -1.23: P = 0.03; between those with and without clinically relevant depressive symptoms] were associated with lower variability in the placental villous barrier thickness of.-smooth muscle actin-negative villi. This placental morphological change predicted higher total (B = -0.34 SDs: 95% CI = -0.60; -0.07: P = 0.01) and internalizing (B = -0.32 SDs: 95% CI = -0.56; -0.08: P = 0.01) psychiatric problems in toddlers. To conclude, our findings suggest that both maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and toddler psychiatric problems may be associated with lower variability in the villous membrane thickness of peripheral villi in term placentas. This lower heterogeneity may compromise materno-fetal exchange, suggesting a possible role for altered placental morphology in the fetal programming of mental disorders.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between family environment (cohesion and parental bonding), high-risk status, and psychopathology (internalizing and externalizing problems) among offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD), from the perspective of both offspring and their parents. We further tested if family environment mediated the relationship between bipolar risk status and internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Method: High-risk (n = 90) BD offspring and control (n = 56) offspring aged 12-21 years old, and their parents, completed questionnaires on family cohesion and offspring internalizing and externalizing problems. Offspring also completed a parental bonding questionnaire. Group differences were examined, followed by multi-level mediation analysis with maximum likelihood and robust standard errors.
   Results: Both offspring and parents in the high-risk group reported higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems than controls. According to offspring reports, high-risk status, lower maternal and paternal care in parental bonding, was independently associated with internalizing problems. Lower maternal care alone predicted externalizing problems. Family environment did not mediate the relationship between bipolar risk status, and offspring problems.
   Limitations: Due to rates of missing data from parent reports of offspring psychopathology, mediation analysis was completed using offspring reports.
   Conclusions: The offspring-report data presented indicate that low parental warmth and connection were associated with internalizing and externalizing problems as an independent risk factor, in addition to bipolar risk status. The parent-child relationship therefore warrants attention as a potential target for prevention strategies with such families.

AB Background: The effect of gene polymorphisms and promoter methylation, associated with maladaptive developmental outcomes, vary depending on environmental factors (e.g., parental psychopathology). Most studies have focused on 0- to 5-year-old children, adolescents, or adults, whereas there is dearth of research on school-age youths and pre-adolescents.
   Methods: In a sample of 21 families recruited at schools, we addressed parents' psychopathological symptoms (through SCL-90-R); offspring emotional-behavioral functioning (through CBCL-6-18); dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) for epigenetic status of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and for genotype, i.e., variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism at the 3'-UTR. Possible associations were explored between bio-genetic and psychological characteristics within the same individual and between triplets of children, mothers, and fathers.
   Results: DAT methylation of CpG at positions M1, M6, and M7 in mothers was correlated with maternal (phobic) anxiety, whereas in fathers' position M6 was related to paternal depression, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, and higher Global Severity Index (GSI). No significant correlations were found between maternal and offspring DAT methylation. Significant correlations were found between fathers' methylation at CpG M1 and children's methylation at CpG M6. Linear regressions showed that mothers and fathers' GSI predicted children's methylation at CpG sites M2, M3, and M6, whereas fathers' GSI predicted children's methylation at CpG sites, particularly M1, M2, and M6. Moreover, offspring methylation of DAT at CpG M2 predicted somatic complaint, internalizing and attention problems; methylation of DAT at CpG M6 predicted withdraw.
   Conclusion: This study may have important clinical implication for the prevention and treatment of emotional-behavioral difficulties in children, as it adds to previous knowledge about the role of genetic and environmental factors in predicting psychopathological symptoms within non-clinical populations.

AB The prevalence of childhood overweight is a major social and public health issue, and primary assessment should focus on early and middle childhood, because weight gain in these phases constitutes a strong predictor of subsequent negative outcomes. Studies on community samples have shown that growth curves may follow linear or non-linear trajectories from early to middle childhood, and can differ based on sex. Overweight children may exhibit a combination of physiological and psychosocial issues, and several studies have demonstrated an association between overweight and internalizing/externalizing behavior. Nevertheless, there is a dearth of longitudinal studies on depressive and aggressive symptoms in children with high BMI. This study adopted a growth curve modeling over three phases to: (1) describe BMI trajectories in two groups of children aged 2-8 (overweight and normal weight) from a community sample; (2) describe the developmental trajectories of children's aggressive and depressive symptoms from 2 to 8 years of age. Results indicate higher BMI in 2-year-old girls, with males catching up with them by age 8. While overweight females' BMIs were consistently high, males' increased at 5 and 8 years. The mean scores for aggressive symptoms at T1 (2 years of age) were the same in all subjects, but a significant deviation occurred from T1 to T2 in both samples, in divergent directions. With regards to children's depressive symptoms, the two groups had different starting points, with normal weight children scoring lower than overweight youths. Overweight females showed lower depressive scores than overweight males at T1, but they surpassed boys before T2, and showed more maladaptive symptoms at T3. This study solicits professionals working in pediatric settings to consider overweight children's psychopathological risk, and to be aware that even when children's BMI does not increase from 2 to 8 years, their psychopathological symptoms may grow in intensity.

AB Although birth weight is a potential causal risk factor for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, both the specificity of this association and its mediating pathways are largely unknown. We carefully assessed youth with and without ADHD (i.e., Wave 1), and followed them prospectively for 2years (i.e., Wave 2). We (a) tested the association of birth weight with Wave 2 ADHD symptoms, and (b) evaluated biologically plausible neurocognitive functions from Wave 1 as temporally ordered mediators of birth weight and Wave 2 ADHD symptoms in a multiple mediation framework. At Wave 1, 222 ethnically diverse youth (30% female; ages 5-10) completed the Digit Span, Vocabulary, Symbol Search, and Arithmetic subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. At both Wave 1 and Wave 2 (ages 7-13), multiple informants (i.e., parents, teachers) rated youth ADHD symptoms and co-occurring psychopathology using multiple methods (i.e., structured interview, rating scale). Controlling for demographic factors, gestational age, and co-occurring externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, birth weight inversely predicted Wave 2 ADHD symptoms across multiple methods and informants. Additionally, controlling for Wave 1 ADHD symptoms and relevant covariates, Wave 1 Arithmetic uniquely mediated the association of birth weight with multi-method/informant Wave 2 ADHD symptoms. These findings suggest that birth weight is a relatively specific risk factor for youth ADHD symptoms and they implicate individual differences in fluid reasoning as a preliminary causal mediator of this association. We discuss implications for future research evaluating causal mechanisms underlying risk factors for ADHD.

AB There is limited understanding of the relation between insomnia and aspects of eating among college students though available data suggest salient clinical relationships. The present study explored a potential transdiagnostic mechanism in the relation between insomnia symptoms and eating expectancies. Participants were a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 1589 college students (80.4% females; Mage = 22.2 years, SD = 5.27) from an urban university. Primary analysis included three regression-based models of eating expectancies. Insomnia symptoms served as the predictor, and emotion dysregulation served as the indirect (mediator) variable in all models. Results indicated that insomnia symptoms yielded a significant indirect effect through emotion dysregulation on expectancies of eating to help manage negative affect, alleviate boredom, and lead to feeling out of control. Students experiencing insomnia symptoms may be at higher risk for experiencing dysregulated emotions and consequently maladaptive eating expectancies compared to good sleepers.

AB As children grow older, parents feel more comfortable sharing information about relational issues. This study explored associations between parents' inappropriate disclosures, young adults' rumination, and difficulties regulating emotions in still married families. It was guided by the theory of communication privacy management. Participants included 371 young adults who completed an online questionnaire. Results indicated an association between parents' inappropriate disclosures and young adults' rumination as well as between rumination and difficulties regulating emotions. Rumination functioned as a full indirect effect, explaining the relationship between parental disclosures and young adults' general difficulties regulating emotions. Results emphasize the perils of inappropriate parental disclosures to young adult children and highlight reasons that young adults may have emotion regulation difficulties.

AB Selective mutism (SM) is a developmental disorder characterized by a child's inability to speak in certain contexts and/or in the presence of unfamiliar interlocutors. This work proposes a critical discussion of the most recent studies on SM, with respect to clinical and diagnostic features, as well as the etiology and treatment of this disorder. At present, all research work supports the hypothesis that SM is a complex anxiety disorder with multifactorial etiology (interaction among biological and environmental causes). The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) places SM mutism among "Anxiety Disorders", and no longer among "Other Childhood, Infant and Adolescent Disorders" (as in DSM-IV). Other important aspects relate to cognitive biases and emotional states at the base of SM, which partly explain the disorder's persistence and represent an important objective of intervention work. No data in the literature point to a total remission of SM, but good results are achieved with cognitive behavior intervention and multimodal therapy (MMT) involving a variety of child interaction contexts.

AB Human development is largely studied as a process of internalizing or accommodating to dominant cultural ideologies, with the implicit assumption that such a process is healthy and desirable. Ideologies, however, not only entail positive beliefs (e.g., family is important); they also contain dehumanizing ones (e.g., men are more important than women). Thus, some dominant ideologies must be resisted for healthy development. This paper draws from our longitudinal research with boys of color over three decades to reimagine social and emotional development as a process by which youth accommodate to and resist dominant ideologies in the construction of their identities and friendships. We reveal that patterns of accommodation and resistance are implicit and explicit, change over time, and are associated with adjustment. Framing social and emotional development as a process by which individuals negotiate cultural ideologies offers a more agentic conceptualization of human development and allows for a better understanding of how to help youth thrive.

The current inflammatory social and political climate appears to be having a negative effect on student social behavior, something we call the "Trump Effect." The authors advocate for specific ways educators can improve school climate and student behavior through increased beginning teacher training focused on understanding behavior (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behaviors) and the use of evidence-based behavior management strategies (e.g., reinforcement). Descriptions of classroom-level supports including information surrounding free/low-cost resources plus direction to additional resources for students in need of targeted or individualized interventions are provided.

AB Harsh parenting is associated with adolescent mental health concerns. Peer relationships also importantly influence adolescent mental health outcomes. Although the direct associations between harsh parenting, peer relationships, and adolescent outcomes have been empirically established, less is known about the extent to which peer relationships mediate the associations between harsh parenting and adolescent outcomes. This study tested the links between harsh parenting, peer relationships, and adolescent outcomes among families at-risk for child maltreatment. With a sample of caregivers and adolescents (n = 218), the results of mediation analyses indicated that peer aggression partially mediated the pathway between harsh parenting and externalizing symptoms of both females and males. Additionally, peer rejection partially mediated the links between harsh parenting and internalizing symptoms of both females and males and peer rejection also was a partial mediator of male externalizing symptoms.

AB The goal of this study was to examine how individual differences in physiological arousal and reactivity moderated the relation between peer victimization and reactive and proactive aggression. Participants were 58 adolescents (61.2% boys; 54.9% African American) in the age range of 12-15. Participants self-reported peer victimization, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression. Cortisol and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were measured from participants before and during an online game in which they were socially rejected by unfamiliar peers. Results indicated that the relation between peer victimization with reactive aggression was significant and positive at low levels of resting RSA and when RSA withdrawal after rejection was high. The association between peer victimization with reactive and proactive aggression was also significant and positive at high levels of anticipatory cortisol. Findings provide further insight into the moderating role that physiological processes may have in understanding individual differences to peer adversity.

AB The articles in this special issue represent progress toward a more comprehensive developmental model of peer victimization and neurobiology. In this commentary, we highlight features of each article that reveal nuances in such a developmental model as related to sex, form of peer victimization, developmental course and period, and neurobiological response system and stimulus. We also encourage further research with an emphasis on longitudinal studies that cross developmental periods and elucidate directions of causality and mechanisms of change, expanded attention to individual and environmental variables that may explain or contextualize effects, assessments of multiple neurobiological systems, and tests of replication, as well as innovation. We acknowledge the challenges of such research and thank the authors for their important contributions to the literature on peer victimization and neurobiology.

ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BEHAVIORS
AB Purpose: Internalizing problems are emotional and behavioural difficulties characterized by a dominant sense of mental and physical discomfort. These problems, with more or less severity, can occur during adolescence. For this reason it is important to broaden our knowledge of the factors associated with these kinds of difficulties. The aim of the study was to analyse the risk and protective factors associated with the development of internalizing problems such as symptoms of depression, low self-esteem and negative emotional states in late adolescence.
   Methods: Longitudinal studies were conducted among students attending Warsaw high schools (N = 511). The baseline was carried out in 2013 and the follow-up in 2015. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire was completed during school lessons to that end.
   Results: The results of generalized linear models (GENLIN) with gamma distribution indicated a statistically significant relationship between the internalization problems of 18 year-olds and the predictors measured two years earlier. Risk factors for depression were gender (female), stress in the family and excessive internet use. Protective factors were physical activity and parental support. Low self-esteem was associated with gender (female) and stress in the family. Higher self-esteem was associated with parental support, good relations with peers and physical activity. Experiencing negative emotional states were associated with gender (female), excessive use of the internet, stress at school and at home as well as the use of sedatives and sleeping pill. Physical activity turned out to be a factor protecting against negative emotional states.
   Conclusions: The results showing the importance of physical activity indicate that encouraging adolescents to be active could be a valuable strategy in the prevention of depression and other youth internalizing problems.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study is to profile three groups of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and both ADHD and ODD, through analyzing their cognitive abilities, personality traits, and family characteristics.
   Methods: The study included 60 patients, with 20 patients in each group. Patients were selected according to the DSM IV criteria. They completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, and their mothers filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Marital Conflict Questionnaire.
   Results: There were no significant differences in picture completion, block design, and coding, which are the WISC-R subtests, between the three groups. In addition, there was no significant difference in verbal, performance, and WISC-R scores. Finally, there was no significant difference when the subdivisions of the CBCL externalizing and internalizing behaviors were analyzed individually. The Frequency of Marital Conflict Score and Conflict Expansion Score were analyzed, and there were no significant differences found between the three groups. The highest average of the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test was in the ODD group, whereas the lowest average was in the ADHD group.
   Conclusion: When comparing ADHD and ODD in terms of cognitive abilities, the observed differences may be because ODD has no genetic or organic component, and ADHD has an organic basis. In ODD, cognitive abilities are intact, which should underline the environmental and family factors.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire for adolescents in Spanish. A convenience sample of 824 and 1756 high school students in Argentina completed the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire, as well as questionnaires measuring peer nominations, cyberbullying, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Exploratory and confirmatory factorial analysis indicated two related dimensions: one related to being bullied and another related to being and aggressor. Cronbach's Alphas were good. Regarding validity, both subscales suggested construct validity (significant associations with internalizing and externalizing problems) and criterion validity (associations with peer nomination). Also, test re-test reliability was detected. Therefore, results suggest that the Olweus questionnaire has good psychometric properties in Argentina.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop entrepreneurship games for early childhood education (ECE) and to develop a module using a number of systematic approaches.
   Design/methodology/approach There were two studies conducted. Study 1 focused on developing guidelines for traditional games. The games were collected and selected based on their entrepreneurial characteristics. In study 2, the authors selected eight relevant traditional games and then examined their effectiveness at internalizing the spirit of entrepreneurship. For the assessment, the authors trained 40 expert raters from the fields of psychology, ECE, and entrepreneurship studies.
   Findings The results showed that two groups of raters agreed (k=0.64) that the games were effective for internalizing the spirit of entrepreneurship in ECE. In the second part of the study, the authors intended to develop a set of multimedia digital instructions and guidelines for users (e.g. teachers and instructors) as the traditional games provided no written instructions. This study produced the multimedia digital instructions and constructed a set of assessment tools for the teachers to test the effectiveness of the games.
   Research limitations/implications This study focused on developing traditional games into a structured guideline for teachers. However, further investigation is still necessary to gather evidence regarding the validity of the game manual. Future study should focus on testing the effect of the games on ECE as well as students' entrepreneurial traits.
   Originality/value This study created a new approach by considering local values in developing an entrepreneurship intervention.

AB Susceptibility to social influence is associated with a host of negative outcomes during adolescence. However, emerging evidence implicates the role of peers and parents in adolescents' positive and adaptive adjustment. Hence, in this chapter we highlight social influence as an opportunity for promoting social adjustment, which can redirect negative trajectories and help adolescents thrive. We discuss influential models about the processes underlying social influence, with a particular emphasis on internalizing social norms, embedded in social learning and social identity theory. We link this behavioral work to developmental social neuroscience research, rooted in neurobiological models of decision making and social cognition. Work from this perspective suggests that the adolescent brain is highly malleable and particularly oriented toward the social world, which may account for heightened susceptibility to social influences during this developmental period. This chapter underscores the need to leverage social influences during adolescence, even beyond the family and peer context, to promote positive developmental outcomes. By further probing the underlying neural mechanisms as an additional layer to examining social influence on positive youth development, we will be able to gain traction on our understanding of this complex phenomenon.

AB Learning disabilities are associated with mental health, behavioural and social difficulties. Developmental dyslexia is a particularly salient example of a learning disability that is associated with social and emotional consequences that are not considered primary features of the disorder. These issues can remain and, in some cases, escalate in adulthood. Practitioners should be made aware of the consequences of the emotional impact of such learning disabilities. The following is a comprehensive review of over 100 journal articles investigating the emotional consequences of developmental dyslexia. Articles published between 1980 and 2018 were found using keywords "dyslexia" and "emotion" or "internalizing behaviour", "externalizing behaviour", "depression" or "anxiety". This review provides an overview of the literature investigating the emotional consequences of developmental dyslexia and suggestions to avoid or at least minimize these consequences on the individual, their family and society are provided.

AB Research supports the notion that adolescents' mental health is impacted by peers via contagion processes. A growing area of interest has been how co-rumination may influence depressive symptoms within friendships. The current study examined particular conditions under which co-rumination is especially likely to facilitate depression contagion. Participants were adolescents (N=480, 49% female, M age=14.6years, 59.5% European American) paired in friendship dyads and assessed over 9 months. Characteristics of the adolescent (personal distress), of the friend (excessive reassurance seeking), and of the friendship (friendship quality) were considered. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that co-rumination facilitated depression contagion only under conditions of adolescents' high personal distress, friends' high excessive reassurance seeking, and high positive friendship quality. This research underscores the importance of attending to how and under what conditions depression contagion occurs within friendships in order to support adolescents' positive social and emotional development.

AB The goal of the study was to test the bidirectional associations between teacher-child relationship quality and behavior problems in an elementary school age sample of Chinese American immigrant children. A socioeconomically diverse sample (N=258) of first- and second-generation Chinese American children (M ages=7.4 and 9.2years at Wave 1 and Wave 2, respectively; 48% girls) was recruited from schools and communities and followed for 1 to 2 years. Two waves of data on dimensions of teacher-child relationship quality (i.e., warmth, closeness, and conflict) and children's externalizing and internalizing problems were collected through parents', teachers', and children's report. Path analyses were conducted to test the bidirectional associations between teacher-child relationship quality and behavior problems, controlling for prior levels, child demographic characteristics, and teacher ethnicity. Transactional associations between teacher-child relationship quality and children's behavior problems were found for externalizing problems. That is, teacher-rated externalizing problems negatively predicted child-rated closeness, and teacher-rated conflict positively predicted parent-rated externalizing problems. On the other hand, teacher-child relationship quality did not predict subsequent internalizing problems. However, parent-rated internalizing problems negatively predicted teacher-rated warmth, and teacher-rated internalizing problems negatively predicted teacher-rated conflict. Using a multiple informant approach and a diverse sample of Chinese American immigrant children, this study extends our knowledge of the reciprocal associations between teacher-child relationship quality and children's behavior problems. Based on the results of this study, the authors provide recommendations for educators and future research with this understudied population.

AB There is growing evidence linking emotion dysregulation to anxiety. However, few studies have examined this relationship longitudinally or developmentally. Additionally, no studies have specifically examined the predictive relevance of the emotion regulation skills taught in mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapies. We explore whether specific emotion regulation processes differentially predict specific anxiety symptoms over time among children and adolescents. Methods: Initial emotion non-awareness, nonacceptance, and difficulties with goal-directed behavior were assessed in a community sample (n=312, age range=8-16, mean age=11.68, 59% female, 69% Caucasian). Social anxiety, separation anxiety, and physical anxiety symptoms were assessed every 3months for 3years. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the concurrent and longitudinal effects of emotion dysregulation assessed at baseline or 18months on anxiety. Results: After controlling for depression, age, and gender, all three processes concurrently predicted physical and social anxiety, and all but nonacceptance predicted separation anxiety. Only difficulties with goal-directed behavior, however, predicted longitudinal change in separation anxiety over time with covariates. Additionally, emotion non-awareness and difficulties with goal-directed behavior predicted subsequent changes in social anxiety. Conclusions: Emotion dysregulation may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of anxiety symptoms among youth. It may be beneficial to target reductions in maladaptive strategies in prevention or intervention work.

AB The present study examined whether skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR) moderated prospective associations linking peer victimization with externalizing behaviors and depressive symptoms across the transition to middle school. Participants included 123 early adolescents (M age=12.03years at T1; 50% male; 58.5% European Americans, 35% African Americans, 6.5% of other races/ethnicities). At Time 1, SCLR was measured in the context of peer-evaluative challenges, and early adolescents and teachers reported on peer victimization. At Time 1 and Time 2, early adolescents and parents reported on depressive symptoms and externalizing behaviors, respectively. SCLR moderated prospective associations between peer victimization and depressive symptoms, such that both adolescent- and teacher-reported peer victimization predicted higher Time 2 depressive symptoms more strongly at lower levels of SCLR compared to higher levels of SCLR. SCLR did not moderate the prospective association between peer victimization and externalizing behaviors. Results of the present study suggest that low reactivity in the inhibitory dimension of the sympathetic nervous system may increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms in the context of peer victimization, whereas higher reactivity may operate as a protective factor.

AB Family interactions can be important contributors to the development of child psychopathology, yet the mechanisms of influence are understudied, particularly for populations at risk. This prospective longitudinal study addresses differences in whole family interactions in 194 families of young children with and without early-identified developmental risk associated with cognitive delay. The influence of family interactions on children's later externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, and social skills was examined, and developmental risk was tested as a potential moderator of these relations. Results indicated that the presence of cognitive developmental risk was linked to higher levels of family control than in families of typically developing children, but groups did not differ on dimensions of cohesion, warmth, organization, or conflict. Observed cohesion and organization were associated with better social skills for all children, regardless of risk status. Significant interactions emerged, indicating that higher levels of conflict and control were associated with higher levels of behavior problems, but only for families of typically developing children. These findings underscore the importance of family-level assessment in understanding the development of children's behavior and suggest the need for deeper analysis of the nuances of family process over time.

AB The goal of this study was to examine the independent and interactive roles of harsh-intrusive maternal behaviors and children's executive function in the development of internalizing behaviors across the first years of school. A diverse sample (58% African American, 42% European American) of 137 children (48% female) was followed from kindergarten (age 5 years) through school entry (ages 6-7 years). At age 5, maternal harsh-intrusive parenting behaviors were rated from a mother-child structured play task, and children completed 3 executive function tasks that measured inhibitory control, working memory, and attention set-shifting. Teachers reported on children's internalizing behaviors at ages 5, 6, and 7. Harsh-intrusive parenting behaviors at age 5 years were positively related to internalizing behaviors in the first years of school, whereas high executive function abilities at age 5 years were related to lower internalizing behaviors in the first years of school. In addition, executive function buffered the association between parenting behaviors and internalizing behaviors such that the link between harsh-intrusive parenting and child internalizing behaviors was evident only among children with low executive function and not among children with high executive function. Interventions that focus on reducing negative parenting behaviors and improving children's executive function may prevent internalizing behaviors from increasing during times of social and academic challenge.

AB The current study sought to test whether higher quality mother-daughter communication would buffer associations between maternal depressive symptoms and girls' internalizing and externalizing psychopathology symptoms among urban African American girls across a 12-month period. One hundred ninety-four treatment-seeking urban African American adolescent girls, ages 12-16, and their mothers participated in the study. Every 6 months (for up to 3 assessments), daughters reported on their internalizing and externalizing symptoms, mothers reported on their depressive symptoms, and both mothers and daughters reported on the quality of their dyadic communication. Daughters additionally reported on the extent to which they felt accepted by their mothers at each assessment. Results of multilevel modeling revealed that quality of communication significantly interacted with maternal depressive symptoms to predict externalizing and internalizing symptoms in daughters, such that the risk associated with maternal depressive symptoms was fully buffered for daughters in high-quality communication dyads. Secondary analyses demonstrated that these patterns of results were not accounted for by higher levels of social status or maternal acceptance. Drawing on a vulnerable and understudied population of urban African American adolescent girls, this work suggests that family communication may contribute to important intergenerational psychopathology transmission processes, above and beyond more general features of the family environment.

AB Despite increased attention on parental intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure, a relative paucity of research has examined the developmental consequences of this traumatic experience within a life span approach. The aim of the present study was to examine how parental IPV exposure may relate to mental health during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Furthermore, we examined whether the impact of parental IPV exposure was unique from more commonly studied maltreatment experiences, specifically neglect and physical abuse. A large, racially and ethnically diverse sample (N-baseline = 1,042; 56% female; M-age = 15.1, SD = 0.79; 31.4% Hispanic, 29.4% White, 27.9% African American, 3.6% Asian, 7.7% biracial or other) of adolescents completed a baseline assessment for parental physical IPV exposure and maltreatment as well as measures for symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress, and substance use, annually for 6 consecutive years. Mixed-level modeling was used to examine how parental IPV exposure was uniquely associated with different patterns of mental health across developmental epochs. Findings demonstrated a multifaceted relation with mental health. For internalizing symptoms, the effect was pronounced during adolescence, and neglect increased the risk for depression symptomatology. Meanwhile, parental-IPV-exposed adolescents were at increasing risk for substance use as they aged into adulthood. Symptom levels and trajectories were independent and distinct from maltreatment experiences. This study helps illuminate parental IPV exposure's unique influence on well-being during vulnerable developmental periods. It also calls attention to the importance of developing suitable intervention/prevention programs to target this vulnerable population.

AB The goal of the study was to examine baseline characteristics-child gender, IQ, age, internalizing problems, symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), oppositional defiant disorder, and sluggish cognitive tempo, and parent income, education, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) severity, and anxiety/depression (A/D)associated with response to behavioral treatments for ADHD, predominantly inattentive type. We employed data from 148 children (M = 8.7 years), 58% male, and 57% Caucasian in a randomized clinical trial. Positive treatment response was defined as (a) 5 or fewer inattentive symptoms and (b) a decrease of at least 3 inattentive symptoms from baseline to posttreatment. Child HI, parental A/D, and child IQ were associated with positive response, as follows: Child HI had a main effect in which it was negatively associated with treatment response (36% with 2 or more HI symptoms were positive responders vs. 59% of those with 1 or no symptoms) that was qualified by parental A/D and child IQ. When children had 2 or more symptoms of HI and higher parental A/D, positive response rate was low at 25%; when children had 2 or more symptoms of HI, low parental A/D, and an IQ of 105 or higher, positive response rate was 85%. Furthermore, the group with the poorest response rate (25%) had parents who self-reported greater ADHD severity, and the group with a relatively good rate of positive response (59%) had the lowest number of oppositional defiant disorder symptoms. Likelihood of positive response to our behavioral treatment for ADHD-I is dependent on child and parent factors.

AB Temperamental approach is associated with adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Negative family affective expression, or problematic communication about emotions, is also associated with youth's risk for symptoms. However, it is unclear whether negative family affective expression differentially predicts symptoms based on (a) youth's temperamental approach and (b) informants' perceptions of negative family affective expression. To address these issues, we explored whether mother-, father-, and youth-reported negative family affective expression moderated the relation between youth temperamental approach and symptoms. Participants were 775 youths (71% male, 76% Caucasian) assessed at ages 10-12 (Time 1) and 12-14 (Time 2). Mothers, fathers, and youths reported on negative family affective expression and youths reported on temperamental approach at Time 1. Teachers reported on youth symptoms at Times 1 and 2. Youth- and father-reported, but not mother-reported, negative family affective expression moderated the relation between youth approach and symptoms. When youths reported higher negative family affective expression, youths lower in approach exhibited higher internalizing symptoms than youths higher in approach. In contrast, when fathers reported lower negative family affective expression, youths lower in approach exhibited higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms than youths higher in approach. Assessments and interventions for youth symptoms should include not only temperamental features, but also multiple informants' perspectives of family affective expression. Such efforts could promote greater family communication, address problematic family dynamics, and potentially attenuate risk for youth symptoms.

   CONTEXT
AB Rumination, a thinking style characterized by a repetitive inward focus on negative cognitions, has been linked to internalizing disorders, particularly depression. Moreover, research suggests that rumination may be a cognitive vulnerability that predisposes individuals to psychopathology. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the etiology and development of rumination. The present study examined the role of specific components of child temperamental negative emotionality (sadness, fear, anger) and effortful control (inhibition), as well as parenting behaviors during early childhood on the development of rumination in middle childhood. Early childhood (age 3) temperament and parenting behaviors were assessed observationally and rumination was self-reported in middle childhood (age 9) in a large community sample (N=425; 47.1% female). Two significant interactions emerged. First, temperamental anger interacted with inhibitory control (IC) such that high anger and low IC predicted higher levels of rumination, whereas low anger and low IC predicted lower levels of rumination. Second, IC interacted with parenting such that children with low IC and positive parenting had lower levels of rumination. In contrast, children with high IC reported similar levels of rumination regardless of parenting quality. Overall, these findings highlight the interplay of early IC with temperamental anger and positive parenting in the development of ruminative tendencies in middle childhood.

AB Considerable research has examined the effects of maternal depression on children, but few studies have focused on the relation between paternal and child depressive symptoms, particularly during early childhood. Even fewer studies have been longitudinal, leaving open questions about how paternal and child depression covary over time. The present study sought to address this gap by examining the relation between fathers' and children's depressive symptoms over a 3-year period. Participants were 153 preschool children with behavior problems and their parents. Three longitudinal analytic approaches were used to examine how father and child depression change together and predict one another over time. Additional analyses examined whether externalizing problems or maternal depression might account for the associations between fathers' and children's depressive symptoms. Changes in paternal depression significantly predicted changes in father-reported and mother-reported child depressive symptoms. These effects were evident both in year-to-year fluctuations and in linear trajectories across the 3-year period. Cross-lagged analyses suggested that these relations may have been driven by father-effects; paternal depression at one time point predicted child depression at the next time point, but child depression did not significantly predict later paternal depression. We found little evidence that externalizing problems or maternal depression accounted for the relations between fathers' and children's depressive symptoms. Results provide convergent evidence that fathers' depression may play an important role in the development of depressive symptoms in young children and underscore the importance of including fathers in studies of depression in families.

AB Social-information-processing theories of parenting posit that parents' beliefs and attributions about their children's behaviors contribute to how parents interact with their children. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between negative parenting attributions in infancy, harsh-intrusive parenting in toddlerhood, and children's internalizing problems (IPs) in early childhood. Using data from a diverse longitudinal study (n = 206), the current study used a structural equation modeling approach to test if mothers' negative attributions measured at 6 months predicted teacher ratings of children's IPs in 1st grade, as well as the extent to which observed harsh-intrusive parenting behaviors measured at ages 1, 2, and 3 years mediated this link. Maternal negative attributions in infancy predict more IPs in 1st grade, but this link becomes nonsignificant when observed harsh-intrusive parenting is included as a mediator. A significant indirect effect suggests that harsh-intrusive parenting mediates the association between early negative attributions and eventual IPs. Findings from this study identify harsh-intrusive parenting behaviors as one potential mechanism through which the effects of early attributions are carried forward to influence children's IPs. The developmental and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The present study compared the perceived attainment of developmental tasks of 220 adolescents diagnosed with anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, or depression with a matched sample of 220 peers without a mental illness. The clinical sample perceived tower success with solving personal, social, and socio-institutional developmental tasks compared with their healthy peers. Comparisons across diagnoses identified the largest differences between students with internalizing disorders (anxiety, depression) versus other disorders. We conclude that psychological interventions with adolescents with mental disorders should promote their attainment of age-typical developmental goals.

AB Bullying involvement as a victim or perpetrator is associated with depression and suicidality, and American Indian (AI) youth experience a disproportionately high rate of these mental health issues. This study assessed whether AI young people involved in bullying were more likely to experience negative mental health problems than AI youth who were not involved in bullying, and identified protective factors that might support this particularly vulnerable population. Data come from 1,409 8th, 9th, and 11th Grade AI students who completed the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey. Logistic regression models estimated associations between bullying involvement and internalizing symptoms and suicidality. Selected protective factors (internal assets, empowerment, positive student-teacher relationships, and feeling safe at school) were also examined as independent variables. All forms of bullying perpetration and victimization were associated with increased risk for mental health problems (odds ratio [OR]: 1.57-2.87). AI youth who reported higher levels of protective factors were less likely to report internalizing symptoms and suicidality even in the presence of bullying involvement. For example, AI youth who reported high levels of internal assets had half the odds of reporting internalizing symptoms compared with those with low levels of internal assets (OR = 0.53, confidence interval [CI] 0.38, 0.74). Findings suggest that, similar to a general sample of students, bullying-involved AI students are significantly more likely to experience mental health problems. Promoting school as a safe place and incorporating culturally relevant programming to promote internal assets such as positive identity, social competence, and empowerment among AI students could help reduce the negative effects of bullying involvement.

AB Teacher's Pet, an animal assisted therapy (AAT) was assessed in a randomized controlled trial with incarcerated youth from two Midwestern United States detention facilities. The AAT was expected to increase empathy and reduce behavior problems. Participants trained dogs for one hour, twice weekly for ten weeks. A control group walked but did not train dogs for the same duration. Both groups attended one hour, twice weekly animal didactics. Of 138 participants, 117 provided complete data, and 21 had some missing data imputed. Contrary to expectation, both groups increased slightly in self-reported empathy, and staff and youth rated internalizing problems. The time youth spent with dogs plus animal didactics may have increased empathy. Increased internalizing problems could be attributed to youth gaining greater emotional awareness. Alternately, this brief intervention may not have any immediate effects, given the small changes observed. Additional follow-up of these youth and other comparison groups are needed.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess behavioral manifestations of attachment in middle childhood, and to evaluate their relations with key theoretical correlates. The sample consisted of 87 children (aged 10-12 years) and their mothers. Dyads participated in an 8-min videotaped discussion of a conflict in their relationships, later scored with the Middle Childhood Attachment Strategies Coding System (MCAS) for key features of all child attachment patterns described in previous literature (secure, ambivalent, avoidant, disorganized-disoriented, caregiving/role-confused, hostile/punitive). To assess validity, relations among MCAS dimensions and other measures of attachment, parenting, and psychological adjustment were evaluated. Results provide preliminary evidence for the psychometric properties of the MCAS in that its behaviorally assessed patterns were associated with theoretically relevant constructs, including maternal warmth/acceptance and psychological control, and children's social competence, depression, and behavioral problems. The MCAS opens new grounds for expanding our understanding of attachment and its outcomes in middle childhood.

AB Using 212 adolescents from a central-European country (mean age = 14.02, SD = 2.05, ranged from 11 to 18 years; females = 54%) and a multi-informant method to measure adolescents' behavioral and emotional adjustments, the present study explored three aspects regarding the attachment hierarchy. (1) The three types of behavioral systems of Rosenthal and Kobak's important people interview (IPI) were initially validated using an exploratory factor analysis with a US sample. Using a confirmatory factor analysis with a Czech sample, we replicated these three behavioral systems: attachment bond, support seeking, and affiliation. (2) We found that adolescents who developed attachment bond to multiple primary attachment figures were likely to score lower on both teacher-rated and parent-rated internalizing problems compared to those who had a single primary attachment figure. These multiple primary attachment figures tended to be family members (not peers). (3) Early adolescents who placed parents low in their attachment hierarchy scored higher on self-reported negative affect and lower on self-reported positive affect compared to early adolescents who placed parents high. The present study highlights multiple (vs. single) primary attachment figures as a protective factor and the premature reorganization of attachment hierarchy as a risk factor for adolescents' emotional and affective adjustments.

AB This study investigated the relationship between externalizing behavior problems (EBP), internalizing behavior problems (IBP), and combined externalizing/internalizing behavior problems (EIBP) in early adolescence (11 years) and substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs) at 15 years, using data from the 1993 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort. Behavior problems were assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), applied to mothers when their children were 15 years old. Substance use was assessed with a self-applied confidential questionnaire for the adolescent. The association between behavior problems and substance use was analyzed with Poisson regression with robust adjustment of variance. After adjusting for confounding, adolescents with EBP showed higher risk of alcohol abuse (RR = 1.74, 95%C1: 1.21; 2.50) and experimentation (RR = 1.78, 95%CI: 1.42; 2,23) and tobacco use in the previous 30 days (RR = 2.38, 95%CI: 1.64; 3.45). Adolescents with IBP showed greater risk of having tried tobacco (RR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.24 L 93) and of having used tobacco products in the previous 30 days (RR = 1.92, 95%CI: 1.31; 2.83). Adolescents with EIBP showed greater risk of trying (RR = 2.24, 95%CI: 1.57; 3.21) and consuming tobacco products in the previous days (RR = 3.01, 95%CI: 1.63; 5.56), and lower risk of having tried alcohol at 15 years of age (RR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0..55; 0.94). Public health measures aimed at reducing behavior problems in early adolescence can help reduce tobacco and alcohol consumption at 15 years.

AB Heavy parent digital technology use has been associated with suboptimal parent-child interactions, but no studies examine associations with child behavior. This study investigates whether parental problematic technology use is associated with technology-based interruptions in parent-child interactions, termed technoference, and whether technoference is associated with child behavior problems. Parent reports from 170 U.S. families (child M-age=3.04years) and actor-partner interdependence modeling showed that maternal and paternal problematic digital technology use predicted greater technoference in mother-child and father-child interactions; then, maternal technoference predicted both mothers' and fathers' reports of child externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Results suggest that technological interruptions are associated with child problem behaviors, but directionality and transactional processes should be examined in future longitudinal studies.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms are associated with neurocognitive task performance and ratings of real-world executive functioning (EF) in preschoolers at risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The associations between parent- and teacher-rated SCT symptoms and neuropsychological task performance and ratings of EF in 61 4-year-old preschool children (51 boys, 10 girls) with self-regulation difficulties were examined, with regression analyses controlling for the effects of ADHD inattention symptoms. In the study sample, higher teacher-rated SCT symptoms are significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of visual-perceptual abilities, auditory and visual attention, sustained and selective attention, inhibitory control, pre-numerical/numerical concepts, and slower processing speed, but SCT symptoms are not significantly associated with working memory, attention shifting or cognitive flexibility when controlling for ADHD inattention. Higher parent-rated SCT symptoms are significantly associated with visual-perceptual abilities. ADHD inattention symptoms are more strongly associated than SCT with daily life EF ratings; neither parent- nor teacher-rated SCT symptoms are significantly associated with daily life ratings of inhibition, working memory, or planning/organization after controlling for ADHD inattention. This study suggests that SCT symptoms contribute to EF deficits at least on neurocognitive tasks assessing visual-perceptual/spatial abilities, attention to detail and processing speed, as observed in this sample of young children at risk for ADHD, and may be an important intervention target.

AB Children who enter foster care are at unique risk for developing substance abuse due to experiencing early life stressors. A large body of research has revealed robust effects of various stressors on later substance use, implicating the role of early neurobiological changes that create chronic internalizing problems. However, less literature has investigated externalizing behavior as a mechanism underlying this relationship. Moreover, few studies have examined these mechanisms through a model of cumulative risk. The present study examined whether the prospective association between cumulative pre-adoptive risk (e.g., maltreatment, age at placement, foster placement instability, ever having lived with birth parent) and adolescent/young-adult substance use was mediated by childhood internalizing and externalizing problems in youth adopted from foster care. Participants included 82 adoptees, most with histories of prenatal substance exposure (72%). We tested parent-rated internalizing and externalizing problems across 5 years in childhood as simultaneous mediators of cumulative risk and level of substance use 11-15 years later. Bootstrapping mediation procedures, controlling for age, prenatal substance exposure, adolescent/young adult mental health symptomatology, and youth participation in follow-up, revealed a significant indirect effect of cumulative risk on substance use through childhood internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems. These results underline the importance of mitigating early risk for children in the child welfare system and call for targeting childhood emotion dysregulation to reduce likelihood of substance abuse among previously high-risk adoptees. Nevertheless, low rates of substance use overall in the present sample underscore the positive impact of adoptive placement on mitigating risk for substance abuse among foster youth.

AB The social emotional learning (SEL) conceptual model posits that SEL programs lead to increased knowledge and skills, improved attitudes about self, others, and school, and supportive learning environments, which in turn improve student emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes. Positive Action (PA) is an SEL program for elementary-, middle-, and high-school students. Extensive research documents the effectiveness of PA in decreasing adolescent risk factors and enhancing protective factors, however, minimal research has examined the mechanisms of change responsible for these effects, The current study examined whether PA was associated with SEL outcomes (i.e., alcohol use, aggression, depression, and anxiety) through school hassles (a proxy for school climate). The analytic sample consisted of 8333 ethnically/racially diverse, rural adolescents (51% female) in grades 6 through 12. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data. Engagement in PA was significantly associated with decreased school hassles, indicating an improvement in school climate. Subsequently, decreases in school hassles were significantly associated with decreased alcohol use, aggression, depression, and anxiety. Thus, there was an indirect effect between PA, decreased school hassles, and improved adolescent outcomes. Implications were discussed.

AB Background: Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with deleterious familial effects; caregivers are often enmeshed in the disorder and can experience considerable burden and decreased quality of life (QoL). Consequently, this study examined burden and QoL in caregivers of youth with OCD enrolled in an intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization program.
   Method: The relationships between caregiver QoL and burden and the following variables were investigated: OCD symptom severity, functioning (youth functional impairment, general family functioning), family (family accommodation, parental relationship satisfaction, positive aspects of caregiving), and comorbid psychopathology (caregiver anxiety and depressive symptoms, youth internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Seventy-two child and caregiver dyads completed clinician- and self-rated questionnaires.
   Results: Components of caregiver QoL correlated with caregiver-rated functional impairment, family accommodation, youth externalizing behaviors, and caregiver psychopathology. Aspects of caregiver burden correlated with child OCD symptom severity, functional impairment related to OCD, as well as caregiver and child comorbid psychopathology. Caregiver depressive symptoms predicted caregiver QoL, and caregiver depressive symptoms and child externalizing symptoms both predicted caregiver burden. Caregiver burden did not mediate the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and caregiver QoL.
   Conclusion: Ultimately, elucidating factors associated with increased caregiver burden and poorer QoL is pertinent for identifying at-risk families and developing targeted interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: This study bridges the empirical research on pubertal timing effects, racial identity, and school and neighborhood context to understand the pubertal development and depression link among Black adolescent females. We examined whether racial identity content dimensions moderated the relation between pubertal timing and depressive symptoms among Black adolescent females and the moderating capacity of school and neighborhood racial composition. Method: We administered measures of pubertal development, racial identity, and depressive symptoms to a sample of 217 Black adolescent females, aged 14 to 18. We assessed racial centrality, private regard, and public regard and used archival data to obtain the racial composition of participants' neighborhoods and schools. Results: The results indicated that high racial centrality levels were linked to depressive symptoms for adolescent girls with late pubertal timing relative to their early counterparts, which was stronger for girls attending not majority Black schools. The results also indicated that low public regard levels were linked to depressive symptoms among adolescent girls with early pubertal timing relative to their late counterparts, which was stronger for girls attending not majority Black schools. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that racial identity and school racial context moderate the effects of pubertal timing differentially for early and late maturing Black girls. The results support the notion that the psychological effects of pubertal timing on internalizing symptoms are context dependent.

AB Objective: The study tested whether associations of parenting styles with internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and academic achievement vary between ethnic groups in western countries, between different regions of the globe, and by level of collectivism/individualism of individual countries. Method: A systematic search in electronic databases and cross referencing identified 428 studies that were included in the random-effects meta-analysis. Results: More ethnic and regional similarities than differences were identified. In western countries, associations of authoritative parenting with academic achievement were stronger in non-Hispanic, White families than in Asian minorities. In these countries, associations of authoritarian parenting with academic achievement were less negative in Hispanic families than in non-Hispanic, White families. Authoritative parenting was associated with at least 1 positive child outcome and authoritarian parenting was associated with at least 1 negative outcome in all regions of the globe, with some regional variation. Finally, associations of authoritarian parenting with child outcomes were weaker in countries with a higher individualism score, as were associations of authoritative parenting with academic performance. Conclusions: Parents across the globe could be recommended to behave authoritatively, although authoritarian and permissive parenting is, to some extent, tolerable in a few cultural contexts.

AB Objectives: African American (AA) adolescents face a greater risk of internalizing symptoms, including symptoms of both depression and anxiety, compared with other racial groups; yet, relatively less is known about the variables that contribute to internalizing symptoms. With the aim of advancing this work, this study examined factors that may buffer against such symptoms (maternal warmth, religiosity), as well as those that may confer additional risk (maternal psychopathology). Method: One hundred ninety-three AA single mothers and their adolescent youth reported on religiosity, maternal warmth and depressive symptoms, and youth internalizing symptoms. Dyadic structural equation modeling was used to examine the effects of mother and adolescent religiosity, maternal warmth, maternal depressive symptoms, and adolescent age on youth internalizing symptoms as reported by both the mother and the adolescent. Results: Consistent with hypotheses, maternal depressive symptoms were significantly associated with youth internalizing symptoms (as reported by the adolescent). Further, the impact of maternal religiosity on self-reported youth internalizing symptoms and its subscales was moderated by adolescent age. Specifically, maternal religiosity was associated with fewer self-reported internalizing symptoms in young adolescents, whereas the effect waned in older youth. Conclusions: Possible predictive coprocesses such as maternal influence on adolescent religious choices and identity formation are explored in the context of adolescent internalizing symptomatology.

AB Secure attachment in childhood and adolescence is important to psychological well-being throughout the life span. This cross-sectional study examines the importance of attachment (i.e. parents, peers and school) and self-esteem on the psychological well-being (i.e. total psychological difficulties, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, prosocial behaviours and life satisfaction) among 1360 adolescents (aged 12-15 years) in a district of Central Thailand. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire during school hours. Path analyses investigated the significance of attachment on psychological well-being and the mediating role of self-esteem. Parental and peer attachment were negatively associated with total psychological difficulties, externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while parental and school attachment were positively associated with life satisfaction. More secure peer and school attachment were significantly associated with greater prosocial behaviours. Self-esteem was found to mediate the relationships between attachment and all domains of psychological well-being except prosocial behaviours.

AB Background: Transgender adolescents who apply for treatment often experience a marked increase in body-related distress when entering puberty, accompanied by internalizing problems and poor peer relations. Although adolescence is a time of considerable psychosocial and physical change, generally associated with a decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), research on HRQoL in transgender youth and possible predictors is sparse. This study thus aims to explore the predictive value of body image factors and emotional and behavioral problems for HRQoL.
   Methods: This cross-sectional one-group observational study was carried out at the Child and Adolescent psychiatric department (Gender Identity Service) in Hamburg, Germany. A sample of n = 126 (103 trans male and 23 trans female) adolescents, who were referred for counseling and/or treatment completed different standardized instruments before undergoing any sort of treatment. Firstly, five dimensions of HRQoL were explored in transgender adolescents and secondly, a linear regression model was applied to assess the impact of body image and emotional and behavioral problems on overall HRQoL.
   Results: HRQoL was generally impaired in transgender adolescents compared to norm scores, especially with regard to aspects of psychological and physical well-being. Linear regression analysis revealed that greater internalizing problems and less body satisfaction significantly predicted lower HRQoL outcomes.
   Conclusions: Impaired HRQoL may be explained by high degrees of internalizing problems and low body satisfaction. Thus, one important aim of mental health professionals working with youth should be to provide appropriate treatment and counseling options that may contribute to overall well-being in the long-term.

AB Juvenile drug courts (JDCs) are a growing response to adolescent substance use, but better understanding of modifiable risk factors is needed to improve JDC outcomes. JDCs also serve dual public health and justice functions, heightening potential impact on co-occurring health factors like risky sex. However, mental health symptoms and peers' activities may impede JDC effectiveness. In a unique longitudinal sample of 105 adolescents involved in JDCs, we find elevated internalizing symptoms and deviant peer behavior were each associated with increased substance use, with similar effects on risk for condomless sex. Findings inform intervention targets that could maximize JDC programming impact.

AB The associations among socioeconomic disadvantage, amygdala volume, and internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents are unclear and understudied in the extant literature. In this study, we examined associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and amygdala volume by age across childhood and adolescence to test whether socioeconomic disadvantage would be associated with larger amygdala volume at younger ages but with smaller amygdala volume at older ages. We then examined whether SES and amygdala volume were associated with children's levels of anxiety and depression. Participants were 3- to 21-year-olds from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study (N = 1,196), which included structural magnetic resonance imaging. A subsample (n = 327; 7-21years of age) completed self-report measures of anxiety and depression. Lower family income and parental education were significantly associated with smaller amygdala volume in adolescence (13-21years) but not significantly associated with amygdala volume at younger ages (3-12years). Lower parental education, but not family income, was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, even after accounting for family history of anxiety/depression. Smaller amygdala volume was significantly associated with higher levels of depression, even after accounting for parental education and family history of anxiety/depression. These findings suggest that associations between SES and amygdala structure may vary by age. In addition, smaller amygdala volume may be linked with an increased risk for depression in children and adolescents.

AB The present study investigated Beck's cognitive diathesis-stress theory (1967, 1987) for the prediction of emotional and behavioral problems in childhood. The study included 218 participants aged 10 to 16 years (M = 12.38, SD = 1.16) who underwent two evaluations with an interval of 8.4 months between them. In the first evaluation, sample was divided according to the participants' cognitive vulnerability (vulnerable, moderate, resilient) and in the second, by their experience of stressful events in recent months (low risk, moderate risk, high risk). The groups were compared by variation in the intensity of the symptoms over time. Results showed that high-risk cognitively vulnerable children had increased externalizing symptoms and children with moderate and high cognitive vulnerability had increased internalizing symptoms at Time 2. These results suggest the importance of considering dysfunctional cognitions and the existence of a certain level of stressful events for the development of psychopathology in childhood.

AB The extensive comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents leads to clinical heterogeneity, and is an often-overlooked issue in etiopathogenic and treatment studies in developmental psychopathology. In a representative sample (N = 8236) of New York City public school students assessed six months after 9/11, latent class analysis was applied to 48 symptoms across seven disorders: posttraumatic stress, agoraphobia, separation anxiety, panic disorder, generalized anxiety (GAD), major depression (MDD) and conduct disorder (CD). Our objective was to identify classes defined by homogenous symptom profiles, and to examine the association between class membership and gender, age, race, different types of exposure to 9/11, and impairment. Eight homogenous comorbidity patterns were identified, including four severe disturbance classes: a multimorbid internalizing class (INT), a class with a high probability of CD, MDD, and GAD symptoms (Distress/EXT), a non-comorbid externalizing class, and a non-comorbid MDD class. Demographic and 9/11-related exposures showed some degree of specificity in their association with severe symptom profiles. Impairment was particularly high in the INT and Distress/EXT classes. A better characterization of phenomic data, that takes comorbidity into account, is essential to understand etiopathogenic processes, and to move psychiatric research forward towards personalized medicine. The high probability of endorsing symptoms of multiple disorders in the INT and Distress/EXT classes supports the use of treatments focusing on multimorbidity. Clinical trials should evaluate the effectiveness of disorder-specific versus transdiagnostic interventions. The association between class membership and demographic and exposure variables suggests that interventions may be improved by considering specific predictors of class membership.

AB SYNOPSISObjective. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of spanking and verbal punishment in a community sample of Latino immigrant families with young children, as well as the association of spanking and verbal punishment with child internalizing and externalizing problems 1year later. Parenting context (e.g., warmth) and cultural context (e.g., the cultural value of respeto) are considered as potential moderators. Design. Parenting and cultural socialization practices were assessed via parent self-report in a sample of 633 Mexican and Dominican American immigrant families with young children (M age=4.43years). Parent and teacher assessments of child internalizing and externalizing were also collected at baseline and 12months later. Results. At Time 1, male child gender was positively correlated with concurrent spanking; familial social support and U.S. American cultural knowledge were negatively correlated with mothers' spanking. Verbal punishment at Time 1 was associated with externalizing problems at Time 2 among both Mexican and Dominican American children, and this relation was not moderated. Additionally, verbal punishment was associated with Time 2 child internalizing problems among Mexican American children. There were no significant associations between spanking and later child internalizing or externalizing behaviors. Conclusion. It is important that researchers examine both physical and verbal discipline strategies to understand their unique influences on Latino child outcomes, as well as contextual influences that may elucidate the use and long-term effects of spanking and verbal punishment on Latino children at different developmental stages.

AB Objective: To provide the first validity evidence for the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ) under the causal indicators approach, using lifetime experiences of victimization in a community sample of adolescents, and to explore the associations between polyvictimization and psychopathological symptoms. Method: The final sample comprised 804 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years (M = 14.52, SD = 1.76) and recruited from 7 secondary schools in northeastern Spain. Victimization experiences and psychopathological symptoms were assessed through the JVQ (Finkelhor, Hamby, Ormrod, & Turner, 2005) and the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). Results: There were low correlations between JVQ items, indicating that victimization events tend to be independent. The causal indicators model for causing psychological distress fitted the data, explaining up to 38% and 40% of the variance in internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively. Conclusions: An inappropriate approach to validation can have important consequences for applied research into victimization. Using a causal indicators approach it can be concluded that the JVQ is a valid assessment instrument that can obtain relevant information regarding victimization directly from children and adolescents. This information can be used to help tailor clinical interventions to the needs of child and adolescent victims.

AB Purpose: The study had two goals as follows: 1) to identify the prevalence of children with mild and severe depression (MD and SD), exploring sex differences; and 2) to determine possible significant differences in adaptive and clinical variables between children with different levels of depression (absence of depression, MD, and SD).
   Materials and methods: We used a sample of 420 participants aged 7-10 years (53.3% boys) enrolled in third and fourth grade of primary education, from schools in the Basque Country (Spain). The Children's Depression Scale (CDS, self-assessment) was administered as well as six more assessment instruments.
   Results: It was found that 84.2% of children had no depression, 10% had MD, and 5.8% had SD. Compared with children with depressive symptoms, participants without depression had significantly: 1) lower levels of maladjustment, stress, emotional symptoms, internalizing problems, and behavioral problems; and 2) higher levels of personal adjustment, resilience, social skills, and self-concept. In addition, children with MD had significantly lower levels of clinical maladjustment, emotional symptoms, and stress than children with SD. However, no differences were found in school maladjustment, internalizing problems, behavioral problems, personal adjustment, resilience, social skills, and self-concept between children with MD and SD.
   Conclusion: The discussion emphasizes the importance of identifying children with MD and implementing universal prevention programs from an early age.

AB Background: Substance use problems are prevalent during emerging adulthood and may be particularly harmful for individuals with medical conditions. Understanding the role of positive temperament in substance use for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) may facilitate the identification of intervention and prevention targets given the complex relations between positive emotions and substance use. Objective: To examine whether components of positive temperament differentially relate to substance use in a sample of AYAs with and without medical conditions. Internalizing problems were examined as a secondary outcome given their comorbidity with substance use. Method: In a cross-sectional study that took place in 2015-2016, 494 AYAs (M-age = 19.30years, SD = 1.33, 73% female) who were enrolled in college completed online questionnaires in a laboratory regarding their levels of positive temperament (i.e., high intensity pleasure and positive affect) as well as their substance use and internalizing problems. The primary analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. Results: For healthy AYAs, high intensity pleasure was positively associated with drug and alcohol use problems and positive affect was negatively associated with drug use problems. Among AYAs with medical conditions, high intensity pleasure was positively associated with alcohol use problems. Positive affect was negatively associated with internalizing problems for both groups. Conclusions/Importance: Findings identify paths between components of temperament and substance use and internalizing problems that may inform prevention and intervention efforts tailored to the unique and overlapping needs of AYAs with a range of healthcare demands.

AB Background: A growing body o f research suggests that the children of parents with chronic pain are at risk for internalizing symptoms. The mechanisms of such associations have not been as thoroughly examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether adolescents' social competence mediates the association between parental chronic pain and offspring internalizing symptoms as well as whether these associations are moderated by adolescent gender.
   Methods: The current study was based on cross-sectional data from the Nord-Tremdelag Health Study (HUNT 3), a Norwegian population-based health survey conducted in 2006-2008. The present sample comprised adolescents who had both parents participating (n=9,681). Structural equation modeling was used for the data analysis.
   Results: Our results indicated that the association between concurrent maternal and paternal chronic pain and offspring's symptoms of anxiety and depression was partly mediated by low social competence for girls (b(SE)=0.060 [0.030], P=0.043) but not for boys (b(SE)=-0.059 [0.040], P=0.146). This suggests that these associations are moderated by offspring gender.
   Conclusion: The study extends the existing literature on the possible pathways between parental chronic pain and internalizing symptoms in the offspring. Identifying protective factors in the pathways between parental chronic pain and mental distress in children could guide measures that promote the wellbeing of the child and family of chronic pain sufferers.

AB The unique neuroanatomical underpinnings of internalizing symptoms and impulsivity during childhood are not well understood. In this study, we examined associations of brain structure with anxiety, depression, and impulsivity in children and adolescents. Participants were 7- to 21-year-olds (N = 328) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study who completed high-resolution, 3-Tesla, T1-weighted MRI and self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and/or impulsivity. Cortical thickness and surface area were examined across cortical regions-of-interest (ROIs), and exploratory whole-brain analyses were also conducted. Gray matter volume (GMV) was examined in subcortical ROIs. When considered separately, higher depressive symptoms and impulsivity were each significantly associated with reduced cortical thickness in ventromedial PFC/medial OFC, but when considered simultaneously, only depressive symptoms remained significant. Higher impulsivity, but not depressive symptoms, was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the frontal pole, rostral middle frontal gyrus, and pars orbitalis. No differences were found for regional surface area. Higher depressive symptoms, but not impulsivity, were significantly associated with smaller hippocampal GMV and larger pallidal GMV. There were no significant associations between anxiety symptoms and brain structure. Depressive symptoms and impulsivity may be linked with cortical thinning in overlapping and distinct regions during childhood and adolescence.

AB Introduction: Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a permanent and complex disability arising within the first three years of life characterized by a socio-communicative disorder and by fixed interests and repetitive behaviors. The present pilot study aims to evaluate behavioral aspects in a small population of siblings of ASD children.
   Material and methods: Population: 5 school-aged children (2 males, 3 females) (mean age 9.235 +/- 2.041) were enrolled, as siblings of ASD children, and for comparison, 12 healthy (7 males, 5 females) children (average age 9,528 +/- 3,351). All subjects underwent evaluation of the behavioral with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale.
   Results: The two groups were statistically comparable by age (p = 0.86) and gender distribution (p = 0.87). From the behavioral point of view evaluated with the CBCL scale, siblings of ASD have a higher degree of overall problem (Total problems) compared to control children (p=0.003), in addition they have significantly higher scores in the subscales of behavior examined (Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Social, Thought, Attention, Delinquent, Aggressive) as well as a greater share of disturbances both internalizing (p=0.004) and externalizing (p = 0.007) (Table 1).
   Conclusions: The present preliminary data confirm the need for a global management of the entire family structure for the correct management of Autistic Disorders.

AB Objective: This study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between internalizing/ externalizing problems and child temperament characteristics, family functioning and child-rearing attitudes. Methods: One hundred and fifty-seven children with internalizing and externalizing and their parents were included in this study. Internalizing and externalizing problems were evaluated by 'Children Behavior Checklist, child temperament was evaluated by 'School-age Children Temperament Inventory, family functioning was evaluated by 'Family Assessment Device' (FAD) and child-rearing attitudes were evaluated by 'Parental Attitude Research Instrument' (PARI). Results: Modelling test has been revealed that affective responsiveness feature subscales of FAD has a mediator effect on the relation found between in which both internalizing and externalizing problems, and marital conflict, rejection of the home making role and equalitarianism and democratic attitudes feature subscales of PARI. Similarly, modelling test has been pointed out that behavior control feature subscales of FAD has a mediator effect on the relation found between externalizing problems and strictness and authoritarianism feature sub scales of PARI. Discussion: Our findings showed that family functioning has a mediator effect on the between internalizing/externalizing problems and child-rearing attitudes, these results indicated the importance of parent education in treatment. Long-term follow-up studies are required to determine relationships between internalizing/externalizing problems with child-rearing attitude and family functioning.

AB School bullying and cyberbullying have been linked to suicidal behaviors through depression and alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. However, how these associations may differ across racial/ethnic groups remains relatively unknown. Using data from the 2015 California Youth Risk Behavior Survey, this study aims to examine two questions in different racial/ethnic subgroups: (1) Does bullying affect suicide? and (2) Does bullying have an indirect effect on suicide through depression and use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and other drugs? The sample consisted of 1,765 Californian youth attending grades 9-12. Logistic regression analyses indicate that being bullied is associated with increased odds of suicide across all racial/ ethnic groups; depression mediates the effect of bullying on suicide for all racial/ethnic groups; alcohol use mediates the effect only for Hispanic youth; other drug use mediates the effect only for White youth; marijuana and tobacco use have no mediating role. These findings suggest that bullying may lead to suicide through different risk behaviors for youths of different racial/ethnic groups. Professionals who work with bullied youths need to treat depression more effectively to prevent suicide in service planning and provision. They also need to be aware of the racial/ethnic differences in the risk behaviors intercorrelated with bullying and suicide and provide appropriate treatment to the youth of specific race/ethnicity.

AB Research Findings: The present study examined (a) whether children's negative emotionality traits (anger proneness and unsoothability) interactively predict mothers' authoritarian parenting (AP) and (b) whether children's negative emotionality moderates the associations between AP and children's performance on a spatial cognitive task. Eighty mother-child dyads were recruited from Seoul, Korea (children's age = 45-66 months). The findings were as follows. First, when children were prone to anger and were simultaneously difficult to soothe, mothers were inclined to show more AP. However, when children were relatively low in either of the traits, such as when children were difficult to soothe but not prone to anger, higher levels of unsoothability were associated with less AP. Second, depending on the degree of children's anger proneness, the associations between children's spatial intelligence and AP varied. Among children with higher levels of anger proneness, less AP was associated with lower performance on a spatial cognitive task, whereas the opposite pattern was observed among children with lower anger proneness. Practice or Policy: This study implies that the configurations of temperamental traits and the levels of parental control need to be considered in designing teacher and parent education programs, probably in relation to the cultural context.

AB We investigated the frequency and types of electronic partner aggression (EPA) victimization and its relation to offline partner aggression (PA) and psychological functioning. The sample was comprised of 200 predominantly White (73.5%) Canadian university students (83.5% women; 18-23 years of age) with dating experience. EPA occurred in 67.5% (verbal) to 86.5% (coercive control) of the sample. EPA and offline PA victimization were positively associated (ps <.05) and frequently co-occurred. Higher levels of PA were generally associated with higher levels of internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, with offline sexual aggression and coercive control EPA subtypes being most predictive of poor psychological functioning (ps <.05). Findings indicate that many emerging adults use communication technology to aggress against their romantic partners, that such aggression appears to be part of a larger pattern of PA and is most deleterious when coercive control is present, and that assessment of and prevention and intervention initiatives for PA need to consider both electronic and offline aggression.

AB This meta-analysis evaluated the psychometric properties of the Security Scale (SS; k=57 studies), a measure specifically designed to assess attachment in middle childhood, using several criteria: stability over time, associations with other attachment measures, relations with caregiver sensitivity, and associations with theoretically driven outcomes. The SS demonstrated moderate stability and meaningful associations with other attachment measures and caregiver sensitivity. Furthermore, the SS showed significant associations with developmental correlates of attachment: school adaptation, emotional and peer social competence, self-esteem, and behavioral problem. Some effect sizes varied as a function of socioeconomic status (SES; peer social competence and maladjustment) and publication status (emotional competence, peer social competence, and self-esteem). The association between the SS and our constructs of interest were, for the most part, independent of geographical location and child gender or age. Overall, findings suggest that the SS is a robust measure of attachment in middle childhood and early adolescence.

AB Studies about the effectiveness of psychodynamic psychotherapy interventions with children and adolescents suggest potential adverse effects of this treatment when not supported by a parallel work with parents: it seems that it could damage family functioning and affect family balances. This research aims to assess psychopathological outcomes after two years of psychodynamic psychotherapy by comparing two groups (G) of children and adolescents, related to a Childhood Adolescence Family Service: G1 - individual therapy for child/adolescent only; G2 - therapy for child/adolescent and a separate session of co-parenting support. 21 families with children aged between 6 and 17 years completed the entire treatment. The research protocol involves: Lausanne Trilogue Play, Children Behavior Check List and Family Empowerment Scale. Results show a positive effect of the treatment on the child/adolescent psychopathological profile with a significant improvement concerning the reduction of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Results show the effectiveness of the integrated intervention in the improvement of parents' abilities to validate the children emotional state. Our results suggesting that parenting support increase parental sensitivity, helping the parents to become more able to recognize the children's emotional state and to validate it.

AB Household food insecurity (HFI) is a major global public health and pediatric concern due to its reported association with adverse child nutrition, growth, and health outcomes. Psychosocial dysfunction is a major cause of childhood disability. US and Canadian studies have linked HFI to poorer overall psychosocial dysfunction and specific dysfunction types in school-aged children, i.e., internalizing, externalizing, and attention behaviors. However, it is uncertain whether prior findings are generalizable to low-and middle-income country (LMIC) settings. We conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the association of HFI with psychosocial dysfunction in 6-12-year-old public elementary schoolchildren (n=279) residing in low-income neighborhoods in Quito, Ecuador. Maternal caregivers were interviewed to obtain data on child psychosocial dysfunction (Pediatric Symptom Checklist, PSC), food security (Household Food Security Survey Module), and maternal mental health (SF-36 Mental Composite Summary). Capillary blood samples were obtained from child participants to measure hemoglobin levels. The data were analyzed using general linear models with adjustment for covariates. The results revealed that HFI was associated with significantly higher overall average PSC scores (p=0.002) and with internalizing (p=0.001) and externalizing (p=0.03) but not attention subscale scores. However, anemia was independently associated with PSC attention subscale scores (p=0.015). This is the first study to report on the relationship between HFI and psychosocial dysfunction in school-aged children in a LMIC setting. It highlights the importance of improving policies and programs protecting vulnerable households from HFI. In addition to improving health and nutrition, such improvements could potentially reduce the burden of child psychosocial dysfunction.

AB The Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) has been widely used with adults. Its vulnerable and grandiose dimensions have been differentially associated with psychopathology and interpersonal difficulties. While the PNI has been used with adolescents, its structure and correlates remain to be investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the French PNI for adolescents and its association with indices of dysfunction. A total of 570 adolescents completed the PNI, the Youth Self Report to assess internalizing and externalizing difficulties, and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents to assess self-esteem. Results showed that the first and second-order factor structure of the PNI for adolescents is identical to the one found in adults. Temporal stability at one month was good. Between gender differences, as well as correlations between PNI dimensions, internalizing and externalizing difficulties, and self-esteem further add to the conclusion that the French PNI-A has good psychometric properties.

AB Guided by ecological, work-family spillover and crossover frameworks, this study examined mechanisms linking parental work travel (i.e. nights per year) to youth adjustment (i.e. externalizing and internalizing behaviours) through youth's perceptions of parenting (i.e. knowledge, solicitation) with traveller and youth gender as moderators in a sample of 78 children in 44 two-parent families residing in the United States. The findings from multilevel analyses suggested that mothers' travel nights predicted lower levels of maternal knowledge, with variation by traveller and youth gender. Mothers' and fathers' work travel and perceived parenting were predictors of youth's externalizing behaviours, whereas only fathers' work travel and perceived parenting were predictors of youth's internalizing behaviours. Tests of indirect effects indicated that maternal work travel linked to youth's externalizing behaviours through youth's perceptions of maternal knowledge. These findings add to our limited understanding of work-family issues for parents who have the unique work demand of frequently travelling.

AB To determine the association between 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphisms and behavior problems of Mongolian school-age children, 311 (female = 157, male = 154) healthy children aged 7 to 12 were investigated in Chifeng city of Inner Mongolia. Children's behavior problems and temperament types were evaluated by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Behavior Style Questionnaire (BSQ) or Middle Childhood Temperament Questionnaire (MCTQ), respectively. The 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotypes were determined by mf-RFLP (multiplex fluorescence-restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis. Association between the genotypes and behavior problem scores was analyzed using a generalized linear model (GLM). The results showed that: (1) no significant difference was found in genotypes based on age, gender, or prevalence of behavior problems in the Mongolian children; (2) the children with low-expression genotypes (LGLG, SLG, or SS) had significantly higher scores in withdrawn, aggression, internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems than those with high-expression genotypes (LALA, SLA, or LALG), (3) withdrawal behavior score was affected by the interaction of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotypes with temperament types (P < 0.01). The children with passive temperament and LALA, SLA, or LALG genotypes tended to suffer from withdrawal behavior; (4) there was a significant interaction between 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 genotypes and age in aggressive behavior score (P < 0.01). The children with LGLG, SLG, or SS genotypes were more likely to suffer from aggressive problems in an older age. Overall, the present study suggests that 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 polymorphisms might contribute to certain behavior problems, and that the interaction between genotypes and major affected factors in behavior problems should be considered.

AB Evidence suggests parental support mitigates the association between community violence exposure and internalizing symptoms in adolescents. This study investigates this moderation of parental support for emerging adults and compares it with that for adolescents. Data were drawn from the Pathways to Desistence Study using community violence, parental support, and their interaction to predict internalizing symptoms in a series of regression models for adolescents and emerging adults. Results suggest that exposure to community violence during adolescence and emerging adulthood had a significant association with internalizing symptoms. Mother support during adolescence moderated this relationship. Emerging adulthood was marked by an increase in parental support; however, this support did not moderate the relationship between community violence and internalizing symptoms. Interventions, programs, and policies that leverage the parental support of emerging adults may be a useful strategy to mitigate the negative impacts of community violence.

AB Objective: Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a public health problem with negative effects on the mental health and development of children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to identify the psychiatric outcomes of child sexual abuse and the trauma-related behavioural and emotional problems in adolescents.
   Methods: Retrospective archive study included patient who were referred to child psychiatry clinic dates between 1 December 2010 and 31 December 2013. 136 CSA victims and non-CSA clincal referred group had reached. Diagnostic evaluation of the CSA victims was applied with the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR by child and adolescent psychiatrists and behavioral and emotional problems were were assessed by self-reports.
   Results: CSA victims are 86.0% were female and %30.1 expereinced multiple sexual abuse events. %72.1 of CSA victims has psychiatric diagnosis on Axis 1. Compared to age-matched controls Internalizing problems (p<0.001), Anxiety/depression (p<0.001), Withdrawn (p<0.001), and Rule breaking behaviour (p=0.002) scores are higher in the CSA group.
   Conclusions: Specific problems following a traumatic event may be important in respect of treatment and a formulation to understand the psychopathology. There is a need for longitudinal childhood studies to investigate the mediators of the psychopathology and to understand the emotional and behavioural problems of CSA victims.

AB Background: Mental problems in children are widespread and cannot be reduced through treatment only. Prevention is therefore urgently needed although it is unclear how effective such strategies may be, particularly in the long term. Aim: Can a parent-centered universal prevention program that is effective in the short term also yield effects after 10 years? Method: According to their preschool location, N = 477 families were randomly assigned to the parent training prevention program (Triple P Positive Parenting Program, TP; Sanders, 2012) or the control group (CG). In all, 77% accepted the TP offer (T+), while 23% declined it (T-). The 10-year effectiveness of the program was established with self-report measures of mothers, fathers, and adolescents from N = 361 families. Results: The intention-to-treat analysis (comparison TP vs. CG) yielded negligible findings. By contrast, the differential analysis from the T+ mothers' perspective found long-term improvements in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) internalizing and externalizing behavior and relationship satisfaction in comparison with CG and T-mothers. At 10 years, compared with preassessment, T+ mothers reported the smallest increase in the CBCL sum score of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, 5%, while CG (20%) and T-(33%) mothers reported far higher rates. Contrary to the hypotheses, parenting behavior did not change over time. T+ fathers reported improvements in parenting behavior, while adolescents reported negligible outcomes. Conclusion: The results support the long-term effectiveness of the TP program as a universal prevention intervention, at least from the T+ mothers' perspective. More research should be conducted with the T-families because they showed worse outcomes than the control group.

AB Background: The concept of emotion regulation (ER) is of great importance to the field of clinical psychology and psychotherapy. However, there are only few validated instruments available to measure ER in children and adolescents. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the parent short version of the Questionnaire to Asses Children's and Adolescents' Emotion Regulation Strategies (FEEL-KJ) has enough psychometric quality to fill this gap at least in part. Additionally, to examine indicators for the validity of the instrument and its dependency on sociodemographic parameters. With increasing age, an increase in the use of ER strategies was expected. Also, positive correlations of maladaptive ER and negative correlations of adaptive ER with symptoms of psychological disorders were assumed. Method: The parent short version of the FEEL-KJ and additional parent report questionnaires were used in a sample of 1,638 children aged 2-10 years (reports of both parents: n = 958 children, mothers report only: n = 605, fathers report only: n = 75). Results: Results for mothers and fathers were mostly congruent. Internal consistency values of the parent short version of the FEEL-KJ were in the range of good to very good. With increasing age, adaptive and maladaptive ER-strategies were used more frequently and correlations of ER strategies with internalizing and externalizing psychopathological symptoms were notable. Only few significant differences dependent on the sex of the child and other sociodemographic variables were found. Conclusion: The parent short version of the FEEL-KJ seems to be appropriate to extend the existing assessment of ER in science and practice. However, a multimethod validation study is still necessary to further investigate the instrument's validity. Norms: The generated norms (T values and percentile ranks) are available at https://doi.org/10.24355/dbbs.084-201803050916 (Greuel, Briegel, & Heinrichs, 2018) or can be requested from the authors directly.(2)

AB This study examines discrepancies between adolescent and caregiver reports of youth internalizing symptoms in families presenting for an initial eating disorder assessment. Initial diagnostic assessments of 49 adolescent-caregiver dyads seeking treatment at an urban pediatric hospital eating disorder clinic were utilized to examine differences between youth and caregiver reports of youth anxiety and depression symptoms. Caregivers reported significantly higher scores of major depression and generalized anxiety than adolescents (p=.000). Caregivers of youth with more severe ED symptoms exhibited more congruence with youth's own reports of their depression and anxiety. Our results suggest that agreement within families regarding comorbid psychological concerns may be beneficial in promoting treatment uptake for those who desire a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms, regardless of motivation to change eating behaviors.

AB Background: Reflective Functioning (RF) is considered to play a central role in risk and resilience for psychological difficulties such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and has become an important treatment target of transdiagnostic psychosocial interventions like Mentalization Based Therapy. However, a lack of measures to assess RF in adolescents has hampered research that can further elucidate the role of RF in different types of psychopathology.
   Objective: The objective of the present study was to examine the validity of the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire for Youth (RFQ-Y), examine the factor structure of the french RFQ-Y, the relationship between RFQ-Y and social cognition, psychological difficulties, BPD and narcissistic personality disorders.
   Method: A total of 533 adolescents and young adults (age 12 - 21) from the community completed the RFQ-Y, the Child Behaviour Checklist, the Borderline Personality Features Scale and the Pathological Narcissism Inventory. A subsample of 150 participants completed the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC).
   Results: Three factors were identified. Uncertainty/confusion was strongly positively correlated with psychological difficulties, especially symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Interest/curiosity was negatively correlated with psychopathology and Excessive Certainty was positively correlated with grandiose narcissism. RFQ-Y factors correlated more strongly with psychopathology than the MASC scales.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the validity of self-report measures like the RFQ-Y and its utility for identifying problematic styles of mentalizing associated with increased risk of psychopathology in general, as well as difficulties like narcissism in particular.

AB It is well-documented that poor parenting practices result in negative emotional outcomes in children. Specifically, this review seeks to explore the relationship between parenting practices and internalization symptomology. This study utilized a systematic review and an appraisal tool was developed in order to ensure that included articles maintained high methodological rigour. Biomed Central, PsychArticles, Academic Search Complete, Eric, Sage and SocIndex databases were searched. After yielding 1002 articles in the initial search strategy, 39 articles were appraised and a total of 21 empirical studies were used for data extraction. In all, 13 articles indicated that some forms of poor parenting practices are related to internalizing behaviours. For example, over-involved parenting, spanking endorsement, over-reactive parenting, insecurely attached children, authoritarian parenting and permissive parenting are all linked to internalizing behaviours in children. Two articles reported a negative relationship between authoritative parenting and internalizing symptoms. This systematic review does indicate a relationship between parent-child relations and internalizing symptoms in children. In several studies, the complexities of this relationship remain unknown, and warrant further attention.

AB Identification of children who exhibit emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBDs) has been prioritized in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region including Oman. Research showed that cognitive attribution processes are biased and defective in atypical populations such as students with learning disabilities (LD). The current study examined the relationship between school-based attributions including academic and social attributions and the display of EBDs in students referred for having LD and typically achieving students. The Student Academic Attribution Scale (SAAS), Student Social Attribution Scale (SSAS), and the Arabic version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (A-SDQ) were administered to 135 typically achieving students and 89 students referred for LD. The participants were all females from middle school. Stepwise regression analyses showed that academic and social attributions were more predictive of EBDs in students referred for LD compared to typically achieving students. The attribution profile of students with LD reflected negative symptoms that lead to the display of internalizing and externalizing EBDs. The study findings are discussed in relation to how schools can utilize the cognitive process of attribution to support students with EBDs.

AB Purpose Parent-focused interventions (PFIs) are a promising method for supporting parents and promoting children's well-being. Few PFIs in the USA, however, include physical health promotion content and are universal programs. The purpose of this paper is to describe a universal health-promoting PFI for parents of elementary school-aged children and demonstrate proof of concept.
   Design/methodology/approach The program emphasizes positive parenting practices, stress management skills and physical health promotion strategies and recommendations, and is part of a larger initiative that includes a continuum of universal, developmentally appropriate, health-promoting PFIs for civilian and military parents. The program was implemented at two community sites in rural Pennsylvania with 20 civilian parents completing pretests and posttests. Study measures assessed parenting, stress and stress management and physical health promotion related outcomes.
   Findings Parents reported decreases in suboptimal discipline and feeding practices, stress and child internalizing behavior. They also reported increases in their sense of control in managing child behavior, coping socialization, child's outdoor playtime and health recommendations met.
   Research limitations/implications While these preliminary findings may not be generalizable, they serve as proof of concept, which suggests that more rigorous research on the program is warranted.
   Practical implications Implementing a universal, health-promoting PFI within the USA is viable and has the potential to impact multiple short-term outcomes.
   Originality/value Parents are among their child's earliest and most influential educators, and this study lends further support to their role as health educators. Given the significant public health benefits of holistically promoting child health, the time has come for universal PFIs to begin including physical health promotion content.

AB Urban African-American youth residing in poorly resourced communities are at a heightened risk of peer victimization, which consequently increases their likelihood of risky behaviors such as substance use. The present study examined whether there was a direct relationship between peer victimization and substance use and whether it was mediated by negative peer norms, internalizing problems, and bullying perpetration. African-American youth (n = 638) completed a self-administered questionnaire on age, biological sex, socioeconomic status, lifetime substance use, peer victimization and bullying perpetration, negative peer norms, and internalizing problems. There were no direct effects between peer victimization and substance use. However, negative peer norms and bullying were both independently associated with substance use, although internalizing problems were not significant. In addition, peer victimization increased the odds of internalizing problems. Social services must be expended in low-income communities to effectively address peer victimization and substance use among urban African-American youth.

AB Obese and overweight youth are at an increased risk for poor peer relations and psychosocial adjustment. Of particular concern is the high rate of bullying victimization experienced by obese and overweight youth. While it is known that victimized youth are at an increased risk for internalizing symptoms, few studies have examined if weight status exacerbates the association between victimization and internalizing symptoms. The current study drew upon data from over 43,000 youth attending 107 middle and high schools. Multilevel results suggested that compared with normal weight youth, both overweight and obese youth were at an increased risk for experiencing relational, verbal, and cyber victimization, with only obese youth being at an increased risk for experiencing physical victimization. Notably, the odds for experiencing cyber victimization were higher than the odds for experiencing other forms of victimization. Frequently victimized obese youth, but not frequently victimized overweight youth, had significantly higher levels of internalizing symptoms compared to their frequently victimized, normal-weight peers. Together, these findings highlight the increased risk for psychosocial adjustment problems among frequently victimized overweight and obese youth, suggesting these youth may require preventive interventions tailored to meet their unique needs.

AB Previous researchers have identified problematic mother-child interaction patterns as a potential pathway through which maternal depressive symptoms impact child behavior problems, but could not establish the temporal precedence of these associations. This longitudinal study investigated mother-child aggression as a mechanism in the association between maternal depressive symptoms that occurred during infancy and subsequent child behavior problems among high-risk families. Two hundred thirty-four socioeconomically disadvantaged families were recruited from neighborhoods with high rates of family violence. During infancy (12-18 months), early childhood (4 years), and middle childhood (6 years), mothers reported their current depressive symptoms and use of psychological and physical aggression with their child. During early and middle childhood, mothers reported their children's behavior problems. Using path analyses, a temporal process was identified in which mother-child aggression during early childhood mediated the association between maternal depressive symptoms during infancy and higher levels of externalizing behavior problems during middle childhood. Mother-child aggression did not mediate the association between maternal depressive symptoms during infancy and higher levels of internalizing behavior problems during middle childhood. Early maternal depressive symptoms that occur during infancy are important risk factors for subsequent mother-child aggression, which, in turn, contributes to more child externalizing behavior problems. Therefore, screening mothers for depressive symptoms and providing intervention and prevention services to improve mother-child interactions may be crucial to preventing the exacerbation of externalizing behavior problems. Additional research is needed to identify pathways to child internalizing behavior problems.

AB Objective: Little is known about psychopathological features associated with restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pediatric populations. This study examined sleep duration, insomnia, and psychopathological profile associated with RLS in a large community sample of adolescents.
   Methods: Participants included 11,831 adolescents from 3 counties of Shandong, China. Mean age of the participants was 15.0 (SD = 1.5) years, and 51% were boys. In November and December 2015, participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess sleep duration, sleep problems, behavioral/emotional problems, and hopelessness. RLS was assessed by the 2003 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnosis and Epidemiology Workshop criteria.
   Results: Of the sample, 9.5% met the 2003 NIH workshop criteria for RLS, and 2.2% had RLS at least 3 times per week. Compared with adolescents without RLS, adolescents with RLS < 3 times per week and those with RLS >= 3 times per week demonstrated significantly higher rates of insomnia symptoms (13.8%, 20.0%, and 36.4%, respectively;chi(2) = 117.84, P < .0001), internalizing (9.1%, 18.5%, and 34.1%;chi(2) = 238.84, P < .001) and externalizing (9.8%, 17.4%, and 34.1%;chi(2) = 193.87, P < .001) problems, and hopelessness (13.0%, 16.9%, and 27.8%;chi(2) = 54.10, P < .001). After adjusting for demographics and internalizing and externalizing problems, RLS = 3 times per week was associated with a doubled risk of insomnia (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.53-2.75). After adjusting for demographics, sleep duration, and insomnia, RLS = 3 times per week was associated with a more than doubled risk of internalizing (OR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.94-3.62) and externalizing problems (OR = 2.75; 95% CI, 2.02-3.74).
   Conclusions: RLS is associated with increased risk of insomnia, hopelessness, and both internalizing and externalizing problems. Our findings suggest that clinicians need to assess RLS in adolescents with sleep and mental health problems.

AB A dolescents who immigrate face particular adjustment challenges. This study investigated (a) levels of wellbeing and depression in migrant adolescents and their Australian native counterparts, (b) associations between adjustment and four psychosocial resources, and (c) moderating effects of country of birth on the relationships between these resources and adjustment indices. The sample (N = 327) included students born in Australia, English-speaking countries other than Australia, and non-English-speaking countries. Students born outside of Australia in English-speaking countries reported highest mean levels of wellbeing and ethnic identity. Ethnic identity did not have the expected protective effects on migrant adolescent adjustment. In contrast, a sense of school membership affected Australian-born adolescents more positively than it did their overseas-born peers. The results raise questions regarding sources of support and connectedness that might particularly help migrant adolescents.

AB Sexual abuse by a perpetrator outside of the family is the most prevalent form of child sexual abuse. It is associated with serious consequences for both the child and his family. Surprisingly, however, the issue of extra-familial sexual abuse has received very little research and clinical attention. The purpose of the current study was to explore the effectiveness of Child-Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT), which uses nondirective play therapy tools, among parents of extra-familial abused children and their parents. In order to do so, data was collected from 51 parents who participated in CPRT, at three points in time: pretreatment stage, at the beginning of the first meeting; and in the post treatment stage. The data included the parents' reports via three questionnaires: Parenting Stress Inventory (PSI), Compassion Fatigue Self-Test (CFST), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Overall, the results indicated a decrease in internalizing and externalizing symptoms among the children, as well as in parenting stress and in parental secondary trauma symptoms. This study contributes to the literature on interventions with victims of extra-familial child abuse and their parents. Specifically, the results highlight the benefits and importance of involving both parents and children in therapeutic interventions for victims of extra-familial child sexual abuse, with particular emphasis on the benefits of Child-Parent Relationship Therapy.

AB The author examined the relationship among peer rejection, peer victimization, and internalizing behaviors. The author hypothesized that physical and relational victimization would have a different indirect effect on the relationship between peer rejection and internalizing behaviors. Participants were 94 preschool children (37 girls; average age 49.97months) from two university preschools located in the northern part of the United States. The results indicated that internalizing behaviors predicted the mediating variables only regarding relational victimization. Relational victimization indirectly affected the association between peer rejection and internalizing behaviors. The study provides evidence of the mediating effect of victimization behaviors on the relationship among peer rejection, victimization, and internalizing behaviors.

AB A majority of men incarcerated are fathers, but little research has been conducted on the children's well-being after their father's release from incarceration. We measured changes in internalizing and externalizing problems (based on father's and female partner's report) across a 34-month period among children ages 6-17 (n = 431). Results suggested increased internalizing and externalizing problems in older children, increased internalizing problems when fathers had problem alcohol use, and a moderating role of father-child coresidence and father-child relationship. Programs to promote paternal well-being and father-child relationships before and after reentry may benefit children of incarcerated fathers.

AB Theoretical models and recent advances in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) have increasingly focused on the role of alterations in the processing and regulation of emotions. To date, however, our understanding of these changes is still limited and reports of emotional dysregulation in AN have been based largely on self-report data, and there is a relative lack of objective experimental evidence or neurobiological data.
   The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the hemodynamic correlates of passive viewing and voluntary downregulation of negative emotions by means of the reappraisal strategy detachment in AN patients. Detachment is regarded as adaptive regulation strategy associated with a reduction in emotion-related amygdala activity and increased recruitment of prefrontal brain regions associated with cognitive control processes. Emotion regulation efficacy was assessed via behavioral arousal ratings and fMRI activation elicited by an established experimental paradigm including negative images. Participants were instructed to either simply view emotional pictures or detach themselves from feelings triggered by the stimuli.
   The sample consisted of 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and a pairwise age-matched healthy control group. Behavioral and neuroimaging data analyses indicated a reduction of arousal and amygdala activity during the regulation condition for both patients and controls. However, compared with controls, individuals with AN showed increased activation in the amygdala as well as in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during the passive viewing of aversive compared with neutral pictures.
   These results extend previous findings indicative of altered processing of salient emotional stimuli in AN, but do not point to a general deficit in the voluntary regulation of negative emotions. Increased dlPFC activation in AN during passive viewing of negative stimuli is in line with the hypothesis that the disorder may be characterized by excessive self-control. Taken together, the data seem to suggest that reappraisal via detachment may be an effective strategy to reduce negative arousal for individuals with AN.

AB Background: The empirical knowledge about psychological disorders and behavioral problems in families with a migration background is low. The few existing studies suggest a slightly greater burden on children and adolescents with a migration background (MB) compared to those without MB, which is probably due to their poorer living conditions and lower socio-economic status. Method: In a longitudinal study, psychological symptoms in children with and without MB were compared, namely in early childhood and 10 years later in adolescence. In addition, exploratory differences between migrants and non-migrants were examined with regard to a parental training (Triple P) carried out in early childhood. The source of the data was the longitudinal project 'Future Family III'. The sample consisted of 70 families with (19.4%) and 291 families without MB (80.6%). The average age of children in early childhood was 4.2 years, of children in adolescence 14.1 years; 45.7% were girls. Results: There were few differences between children and adolescents with and without MB. These differences decreased from childhood to adolescence. For young people with MB, there was increasing evidence of a computer game dependency, and they spent more time with social networking; young people without MB showed a greater risk of eating disorders and risky sexual behavior. Regarding the prediction of psychological problems in adolescence, neither MB nor the social status played a role, only psychological problems in early childhood proved to be relevant. Migrants and non-migrants benefited equally from the parental training. Migrants who refused to participate showed significantly less favorable outcomes compared to non-migrants. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of migrants must be taken more seriously into account in future studies. Due to the increasing number of families with MB in Germany, increased efforts should be made to examine children, adolescents, and their parents. For a better understanding of the effects of migration, longitudinal studies are necessary.
