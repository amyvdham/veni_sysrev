AB This study investigates how temperament factors are linked to internalizing and externalizing problems in a Dutch population sample of preadolescents (N = 2230). Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report and temperament was evaluated by the parent-version of the Revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. Temperament profiles were examined in children with (a) neither internalizing nor externalizing problems, (b) only internalizing problems, (c) only externalizing problems, and (d) both internalizing and externalizing problems. The results suggest clearly diverging temperament profiles for these groups of children, with High-Intensity Pleasure and Shyness (representing the broad dimension of Surgency) steering the conditional probability of internalizing and externalizing problems (direction markers), Frustration mainly being related to maladaptation in general (severity marker), and Fear and Effortful Control being associated with both the severity and the direction of internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Girls and boys differed in the distribution across the problem groups, but the associations between temperament and psychopathology were comparable for both genders.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the association among suicide behaviors, high-risk behaviors, coping style, and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptomatology, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) in homeless and non-homeless adolescent males (aged 16 to 19 years).
   Methods: Data were obtained from 100 homeless youth accessing an emergency shelter (Ottawa, ON). The comparison group was comprised of 70 youth accessing local community drop-in centers that lived with their parent(s)/guardian(s) and had never stayed in a shelter. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, Student's t-tests, and regression statistics.
   Results: Relative to non-homeless youth, homeless youth were more likely to report drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, legal problems, academic difficulties, and mental health problems. Homeless youth presented with a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation, past suicide attempts, depressive symptomatology, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Disengagement coping was a predictor of suicidal ideation, past attempts, depressive symptoms and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youth.
   Conclusions: Relative to non-homeless youth, findings indicate that homeless youth reported greater use of a disengaging coping style and are at greater risk for high-risk behaviors, past suicide attempts, and clinically elevated levels of depressive symptoms and behavior problems.

AB This article uses a resources and demands approach to examine the extent to which work, community, and parenting resources and demands are related to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems and grades in school. The analysis is based on data from 489 married two-earner couples and adolescents aged 10 to 17 interviewed for the 19921994 National Survey of Families and Households. The results indicate that time in activities is not related strongly to adolescent problems and grades. Negative work spillover, peer-based school problems, and harsh parenting behaviors show the strongest and most consistent relationships with adolescent problems and grades. Friends' planning college and nurturing parenting behaviors are positively related to grades. Thus, the findings support the resources and demands approach to varying degrees for the resources and demands included in the study.

AB Although anxiety disorders are prevalent among children and adolescents, with a chronic and often disabling course, there is a paucity of research examining the specific ways in which anxiety interferes with various domains of functioning in childhood. The purpose of the current investigation was to examine the initial reliability and construct validity of the Child Anxiety Impact Scale-Parent version (CAIS-P). The CAIS-P is a parent-report measure consisting of School, Social, and Home/Family subscales. In a clinical sample (N = 92), the internal reliability and the convergent and divergent validity were evaluated. Internal consistency was good for the total score as well as each subscale (Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.73-0.87). The CAIS-P total score demonstrated good construct validity, showing predicted significant correlations with the Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing Scale and the Child Depression Inventory but not the Externalizing Scale of the Child Behavior Checklist. The Social subscale of the CAIS-P was also significantly correlated with measures of social anxiety. The results provide initial support that the CAIS-P is a reliable and valid measure for the assessment of the impact of anxiety on child and adolescent functioning.

AB Background: Cross-national studies describing the psychopathological characteristics of arrested adolescents are virtually non-existent. Such studies are important because they have implications for national policy on arrest, case-management, and future research. Method: To address this issue, self-report surveys administered to representative groups of 12- to 16-year-old adolescents in New Haven, USA (N = 1138) and Antwerp, Belgium (N = 627) were compared. A number of internalizing and deviant behavior variables were compared between controls (C), non-arrested antisocial (NA), and arrested antisocial (AR) participants. Results: Similar cross-national arrest rates and levels of antisocial behavior were found. NA and AR youths in both countries reported more internalizing problems, except for anxiety, and more deviant characteristics. Contrary to expectations, the level of depression was not higher in AR compared to NA youth when differences in antisocial behavior between NA and AR were controlled. Also unexpected, arrest showed an independent association with a number of deviant behavior variables. Conclusions: Further research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of these associations, as this insight would be useful for developing future intervention and prevention programs, as well as for developing future national policies regarding juvenile antisocial behavior.

AB The role of child gender in the relationship between interparental conflict and adolescent psychological symptoms was examined in a sample of 924 children 10 to 15 years old and 172 of their mothers. Interparental conflict was a significantly stronger predictor of adolescent internalizing symptoms for girls than boys across type of informant (i.e., mother or child). In examining why the risk posed by interparental conflict differed by gender, further analyses indicated that girls' tendencies to experience elevated levels of communion partly accounted for their greater vulnerability to interparental conflict.

AB Objective: To understand the relationship of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) to early life experience.
   Methodology: Eight thousand five hundred and fifty-six women enrolled in a prospective study at their first antenatal clinic visit. At 13 years, of 5345 women remaining, a consecutive sample of 901 mother/child pairs provided data on adolescent HR-QOL using the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Report form (CHQ-PF50) and the Dartmouth COOP Functional Assessment Charts for Adolescents. The CHQ-PF50 yielded physical (PHS) and psychosocial (PSS) summary scores. We examined the relationship between health-related QOL and early childhood predictive variables.
   Results: PHS was related to gestation, maternal health symptoms in pregnancy, maternal anxiety at 6 months, child health and hours of childcare at 5 years (P<0.05). PSS was related to maternal age at index visit, maternal attitude to pregnancy, maternal satisfaction with care giving and maternal depression at 6 months, and child health and behaviour problems at 5 years (internalizing and social/attentional/thought (SAT) domains) (P<0.05). Findings from adolescent self-reports were similar.
   Conclusions: This study has identified a number of early childhood determinants of adolescent HR-QOL. These findings add to evidence of the effects of early adversity on the developmental pathways of children and support the need for effective early intervention.

AB Objective We set out to examine the relationship between unintentional injury and common child psychiatric disorders, including both internalizing and externalizing diagnoses. Methods The 1999 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Survey provided a nationally representative sample of over 10,000 children aged 5-15 years. Measures included assessment of diagnoses of psychiatric disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, unintentional injury, and a range of potentially related psychosocial factors. Results Children with psychiatric disorders had higher rates of unintentional injury. After accounting for psychosocial risk factors and comorbid psychopathology, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) was independently associated with burns and poisoning. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was related to fractures, and depression and anxiety also showed independent links to some injury types. Conclusions ODD and ADHD, rather than conduct disorder, appear to be the externalizing disorders associated with unintentional injury. We discuss possible models of the relationships between internalizing disorders and unintentional injury.

AB Comorbidity of substance abuse disorders (SUD) and psychiatric disorders is one of the most important areas of investigation in contemporary drug abuse treatment research. This study examined the impact of psychiatric comorbidity on the treatment of 182 adolescent drug abusers in a randomized clinical trial comparing family and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy. Three distinct groups of adolescent substance abusers were compared: (1) Exclusive Substance Abusers (SUD only); (2) Externalizers (SUD + externalizing disorder); and (3) Mixed Substance Abusers (SUD + externalizing and internalizing disorder). The purpose of this study was to determine whether adolescents in these comorbid groups differed in clinical presentation and treatment response. More severe comorbidity was associated with greater family dysfunction and being female and younger at intake. An examination of substance use trajectories over time indicated that the Mixed group initially responded to treatment but returned to intake levels of substance use by 1 year post-discharge.

AB Background: Children with phenylketonuria of early onset under continuous treatment are considered at higher risk for psychological maladjustment than children without other chronic diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychological adjustment of Lithuanian children with treated phenylketonuria and analyse it in the context of the psychological adjustment of their parents.
   Material/Methods: The parents of 37 early-treated children (age 4-14 years old) with phenylketonuria and of 37 matched controls were asked to fill out the Child Behavior Checklist and questionnaire on stress coping strategies. Parents of children with phenylketonuria answered a questionnaire on reactions to the child's disease and its impact on the family.
   Results: Lithuanian children with treated phenylketonuria have significantly more emotional and behavioral problems than healthy controls. They are more withdrawn, anxious/depressed, have more social and attention problems. The higher rates of internalizing and total problems are related to parental maladjustment (feelings of guilt and anger) together with maladaptive (emotional) everyday stress coping strategies. These last two factors promote overindulging that child, which is also a predictor of psychological maladjustment in children with phenylketonuria.
   Conclusions: The already existing organic vulnerability may account for the greater susceptibility of children with phenylketonuria to psychological risk factors, as for example parental inability to cope adequately with everyday stress related to the demands of disease and its treatment.

AB Given the research that suggests the social use of language is the latest developing aspect of language, it was hypothesized that children with speech/language impairment (SLI) are particularly susceptible to social interaction difficulties, resulting in diminished social competence. This hypothesis was explored with SLI and non-language-impaired (NLI) 4- and 5-year-old children by gathering measures of social problem solving ability (as rated by teachers, parents, and peers), emotion knowledge, and language development. Results provided partial support for the hypothesis above. Speech/language-impaired children were rated significantly lower on parent ratings of self-control and higher in internalizing behaviors, and lower on teacher ratings of assertiveness, than the NLI controls. There were no differences noted on peer sociometric ratings or mutual friendships. However. SLI children scored lower on a stereotypical test of emotional knowledge, while scoring similarly to NLI controls on a non stereotypical test. A test of language development (TELD-2) differentiated the SLI and NLI groups, both expressively and receptively. In addition, the TELD-2 indicated a significant difference in semantic processing errors, but not syntax errors, between the two groups. The differential effects of speech/language impairment on the development of social competence were explored. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Studies have reported that childhood asthma is associated with internalizing disorders, but most of these studies have used global measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was administered to a group of 1,891 youth ages 4 to 17 and their caregivers in Puerto Rico to determine DSM-IV symptoms and diagnoses. Asthma diagnosis and having had an asthma attack were assessed by parental report. A diagnosis of asthma was associated with having any depressive disorder and one symptom of separation anxiety. An asthma attack was associated with any depressive disorder and any anxiety disorder and, more specifically, with separation anxiety disorder major depressive disorder and symptoms of depression, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety. Possible explanations for the findings are discussed.

AB Youth with substantial sexual behavior problems (n = 166) were compared with youth from the same sample with few sexual behavior problems (n = 413) and with no sexual behavior problems (n = 943). It was hypothesized that youth with significant sexual behavior problems would be characterized by higher rates of sexual and physical abuse and higher rates of internalizing problems relative to youth without sexual behavior problems and that all youth would evidence a Positive treatment response to multisystemic therapy. Relative to youth with no sexual behavior problems, youth with significant sexual behavior problems were more likely to have been sexually or physically abused and had higher rates of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. These youth were also more likely to include girls, were younger, and had more social problems than youth with no sexual behavior problems. Youth in all groups responded with clinically relevant and statistically significant reductions in problem behaviors at posttreatment.

AB A multiethnic community sample of 191 families with four-year-old children in northern Norway was used to explore whether parenting factors were associated with child behavior problems, and whether these associations differed for boys and girls or for the two main ethnic groups in this region: the indigenous Sami and the majority Norwegians. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a semi-structured interview on child-rearing were used as instruments. As would be expected from a developmental perspective, elevated scores of child behavior problems were associated with lower levels of parental cuddling and with higher levels of physical punishment. Family demographics such as low maternal age and single parenthood were also associated with more behavioral problems. Girls seemed to be more strongly influenced by child-rearing factors than boys. Subgroup analyses suggested that for harsh treatment, patterns of correlations differed between Sami and Norwegian groups, especially for boys. A positive correlation between physical punishment and externalizing problems emerged for Norwegian boys, but not for Sami boys. Teasing/ridiculing was positively correlated with internalizing problems for Norwegian boys, but inversely correlated for Sami boys. These findings emphasize the importance of taking the child's cultural context and gender into account when assessing parenting influences on behavioral problems in children.

AB Objective In this study, emotional functioning of adolescent anorexia nervosa patients was compared with two control groups; another internalizing psychiatric outpatient group and a healthy control group. Methods Forty-eight anorexia nervosa patients (AN), 21 other psychiatric outpatients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders (PSYCH) and 48 healthy controls (HC) completed a battery of tasks and questionnaires designed to measure different aspects of emotional functioning. Cognitive (parallel) tasks were administered to control for differences of a cognitive nature. Results The AN and the PSYCH groups had clear deficits in emotional functioning compared to the HC group. Considering the data from the alexithymia questionnaire, it was the AN group who scored significantly worse on emotional functioning when compared to the HC group. Considering the data from the emotional tasks, both psychiatric groups performed worse than the HC group in their processing of visual emotional information and the PSYCH group had more difficulty in memorizing responses to auditory emotional stimuli than the AN and HC group. Furthermore, the PSYCH group processed auditory emotional information more slowly than the HC group. No differences between the three groups were found on the non-emotional, cognitive tasks. Conclusion Both the AN and PSYCH patients show deficits in their processing of emotional information and details are discussed.

AB The Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) is a unique adolescent instrument that attempts to delineate between personality and acute symptoms. This study sought to explore typologies based on the Personality Pattern scales of the MACI in a sample of detained male juvenile offenders (N = 103). A Ward's method cluster analysis yielded a four-cluster solution, and each cluster was provided a clinically relevant label: (a) disruptive, antisocials; (b) agreeable, antisocials; (c) anxious, prosocials; and (d) reactive, depressives. The largest group consisted of the reactive depressives (n = 41). This suggests the importance of considering the role of internalizing problems as a conduit to delinquency in addition to antisocial-personality. No interaction between cluster membership and offense history or race was found.

AB Concerns have been raised about the ability of diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to distinguish subtypes that are clearly distinct from each other with regard to clinical correlates. One area of concern is that research regarding differences in anxiety and depression as a function of ADHD subtype has produced discrepant findings. This study was designed to systematically evaluate whether the ADHD subtypes differ with regard to level of internalizing symptoms. From a large pool of children referred to an ADHD center based in a pediatric hospital, children were differentiated into three groups: ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD/COM); ADHD, Inattentive Type (ADHD/I); and a non-ADHD, comparison group (COMP). Parent- and child-report measures using both dimensional and categorical methods were used to assess internalizing symptoms. The results indicated that children with ADHD/COM and ADHD/I had similar levels of anxiety and depression. Subtype differences related to parent-reported depression were accounted for by group differences in level of externalizing problems. The results were discussed with regard to their implications for refining the criteria used to differentiate children with ADHD into subtypes.

AB We examined 9-month data from the 14-month NIMH Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (the MTA) as a further check on the relative effect of medication (MedMgt) and behavioral treatment (Beh) for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while Beh was still being delivered at greater intensity than at 14-month endpoint, and conversely as a check on the efficacy of the MTA behavioral generalization/maintenance procedures. Intention-to-treat analysis at 9 months showed essentially the same results as at 14 months, after Beh had been completely faded; MedMgt and the combination (Comb) of medication and Beh were significantly superior to Beh and community care (CC) for ADHD and oppositional-defiant (ODD) symptoms, with mixed results for social skills and internalizing symptoms. All treatment-group differences examined as changes in slopes from 9 to 14 months were nonsignificant (we found general improvement for all groups). Slopes from baseline to 9 months correlated highly (r > .74, p < .0001) with slopes from baseline to 14 months for all groups. The time function from baseline to 14 months showed a significant linear, but not quadratic, trend for the main outcome measure (a composite of parent- and teacher-rated ADHD and ODD symptoms) for all groups. Findings suggest that in contrast to the hypothesized deterioration in the relative benefit of Beh between 9 and 14 months (after completion of fading), the MTA Beh generalization and maintenance procedures implemented through 9 months apparently yielded continuing improvement through 14 months, with preservation of the relative position of Beh compared to other treatment strategies.

AB The goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which aggressive-disruptive peers contribute to the development of externalizing and internalizing problems in children, while controlling for children's own behavior. We examined 2 sets of peers: (1) those that the child nominated as friends, and (2) those that nominated the child as a friend. The participants were 236 boys and girls attending 3rd to 5th grade at the beginning of the study, who were followed over a period of 2 years. Results showed that choosing more aggressive peers on the nomination procedure was associated with more externalizing problems and self-reported depressive symptomatology over time. On the other hand, being liked by more aggressive children generally was not associated with elevated externalizing or internalizing problems.

AB This study examines the reliability and validity of a newly developed self-report measure designed to assess children's coping strategies in response to everyday rejection experiences. The Survey for Coping with Rejection Experiences ( SCORE) was administered to 225 children and factor analysis of responses resulted in the conceptually meaningful subscales of active, aggressive, denial, and ruminative coping. A subset of 95 children also completed a battery of self- (depression, social anxiety), parent- (internalizing and externalizing problems), and peer- (social preference, aggression, withdrawal) ratings of socioemotional adjustment. Children's coping strategies were meaningfully associated with adjustment measures, although these associations differed for boys and girls in several instances. Importantly, both aggressive and ruminative coping strategies were positively associated with internalizing problems even after controlling for the effect of children's actual sociometric status. In addition, denial coping emerged as a significant moderator of the relation between status and adjustment.

AB The aim of this study was to examine growth trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems during adolescence. In addition, we also examined factors that might account for individual differences in the level of problem behavior and in the rate of change: Adolescent gender and the quality of the relationships with parents and peers. The sample consisted of 212 adolescents (mean age 13.4 years at the initial assessment) who were assessed at 3 measurement waves with approximately 1-year intervals. The results showed substantial absolute and relative stability in both types of problem behavior, but also significant individual differences in both initial levels of problem behavior and in the rate of change across the 3 measurement occasions. Adolescent gender and the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship predicted the initial level of both externalizing and internalizing problems. The protective effect of the positive quality of the relationship with peers was found for internalizing but not for externalizing problems. No differences appeared between boys and girls in the effect of the quality of interpersonal relations on the level and on the rate of change in problem behavior, suggesting that the etiology of problem behavior might be similar for boys and girls in spite of gender differences in the prevalence of problem behaviors.

AB This study examined (a) associations of progression to daily cigarette smoking with lifetime psychopathology, regular smoking by family members, and psychopathology in family members, (b) the degree to which disorders precede or follow progression to daily smoking, and (c) whether daily smokers differ as a function of nicotine dependence. Among 941 participants interviewed at three time points, 722 (77%) had experimented with cigarette smoking, 391 of whom (54%) progressed to daily smoking. Lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were obtained at each assessment. Biological parents and full siblings were interviewed for lifetime psychopathology and regular smoking. Progression to daily smoking was associated with lower parental education, major depression, alcohol and drug use disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive behavior disorders, antisocial personality disorder symptoms, regular smoking by father (but not mother or sibling), and one measure of psychopathology in family members (externalizing disorders, which consisted of ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and antisocial personality disorder). When composite measures of internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, familial smoking, and familial psychopathology were examined in a single model, only the externalizing disorders composite remained associated with both daily smoking and nicotine dependence. Only ADHD consistently preceded the onset of daily smoking. Nicotine dependence was associated with drug use disorders and alcohol use disorders. In conclusion, externalizing disorders had the strongest associations, both with progression to daily smoking among adolescents who initiate smoking and with nicotine dependence among the daily smokers. Limitations of the present study and future research directions are noted.

AB Independent examination and replication of the core syndrome factor structure of the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA; McDermott, Marston, & Stott, 1993) is reported. A sample of 1,020 children were randomly selected from their classroom and rated on the ASCA by their teacher. The six ASCA core syndromes produced a two-factor solution through principle axis analysis using multiple criteria for the number of factors to extract and retain. Varimax, direct oblimin, and promax rotations produced identical results and nearly identical factor structure coefficients. It was concluded that the ASCA indeed measures two independent dimensions of psychopathology (Overactivity and Underactivity) that are similar to the conduct problems/externalizing and withdrawal/internalizing dimensions commonly found in the child psychopathology assessment literature (Cicchetti Toth, 1991; Quay, 1986).

AB Objective The aim of this study was to compare self-reported emotional and behavioral problems for Turkish immigrant, native Dutch and native Turkish adolescents. Method A total of 379 Turkish immigrant adolescents living in the Netherlands, and 1,039 Dutch adolescents from the general population completed the Dutch translation of the Youth Self-Report (YSR); 2,151 Turkish adolescents from the general population completed the Turkish translation of the YSR; parents of Turkish immigrant adolescents filled in the Turkish translation of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18). Results Turkish immigrant adolescents scored themselves significantly higher than Dutch adolescents on five of the 11 YSR syndromes, most markedly on the Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn and Internalizing scales. Dutch adolescents scored themselves higher than immigrant adolescents on the Somatic Complaints and Delinquent Behavior scales. Turkish immigrant adolescents scored themselves higher than Turkish adolescents on five of the 11 scales, most markedly on the Delinquent Behavior scale. Total problems scores for Turkish immigrant adolescents were higher than for Dutch and Turkish adolescents. Turkish immigrant adolescents scored themselves higher than their parents assessed them on seven of the 11 scales. Conclusion Turkish immigrant adolescents reported more problems in comparison to their Dutch and native Turkish peers. Different patterns of parent-child interaction, family values and delay of Dutch language skills are considered to be responsible for these differences in scores.

AB Treatment of conduct disordered children and adolescents in a clinical setting. How effective are they?
   Objective: Anti-social behavior in childhood and adolescence represents a frequent behavior disorder in this age group and its prognosis is predominantly unfavourable. The purpose of this study was to analyze the out-come and predictors of outpatients and inpatients with conduct disorders and internalizing disorders.
   Methods: We compared a 10 year follow-up history of in- and outpatients with conduct disorders and internalizing disorders. The sample of patients with conduct disorders was divided into three groups (<<1>>: F90.1; <<E>>: F91.2, F92; <<D>>: F91.1, F91.3). The outcome was defined as an improvement of psychosocial functioning (SGKJ). Statistical analysis consisted of Fisher exact test and logistical regression.
   Results: Our findings showed the best results in patients with the ICD 10 diagnosis F90.1. Inpatient treatment was superior to outpatient treatment. Cooperation of parents and children, severeness of disease, psychosocial risk factors and pharmacotherapy were found to be the most important predictors.
   Conclusions: Effectiveness of an outpatient treatment of children and adolescents with conduct disorders can be increased by training of parents, home treatment or pharmacotherapy.

AB The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which direct and indirect bullying and victimization at school affects the mental and physical health of 661 Italian boys and girls, aged 11 to 15 years old. The impact of bullying and victimization is assessed by taking into account the relative buffering effect of a positive relationship with one or both parents. Internalizing symptoms such as withdrawn behaviors, somatic complaints, and anxiety and depression, measured with the self-administered Youth Form of the Achenbach's Child Behavioral Checklist, are indicators of maladjustment. Multiple regression analyses revealed that being a girl is a strong significant risk factor for all internalizing symptoms. Being a victim of indirect bullying is the strongest predictor of withdrawn behaviors, somatic complaints, and anxiety/depression, independent of direct victimization, which significantly predicts somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression, but not withdrawn behaviors. Bullying others directly by hitting, threatening, or calling names is not a significant predictor the poor mental and somatic health of youngsters, whereas indirect bullying (spreading rumors or not talking to someone on purpose) does significantly predict anxiety and depression, as well as withdrawn behaviors. The negative impact of victimization and bullying is buffered by youngsters' positive relationship with one or both parents. Recommendations are provided with regard to possible intervention strategies underlying the importance of distinguishing between different forms of bullying and victimization and providing social support in each different case.

AB Psychosocial research on adolescent drinking includes studies of personality and the impact of particular personality traits on drinking risk, expectancies (that is, the effects someone expects after drinking alcohol), and cognitive development. Although studies involving adolescents have not identified specific sets of personality traits that uniquely predict alcohol use, some traits have been shown to be associated with heavy alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. These traits include disinhibition or poor self-regulation, impulsiveness and aggression, novelty-seeking, and negative affectivity. Externalizing behaviors in childhood and early adolescence have been found to predict alcohol use disorders in early adulthood, as have certain internalizing behaviors. This article examines the theories and psychosocial processes thought to underlie underage drinking.

AB This article examines the prevalence and prediction of internalising and externalising disorders from temperament and parenting in children aged 4 to 6 years (N = 491). Children were assessed via parent and teacher reports over 14 months and clinical interviews with parents were included at follow-up, along with parent and teacher reports of behavioural and emotional difficulties. Prevalence rates for internalising disorders (8.7%) were higher than for externalising disorders (5.8%), and internalising rates were similar to that found for older children in the same city. Accuracy of prediction of disorders, as well as overall behavioural and emotional difficulties, was low to moderate, and externalising problems were better predicted than internalising problems. The results highlight that while psychological disorders can be predicted from measures of temperament in infancy, the accuracy is too low to recommend these children receive selective prevention and treatment programs.

AB The unique relations of effortful control and impulsivity to resiliency and adjustment were examined when children were 4.5 to 8 years old, and 2 years later. Parents and teachers reported on all constructs and children's attentional persistence was observed. In concurrent structural equation models, effortful control and impulsivity uniquely and directly predicted resiliency and externalizing problems and indirectly predicted internalizing problems (through resiliency). Teacher-reported anger moderated the relations of effortful control and impulsivity to externalizing problems. In the longitudinal model, all relations held at T2 except for the path from impulsivity to externalizing problems. Evidence of bidirectional effects also was obtained. The results indicate that effortful control and impulsivity are distinct constructs with some unique prediction of resiliency and adjustment.

AB The present study addressed two specific questions: (1) Are there differences in parenting behaviors between anxious and non-anxious mothers'? and (2) Are parenting behaviors within these two groups associated with adverse outcomes in children (i.e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms)? The above questions were examined concurrently (when children were in first grade) and at a six-year follow-up among a predominately African American community-based high-risk sample. Twenty-five anxious and matched non-anxious (N = 50) mothers were videotaped with their children (mean age 5.8 years) engaging in a challenging task. Blind raters coded parent behaviors. Parents and children completed measures of anxiety and/or externalizing symptoms at both time points. Contrary to expectations, results indicated no group differences in parenting behaviors in the first grade and no relation between parenting behaviors and concurrent levels of anxiety or externalizing symptoms. At the six-year follow-up, however, higher levels of criticism and lower levels of granting of autonomy were significantly related to higher anxiety (but not externalizing) symptoms in children of anxious parents. Findings are discussed in the context of existing developmental models of childhood anxiety and suggest that the interaction of parental anxiety and parenting behavior may increase children's risk for anxiety disorders.

AB We examined anxiety symptoms, anxiety-related impairment, and further treatment in adolescents who received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for childhood anxiety disorders 6-7 years previously. Forty-three adolescents and their parents (14 boys, 29 girls; mean age 16.7 years) participated in structured telephone interviews. Participants (68% of initial sample of 63) did not differ in age, diagnostic profile, socioeconomic status, or initial severity from nonparticipants but more girls than boys participated. Indices based on child- and parent-reported symptoms and impairment were calculated, and within-sample comparisons by age, gender, diagnosis, and initial severity were done using t tests. Predictors of symptoms and impairment were also examined. On average, adolescents reported modest levels of anxiety-related impairment. Further treatment for anxiety had occurred in 30% (13 of 43) of patients. Stepwise regressions found female gender and diagnosis other than generalized anxiety disorder predictive of increased symptoms by parent report, and initial severity predicted adolescent-reported impairment. Adolescents showed limited internalizing symptomatology and impairment but almost one third had required further treatment. Studies comparing treated and untreated samples are needed to clarify whether CBT alters the natural history of childhood anxiety disorders and to replicate our findings regarding predictors of symptomatology and impairment.

AB The relations of children's nonsocial behavior to their emotionality, regulation, and social functioning were examined in a short-term longitudinal study. Parent's (primarily mothers) and teachers rated children's effortful regulation, emotionality, asocial behaviors, problem behaviors, and social acceptance, and children's nonsocial play behaviors were observed for two semesters. Peers also rated likability. Children's observed reticent activities were related to adults' ratings of high regulation, low externalizing problems, and high asocial behavior, as well as to low anger and low positive emotion. On the other hand, solitary play was associated with low positive emotion and low regulation over time and with high asocial behavior and high peer exclusion. Peer rejection mediated the relation of internalizing emotions (anxiety, low positive emotion) and regulation,to solitary play later in the school year, and asocial play mediated the relation of internalizing emotions to both solitary and reticent play behavior.

AB In this study, the concept of 'goodness-of-fit' between the child's temperament and the environment, introduced by Thomas and Chess [Temperament and Development, Brunner/Mazel, New York, 1977], is applied within the setting of center day care. Mothers and primary professional caregivers of 186 children, aged 6-30 months, participated in this study. The child's problem behaviors were assessed with the CBCL Teacher Report Form [Achenbach, T.M., Guide for the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for Ages 2-5, Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, 1997]. The child's socio-emotional well-being in day care was measured with the Leiden Inventory for the Child's Well-Being in Day Care. The Infant Characteristics Questionnaire measured the child's temperament. Children with an easier temperament showed less internalizing and total problem behavior and more well-being. The results suggest that for children with a more difficult temperament, several parallel care arrangements interfere with the process of adapting to the day care setting. Also, our results indicate that in the group of children with greater availability of trusted caregivers, a more easy-going temperament was associated with more well-being. The association between temperament and well-being was not found in the group of children with less access to trusted caregivers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined links among parents' attachment orientations, depressive symptoms, and conflict behaviors (attacking and compromising) and children's extemalizing and internalizing behavior problems in a sample of 64 nonclinical, Caucasian families. Correlational analyses showed that all three parent attributes were significantly related to children's behavior problems. When a regression-based approach recommended by Baron and Kenny [The moderator-mediator distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical contributions, J. Personal. Social Psychol. 51 (1986) 1173-1182] was applied to the data, some indirect pathways between parents' attachment orientations and children's behavior problems were found. Results indicated that mothers' depressive symptoms mediated the relation between mothers' attachment anxiety and children's internalizing behaviors, whereas fathers' depressive symptoms partially mediated the relation between fathers' attachment anxiety and children's internalizing behaviors. Findings provide support for the idea that attachment theory [J. Bowlby, The making and breaking of affectional bonds, Br. J. Psychiatry 130 (1977) 201-210] is useful for understanding the role of parents' intimate relationships and depressive symptoms in their children's behavioral adjustment and highlight the importance of addressing mothers' and fathers' attributes separately.

AB In a number of recent studies on personality in childhood and adolescence, comparable personality types have been distinguished. The three types that are repeatedly found can be labelled as: resilient, overcontrolled, and undercontrolled. Using data from a short-term longitudinal study of 569 adolescents, we investigated the transactions between type membership and perceived family and peer support and coercion in predicting problem behaviour, and the concomitants of stability and change in type membership. Resilients report the most perceived support from family members and from friends and the lowest parental coercion. Overcontrollers and undercontrollers report similarly low levels of support and undercontrollers report the highest amount of parental coercion. The types also differ in their psychosocial functioning, with overcontrollers and undercontrollers showing more internalizing and social problems and undercontrollers additionally showing more externalizing problems. Interactions between type and support in predicting the level of problem behaviour were found; support seemed more relevant for overcontrollers, and coercion more for resilients and undercontrollers. Type membership was moderately stable over a period of three years, a stability that in several instances seems to be related to perceived relational support and to problem behaviour.

AB The aims of this study were the Italian standardization of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18) and the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), the analysis of the internal consistency of the two instruments, and the evaluation of the agreement between parents' and teachers' ratings. A group of 1423 parents and 1464 teachers of children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years, from three different provinces of Northern Italy, were randomly recruited. Boys scored higher than girls on the Externalizing scales on both CBCL and TRF, while there were no significant differences between the two sexes on the Internalizing scales. In general, internalizing problems increased with age, whereas externalizing behaviors decreased, mainly through a reduction of aggressive problems in older subjects. For most scales, low socioeconomic status was associated with high problem scores. Most scales of the CBCL and the TRF showed a satisfactory internal consistency, with higher alpha coefficients for overt behaviors. A low - to - moderate parents' and teachers' agreement was found, with the higher correlation found for the Attention Problems scale. Overall, the figures of this first standardization are in line with the results of most studies carried out in Western and Eastern countries, evidencing a good applicability of Achenbach's instruments in Italy.

AB In this study, with an epidemiologic sample of national scope, we seek confirmatory evidence about specific mental health problems of adolescent children living with actively alcohol dependent parents (AD+ children) as compared to control children whose parents are not alcohol dependent (AD- children). Treatment sample research leads us to expect the most prominent AD+/AD- differences with respect to externalizing symptoms. Data for this study were from the 1995 and 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), with the sample and field research staff 'blinded' to the study's hypothesis. Within the NHSDA national sample, a total of 1,720 parent-child pairs living in the same household were assessed. Youths were asked to complete an adapted version of Achenbach's Youth Self-Report. Independently, the parent was asked about his or her alcohol problems using an adapted version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed the AD+ children (n = 79) to have higher delinquency (p < .001) and aggressive behavior scores (p < .05) as compared to AD- children (n = 1,650). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MAN COVA), with five sociodemographic characteristics as covariates, confirmed the presence of independent delinquency excesses (but not independent aggressive behavior excesses) among children living with a parent with alcohol problems (F = 9.23, df = 1, 1659, p < .01). The evidence of this study favors the hypothesis that adolescent children living with an alcohol dependent parent have more delinquency problems than other adolescents. We did not find similar patterns of association for the internalizing symptoms, nor for aggression, once delinquency was held constant. (C) 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as completed by doctoral-level clinicians in the treatment of adolescents. We asked 294 randomly selected, experienced psychiatrists and psychologists to describe a patient aged 14 to 18 in treatment for personality pathology. Clinicians completed the CBCL (parent-report version) and measures of adaptive functioning, personality pathology, and family and developmental history, which served as criterion variables to test the validity of the CBCL as completed by clinicians. Most CBCL scales demonstrated acceptable reliability. Validity estimates were impressive, and the data revealed clinically meaningful associations between specific CBCL scale scores and developmental and family history variables. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factorial structure of the clinician-report CBCL resembled that of the parent-report CBCL, with the exception of a substantially lower correlation between higher order internalizing and externalizing factors. The data suggest that clinical judgment can be both reliable and valid when quantified using psychometrically sound instruments. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study investigated to what extent abuse-related symptoms and family functioning are related to intra- or extrafamilial sexual abuse. One hundred adolescents (12 to 18 years old) were recruited shortly after disclosure of the abuse. Information from the participants was obtained through self-report questionnaires and a semistructured interview. Fifty-three percent of the adolescents reported clinically significant symptoms. Data did not support the idea that intrafamilial sexually abused adolescents report more symptoms than extrafamilial sexually abused adolescents. Type of abuse did not account for the differences and variety of reported symptoms or for differences in family functioning. Family functioning-in particular lack of cohesion was an independent contributor to internalizing trauma-related problems.

AB Objective To examine the associations among disease status, social competence, and depressive symptoms in children with juvenile rheumatic disease (JRD) and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in children's social competence account for a significant proportion of variance in depressive symptoms after controlling for disease status variables. Method Thirty-six children with JRD completed standardized instruments to assess pain, health status, and depressive symptoms. The rheumatologist completed a disease severity measure, and teachers provided ratings of peer rejection and social behavior. Results Pain, peer rejection, and problematic social behavior were all positively associated with depressive symptoms. Social variables remained significantly associated with depressive symptoms after controlling for level of pain. In addition, peer rejection moderated the association between pain and depressive symptoms, such that children with high levels of pain and high levels of peer rejection reported the highest frequency of depressive symptoms. Conclusions Health care providers should assess the social functioning of children with JRD in order to identify socially vulnerable children who may be at increased risk for internalizing problems.

AB This study investigated the role of parent-adolescent relationships in mediating the association between family-related negative life events and adolescent depressive symptoms and problem behaviors among 1,696 eleventh graders from the United States (n = 201), China (n = 502), Korea (n = 497), and Czech Republic (n = 496). Results indicated that perceived parental involvement and parent-adolescent conflict mediated the link between family-related life events and adolescent depressed mood. The path from family-related life events to adolescent problem behaviors was mediated by perceived parental involvement, parent-adolescent conflict, and perceived parental sanctions of adolescent misconduct. With the exception of minor cross-cultural differences in the magnitude of associations among variables, this study revealed considerable similarity in the association of family factors with adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. The findings contribute to the growing literature on culture-general developmental processes.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among incarcerated male adolescents and to investigate the influence of psychopathology on allocation to either plain detention or detention with compulsory treatment. Method: A cross-sectional study of a representative sample (N = 204) of incarcerated boys aged 12 to 18, using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). Data were collected from December 1998 to December 1999. Results: Of the eligible subjects, 79% agreed to participate. Ninety percent reported at least one psychiatric disorder: disruptive behavior disorder 75% (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 68-81%), substance use disorder 55% (95% Cl: 48-63%), psychotic symptoms 34% (95% Cl: 27-41%), ADHD 8% (95% Cl: 5-13%), anxiety disorder 9% (95% Cl: 6-15%), and affective disorder 6% (95% Cl: 3-10%). After controlling for a broad range of sociodemographic characteristics and former treatment parameters, the presence of a psychiatric disorder was not associated with allocation to compulsory treatment. Conclusions: Compared with North American studies, relatively low rates of anxiety and affective disorders were found, probably due to the better availability of mental health services to disadvantaged youths with internalizing problems in the Netherlands. It should be examined whether standardized psychiatric assessments can improve the efficiency of allocation to detention programs with or without psychiatric treatment options.

AB The study concentrated on rural, adolescents experiencing persistent economic adversity. It was based on a data set of 245 rural adolescents (12 to 16 years) and their mothers, drawn from persistently poor but intact families of Ludhiana district. Teachers were also contacted for knowing about child's adjustment at school. Results indicated that despite economic adversity and the presence of other risk conditions, majority of the adolescents were found to be performing within normal status of mental health without any manifest conduct disorders. More vulnerability was found towards manifestation of externalizing syndrome as compared to internalizing syndrome. Male adolescents were more vulnerable towards behaviour problems than females. The dominant problem in males was delinquency, followed by aggressive behaviour and social problems. The governing problem in girls was found to be anxiety and depression followed by social problems and aggression.

AB Objective: To identify the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing conditions in referred anorexic adolescents. Method: Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR) were used to assess psychopathology: ( a) in the global sample ( 43 adolescents); (b) in different subtypes of anorexia; ( c) considering the timing of admission after the onset of the disease. Results: A high percentage of patients were found in the internalizing clinical range both at CBCL and YSR. Higher mean values were found in full syndromes both at CBCL and YSR, and in the binge-eating subtype only at the YSR. Subjects arrived within the first year of illness showed a less severe psychopathology. Conclusions: Adolescents with anorexia have high rates of internalizing psychopathology. The less severe psychopathology in adolescents arrived within the first year of illness shed light on discontinuity between anorexia and internalizing condition. On the basis of the psychopathological severity, three types of adolescent anorexia are proposed which could be of interest for therapeutic decisions. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB This paper critically reviews the literature on the links between temperament and social development in children and adolescents. Social development is broadly defined to include externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, prosocial behaviour and social competence. It concludes that there are clear links between specific dimensions of temperament and particular aspects of social development. Examples include the association of negative reactivity with externalizing behaviour problems, inhibition with internalizing behaviour problems, and attention regulation with school functioning. Theoretical and methodological issues to be confronted in future research are identified, including the need to investigate further the interactions between temperament and social context. Analysis of patterns of change in temperament, in relation to physiological changes and to such factors as parenting and socio-cultural expectations of children, promise to refine our understanding of how temperament works in context. Some practical implications which can be drawn from the research are also discussed.

AB Mediator models were examined in which children's emotional reactions to peer aggression were hypothesized to mediate their selection of coping strategies and subsequent peer victimization and internalizing problems. Self-report data were collected from 145 ethnically diverse kindergarten through fifth grade children (66 females and 79 males) who attended a predominantly low- to middle-class school. Hypothetical scenarios were used to assess children's anticipated responses to peer aggression. Victims reported more intense negative emotions (e.g., fear and anger) than did nonvictims. Fear emerged as a predictor of advice seeking which, in turn, predicted conflict resolution and fewer internalizing problems. Conflict resolution was associated with reductions in victimization. Anger and embarrassment predicted revenge seeking which, in turn, was associated with increases in victimization. Additional pathways predicting changes in peer victimization across a single academic year as a function of children's emotional and coping responses to peer abuse are discussed.

AB Mothers and primary professional caregivers of 186 children, aged 6-30 months, participated in this study in which a new measure for daily stability in center day care was developed, describing staffing, grouping, and program features. Relative contributions of infants' daily experiences of care stability, quality of care, and mother's daily stress to the child's adjustment to day care were analyzed with hierarchical regressions. The child's adjustment was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1997) and with the Leiden Inventory for the Child's Well-being in Day Care. Children enrolled in fewer care arrangements showed less internalizing behavior and more well-being in the day care setting. Children had higher well-being scores when trusted caregivers were more available. Mother's family management stress was related to more internalizing problem behavior. Interactions between mother's daily stress and stability in care were found to affect the child's adjustment to day care.

   MACAQUES
AB Inequalities in human social groups contribute in important ways to the initiation and perpetuation of violence. Because both social inequalities and interpersonal aggression emerge in early life, it is important to study their developmental origins in the collective and individual behavior of young children. As young as 2 years of age, children assemble stable, linearly transitive dominance hierarchies when brought together in novel social groups. Just as the consequences of socioeconomic status may be due in part to experiences of social ordering per se, subjective childhood experiences of occupying a lesser or greater position on a scale of social influence may similarly affect health, safety, and behavior in early development. Children's experiences with social ordering may represent a first, formative encounter with the hierarchical social relations that affect health and susceptibility to violence over the human lifespan. We have studied the health correlates of group stressors, dominance positions, and biobehavioral reactivity within cohorts of preschool children and semi free-ranging rhesus macaques. Social position is ascertained using naturalistic observations of critical dyadic events, and stress-reactivity is measured using assessments of behavioral and biological responses to standardized challenges. Outcome measures, including indicators of mental and physical health and interpersonal injuries, have been assessed-in the case of children-with parent- and teacher-report questionnaires, child self-report protocols, and frequent, objective physical examinations of the child and-in the case of rhesus monkeys-with daily observations of violence-related injuries. Results to date have suggested the following provisional conclusions: (1) Children and monkeys form stable, linearly transitive social hierarchies in which identifiable subgroups of individuals occupy dominant and subordinate social positions. (2) Individuals occupying subordinate positions within the social group show exaggerated adrenocortical and/or autonomic reactivity to challenge and disproportionate rates of chronic medical conditions or violent injuries. (3) Stress-reactivity, naturally occurring stressors, and social position are interactively predictive of rates of morbidity. Monkeys who displayed high biobehavioral reactivity sustained disproportionate numbers of violent injuries during a confinement stressor. Children who were high in the dominance hierarchy and low in reactivity showed significantly higher rates of externalizing mental health symptoms, while those who were in subordinate social positions and high in reactivity showed higher prevalences of internalizing symptoms. In conclusion, the prevention of youth violence and other forms of early disorder-will require a deeper, developmental understanding of the "headwaters" of aggression and victimization in early childhood and a stronger accounting of how early social inequalities set trajectories toward healthy or disordered behavior.

AB The concept of inhibition is central in the explanation of an array of psychopathological disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, aggressive behavior and anxiety. But despite the importance and the widespread use of the inhibition concept, there is no widely accepted definition. Due to the multitude empirical results, there is a necessity for a differentiated problem solving and classification. With regard to the classification by Nigg (2000), this article gives an overview over different kinds of inhibition and their meaning for internalizing and externalizing disorders. Therefore we present two heuristic models, which integrate different kinds of inhibition, and describe the dysfunctional inhibitory process in individuals with externalizing and internalizing disorders.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY

AB Objective: The goal of this study was to predict the onset of mood and anxiety disorders from parent-reported emotional and behavioral problems in childhood across a 14-year period from childhood into young adulthood.
   Method: In 1983, parent reports of behavioral and emotional problems were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist for children and adolescents 4-16 years of age from the Dutch general population. At follow-up 14 years later, lifetime mood and anxiety diagnoses were obtained by a standardized DSM-IV interview for 1,580 subjects. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict the incidence of mood and anxiety disorders from childhood problems and demographic covariates.
   Results: Mood disorders were significantly predicted by high scores on the anxious/depressed scale and on the internalizing composite (withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed). Anxiety disorders were significantly predicted by the social problems scale and the externalizing composite (delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior). Anxiety disorders predominantly started in childhood and early adolescence, whereas the incidence of mood disorders increased sharply in adolescence and young adulthood.
   Conclusions: These results suggest different developmental pathways for mood and anxiety disorders. The predictions based on problem behavior remained stable during the 14-year period across adolescence and young adulthood. The results therefore underline the importance of early intervention and prevention of behavioral and emotional problems in childhood.

AB Objective: The identification of predictors of major depression in the transition to adulthood has direct application to prevention and intervention efforts designed to forestall depression in this high-risk period. The current study identified childhood and adolescent familial and behavioral-emotional factors predicting depression during this critical developmental stage.
   Method: The 354 participants were part of a single-age cohort from a predominately Caucasian working-class community whose psychosocial development has been traced prospectively since age 5. In these analyses, data collected during childhood and adolescence were related to diagnoses of major depression at ages 18-26.
   Results: During the transition to adulthood, 82 participants (23.2%) experienced major depression. Bivariate indicators of later depression included a family history of depression or substance use disorders, family composition, and childhood family environments perceived as violent and lacking cohesiveness. Also significant were self-and mother-reported internalizing behaviors, as well as self-rated anxiety and depressive symptoms. Multivariable analyses showed family violence, family composition, internalizing problems during adolescence, and low family cohesion to be the most salient factors.
   Conclusions: These results highlight familial and behavioral-emotional predictors of depression that can serve as foci for identifying youth in need of intervention.

ID POSTNATAL DEPRESSION; ATTACHMENT; ADJUSTMENT; DIAGNOSIS; SYMPTOMS
AB Objective: The relationship between maternal attitude to the infant at 6 months of age and behavioural outcomes at 5 years is explored, controlling for numerous demographic, child and psychosocial family factors.
   Method: Data was used from the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy, an Australian longitudinal study of over 7000 mothers and children followed from pregnancy to when the children were 5 years. Measures ranging from the key variables of maternal attitude and child behaviour as well as numerous confounders were dichotomised. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between maternal negative attitude toward the infant and clinically significant levels of child behaviour problems and other infant risks, early social risks, and concurrent social risks.
   Results: The results suggest that maternal negative attitude towards the infant at 6 months is an independent predictor of child behaviour problems at 5 years. This association remained significant for boys' externalizing behaviours and girls' internalizing behaviours.
   Conclusions: The findings lend support to the concept of a sensitive period in early infancy; the need for a broad perspective in the assessment of the mother-infant relationship and the need for early intervention with dysfunctional mother-infant dyads.

ID PERFORMANCE; PSYCHOLOGY; DISORDER
AB Concurrent and 2-year longitudinal relations were investigated between two indicators of children's (n=60; mean age=7 years 11 months) executive function, inhibitory control and sequencing ability, and behavior problem symptomatology. Dependent measures were parent and teacher reported internalizing and externalizing behavior. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated few significant concurrent associations between either inhibitory control or sequencing ability, and behavior problem symptoms. In contrast, baseline inhibitory control predicted decreased teacher reported externalizing, and parent reported externalizing and internalizing behavior problems over a 2-year period. Baseline sequencing ability also predicted decreased teacher reported externalizing and parent reported internalizing behavior over this same time period. Results suggest that some aspects of executive function in early elementary grade-school children may be more strongly associated with change in behavior over time than concurrent behavior. Implications of these findings for the prevention of behavior problems are discussed.

AB This review provides an overview of research on the influence of personality on the development course, and behavioral expression of posttraumatic stress disorder (FTSD). The existing literature is discussed in relation to three broad-band personality traits that have been emphasized in personality and psychopathology research: negative emotionality (NEM), positive emotionality (PEM), and constraint/inhibition (CON). The primary conclusion derived from this review is that high NEM is the primary personality risk factor for the development of PTSD whereas low CON and low PEM serve as moderating factors that influence the form and expression of the disorder through their interaction with NEM. From this standpoint, a premorbid personality characterized by high NEM combined with low PEM is thought to predispose the trauma-exposed individual towards an internalizing form of posttraumatic response characterized by marked social avoidance, anxiety, and depression. On the other hand, high NEM combined with low CON is hypothesized to predict an externalizing form of posttraumatic reaction characterized by marked impulsivity, aggression, and a propensity towards antisociality and substance abuse.

AB Previous research suggests an association between partner violence and child behavior problems. However, methodological shortcomings have precluded the formation of directional conclusions. These limitations include failure to control for the effects of child physical abuse and general life stress, employment of nonrepresentative samples from battered women's shelters, and reliance on a single contemporaneous reporter, usually the mother, for information on both independent and dependent measures. This study used prospective, longitudinal data (N = 155) and multiple informants to examine the relation between maternal reports of partner violence in the home and teacher- and youth-report ratings of concurrent and prospective child behavior problems. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to control for the effects of child physical abuse, child physical neglect, socioeconomic status, child cognitive ability, and life stress. The contribution of partner violence to child behavior problems was confirmed for boys' (n = 81) externalizing problems and girls' (n = 74) internalizing problems. Child developmental status at the time of exposure further influenced these relations. For boys, behavior problems in middle childhood were most strongly related to contemporaneous partner violence, whereas behavior problems among both boys and girls at age 16 were most strongly related to partner violence exposure during the preschool years.

ID RELIABILITY; DIAGNOSES; INTERVIEW
AB We conducted a longitudinal study of young children with clinical, subclinical, or nonclinical levels of separation anxiety to evaluate the diagnostic stability and concomitant parent and family variables of separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Youngsters were assessed at age 3 years (n = 60) and 3.5 years later (n = 44). Data were collected front children, parents, teachers, and clinicians. Results revealed that most diagnoses of SAD were not stable during this developmental period, as many children drifted toward subclinical or nonclinical status. In addition, children with clinical SAD, compared to those with subclinical SAD or no symptoms of SAD, had a disproportionately higher number of comorbid diagnoses and experienced significantly greater somatic concerns, anxiety, and general internalizing behavior In addition, their parents experienced greater depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior phobic anxiety, and general distress. The results preliminarily support prior findings that most children experience a dissipation of SAD symptoms in young childhood but that some children continue to experience stable, significant distress. The results are consistent with prior research on older children that SAD remits for many but not all youth and suggest that parent and family variables may have much to do with cases of poor remission in this population.

AB Drawing on a normative sample of 224 youth and their biological mothers, this study tested 4 family variables as potential mediators of the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms in early childhood and child psychological outcomes in preadolescence. The mediators examined included mother-child communication, the quality of the mother-child relationship, maternal social support, and stressful life events in the family. The most parsimonious structural equation model suggested that having a more problematic mother-child relationship mediated disruptive behavior-disordered outcomes for youths, whereas less maternal social support mediated the development of internalizing disorders. Gender and race were tested as moderators, but significant model differences did not emerge between boys and girls or between African American and Caucasian youths.

AB The effects of maternal (bias), child (age, severity of behavior problems), and measurement characteristics (similarity of parent and child measures; types of internalizing symptoms) on mother-child agreement on reports of children's internalizing symptoms were examined for 65 children referred for evaluation of ADHD. Agreement was low and did not improve when parents and children completed parallel measures. Mothers and children were more likely to agree on severity of internalizing symptoms rated as behavioral than those rated as ideational. The majority of discordant reports were of the type that mothers, but not children, reported clinically elevated symptoms. This type of discordance appeared to be a function of maternal negative bias rather than underreporting of symptoms by children.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between maternal depression, parent-child relations, and resilient outcomes in the context of risk in a cross-sectional study of 816 15-year-olds in Australia. Method: Resilient outcomes were defined as the following: no current Axis I diagnosis, no history of depressive disorder diagnoses, no current internalizing problems, and no indication of current social functioning difficulties. Parent-child relationship qualities were measured using the Five-Minute Speech Sample, the Children's Report of Parent Behavior Inventory, and a child report questionnaire concerning perceived maternal warmth and hostility. The role of the father's psychiatric status in resilient outcomes was also assessed. Results: Results revealed that low levels of parental psychological control, high levels of maternal warmth, and low levels of maternal overinvolvement all interacted with maternal depression to predict resilient outcomes in youth. Conclusions: Targeting maternal and paternal parenting qualities may be a useful method of increasing the likelihood of resilient outcomes in children of depressed mothers.

AB 30 patients (23 m/7 f) with untreated, isolated sagittal craniosynostosis (ISC) were re-evaluated at an average age of 9.25 years (2.5 - 25.5). Assessed were neurological status, head shape, school performance, behaviour (with Child Behavior Checklist CBCL), quality of life (TACQOL questionnaire), and a detailed neuropsychological testing (30 patients, 17 siblings as controls). Almost all patients/parents were pleased with the current situation. The aesthetic appearance seemed less obvious compared to photos in infancy. Psychological adjustment as measured by the CBCL was well within normal range. There was a slight tendency for increased internalizing symptoms. TACQOL revealed a lower score for positive emotions. Total score and subscores of test batteries assessing general intellectual performance were in the average range. 6 patients had below average scores in subtests for learning and memory. 12 children had below average scores in one or more subtests for attention. These "deficits" were obviously not of functional importance as all children attended regular school classes (1 exception, an immigrant child of low socio-economic status). These reassuring results regarding school performances, behaviour, and quality of life as well as aesthetic outcome may be helpful when discussing the indication for surgical correction of ISC.

TI Regulation of emotional security by children after entry to special and
   regular kindergarten classes
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL ADJUSTMENT; PRESCHOOL; BEHAVIOR; INHIBITION; ANGER
AB In this paper early adaptation after children's entry to kindergarten is conceptualized as a process of achieving emotional security. It was hypothesized that children adapt to school by means of security seeking from the teacher and behavioral inhibition. 30 normal children from regular classes and 36 children with a variety of problems, e.g., behavioral, emotional, and family problems, from special classes were rated by their teachers on the Inhibition Scale and Security Seeking Scale on 5 occasions during the first 3 mo. at school. By the end of this period teachers judged the intensity of behavior problems on the Internalizing Problem Scale and the Externalizing Problem Scale. Analysis showed that initial high scores on the Security Seeking Scale and Inhibition Scale decreased sharply during the first weeks, and that children from special classes scored consistently higher on the Security Seeking Scale and more variable on the Inhibition Scale than children from regular classes. Girls had higher scores than boys on both scales. Recent stress in the family as rated by the teacher was positively related to both scores on the Inhibition and Security Seeking Scales after entry. Finally, scores on the Security Seeking and Inhibition Scales over the first three months predicted scores on the Internalizing Problem Scale by the end of this period, especially for children in special classes. We conclude that understanding adaptation after school entry as a process of obtaining emotional security is productive, providing a means to link entry behavior to precursors and consequences.

   BEHAVIOR; ISSUES
AB The coping strategies employed in response to different types of bullying, by 305 Danish children (142 boys, 163 girls) in school years four to nine (aged 10-15 years), were investigated. Children were classed into four bully-victim status types. A revised version of the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire was used for the classification of children, and a Self-Report Coping Measure for the investigation of coping strategies. The coping strategy of Externalizing was used significantly more by children classed as bully/victims compared with victims and not involved children; Seeking Social Support and Internalizing were preferred significantly more by girls, whereas Externalizing was preferred significantly more by boys; Distancing, Seeking Social Support, and Internalizing were favored significantly more by children in years four to six compared with children in years seven to nine. Looking at coping strategies in response to different types of bullying, Seeking Social Support was used significantly more in response to attack on property relative to verbal bullying, social exclusion, and indirect bullying, and Distancing was used significantly less in response to attack on property compared with any of the other types of bullying. The results are discussed in relation to implications for educational practice.

TI Making personal sense - An account of basic internalization and
   externalization processes
SO THEORY & PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SELF
AB This paper presents an account of basic internalization/externalization processes as the vehicle by which socio-cultural meanings are turned into personal sense systems. Such systems guide persons' actions in respect to their environments. Social and personal worlds constantly mutually constrain each other in ways that lead to transformations in both. Internalization and reciprocal externalization occur as the person takes in and transforms social messages and other signs in self-talk (dialogues with oneself and imagined others). The theoretical account is accompanied by the specifications of empirical criteria for observing personal dialogues, and an empirical example is provided and analyzed in terms of the unfolding of the personal sense system in a task environment. The data of dialogues between police officers and a computer program about adolescent shoplifting reveal how these respondents transformed the computer input through their internalizing/externalizing operations, by interpolating specialized knowledge and personal beliefs, taking up prior expressions, and going beyond the social material that was given in the task. This account of internalization/externalization extends sociogenetic approaches to explain how the human mind functions as both a social and a personal organized system.

SO TWIN RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILD; DISINHIBITION; DISORDERS; ANXIETY
AB We investigated the etiology of six problem behaviors that might facilitate an understanding of behavioral pathways to substance use and abuse in adolescents. These behavioral measures, classified as Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity, School Problems, Low Self-esteem, Neuroticism, and Social Withdrawal were the result of a previously reported (Siewert et al., 2003) modification of the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI; Tartar, 1990; Tarter & Hegedus, 1991). We developed these measures as interpretable components of risk for substance use and abuse in a community based sample of 633 twin pairs, who were under the legal drinking age of 21 (mean age = 15.0 years). Using multivariate analyses, model comparisons indicated that these six behavioral measures could be thought of as two heritable, and genetically distinct, dimensions of problem behavior. Two closely competing models resulted from our analyses. The best fitting model hypothesized a general genetic factor loading on all 6 behavioral measures with a second genetic factor loading on only the three internalizing behavioral measures with loadings of 0.25-0.59 and 0.26-0.44, respectively. A second model, which fit the data almost as well, hypothesized one genetic factor loading only on the externalizing behavioral measures, and a second genetic factor loading only on the internalizing behavioral measures, with a correlation between the two latent factors of 0.75. Because our analyses show that there are two genetically distinct factors influencing these six problem behaviors, we anticipate that there may be different patterns of relationship of these factors to risk for substance use, abuse, and dependence.

AB Aims: This paper describes a new stage in the ongoing evaluation of the original families of sons of alcoholics and controls where we now focus on the relationships among relevant domains of functioning in their young sons and daughters. Methods: The data were gathered from the 15-year follow-up of the families of the original probands (the fathers of these offspring) who had been selected from among students and non-academic staff at a university at approximately age 20. At the 15-year evaluation of these families. a structured interview and the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) questionnaire were administered to a parent, usually the mother. of 145 offspring age seven through 17. The eight domains evaluated here included the extended family histories of alcohol use disorders, parental alcoholism, independent mood or anxiety disorders in the grandparents and parents, the history of potential brain insults early in life, the absence of a biological parent in the home, and scores for internalizing symptoms, with externalizing symptoms as the dependent variable. Results: Correlations among the domains were all in the predicted direction, a structural equation model revealed empirical results with an R-2 of 0.26, and there were high goodness of fit characteristics for hypothesized and empirical models. The results were similar for boys and girls and older versus younger offspring. Conclusions: An understanding of the relationships among characteristics in the offspring of the original probands offers the opportunity of establishing levels of functioning in relevant domains before the onset of alcohol-related problems or related disorders. The data presented here represent a baseline upon which future follow-ups will evaluate substance-related problems and disorders as this population matures.

AB Objectives: To determine the association between children's exposure to maternal intimate partner violence (IPV) and behavior problems as measured by the parent report version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Methods: The study population was comprised of 167 2- to 17-year-old children of Seattle women with police-reported or court-reported intimate partner abuse. The CBCL normative population served as the comparison group. Risk of behavior problems was calculated among the exposed children, in the presence and absence of a history of reported child maltreatment, relative to the normative population. Multiple logistic regression served as the primary method of analysis.
   Results: Children exposed to maternal IPV were more likely to have borderline to clinical level scores on externalizing (i.e., aggressive, delinquent) behavior (RR = 1.6,95% CI: 1.2,2.1) and total behavioral problems (RR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1,1.9) compared to the CBCL normative sample after adjusting for age and sex. Children who were exposed to maternal IPV and were victims of child maltreatment were more likely to receive borderline to clinical level scores on internalizing (i.e., anxious, depressed) behaviors (RR = 2.6,95% CI: 1.5,3.6), externalizing (i.e., aggressive, delinquent) behaviors (RR = 3.0,95% CI: 1.9,4.0) and total behavioral problems (RR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2,3.2) compared to the CBCL normative sample after adjusting for age and sex.
   Conclusions: Exposure to maternal IPV is significantly associated with child behavioral problems both in the presence and absence of co-occurring child maltreatment. Appropriate attention to the mental health of children living in households with IPV is needed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Family and child care factors from birth to 54 months, achievement and social outcomes at entry to school, and qualities of first-grade classrooms were used to predict first-grade social functioning for 864 children from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care. Child gender, mothers' partner status, maternal education and depressive symptoms, sensitivity of mothering, and amount of time spent in nonmaternal child care were significant predictors. Home and child care variables predicted social functioning through associations with prior social functioning rather than directly. More teacher-led structured activities in first-grade classrooms predicted mother's reports of more internalizing behavior. Classrooms rated as more emotionally supportive predicted lower levels of mother-reported internalizing behavior and concurrently observed indicators of competence.

AB Parents' marital conflict styles were investigated as mediators in the associations between parental dysphoria and children's internalizing symptoms. A community sample of 267 children, ages 8 to 16, participated with their parents. Behavioral observations were made of parents' interactions during marital conflict resolution tasks. Questionnaires assessed parents' dysphoria and children's internalizing problems. Structural equation modeling indicated that marital discord, in particular, depressive conflict styles, mediated the relationship between parental dysphoria and children's internalizing problems. Furthermore, whereas for dysphoric mothers, depressive conflict styles partially mediated the links with children's internalizing, for fathers, depressive conflict styles fully mediated the links. Destructive and constructive marital conflict were associated with parental dysphoria (positively and negatively, respectively) but did not mediate the relations with children's internalizing.

AB Social phobia is an extremely disruptive and distressing anxiety disorder that can impact on many areas of an individual's life. Yet, despite the fact that lifetime prevalence rates are relatively high, its etiology is still poorly understood. The aim of this review is to draw together findings from the broad base of nonclinical literature associated with behavioral inhibition (BI), shyness, social anxiety, and passive-anxious withdrawal and to compare these findings with those from the limited number of clinical studies with social phobics. Such comparison is not unproblematic due to conceptual differences between terms used and methodological divergence; these issues are discussed in some detail. The consonance of findings, however, suggests a viable profile for the developmental course of social phobia. This profile incorporates temperament variables, behavioral motivational, parenting styles, peer relationships, and internalization problems. Finally, specific suggestions for future research are offered. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examines comorbid mental disorders in relation to post-treatment outcomes (12 months post-intake) among adolescents (N = 419) who entered three residential drug treatment programs. When contrasted with youths who had no comorbid mental disorders or youths with a single comorbid condition, those with combined internalizing and externalizing disorders (mixed comorbidity) had higher levels of substance-related problems and poly-drug use at entry to treatment, and poorer outcomes, e.g. relapse, particularly evident for drugs other than alcohol or marijuana. A significantly higher proportion of those with mixed comorbidity were admitted to short term residential treatment, as compared to long term residential care. However, the effects of comorbidity were independent of both planned and actual length of stay, suggesting that comorbidities can negatively impact treatment outcome in multiple ways, apart from length of stay. Since co-occurring problems appear to profoundly limit treatment effectiveness, treatment strategies that address comorbidity are needed to improve outcomes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Associations between children's (N = 147) participation in structured leisure activities and their adjustment were examined. Caregivers provided lists of extracurricular activities (clubs, sports, and church activities) in which children participated. Children and caregivers participated in interviews and completed questionnaires designed to measure children's adjustment in four domains (academic competence, psychosocial development, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior). Classroom teachers completed additional measures of children's academic and social competence. Greater participation in club activities was linked with higher academic grades and more positive teacher ratings of academic competence. Greater participation in sports was associated with higher levels of psychosocial maturity and more positive teacher ratings of social competence. There were no associations between involvement in church activities and any indicators of adjustment. Activity involvement was unassociated with externalizing or internalizing behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of both selection into different types of extracurricular activities and the skills emphasized in the pursuit of such activities. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The present study examined the association between adolescent perceptions of parental psychological control and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms across four dyadic relationships (mother/daughter mother/son, father/daughter, and father/ son) cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Participants were 306 sixth- and seventh- grade students, 287 mothers, and 115 fathers, interviewed at two time points one year apart. Cross-sectionally, father psychological control predicted higher adolescent-reported internalizing both for boys and for girls only when mothers also were perceived as high in psychological control. Similarly, but only among girls, father psychological control predicted higher externalizing only when mothers also were perceived as high in psychological control. Longitudinal analyses indicated that adolescents with higher internalizing symptoms atone time are especially likely to perceive parents as using psychological control one year later, earlier psychological control did not predict later internalizing. For externalizing, longitudinal analyses indicated that higher psychological control at one time predicts higher externalizing one year later.

AB Objective: To examine concurrent physical, educational, behavioural, social and family factors associated with cigarette smoking in adolescents at 14 years.
   Methodology: This study reports cross-sectional data on 14-year-old adolescents and their mothers, drawn from a prospective cohort study commencing at the time of the first antenatal visit. At 14 years, 5247 adolescents completed questionnaires on current cigarette smoking. Adolescents and mothers completed health, psychological, school and social questionnaires relating to the youth. A total of 3864 adolescents were assessed physically, and undertook the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and Ravens Progressive Matrices Test.
   Results: Cigarette smoking at 14 years was associated with externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, school suspension, contact with children's services and alcohol/illicit drug use. Apart from internalizing behaviour problems, these problems were more prevalent in boys. Poor school performance on maternal/adolescent reports was associated with increased smoking quantity for both genders, though WRAT scores were only decreased in male smokers. The Ravens Progressive Matrices Test scores were lower for boys with greater smoking quantity. The trend was less marked in girls. Body mass index and exercise frequency were not associated with cigarette smoking at 14 years, though girls who smoked had a higher reported prevalence of asthma. Parental smoking, marital conflict, maternal depression, lower income, and mothers aged in their teens and with a lower level of education at the time of this pregnancy were also positively associated with adolescent tobacco use.
   Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate that cigarette smoking, at this critical time of smoking initiation, is associated with a broad spectrum of personal and social disadvantage that needs to be considered in intervention strategies.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether disagreements in reporting child behavior problems between biological parents and foster parents and teachers are related to depressive symptoms in the biological parent. Method: Child Behavior Checklists and Teacher's Report Forms were completed by parents, foster parents, and teachers on 95 foster children between ages 5 and 16 during 1990-1991. Depressive symptoms in biological parents were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the relation between parental depressive symptoms and the discrepancies between their reports and those of two other informants. Results: In both the internalizing and externalizing behavior models, a significant relation was found between parents' depressive symptoms and their discrepancies in reporting, but not with child behavior. This relation was stronger for internalizing than externalizing models. Conclusions: Using foster parents (and teachers) as informants offered a unique opportunity to view the reports of biological parents in comparison to two independent reports. Foster parents have a similar observational situation as biological parents but bring a less emotionally invested perspective to behavior observation, even when they are relatives. It is likely that depressive symptoms in parents distort their reports of their children's behavior. Clinicians would be wise to supplement parental with other informant reports.

AB Objective: Studies on 3-, 7-, and 10-year-old twins' internalizing and externalizing problems have emphasized the importance of understanding sources of agreement and disagreement between maternal and paternal ratings. A psychometric model that assumes that each parent assesses rater-specific aspects of the child's behavior provided the best explanation for parental disagreement. This study investigates two models that have been used to explain the agreement and disagreement between mothers and fathers in the ratings of their children. Method: Child Behavior Checklists filled in by mothers and fathers were collected for a sample of 1,481 twelve-year-old twin pairs. Genetic and environmental influences on internalizing and externalizing problems were estimated using models that corrected for rater bias, rater-specific effects, and unreliability. Results: The psychometric model fitted the data significantly better than a rater bias model. Significant influences of genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors were found for internalizing and externalizing behavior. Parent-specific views, rater bias, and unreliability were significant. Conclusions: The best-fitting model implies that disagreement between parents is due to the fact that mothers and fathers provide information from their own perspective. This information should be seen as important and adding to the diagnostic formulation rather than as a point of disagreement. The finding that internalizing and externalizing problems are influenced by genetic and environmental factors fosters the understanding that it is the interaction of nature and nurture that puts children at risk for common behavioral disorders.

AB Objective: To examine the longitudinal course of subthreshold and full-criteria child psychiatric disorders. Method: Nine hundred ninety-six children, aged 4 to 9 years, from a representative sample of pediatric primary care practices participated in a 1-year follow-up in 1989-1990. Parent interviews included the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, measures of psychosocial problems, stress, social support, possible child abuse, and sociodemographics. Results: The initial prevalence of full and subthreshold disorders was 18.8% and 14.0%, respectively. Full and subthreshold disorders were associated with impairment. Approximately 37% of children with full disorders had persistent disorders. Persistence was more common among boys than girls, particularly when comorbidity was present. Children with initial subthreshold disorders only were five times more likely than those without disorder to develop a full disorder. Persistence of full disorders was associated with high initial symptoms. Among boys, persistence was linked to possible child abuse, whereas among girls it was associated with full externalizing disorders that were accompanied by subthreshold internalizing disorders. Conclusions: Intervention may be particularly crucial when a high number of symptoms and/or both internalizing and externalizing problems are present. Underscoring the importance of family-centered rather than child-centered interventions, boys whose parents reported possible child abuse were more likely to have persistent disorders.

AB Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and permanent disability in developmental age. Neurobehavioural symptoms are not uncommon in these patients. The aim of this study was to identify the main neuropsychiatric sequelae of TBI at different ages and study the possible correlations with clinical features in the acute phase and outcome in order to better plan rehabilitative treatment and re-entry into society.
   Method: Ninety-six post-traumatic patients, ranging from 0 - 18 years, underwent a complete psychological evaluation protocol at 1 year from trauma. Patients were divided into three different age groups ( 0 - 6 years; 7 - 13 years; 14 - 18 years) and received a protocol made up of age-appropriate scales.
   Results: Different psychological problems were found across the three groups; more frequently younger patients show internalizing problems such as withdrawal and closure, while, with age, behaviour problems become more frequent, characterized by hyperactivity and aggressiveness. Factors that were most predictive of psychological, behaviour and adjustment problems include GOS scores, the degree of impairment on the neurological examination and male gender.
   Conclusions: Psychological and behavioural problems differ across the three age groups and determine a different outcome, rehabilitation plan and re-entry into society. These problems should, thus, be investigated and treated specifically according to age.

AB The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of parenting style and child emotionality on the development of proneness to shame in young girls, and the mediating effect of shame on the development of adjustment problems. Eighty-eight girls were assessed twice, at 3 and 5 years of age, along with their mothers and fathers. Shame was assessed by observations (reactions to failure and criticism); parenting style and child emotions (fearfulness, sadness, anger) were measured using parent reports; and adjustment problems were assessed by parent and teacher reports. Girls were more likely to show shame at age 5 when both their mothers and fathers had been relatively authoritarian at age 3; their emotional dispositions did not have any direct longitudinal effects on shame. Authoritarian parenting predicted subsequent internalizing problems as assessed by teachers, but there was no evidence for a mediational effect of shame. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper the refinement and psychometric properties of the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) are described. Results from a sociodemographically diverse birth cohort sample of 1,235 parents of children between the ages of 12 and 36 months are presented. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized Internalizing, Externalizing, Regulatory, and Competence domains as well as the 17 individual scales that comprise the ITSEA. Findings for 3 additional indices useful in identifying significant psychopathology are presented. Subgroup analyses revealed structural invariance and expected mean level differences across both child sex and 6-month age bands. Child sex differences emerged for some problem and most competence scales, with boys rated as higher on Activity/Impulsivity and girls rated higher on Anxiety and most Competence scales. All competence scores increased across age groups. Problem behaviors showed a more mixed developmental pattern. Test-retest and interrater reliability were acceptable. Associations between the ITSEA and independent evaluator ratings and parental ratings of child behavior problems, temperament, and parental distress support the validity of the instrument.

AB Background: Few longitudinal studies have attempted to identify risk factors in mid-adolescence for subsequent depression in young adulthood. Mid-adolescence is a critical developmental phase for studying vulnerability to depression due to high incidence and prevalence of depression. Methods: In a longitudinal study, following an urban Finnish community cohort (761 males and 887 females) from age 16, mid-adolescent risk factors for depression at age 22 years were studied. Data were collected by a questionnaire at school at age 16, and by a postal questionnaire at age 22. Results: Of the females 116 (13%) and of the males 69 (9%) had depression (S-BDI) in young adulthood. In multivariate analyses baseline depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, dissatisfaction with academic achievement, problems with the law, poor atmosphere at home and having no close friends predicted subsequent depression. Risk factors for males included more 'externalizing' aspects, for females more 'internalizing' factors. Conclusions: Mid-adolescence is an important age to study risk for depression, and self-reported perceptions of psychosocial well-being have predictive value. Preventive efforts can be selectively targeted at adolescents who have been exposed to identifiable risk factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Childhood internalizing problems are often precursors in the development of more serious psychiatric syndromes including anxiety and depressive disorders. Twin studies of the etiology of these disorders suggest that the genetic risk factors underlying anxiety and depression are highly correlated. However, the specific genetic mechanisms responsible for this risk have not yet been identified. Methods: We examined the association between childhood internalizing problems and a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) in 711 children participating in a longitudinal twin study of behavioral and emotional development. Internalizing problems were measured at ages 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) parent report form. We applied a sibling-based methodology for estimating allelic association with quantitative traits, while controlling for population stratification. Results: No associations were found for CBCL Internalizing problems at any age, including the subscales for Somatic Complaints, Withdrawn and Anxiety/Depression. Conclusions: Thus, although our results did not support the hypothesis that the 5-HTTLPR contributes to a dimensional expression of internalizing behavior problems, this does not rule out the possibility that it is an interesting polymorphism to pursue in the search for genetic risk factors related to major depressive and/or anxiety disorders.

AB Background: In adolescents, as in adults, there is often comorbidity between major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other disorders. In this study, the discordant twin method was used to investigate whether this comorbidity in adolescents may be due to a shared familial liability between MDD and other internalizing disorders, and between MDD and externalizing disorders. Methods: We examined prevalence rates of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and childhood externalizing disorders in 624 seventeen-year-old same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. Overall prevalence of MDD in this sample was 12.9%. Twenty-seven twin pairs were concordant for MDD, 107 were discordant for MDD, and 490 were concordant for no MDD. Results: Prevalence rates for disorders other than MDD were elevated in the depressed twins relative to the control twins from pairs concordant for no MDD. Prevalence rates were also elevated in the nondepressed co-twins of depressed twins. Twin concordance for disorders other than MDD was higher in twin pairs where at least one twin was depressed than in pairs where neither twin was depressed. Conclusions: These results support a shared familial liability between MDD and other internalizing disorders and between MDD and externalizing disorders in adolescents.

   ATTACHMENT
AB Emotion self-regulation is an important developmental task in the preschool period that is related to children's emotional and behavioral adjustment in early childhood. Emotion self-regulation and its relation to later adjustment has not been studied in children born with orofacial clefts, despite their risk for externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Eighty-three 5-year-old children with cleft lip and palate, isolated cleft palate, or no cleft condition were videotaped during a laboratory disappointment situation. Results showed that children in the cleft group expressed less disappointment than children in the comparison group. Longitudinal analyses revealed that parenting stress measured when the children were 2 years of age predicted Expressed Disappointment at age 5 years, which, in turn, predicted severity of behavior problems at age 7 years. Although tentative, results indicate that control over mild negative affect may be a protective factor for children with clefts, buffering the effects of early stress on the development of later behavioral and emotional problems. Thus, interventions that reduce parenting stress and enhance children's emotion regulation strategies may decrease the risk for later psychological problems in this population.

AB Fifty preschool children with varying amounts of visitation with their previously violent fathers were studied to determine if the amount of father visitation was related to their behavioral functioning. The possible association of the severity of violence witnessed and the quality of the mother-child relationship on child behaviors was also assessed. There was a significant negative relationship between internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist, and frequency of father visitation. Children who saw their fathers less frequently evidenced higher internalizing and externalizing scores. More severe levels of violence perpetrated by the father significantly predicted increased externalizing behavior scores but not internalizing scores. Severity of violence was more predictive of externalizing behaviors than frequency of father visitation.

AB We reviewed the literature on family treatment for childhood behavioral and emotional disorders and found an increase in the number of studies since 1995; however there was significant variation by disorder and therapy model. There is substantially more research on externalizing disorders (i.e., conduct disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder oppositional defiant disorder) then internalizing disorders, depression and anxiety disorders. The data support the conclusion that family-based interventions produce results comparable to individually oriented interventions, and in some cases family-based interventions are superior to individual treatments. To date, cognitive behavioral family therapy and parent management have been the two models studied, almost exclusively. Implications for family therapy and future research are considered.

AB Objective: To estimate genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental contributions to stability and change in internalizing and externalizing problems. Method: Maternal Child Behavior Checklist ratings were obtained for 3,873 twin pairs at age 3 and 1,924 twin pairs at age 7. For 1,575 twin pairs, ratings were available at both ages. Results: For Internalizing/Externalizing ratings, genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors explained about 59/51%,10/30%, and 31/19% of the variance at age 3, and 40/52%, 31/32%, and 29/16% of the variance at age 7. The phenotypic correlation of r = 0.38/0.54 between problems assessed at 3 and 7 years of age was explained for 66/55% by genetic factors, for 23/37% by shared environmental factors, and for 11/8% by nonshared environmental factors. The genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental correlations between ages 3 and 7 were 0.51/0.57, 0.47/0.66, and 0.13/0.24, respectively. Conclusions: Genetic and shared environmental factors were most important for the stability of Internalizing and Externalizing Problems between ages 3 and 7. Nonshared environmental factors were mainly age-specific. For Internalizing Problems, shared environment may become more important from early to middle childhood.

AB Introduction. Several studies have found neuropsychological and behavioral disorders in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which have been explained as a executive dysfunction. Objective. To describe and compare children with ADHD and a control group. Patients and methods. 79 seven to eleven year-old children were selected and grouped according to ADHD DSM IV criteria and the T scores on a ADHD checklist. They were classified as predominantly inattentive (n = 19), combined (n = 24) and control (n = 36) groups. Age, gender, socio economic status and intellectual quotient (> 85) were statistically controlled Neuropsychological functions were assessed with a child neuropsychological battery, and the behavioral dimensions were evaluated with the BASCs questionnaires, Conners' parents (CPRS) and teachers (CTRS) rating scales, and with a questionnaire for oppositional defiant (ODD) and conduct (CD) disorders. Results. Statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.01) in neuropsychological variables of mental control, continuous auditory performance, Rey's complex figure evocation and the Stroop's test. There were significant differences in the most BASCs internalizing and externalizing dimensions, so for the parents as for the teachers and self report questionnaire, and in the dimensions of CPRS, CTRS, ODD and CD questionnaires. Conclusion. Children with ADHD showed difficulties in sustained and selective attention, visual memory, inhibitory control, and they had behavioral disorders similar to those informed by previous studies.

AB This study examined relationships between violence exposure, other stressors, family support, and self-concept on self-reported behavioral problems among 320 urban adolescents ( aged 11 18) referred for mental health treatment. Overall, participants reported high levels of violence exposure, with a median of six past encounters with violence as a witness, victim, or through the experiences of associates. All forms of violence exposure ( witnessing, being a victim, knowing of victims) were correlated with internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems for males and females. Total violence exposure predicted behavioral problems among participants, even after controlling for the effects of other risk, demographic and protective factors. Family support and self-concept moderated the influence of life stress and cumulative risk on problem behavior outcomes, but these protective variables did not significantly moderate violence exposure.

AB The present study examined the base rates of normal range Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent (MMPI-A) profiles in an inpatient sample and examined the differences between adolescents with apparently valid normal range profiles (all clinical scale T-scores < 60) and those with elevated profiles on prior interventions, reported internalizing, and externalizing symptoms, and MMPI-A validity scale scores and other indexes of underreporting. Normal range profiles cannot be adequately explained by a less pathological history prior to hospitalization or by defensiveness. Thirty percent of male and 25% of female adolescents produced valid MMPI-A profiles in which none of the clinical scales were elevated. Both male and female adolescents with normal range profiles were generally less likely to report internalizing symptoms than those with elevated profiles, but both groups report externalizing symptoms. Neither the standard MMPI-A validity scales nor additional validity scales discriminated between profile groups. Clinicians should not assume that normal range profiles indicate an absence of problems.

AB By comparing the prevalence of emotional and behaviour health problems among institutionalized juvenile offenders with that amongst a non-offending sample of adolescents, this study indicates common characteristics of the perceived emotional and behavioural problems, and describes risk factors pertinent to persistent juvenile offending. Familial backgrounds, behavioural and emotional measures were collected through self-report surveys. Results showed that young people in secure units claimed significant high levels of emotional and behavioural problems and that those problems were associated with their disadvantaged familial socio-economic backgrounds and perceived parenting factors. Various policy implications are recommended to tackle problems amongst these disadvantaged young people in correctional institutions in Korea. In particular, for those working with young people in correctional institutions in the UK, the findings highlight the importance of culturally relevant programmes.

AB The study tested whether children's prosocial behavior was negatively or positively related to children's and mothers' psychological problems. Participants were 149 London families when mothers were pregnant and followed up in infancy and at ages 4 and 11. Children's cooperation at 4 and general prosocial tendencies at 11 were negatively associated with externalizing problems but unrelated to internalizing problems. A subgroup of children who were more prosocial than average expressed clinically significant worries about family members. Maternal depression decreased prosocial behavior in the eyes of adults, but children of depressed mothers saw themselves to be prosocial. Early cooperation protected children against later risk for externalizing problems, even when their early behavioral problems were taken into account.

AB A longitudinal investigation was conducted to explicate how the confluence of early behavioral dispositions, relational histories, and cognitive representations of the self and others contributes to internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and loneliness. One-hundred and ninety three girls, and 206 boys were assessed annually from age 5 (kindergarten) to age 10 (Grade 4). Early aggressive behavior was related to Grade 4 maladjustment directly and indirectly through subsequent relational stressors. Significant associations emerged between chronic friendlessness and rejection and later adaptation not accounted for by concurrent relational difficulties. Self- and peer beliefs partially mediated the relation between peer difficulties and internalizing problems and loneliness. The results highlight the utility of child-by-environment models as a guide for the investigation of processes that antecede psychosocial maladjustment.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate effects of a training package on appropriate and inappropriate behaviors of residents with mental retardation with internalizing or externalizing behavior problems and the responses of staff to these behavior problems. The training procedure included resident training with video feedback and self-management procedures and staff training with video and graphic feedback. A multiple baseline design across residents was used. Results show increased appropriate social behavior for residents with internalizing behavior problems and decreased inappropriate social behavior for residents with externalizing behavior problems. The provision of video and graphic feedback also successfully improved performance of direct-care staff members. Recommendations are made for further investigation of variables related to behavior change of staff and residents.

DE intrafamilial childhood sexual abuse; personal space boundaries
AB A large volume of literature exists on childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and nursing literature on this topic continues to develop. However, discussion of boundaries in relation to intrafamilial childhood sexual abuse (ICSA) and to its significance in terms of personal space boundary (PSB) violation, is lacking. This is important, as PSB violation creates difficulties for adult survivors of ICSA and for nurses who care for these people as clients. As all experiences of CSA cannot be addressed, discussion focuses on women who are clients of mental health services and who have experienced ICSA. Using Scott's work on boundaries and her diagrammatic conceptualization of PSBs, links are created between ICSA boundary violation, resultant PSB regulation difficulties and principles to guide nursing practice. Discussion centres on understanding the need for PSB restoration in women-client survivors of ICSA.

AB Compared 2 groups of children with anxiety disorders: those treated in a university-based research clinic (RC) and those treated in community-based service clinics (SCs). A widely endorsed goal in intervention research is to disseminate evidence-based treatments from RCs to SCs. Attaining this goal requires an understanding of the similarities and differences between clients in these 2 settings. Youth from SCs showed more comorbid externalizing diagnoses and externalizing problems and were more likely to come from low-income and single-parent families. On measures of internalizing symptomatology and diagnoses, youth from RCs were very similar to SC youth. To facilitate development of treatments with real-world applicability, we describe a model involving the testing of treatments. in real-world settings. We also discuss limitations to this project.

AB Examined the relative importance of diagnostic and psychosocial factors in the prediction of adolescent suicidal ideation. Seventy-three high school students exhibiting emotional disturbance in the school setting completed a diagnostic interview and self-report measures assessing social support, family environment, negative life events, and problem solving. Using hierarchical regression analyses, only the presence of a pure internalizing disorder predicted suicidal ideation in addition to psychosocial variables. Interactions were found between psychiatric disorders and psychosocial variables. These results underscore the importance of including both diagnostic and psychosocial variables in research examining risk factors for adolescent suicidal behavior Further, they suggest that adolescents presenting with psychiatric disorders, high levels of stress, and poor social support networks should be monitored for suicidality.

In the context of marital conflict, a big : her level of active coping and support coping combined was a protective factor against girls depression symptoms and self-esteem problems and both boys' and girls' health problems. Further, avoidance coping was a vulnerability factor for externalizing, internalizing, and physical health problems in boys, and distraction coping was protective against children's depression and health problems. These findings extend the literature by delineating coping strategies that either protected children against, or heightened their vulnerability to, adjustment and health problems associated with exposure to parental marital conflict.

AB Objective To conduct a prospective case-controlled study of pediatric inpatients referred for consultation in a tertiary care children's medical center. Method Referrals (n = 104) were matched with nonreferrals (n = 104) for age (4 to 18 years), gender, and illness type/severity and completed parent- and self-report (dependent on age) behavioral rating scales to assess for adjustment/functioning. Nurses completed in-hospital ratings of behavioral/adjustment difficulties. Goal attainment and satisfaction ratings were obtained from the referring physicians, parents/guardians, and the consultant. Results Referrals exhibited more behavior/adjustment/coping difficulties than nonreferrals by parent, nurse, and self report. Frequently employed interventions included coping-strategies intervention, cognitive and behavioral therapies, and case management. Referring physician and consultant ratings of goal attainment were high, as were physician ratings of satisfaction and parent/guardian ratings of overall helpfulness. Conclusions Pediatric inpatients referred by their physicians had significantly more internalizing and externalizing disturbances than their nonreferred hospitalized peers. Many of the behavioral and adjustment problems that lead to in-hospital consultation referral were evident in global behavior difficulties prior to hospitalization. Referring pediatricians, parents/guardians, and consultants rate the outcome as benefiting the patients via assisting in the overall management of their health concerns, coping, and adjustment.

AB Objective: To investigate the role of childhood abuse in the relationship between panic attack, depression and lung disease among adults in the population. Methods: Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (n=5877), a representative sample of adults age 15-54 in the United States. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between childhood abuse and lung disease, and to determine whether childhood abuse is an independent predictor of the co-occurrence of lung disease, panic attack and depression. Results: Childhood abuse was associated with significantly increased odds of panic attacks (OR=2.2 (1.5, 3.1)) and depression (OR=1.6 (1.1, 2.3)). Childhood abuse increased likelihood of lung disease (OR=1.5 (1.1, 2.2)). Childhood abuse independently predicted the co-occurrence of lung disease, panic attack and depression (OR=10.7 (2.2, 51.5)). Conclusion: These data are preliminary, but if replicated, suggest that childhood abuse may be associated with increased risk of lung disease during adulthood, and further may reflect a shared vulnerability for the co-occurrence of lung disease, panic attack and depression in the community. Future studies are needed to further explore the mechanism of this association. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CHILDHOOD MIGRAINE; PEDIATRIC HEADACHE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; DISORDERS
AB Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of autogenic relaxation training in a mildly disturbed outpatient population of children and adolescents with mostly internalizing symptoms, and/or some aggressive, impulsive, or attention deficit symptoms. Method: Fifty children and adolescents from southern Germany (mean age 10.2 years; range 6-15 years; mostly intact middle class family background) participated in a group intervention program. Fifteen patients were randomly assigned to a waiting-list control group. Behavior symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist), psychosomatic complaints (Giessen Complaint List), and level of stress were assessed before and after the intervention or after the waiting phase. Individual goal attainment was evaluated at the end of the intervention and in a 3-month follow-up. Results: The parent report on CBCL reflected reduced symptoms compared with control. The child report indicated reduced stress and psychosomatic complaints both in the intervention and control group, and no significant group X time interaction effects occurred on these scales. Effect sizes of 0.49 in the CBCL and 0.36 in the complaint list indicated clinically relevant effects of the intervention compared with the control group. At the end of the intervention, 56% of the children and 55% of the parents reported partial goal attainment, 38% of the children and 30% of the parents reported complete goal attainment; 71% of the parents confirmed partial goal attainment 3 months postintervention. Conclusions: Autogenic relaxation training is an effective broadband method for children and adolescents.

DT Article
DE selective mutism; social phobia; social anxiety disorder
ID ANXIETY DISORDER; CHILDREN
AB Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that children with selective mutism are more socially anxious than children with social anxiety disorder but who are not selectively mute. Method: Twenty-three children with comorbid selective mutism and social phobia and 23 age-matched controls with social phobia alone and their parents participated in a comprehensive assessment of social anxiety and related aspects of psychopathology. Results: The results do not uniformly support previous suggestions that children with selective mutism refuse speech because they are "frozen with fear." Although clinician and observer ratings for children with selective mutism revealed higher ratings of social distress than for children with social phobia alone, self-report data do not support this conclusion. Furthermore, although there were no group differences on measures of trait anxiety, general fears, or scores on the Child Behavior Checklist broadband Internalizing or Externalizing scales, children with selective mutism scored higher than children with social phobia alone on the Child Behavior Checklist Delinquency subscale, suggesting the presence of a broader clinical syndrome. Conclusion: It remains unclear whether children with selective mutism have extreme levels of social anxiety. Potential areas that might shed further light on this interesting disorder are discussed.

AB Objective: This article investigates sibling similarity in early childhood problem behavior. Method: Analyses are based on an Australian longitudinal study of health and development that included sister, brother, and mixed-sex sibling pairs. Pregnant women were recruited into the study in 1981 to 1983 and provided information regarding family characteristics and child behavior from birth through the age of 5 years. The relationship between older and younger siblings' aggression and internalizing behavior at the age of 5 years is examined, based upon maternal reports on a shortened version of the Child Behavior Checklist for 414 sibling pairs (60% of the initial sibling sample). Results: The results demonstrate a moderately strong association between sibling's aggression and internalizing behavior, for mixed- and same-sex siblings, with correlation coefficients of 0.26 to 0.39. The association between older and younger sibling's behavior remains significant, controlling for family characteristics such as mother's age, mental health, marital status, affection toward children, and family size and income. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of including siblings in family-based intervention programs aimed at reducing child behavior problems.

AB Psychological factors play an important role in nocturnal enuresis. The comorbidity of enuresis and clinical mental disorders, as well as subclinical psychological symptoms is reviewed. In epidemiological, as well as clinical studies, 20-30% of all children with nocturnal enuresis have a manifest clinical disorder - two to three times higher than non-wetting children. Children with a secondary nocturnal enuresis carry the highest risk for a disorder, those with primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis the lowest. Internalizing disorders are less common than externalizing ones. There is a specific association with ADHD. These disorders require specific treatment. In addition, subclinical emotional and behavioral symptoms are common. These will often recede upon attaining dryness and self-esteem can increase. A general screening for psychological symptoms and disturbances is recommended.

ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; ADJUSTMENT; STRESS
AB Objective. To compare the behaviors of black, white, and Hispanic children who were 18 months to 18 years of age and exposed to intimate partner violence with an age- and ethnically similar sample of children who were not exposed to violence and to compare both exposed and nonexposed children to normative samples.
   Methods. As part of a study on treatments for abused women in primary care public health clinics and Women, Infants and Children clinics in a large urban area, 258 abused mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) on 1 of their randomly selected children between the ages of 18 months and 18 years. An ethnically similar sample of 72 nonabused mothers also completed the CBCL. The CBCL is a standardized instrument that provides a parental report of the extent of a child's behavioral problems and social competencies. The CBCL consists of a form for children 18 months to 5 years and a version for ages 6 to 18 years. The CBCL is orally administered to a parent, who rates the presence and frequency of certain behaviors on a 3-point scale ( 0 = not true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often true). The time period is the last 6 months for the child 6 to 18 years of age and 2 months for the child 18 months to 5 years of age. Examples of behaviors for the child age 6 to 18 years include "gets in many fights," " truancy, skips school." Examples of behaviors for the child 18 months to 5 years of age include " cruel to animals," " physically attacks people," and " doesn't want to sleep alone." Both forms of the CBCL consist of 2 broadband factors of behavioral problems: internalizing and externalizing with mean scale scores for national normative samples as well as clinically referred and nonreferred samples of children. Internalizing behaviors include anxiety/depression, withdrawal, and somatic complaints. Externalizing behaviors include attention problems, aggressive behavior, and rule-breaking actions. Behavior scales yield a score of total behavioral problems. Scores are summed and then converted to normalized T scores. T scores greater than or equal to 60 are within the borderline/clinical referral range - higher scores represent more deviant behavior. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) were used to determine whether children from abused mothers differed significantly in their internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and total behavior problems from children of nonabused mothers. One sample t tests were used to compare children from abused and nonabused mothers to the matched clinically referred and nonreferred normative sample. Four pair-wise comparisons were considered: 1) children from abused women to referred norm, 2) children from abused women to nonreferred norm, 3) children from nonabused women to referred norm, and 4) children from nonabused to nonreferred norm. The internal, external, and total behavior problem T scores were dichotomized into a referral status: nonreferred = T score < 60, referred = T score &GE; 60. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe the distribution of referral status among the children from the abused and nonabused women, and &chi;(2) tests of independence were used to determine whether the groups were significantly different.
   Results. No significant differences in demographic characteristics between children from the abused women and nonabused women were observed. The sample consisted of a large number of Hispanic children (68.9%) and slightly more girls (53.6%), and nearly half (45.2%) had annual household incomes <$ 10 000. Means, standard deviations, and results from the MANOVAs performed on internal, external, and total behavior problem scores between children from abused and nonabused women revealed no significant differences ( F[ 3,139] = 1.21) for children ages 18 months through 5 years. Results from the MANOVA performed for ages 6 through 18 years revealed a significant group difference ( F[ 3,183] = 3.13). Univariate tests revealed significant group differences for internalizing behavior ( F[ 1,185] = 6.81), externalizing behavior ( F[ 1,185] = 7.84), and total behavior problems ( F[ 1,185] = 9.45). Overall, children of abused mothers had significantly higher internalizing ( 58.5 +/- 12.1), externalizing ( 55.5 +/- 12.4), and total behavior problems (57.6 +/- 12.3) scores than the internalizing ( 52.9 +/- 13.7), externalizing ( 49.7 +/- 10.6), and total behavior problems ( 51.0 +/- 13.0) scores exhibited for children of nonabused mothers. Most comparisons of children from the abused women to the referred and nonreferred norms are significant. The mean internal, external, and total behavior problem scores from children of abused women were significantly higher than the nonreferred norms and significantly lower than the referred norms. In contrast, all comparisons for children from nonabused women were not significantly different from the nonreferred norms.
   Conclusions. Children, ages 6 to 18 years, of abused mothers exhibit significantly more internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems than children for the same age and sex of nonabused mothers. In addition, the mean internalizing behavior score for boys 6 to 11 years of age as well as girls and boys 12 to 18 years of age of abused mothers were not significantly different from the clinical referral norms. Internalizing behaviors of anxiety, withdrawal, and depression are consistent with suicidal risk. The association of a child's exposure to intimate partner violence and subsequent attempted and/or completed suicide demands research. Our data demonstrate that children of abused mothers have significantly more behavioral problems than the nonclinically referred norm children but also, for most children, display significantly fewer problems than the clinically referred children. These children of abused mothers are clearly suspended above normal and below deviant, with children ages 6 to 18 being at the greatest risk. If abused mothers can be identified and treated, then perhaps behavior problems of their children can be arrested and behavioral scores improved. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect recommends routine screening of all women for abuse at the time of the well-child visit and implementation of a protocol that includes a safety plan for the entire family. Clinicians can use this research information to assess for intimate partner violence during child health visits and inform abused mothers of the potential effects on their children's behavior. Early detection and treatment for intimate partner violence against women has the potential to interrupt and prevent behavioral problems for their children.

AB This research involved comparing the effectiveness of two different approaches of conjoint consultation using a manual versus a videotape series as the main components of training parents and teachers to treat children's behavioral difficulties. Children exhibiting externalizing or internalizing behavioral problems who attended Head Start Programs were targeted for this intervention. During the first 2 years of the project, a manual-based program was conducted. The last 3 years of the project involved delivery of the parent-teacher training program through a series of videotapes and accompanying manuals. Children were randomly assigned to either an experimental or no treatment control group. The effectiveness of the intervention within the experimental group was assessed primarily through a pretest-posttest, experimental-control, group repeated-measures design. Direct behavioral observations did not indicate clinically relevant improvements in behavior; however, parents' and teachers' goal attainment reports characterized students as meeting their overall behavior goals. Parents and teachers also reported high rates of treatment acceptability and satisfaction with the manual and videotape treatment programs. Implications are discussed for future research on evidence-based treatments.

AB Objective: Affiliation with delinquent peers has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of antisocial and substance abuse behaviors in adolescence. However, little data are available concerning the developmental trajectories of deviant peer affiliation. Method: In this study, we have prospectively examined the density of deviant peers among the social networks of children of drug dependent fathers at age 10, and at 2 and 5 year follow-ups, and compared them with those of controls. Measures of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology were employed as time varying covariates, while socioeconomic status (SES) was used as a time invariant covariate. A pattern mixture analysis of missing data was conducted. Results: Using mixed effects models, we found significant main effects of time, group, externalizing psychopathology, and to lesser extent, SES on the magnitude of affiliation with deviant peers. Greater deviant peer affiliation among the high-risk children was found at each time point. Externalizing psychopathology augmented the magnitude of deviant peer affiliation in both high-risk and comparison children. Conclusion: Offspring of drug dependent fathers have heightened affiliation with deviant peers from pre-adolescence through mid-adolescence. This social developmental process may be a component of the familial risk for substance abuse and antisocial behaviors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate whether in pre-adolescent children specific types of minor neurological dysfunction (MND) are related to specific types of learning and behavioural problems, and whether it is the type or the severity of neurological dysfunction that matters most.
   Method: A total of 1186, 5.5-11-year-old, children were examined for the presence of clusters of signs of MND. Parents and teachers completed brief behaviour rating scales. In school-aged children (n = 580) cognitive achievement was assessed using standardized Dutch tests. Least-squares regression was used to examine neurobehavioural and neurocognitive links.
   Results: Children with more MND clusters performed worse scholastically and had more signs of attention deficit than others. Externalizing and internalizing behaviour were only linked to specific forms of MND.
   Conclusion: Evaluation of the neurological condition of the child with learning and behavioural problems offers insight into the aetiology and pathogenesis of these problems.

AB Objective: This study compared ratings for self-reported behavioral and emotional problems in adolescents from seven countries.
   Method: Youth Self-Report scores were analyzed for 7,137 adolescents ages 1118 years from general population samples from Australia, China, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States.
   Results: Comparisons of problems scores yielded small to medium effect sizes for cross-cultural variations. Youths from China and Jamaica had the highest and youths from Israel and Turkey had the lowest mean total problems scores. With cross-cultural consistency, girls scored higher for internalizing and lower for externalizing than boys. Cross-cultural correlations were high among the mean item scores.
   Conclusions: Empirically based assessment provided a robust method for assessing and comparing adolescents' self-reported problems. Self-reports thus supplemented empirically based assessments of parent-reported problems and offered a cost-effective way of identifying problems for which adolescents from diverse cultural backgrounds may need help.

AB Parentally bereaved children's locus of control and self-esteem were examined as stress-moderators or stress -mediators of their internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. Seventy-six children ages 8 to 16 and their surviving parent were assessed 4 to 34 months after the death. Stress, locus of control, and self-esteem were measured by child report questionnaires. Internalizing and externalizing mental health problems were measured by child report on both questionnaires and a structured interview and by parent report questionnaires. The results revealed that self-esteem was a significant mediator of the relations between stress and both child and parent reports of internalizing problems but not externalizing problems. No significant mediation effects were found for locus of control. Neither locus of control nor self-esteem was a significant moderator of the relations between stress and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications for understanding parentally bereaved children mental health problems and for developing preventive interventions are discussed.

AB Aims To assess the validity of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) as a screening tool for detecting 'at risk' emotional and behavioural maladjustment in children with diabetes, using the Behaviour Assessment System for Children (BASC) as a gold standard measure.
   Methods CHQ and BASC were administered to 103 parents of children with Type 1 diabetes, aged 7-12 years. Sub-scales of the two measures were compared using Pearson's bivariate correlations. CHQ sensitivity and specificity cut-points were optimized against the BASC borderline category using receiver operating characteristic curves.
   Results The BASC Externalizing Problems scale correlated strongly with CHQ Behaviour, Global Behaviour, Mental Health, Family Activities and Family Cohesion scales (r-values -0.68, -0.54, -0.51, -0.59, and -0.42, respectively). BASC Internalizing Problems scale correlated strongly with CHQ Behaviour, Mental Health and Family Cohesion scales (r-values -0.40, -0.43 and -0.45, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the CHQ Mental Health scale most effectively identified children classified as borderline on the BASC Internalizing Problems scale (sensitivity 87%, specificity 78%), while the CHQ Global Behaviour scale most effectively identified children classified as borderline on the BASC Externalizing Problems scale (sensitivity 73%, specificity 82%).
   Conclusions Significant correlations were seen between the CHQ Global Behaviour and Mental Health scales and the BASC Externalizing and Internalizing scales, respectively. Sequential use of the CHQ, as a screening tool, followed by an established mental health measure such as the BASC, may help identify children with diabetes 'at risk' for chronic maladjustment and poor health outcomes.

AB When children in foster care are reunified with their families of origin they encounter changes that may influence their well-being in both positive and negative ways. We examined the effects of reunification among 218 children in foster care to test an integrative model of the effects of reunification using structural equation modeling. We hypothesized that reunification would exert indirect effects on subsequent child adjustment via changes in adverse life events, perceived social isolation, and mental health service utilization. Results indicated no direct effect of reunification on subsequent internalizing problems, but reunification was related to increased adverse life events that, in turn, were related to elevated symptoms. Second, reunification was negatively associated with mental health service use. Finally, reunification was associated with decreased child perceptions of social isolation. In summary, reunification with biological parents is associated with multiple environmental changes, with most but not all effects indicating negative consequences.

AB The association between maturity of defense use and psychological functioning was assessed in a group of 95 elementary school children. Defense mechanisms were measured using a valid and reliable storytelling task, and psychological adjustment was assessed through a combination of parent and self-report questionnaires. Correlational analyses indicated that children who relied on the developmentally immature defense of denial reported higher levels of self-rated social anxiety and depression and received higher ratings of parent-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. However, children who made use of the developmentally mature defense of identification exhibited higher scores on perceived competence in social, academic, conduct, athletic, and global domains. Significantly, there was no relationship between children's use of denial and their level of perceived competence or between children's use of identification and their degree of maladjustment.

AB In this study, we investigated the treatment utility of the revision of Perry and Viglione's (199 1) Rorschach Ego Impairment Index (EII-2) in a sample of 53 child psychiatric inpatients. Parent ratings of symptomatic functioning on the Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders (DSMD; Naglieri, LeBuffe, & Pfeiffer, 1994) were obtained at admission, 30 days postdischarge, and 120 days postdischarge. EII-2 scores correlated with initial symptom elevations on the Critical Pathology at admission. EII-2 scores did not predict short-term response to treatment. However, EII-2 scores demonstrated moderate correlations with long-term outcome and relapse. EII-2 was related to prediction of worsening of symptoms between 30-day and 120-day follow-up as measured by Reliable Change Index scores that were computed for the Externalizing, Internalizing, Critical Pathology, and Total DSMD scales.

AB Objective. Depression in parents is a prevalent and impairing illness that is encountered frequently in medical practice. Children of depressed parents are at risk for psychopathology and other difficulties. A series of recent national reports have recommended the development of prevention efforts targeting children of depressed parents. Yet, to date, few controlled prevention studies of depression in children and adolescents have been conducted. In this study, we report the evaluation of 2 preventive intervention strategies that target children living in homes with depressed parents. Both are public health approaches that were designed to be used by a wide range of practitioners from a variety of disciplines, including pediatricians, internists, school counselors, nurses, and mental health practitioners. We adopted a developmental perspective and intervened with families when children were entering the age of highest risk for depression onset (ie, adolescence). We chose a family-based approach to prevention and sought to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors for early adolescents by increasing positive interactions between parents and children, and by increasing understanding of the illness for everyone in the family. Our prevention approaches were designed to provide information about mood disorders to parents, to equip parents with the skills they need to communicate information to their children, and to open a dialogue with their children about the effects of parental depression. We hypothesized that participation in these prevention programs would result in parental change in child-related behaviors and attitudes about depression and its impact on the family. In addition, we hypothesized that this parental change would produce change in children's self-understanding, and in children's depressive symptomatology.
   Methods. We conducted a large-scale efficacy trial of 2 manual-based preventive intervention programs that were designed to be used widely in public health settings. These interventions target the relatively healthy children (ages 8-15) of parents with mood disorder. Ninety-three families (88.5% of our initial sample), including 121 children, participated in this study through the fourth assessment point. These families were assigned randomly to either a lecture or a clinician-facilitated intervention. Both interventions were specified in manuals. The lecture condition consisted of 2 separate meetings delivered in a group format without children present. The clinician-facilitated condition consisted of 6 to 11 sessions, including separate meetings with parents and children, and a family meeting in which the parents led a discussion of the illness and of positive steps that can be taken to promote healthy functioning in the children. In addition, telephone contacts or refresher meetings were conducted at 6- to 9-month intervals. In both conditions, psychoeducational material about mood disorders, risk, and resilience was presented and efforts were made to decrease feelings of guilt and blame in children. Parents were helped to build resilience in their children through encouraging their friendships, their success outside of the home, and their understanding of parental illness and of themselves. In addition, in the clinician-facilitated condition, efforts were made to link the psychoeducational material presented to the family's own unique illness experience. To address directly how their lives had changed, all family members in both conditions were assessed for psychopathology and for overall functioning at intake, and for psychopathology, functioning, and response to intervention immediately postintervention, similar to1 year postintervention, and again similar to2.5 years postintervention.
   Results. We examined the outcomes of child understanding and internalizing symptomatology, and a number of predictor variables, using repeated measures analyses with generalized estimating equations. We found that parents in both conditions reported significant change in child-related behaviors and attitudes, and that the amount of change reported increased over time from time 3 to time 4 (chi(1)(2)=18.1). Moreover, relative to parents in the lecture program ( mean number of changes=6.3), parents in the clinician-facilitated program reported more change in child-related behaviors and attitudes (mean number of changes=9.8). Children in both conditions reported increased understanding of parental illness attributable to participation in our intervention programs. There was a positive association between the amount of change children reported in their understanding of parental illness and the number of changes couples reported in child-related behaviors/ attitudes (chi(1)(2)=37.3; ie, parents who had changed the most in response to intervention had children who also changed the most). Finally, internalizing scores for all children decreased with increased time since intervention (chi(1)(2)=7.3). In addition, females had higher internalizing scores than males (chi(1)(2)=5.3). There was no significant effect of group on children's change in internalizing symptomatology (chi(1)(2)=0.2).
   Conclusions. We enrolled families with relatively healthy children, administered carefully designed preventive interventions that are manual-based and relatively brief, and found that these programs do have long-standing positive effects in how families problem solve around parental illness. Our results show significant benefits from both interventions. Moreover, changes in parents' perceptions translated directly into changes in children's own understanding of parental illness. Parental behavior and attitude changes and their connection to child changes in understanding identify an important mediating variable: family change. By increasing children's understanding of parental mood disorder, our interventions were found to promote resilience-related qualities in these children at risk. This presentation represents the first and only longitudinal primary prevention study of relatively healthy children at risk for psychopathology attributable to parental mood disorder and demonstrates a significant reduction in risk factors and increase in protective factors in these families over a long time interval-2(1)/(2) years. Our results provide support for a family-based approach to preventive intervention.

AB Tic disorders (TD), obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often associated with deficits of impulse control and aggressive behavior. Tic disorders and OCD are closely related on epidemiological, psychopathological and neurobiological levels, whereas ADHD and OCD phenomena seem to be at opposite poles, Research evidence on the clinical significance of associated obsessive-compulsive behavior is reviewed and linked to our own new data.
   Thus the analyses of a worldwide database on Tourette's Syndrome (TS) (N = 4,833) showed that that the associated symptomatology of the OCD spectrum has to emphasized. In further investigations, premonitory sensorimotor phenomena reminiscent of OCD were more frequent in children with tic disorders as they grew older. Obsessive-compulsive behavior concomitant with TS was particularly associated with impulsive and aggressive behavior, as well as with depression and anxiety. The data suggest a reduced serotonergic transmission.
   Self-reports by children with ADHD, as opposed to those by their parents, mentioned a significantly higher quantitative degree of OC phenomena than those by children with TS. These findings suggest that OC symptoms in children with ADHD have so far been neglected in assessments by others.
   In summary, a complex psychopathological pattern of tic, OC behavior, impulsivity and internalizing symptomatology emerges that requires discriminating assessment and treatment.

AB In a sample of 1,940 Dutch 7-year-old twin pairs we studied the etiology of individual differences in Internalizing and Externalizing behavioral problems. For the majority of twins in the sample, both maternal and paternal ratings of behavioral problems were obtained from the Child Behavior Checklist. This made it possible to take into account processes underlying agreement and disagreement between maternal and paternal ratings. For both problem behaviors, a Psychometric model fitted the data better than a Rater Bias model, implying that parents, in addition to the behaviors they similarly observed, also assessed unique aspects of their children's behaviors. Relatively large genetic influences were found for Externalizing problems, explaining over 50% of the variance in both boys and girls. For internalizing problems, the heritability was over 30% in both sexes. Shared environmental factors were nearly as important as genetic influences in explaining the variation in behavioral problems. For both Externalizing and Internalizing problems, around 30% of the variance was accounted for by the shared environmental factors.

AB This longitudinal study tested the role of children's appraisals of threat and self-blame as mediators of the association between interparental conflict and child adjustment in a sample of 298 Welsh children ages 11 to 12 years. Exposure to higher levels of interparental conflict at Time 1 predicted greater perceived threat and self-blame at Time 2, after accounting for the effects of Time I adjustment and appraisals on later appraisals. Perceived threat in turn was associated with increased internalizing problems at Time 2, and self-blame was associated with higher externalizing problems. The pattern of results was largely consistent for child and parent reports of conflict and for boys and girls, though some gender differences were found in associations between appraisals and adjustment.

ID YOUNG-CHILDREN; FOLLOW-UP; INFANTS; AUTISM
AB The objective of the study was to define diagnostic boundaries between Regulatory Disorders (RD) and Multisystem Developmental Disorders (MSDD). Two groups of 15 subjects, between 20 and 36 months of age, diagnosed as RD or MSDD, according to DC: 0-3 (1994) criteria, were compared in relationship, linguistic, and behavioral profiles using specific instruments. The results showed that both RD and MSDD children were impaired on all linguistic measures with a higher significant impairment of MSDD for communicative gestures, spontaneous speech, and verbal comprehension. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) showed significant differences for withdrawn, and somatic problems. Only the MSDD group reached the clinical cutoff score in total problems, internalizing and withdrawn behaviors. A discriminate analysis showed that the number of communicative gestures and the scores on withdrawn and somatic problems correctly predicted in 86% of cases. It was concluded that RD and MSDD children show quantitative and qualitative differences in many of the linguistic, behavioral, and relational dimensions that were explored. These dimensions may facilitate the differential diagnosis of these disorders.

AB Background: The purpose of the present study was to identify predictors of two potential sequelae of child sexual abuse, self-blame attributions and internalizing behavior problems. Methods: In the study, detailed information was collected on 218 victims of sexual abuse aged 4 to 17, involved in criminal cases, about their background, the abuse, and their mother's reaction following discovery of the abuse. Results: Increased attributions of self-blame were predicted by the child having a close relationship with the perpetrator, experiencing severe sexual abuse (e.g., long-lasting abuse that involved penetration), perceiving the abuse as disgusting, and coping with the abuse by pretending it was not happening. Similar factors did not emerge as predictors of internalizing behavior problems. Conclusions: Results suggest that different child and abuse characteristics predict the two sequelae often associated with childhood sexual abuse. Thus, although self-blame attributions and behavior problems are often considered similar consequences of sexual abuse, there appears a need to distinguish the two types of outcomes following sexual victimization in childhood.

AB Objective. To assess the determinants and responsiveness of the Norwegian version of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) in patients with early juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and to compare health status in patients and controls.
   Methods. A total of 116 children (median age 8.4 yrs) with JIA and < 2.5 years of disease duration (median 11.0 mo) were examined by a pediatric rheumatologist and reassessed after a median of 10.0 months. Physical and psychosocial health were assessed by means of the CHQ, which provides summary scores for physical and psychosocial health, the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, n = 32). Matched controls (n 1116), randomly selected from the general population, completed the CHQ at baseline.
   Results. The patients with JIA had poorer physical health and slightly impaired psychosocial health compared with the controls [41.2 +/- 13.6 vs 55.2 +/- 7.3 (p < 0.001) and 51.0 +/- 7.5 vs 54.1 +/- 5.7 (p = 0.002), respectively]. The most important determinants of the CHQ physical summary score were the child's pain, morning stiffness, the CHAQ disability index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), overall well-being, and physician's global assessment of disease activity. The psychosocial summary score correlated with the CBCL level of internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems. The standardized response mean for the physical summary score was large (0.96) for those who improved,
   and moderate (-0.60) for those who became worse. Conclusion. The CHQ discriminated between patients with early JIA and controls. The most important determinants of the CHQ physical summary score were the child's pain, morning stiffness, CHAQ, ESR, overall well-being, and physician's global assessment of disease activity: The CHQ was sensitive to clinical changes in children with JIA.

AB Objective: This cross-sectional study explored differences in and the association of self-reported coping style, negative life events, self-esteem, and perceived social support with the psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems) of homeless and nonhomeless adolescent males. Method: Data were collected from 100 youths accessing an emergency shelter and two comparison groups of nonhomeless youths: 70 youths accessing local community drop-in centers and 54 high school youths who had never accessed a shelter or drop-in. Data were collected from January 2000 to January 2001 in Ottawa. Results: Homeless youths reported a higher prevalence of family dysfunction, school difficulties, suicide attempts, legal problems, and substance use than nonhomeless youths. Homeless youths differed from nonhomeless youths for each outcome measure, reporting a greater use of the disengagement coping style, higher negative life events index, less perceived parental support, and higher levels of depressive symptoms and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that disengagement coping and self-worth accounted for significant amounts of variance in depressive symptomatology, and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in homeless youths. Conclusions: Findings reflect the merit of considering coping style as a factor in the prevalence of psychological maladjustment among homeless youths.

AB Objective: This study explores whether parental support networks vary by sociodemographic factors among children at high risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and whether network characteristics influence the receipt of mental health treatment for the child. Method: A school district-wide, two-phase screening study design was used to identify 266 children at high risk for ADHD. Parents completed standardized instruments assessing network structure and function, DSM-IV diagnoses of disruptive disorders, caregiver strain, and treatment receipt, and children self-reported internalizing symptoms. Relationships were examined with analysis of variance and multivariate prediction, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, psychopathology, and parental strain. Results: Network characteristics varied by race and socioeconomic status (SES), but not by child gender. African-American and disadvantaged parents reported smaller network sizes, but more frequent contact and higher levels of support than their white and high-SES counterparts. High levels of instrumental support lowered the odds of ADHD treatment during the 12 months before (OR = .7, p < .001) and after (OR = .7, p < .001) the network assessment interview. In contrast, parental strain increased the likelihood of ADHD treatment during both periods. Conclusions: Clinicians should anticipate high levels of caregiver strain and low levels of instrumental support among their patients' parents and address the potential high need for respite care in treatment plans.

AB Objective. To identify factors associated with positive scores on a brief psychosocial screening tool with subscales for internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems.
   Methods. Parents of 2028 children between the ages of 7 and 15 years seen in a sample of 8 primary care practices in the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area completed a brief questionnaire that included the 17-item Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), demographic information, and the reason for the child's visit to the clinic.
   Results. Overall, 22% of the youth had at least 1 positive PSC-17 subscale or a positive PSC-17 total score. Twelve percent scored positive on the internalizing subscale, 10% on the externalizing subscale, 7% on the attention subscale, and 11% had a positive PSC-17 total score. Although boys were more likely than girls to score positive on the attention and aggression subscales, boys and girls were equally likely to have a positive score on the depression subscale. Children not living with both biological parents and those with a household member receiving public assistance were significantly more likely to show psychosocial dysfunction. Controlling for demographic characteristics, patients presenting for an illness-related or injury visit were more likely to score positive on the screen than those presenting for a routine well-child visit (odds ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.98).
   Conclusions. Clinicians will miss opportunities to identify emotional and behavioral disorders among children and adolescents who may be at a higher risk if they limit psychosocial screening to health supervision visits. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies for using primary care for recognizing, diagnosing, and treating mental health disorders in children and adolescents.

AB Objective: This study tests the validity of the Shortform Assessment for Children (SAC), a one-page, 48-item measure of a child's overall mental health. Designed as a rapid assessment instrument for child welfare and juvenile justice systems, the SAC measures the broadband constructs of internalizing and externalizing problems using either parents or teachers as respondents. Method: The convergent, divergent, and criterion validity of the SAC (completed by both parents and teachers) was assessed with data gathered on 188 children in two urban child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Results: The validity of the SAC was supported for both parent and teacher respondents. Conclusions: The SAC's brevity, validity, and utility (completed by a teacher or parent) provide an efficient and effective assessment tool for child welfare and juvenile justice systems.

AB Public health researchers have provided a growing body of evidence on the salutary effects of social capital for individual well being. The importance of these findings for social epidemiology, however, may have precluded so far a full examination of the complex association between neighborhood social processes and the well being of individual residents, including the often acknowledged potential "downside" of social capital. In this study, we examine the association between attachment to community, an indicator of social capital, in a sample of African American parents, and the presence of behavior problems in their preschool children. Participants were recruited from a socioeconomically diverse set of neighborhoods. Attachment to community was assessed using a multi-item scale comprised of two subscales, general sense of community and how well one knew one's neighbors. Results indicated that the association between how well a parent knew her neighbors and the presence of child behavior problems differed depending on the degree of economic impoverishment of the neighborhood. In wealthy neighborhoods, children whose parent reported knowing few of the neighbors had higher levels of internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression compared to those who knew many of their neighbors. In contrast, in poor neighborhoods, children whose parent reported knowing few of the neighbors had lower levels of internalizing problems compared to those who knew many of their neighbors. These results are discussed in terms of furthering the study of the contextual nature of the social capital in explaining community inequalities in mental health among children.

AB Context The outcome into school age of regional cohorts of children born in the 1990s with birth weights less than 1000 g (extremely low birth weight, ELBW) or earlier than 28 weeks' gestation (very preterm) is not known.
   Objective To determine the cognitive, educational, and behavioral outcome of ELBW or very preterm infants born in the 1990s compared with normal birth weight (NBW) controls.
   Design Regional cohort study.
   Setting Victoria, Australia. Participants The ELBW or very preterm cohort was composed of 298 consecutive survivors born during 1991-1992. The NBW cohort was composed of 262 randomly selected children with birth weights of more than 2499 g.
   Main Outcome Measures Cognitive ability, educational progress, and behavioral problems.
   Results The follow-up rates from birth to 8 years of age for survivors were 92.3% (275/298) for the ELBW or very preterm cohort and 85.1% (223/262) for the NBW cohort. The ELBW or very preterm children scored significantly below NBW controls on full-scale IQ (mean difference, -9.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12.1 to -6.7; P<.001) and indices of verbal comprehension (mean difference, -6.8; 95% Cl, -9.5 to -4.2; P<001), perceptual organization (mean difference, -9.9; 95% Cl, -12.7 to -7.2; P<001), freedom from distractibility (mean difference, -8.1; 95% Cl, -10.8 to -5.5; P<001), and processing speed (mean difference, -6.7; 95% Cl, -9.4 to -4.0; P<001). The ELBW or very preterm children performed significantly worse than the NBW cohort on tests of reading (mean difference, -6.7; 95% Cl, -9.5 to -3.9; P<001), spelling (mean difference, -5.6; 95% Cl, -8.0 to -3.3; P<.001), and arithmetic (mean difference, -8.8; 95% Cl, -11.3 to -6.2; P<.001). Attentional difficulties, internalizing behavior problems, and immature adaptive skills were more prevalent in the ELBW or very preterm cohort.
   Conclusion School-aged ELBW or very preterm children born in the 1990s continue to display cognitive, educational, and behavioral impairments.

AB Objective: Substance abuse/dependence has been reported to show significant association with psychopathology, and is likely to influence the course and outcome of psychiatric illness. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of substance use disorders (other than alcohol) comorbidity among inpatient adolescents with severe Axis 1 psychiatric disorder.
   Method: A retrospective analysis of systematically collected data was carried out. The subjects were 16-18-year-old youths, admitted to an inpatient unit for severe psychiatric disorder. The data collection process utilized the DSM-IV criteria for diagnostic categorization of psychiatric disorder and substance use disorder. Demographic data, and data on suicide attempts were also collected.
   Results: Over a period of one year (March 2001-March 2002), 62 patients were admitted to the Christchurch Youth Inpatient Unit; 40 (64.5%) had a comorbid Substance Abuse Disorder (SAD) according to DSM-IV criteria and none had a Substance Dependence Disorder. The vast majority involved cannabis and stimulants. Sixty per cent of those with mood disorder, 63% of those with anxiety disorder and 80% of those with schizophrenia spectrum disorder had a comorbid SAD. Internalizing problems, especially mood disorders, pre-dominated among those with SAD reflecting the Unit's admission criteria. There were no differences in attempted suicide rates between those with SAD and those without SAD, but those with SAD were more likely to have unstable accommodation/living arrangements than those without SAD.
   Conclusions: Our findings confirm previous reports suggestive of high rates of SAD comorbidity among youth with severe psychiatric illness. There are clinical and process implications for these findings particularly identification of substance use disorders and their treatment as well as resource availability and staff training.

AB Background: Prior investigations of cross-informant agreement among parents, teachers, and clinicians about externalizing and internalizing problems have not directly addressed agreement about manic Symptoms.
   Methods: We identified three groups from a large cohort of youths, aged 8-12 years, treated on an inpatient unit. All 108 participants met criteria for an externalizing disorder, based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Of these, 49 did not have manic symptoms endorsed by either the parent or a teacher; 34 had manic symptoms reported by the parent only, and 25 had pervasive manic symptoms (i.e., corroborated by both sources).
   Results: The "corroborated mania" group consistently showed the most disruptive behavior on the inpatient unit, the worst behavior problems on multiple scales, and the longest admission durations. The "parent-only" group scored in the midrange on all of these measures, with group differences typically representing small to medium effect sizes. The "externalizing only" group consistently scored lowest on all dependent measures, with the differences representing large to extremely large effects when compared with the corroborated mania group and medium effects as compared with the parent-only group.
   Conclusions: Youths for whom multiple informants report manic symptoms appear likely to have more severe symptom presentation and more complicated, refractory courses than do youths without manic symptoms. (C) 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB This study set out to investigate some psychometric properties of the Lithuanian version of CBCL for providing the preliminary data on the emotional and behavioural problems in Lithuanian children taking factors such as gender, age, SES and family composition into account. The CBCL was completed by parents of 7- to 11- and 12- to 14-year-old school children (N = 1296) drawn from the urban and suburban population. Younger boys scored higher than girls on externalizing problems and total problems scores, and older girls scored higher on internalizing problems. Younger children scored higher than the older children on total problems and externalizing problems scores. The comparisons with the US sample indicated that the levels of problem behaviour in 7- to 14-year-old children are similar to those found in the US. Lithuanian children had higher total problem scores; however, the effect sizes for other scales, except the attention problems scale and the somatic complaints scale, were very small. Similar to other studies, we found significant SES effects on total problem scores. Problem scores were highest for the lowest SES children. In general, this study supports previous findings concerning CBCL: similarities in emotional and behavioural problems outweigh differences in cross-cultural studies based on CBCL.

AB Background: Psychosocial problems, such as behavioural, emotional, and educational problems, are highly prevalent among children and adolescents. Early treatment may reduce these problems, if accurately identified. Validated questionnaires may support identification. The aim of this study is to assess the psychometric qualities of such a questionnaire, the Short Indicative Questionnaire for Psychosocial problems among Adolescents (KIVPA,) and to determine whether it is suitable for and adds to the early detection of psychosocial problems among adolescents. Methods: Data came from a national sample of 1,440 Dutch adolescents, using the KIVPA, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Of these, 1,248 provided data on all questionnaires (77.8%). The scale structure of the KIVPA was assessed; its sensitivity and specificity using CBCL, YSR and referral for psychosocial problems as criteria; and its contribution to detecting CBCL and YSR problems. Results: The KIVPA is mostly Uni-dimensional but the variance explained by its main factor is relatively low. The total KIVPA score discriminates between adolescents with and without problems on the three criteria. Using a clinical YSR total problem score as criterion, sensitivity and specificity are 0.82 and 0.85, respectively, at the proposed cut-off (area under-the ROC curve: 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-0.95). The odds ratio of a clinical YSR score for an elevated KIVPA score is 29.1 (95% Cl: 14.4-59.1), although the KIVPA mainly covers internalizing problems. Conclusion: The KIVPA has added value in the early detection of internalizing psychosocial problems, but is not sufficiently efficient.

AB The investigators examined the rates of psychiatric comorbidity for externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, using semistructured diagnostic interview and parent, teacher, and youth report on the Achenbach checklists. The study also evaluated the effects of conjunctive, compensatory, and disjunctive data combination strategies. Using the same data and identical diagnostic thresholds, between 5 and 74% of 189 youths presenting to an outpatient clinic were identified as having comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Parent report and semistructured interview indicated the highest comorbidity rates. Despite good cross-source agreement (rs.29-.58), there was very little agreement about which specific youths presented with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (kappas.14-.40). Results also indicate that single DSM-IV disorders, such as bipolar disorder, can manifest "comorbid" patterns of behavior problems on checklists.

AB Relations between depressed mood and delinquency were investigated in a longitudinal sample of 506 urban adolescent males across ages 13.5-17.5, while adjusting for common risk factors. Adolescents provided yearly reports of their delinquent activities and depressed mood, as well as reports of peer delinquency at age 13.5 (i.e., baseline). Primary caregivers and teachers provided reports of risk factors for depressed mood and delinquency such as aggressive behavior problems and low academic achievement. Two-level hierarchical generalized linear models of concurrent relations indicated that depressed mood predicted concurrent variety of delinquent acts, and more variety of delinquent acts predicted concurrent depressed mood, even after controlling common risk factors. Longitudinal analyses indicated that after controlling for common risk factors, depressed mood had a more robust effect on delinquency variety trajectories than delinquency variety had on depressed mood trajectories. Time-averaged depressed mood significantly predicted a more positive rate of change in delinquency variety across time. Baseline delinquency variety predicted baseline depressed mood and time-averaged delinquency variety predicted a more positive rate of change in depressed mood; however, both effects were marginally significant. Implications of the results for theory and intervention are discussed.

AB In a sample of 585 children assessed in kindergarten through 8th grade, we fit a confirmatory factor model to both mother- and teacher-reported symptoms on the Achenbach checklists (CBCL, TRF) and determined that a covariation factor of externalizing and internalizing behaviors existed, in addition to the pure-form factors of externalizing and internalizing for each reporter. In 3 structural equation models, between 8 and 67% of the variance in these 6 latent factors was accounted for by a set of antecedent child, sociocultural, parenting, and peer risk variables. Each of the 6 latent factors, taken 2 at a time, was predicted by a unique set of risk variables; however, there were some patterns that held for both mother- and teacher-report symptom factors: Child temperamental unadaptability and female gender were predictors of higher internalizing symptoms; child temperamental resistance to control, parental harsh punishment, male gender, low SES, and peer rejection were related to higher externalizing symptoms whereas child temperamental unadaptability was related to lower externalizing symptoms; and peer rejection and family stress were also related to the covarying, externalizing-plus-internalizing component of both mother and teacher reports.

AB The term and concept of "comorbidity" has been mired in controversy, although there is little question that the existence of covariation among psychiatric diagnoses poses significant challenges to current models of psychiatric classification and diagnosis. The papers in this Special Section underscore a number of important issues relevant to the comorbidity between and within childhood externalizing and internalizing disorders, and illustrate both methodological and substantive reasons for such comorbidity. Weiss, Susser, and Catron's distinction among common, broad-band specific, and narrow-band specific features provides a helpful framework for understanding the comorbidity of childhood externalizing and internalizing disorders (B, Weiss, K. Susser, & T. Catron, 1998). Hierarchical models of psychopathology help to dissolve the distinction between "splitters" and "lumpers" and point to variables that may elucidate the etiology of externalizing and internalizing disorders.

AB Examined the relations among perceived racism and externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, hopelessness, and self-concept in African American boys (N = 84). The experience of racism is a complex phenomenon that has been found to have negative psychological outcomes in adult studies of African Americans. There has been a gap in the empirical literature regarding the possible associations between perceived racism and children's psychological well-being. This study is an attempt to address that gap. Results demonstrated that experiences of racism were related to self- and parent-reported externalizing symptoms. Personal experiences of racism were related to self-reported internalizing symptoms, lower self-concept, and higher levels of hopelessness. Potential mediators (e.g., trait anger, hostile attribution bias) were analyzed. Additional analyses indicated that trait anger mediated a number of the observed relations between perceived racism and behavioral symptoms. The results of the study suggest that perceived racism is associated with multiple negative correlates for African American boys.

AB Objective: To examine whether "outer-directed irritability," a mood construct from the adult literature, characterizes a subgroup of disruptive behavior disordered children and adolescents previously shown to improve on divalproex, a mood stabilizer.
   Method. A sample (N = 20) of disruptive youth (aged 10-18 years) entering a divalproex treatment study of temper and irritable mood swings was compared to normal controls (N = 18) on measures of aggression/irritability directed against others (externalizing symptoms) and on aggression/irritability against self, anxiety, and depression (internalizing symptoms). All patients met DSM-IV criteria for a disruptive behavior disorder (oppositional defiant disorder of conduct disorder) in addition to research criteria.
   Results: "Outer-directed irritability" most clearly distinguished patients from controls (effect size 4.1) and did not correlate with other mood measures. Patients and controls showed no to minimal differences on internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusion: Disruptive behavior disordered children and adolescents characterized by outer-directed irritability exist, can be identified, and should be further investigated, especially since they are potentially treatable.

AB This research examined how syndromal approaches to assessment can obscure differences between children in the quality of their social interactions. Mixed boys (high for externalizing and internalizing problems) showed heterogeneity in the responses they evoked from others: For one subgroup, aggression and withdrawal evoked aversive responses from others, and even prosocial behavior evoked hostile peer responses; for the other, aggression and withdrawal evoked positive peer responses. Externalizing boys also showed heterogeneity in the patterning of their evoked responses. Within-group heterogeneity was not explained by boys' syndrome scores but was linked to their reactions to specific antecedent events. The results illustrate how a contextualized analysis of behavior can reveal distinctive social interactional patterns that underlie similar overall rates of problem behaviors.

The program involved separate groups for caregivers, adolescents, and children, which were designed to change potentially modifiable risk and protective factors for bereaved children. The evaluation involved random assignment of 156 families (244 children and adolescents) to the FBP or a self-study condition. Families participated in assessments at pretest, posttest, and 11-month follow-up. Results indicated that the FBP led to improved parenting, coping, and caregiver mental health and to reductions in stressful events at posttest. At follow-up, the FBP led to reduced internalizing and externalizing problems, but only for girls and those who had higher problem scores at baseline.

AB A controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a prevention program aimed at reducing depressive and anxious symptoms in rural school children. Seventh-grade children with elevated depression were selected. Nine primary schools (n = 90) were randomly assigned to receive the program, and 9 control schools (n = 99) received their usual health education classes. Children completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, explanatory style, and social skills. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach, 1991). No intervention effects were found for depression. Intervention group children reported less anxiety than the control group after the program and at 6-month follow-up and more optimistic explanations at postintervention. Intervention group parents reported fewer child internalizing and externalizing symptoms at postintervention only.

AB In this study we examined the relation among family life events, appraisal, and family protective factors in predicting behavioral outcome in 260 school-age children. Hierarchical analyses were conducted using appraisal-based calculations of family events and ratings on three potential family protective factors: family relations, personal growth, and systems maintenance. The results indicated several main effects for personal growth experiences, the negatively appraised, and the positively appraised family stress scores on adaptive behavior. In addition, two significant interactions were found among negatively endorsed family events and personal growth experiences, positive family relationships,and internalizing behavior. The forms of these interactions indicate that personal growth and family relationships appear to increase internalizing behavior as negatively endorsed family stress events increase. The contextual role of potential family protective factors and the influence of differential appraisal are discussed.

AB This research used structural equation modeling to examine relations among family dynamics, attorney involvement, and the adjustment of young children (0-6 years) at the time of parental separation. The article presents baseline data (N = 102 nonresidential fathers and N = 110 primary caretaking mothers) from a larger longitudinal study. Results showed that the effects of parental conflict on child outcomes were mediated by paternal involvement, the parent-child relationship, and attorney involvement. A scale assessing parental gatekeeping yielded two significant factors: Spouse's Influence on Parenting and Positive View of Spouse. Paternal involvement was related to children's adaptive behavior, whereas negative changes in parent-child relationships predicted behavior problems. Mothers who experienced greater psychological symptomatology were less likely to utilize an attorney, which in turn predicted greater internalizing problems in their children.

A nonclinical community sample of 51 families and their children's 1st-grade teachers (N = 41) participated. Both mothers and teachers completed a behavior-problem checklist in order to evaluate the incidence of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the children. Correlational statistics revealed significant associations between parents' avoidance and attacking strategies and their depressive symptoms. Also, parents' use of avoidance was related to more internalizing behaviors in the children. When hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the contributions of the parents' attributes to children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors, mothers' avoidance and an interaction between mothers' and fathers' avoidance were identified as significant predictors of children's internalizing behaviors.

AB We explored the perceptions that youth with and without self-reported mental health problems had of their social contexts (family, peer, and school) and the extent to which youth with mental health problems had received special education services in school. We examined data for 4,088 urban youth with self-reported externalizing, internalizing, comorbid, and no mental health problems in early adolescence. With regard to family context, students with comorbid problems reported significantly lower scores for parent attention to misbehavior than students without mental health problems, and students with internalizing problems reported significantly less positive parent-child relations than those with externalizing problems. With regard to peer context, students with externalizing and comorbid problems reported that significantly greater numbers of their friends were involved in risky behavior than did members of the other groups. With regard to school context, students with internalizing and comorbid problems reported feeling more anonymous and less well-liked by peers and teachers than students with externalizing problems. Significantly more internalizers and members of the comorbid group were in special education classes than expected. The majority of the students with self-reported mental health problems received services for learning disabilities.

AB To determine the association of parent, family, and adolescent variables with adolescent mental health service need and utilization. Method: Correlates of adolescent mental health service utilization, self-perceived need and unmet need were investigated in a general population sample of 1,120 Dutch adolescents aged 11 to 18 years (78% response rate). Results: 3.1 % of the sample had been referred for mental health services within the preceding year, and 3.8% reported unmet need. 7.7% of adolescents at risk for psychopathology, and 17.8% of those indicating a need for help, had been referred. Family stress and adolescent's self-reported problems were most strongly associated with service need and utilization. Internalizing problems, female gender, and low education level were associated with self-perceived unmet need. Adolescent ethnicity and competence in activities and school were associated with service use, but did not influence service need, while the opposite effect was found for adolescent age and parental psychopathology. Conclusion: In designing intervention programs aimed at increasing adolescent mental health service use, distinctions should be made between efforts focused at adolescents not recognizing their problems, and those with unmet need.

AB To investigate effects of the timing of initial exposure to maternal depression and marital conflict on kindergarten children's mental health symptoms. Method: For 406 families (of 570 originally recruited), mothers reported on major depression and marital conflict on multiple occasions in the child's infancy and toddler/preschool periods. Mothers and teachers completed the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire when children were in kindergarten. Results: Children evidenced co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms, although the mix was more toward internalizing for girls and externalizing for boys. Symptoms were more severe among children exposed to either adversity, and these effects were additive. Boys exposed to maternal depression in infancy had a preponderance of internalizing behaviors, but if subsequently exposed to marital conflict, the mix toward externalizing behaviors increased to match levels of clinic-referred children. For girls, the preponderance of internalizing symptoms increased to match levels of clinic-referred children when initial exposure to marital conflict occurred in the toddler/preschool period. Conclusions: It is important to consider both adversities across developmental periods, to distinguish the symptom severity from directionality, and to consider child gender. Prevention and intervention efforts that consider these findings are warranted.

AB The significance of the father-child relationship for the development of childhood maladjustment has rarely been discussed in contrast to the early mother-child relationship. This study examines the associations between the father-toddler interaction and behavioral problems of children aged 2-8 years. In a prospective study of children at risk (Mannheim Study of Risk Children), 97 father-child dyads at the child's age of 2 years were videotaped and evaluated. Behavioral problems were assessed at the ages of 2,4 112, and 8 years using a parent interview and at 8 years additionally with Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist. Fathers were found to be more restrictive towards their disturbed daughters than towards their sons. Between the ages of 2 and 8 years, children of less supportive fathers presented with more behavioral problems than children supportive fathers,While associations with later psychopathology in boys were inconsistent, a number of significant links emerged in girls.

AB This study examined the relationship of acculturation and Central American adolescents' behavioral problems as reported by their parents. Cross-sectional survey data regarding demography, acculturation, and psychosocial functioning was examined among 112 urban adolescent immigrants, aged 12 to 17 years. Analysis indicated that, when parents and adolescents differed in acculturation, parents most frequently rated their adolescent with internalizing symptoms at a clinically elevated level. Parents' education and distress predicted parents' reports of adolescents' psychosocial problems beyond demographic factors, respondents' characteristics, and parents' and adolescents' acculturation. Higher relative acculturation among adolescents, but not parents, was the most robust predictor of parental distress scores, indicating that parental distress mediates the relationship between high relative acculturation of the adolescents and their psychosocial problems as reported by parents. Implications for research and clinicians conducting mental health interventions with Central American populations are briefly discussed.

AB Objective: The current study examines multiple empirically based perspectives (i.e., child, caregiver, and clinician) of behavior and functioning as they contribute to the clinical and psychosocial profile of children (aged 5 to 17.5 years) with reported histories of sexual abuse.
   Method: A large, multi-site data set of children referred into Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services both with and without reported histories of sexual abuse, was examined. Seven hundred and fifty-nine children with a reported history of sexual abuse were compared to 2722 without such a history on caregiver and child reported behavior, clinician rated functioning, diagnosis, demographic variables, and life challenges.
   Results: The multiple perspectives contributed unique and specific information to regression models: caregiver-reported behavior contributed information about externalizing behavior while child-reported behavior added information about internalizing behavior and clinician ratings about self-harmful behavior. Children with reported histories of sexual abuse were also more likely to be female, Caucasian, and have reported histories of life challenges (e.g., physical abuse, substance use, running away). Child sexual abuse was associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety diagnoses, and lower rates of substance abuse, conduct, and attention deficit disorder diagnoses.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that the profile of children entering into Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services with reported histories of sexual abuse, as compared to those without such histories, is complex and best understood via multiple perspectives. Caregiver, child and clinician rated information, when taken together, provide a comprehensive clinical and psychosocial profile around which to plan and implement individualized service plans.

AB Objective To facilitate understanding of disagreement between mothers and adolescents when they report on adolescents' mental symptoms, discrepancy of reports were studied in relation to depressive symptoms of mothers and self-esteem of adolescents.
   Participants Sixty-eight mother-adolescent pairs participated. All the adolescents (11-17 years) were referred to child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics in Norway for emotional or behavioural disorders.
   Methods The adolescents completed the questionnaire Youth Self Report (YSR), and mothers completed the corresponding Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Maternal depression was measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales and adolescent self-esteem was measured with Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents.
   Results Mothers' level of depression emerged as a significant variable (P < 0.001) predicting CBCL-YSR discrepancy on internalizing disorders, explaining 41% of the variance. With increased levels of depression mothers tended to report more internalizing problems compared to the adolescents. For mother-adolescent discrepancy on externalizing problems, adolescents' age was the most significant variable. With increasing age the adolescents were more in agreement with their mothers when reporting their externalizing problems. But also self-esteem problems concerning their looks made adolescents inclined to admit more externalizing problems, thus being more in agreement with their mothers.
   Conclusions Subjective, psychological variables such as mothers' level of depression and self-esteem of adolescents may be useful to consider when interpreting informant discrepancy concerning the mental problems of adolescents.

ID HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; ABUSE; STUDENTS; IMPACT; HIV
AB Of 490 middle and high school students attending alternative schools who participated in this study, 18.2% of females and 6.7% of males reported a past unwanted sexual experience. Relative to nonabused subjects,female and male adolescents who reported a forced sexual experience were more likely to exhibit externalizing problems such as sexual risk behaviors and internalizing problems such as depression and suicidal thoughts in the past two weeks. Females with a history of a coercive sexual experience also had increased odds of drug and alcohol use, and violence-related behaviors. The magnitude of these associations ranged from a twofold increase to a tenfold increase. Controlling for ethnicity, family income, and family support had less impact on the strength of associations between a forced sexual experience and sexual risk behaviors for females than for males. A forced sexual experience remained significantly associated with depression for females and suicidal thoughts for males. Alcohol use in the past 30 days was the only substance use-related problem that remained significant for females. Violence-related behaviors did not remain significant in the presence of control variables for females. Interventions focusing on adolescents with a history of a coercive sexual experience in general, and in alternative schools in particular, are suggested by these results. More research focusing on the differential impact of a coercive sexual experience on males and females is crucial.

AB Objective: To identify the most important social and personal characteristics related to early sexual debut among troubled teenagers. Method: One hundred ninety-eight youths aged 12-19 years were recruited from outpatient mental health clinics and completed self-reports and interviews about their age of sexual debut; family, peer, and partner relationships (e.g., parental hostile control, negative peer influence, need for intimacy); and personal characteristics (e.g., achievement motivation, externalizing problems). Broad-band (externalizing, internalizing) and narrow-band (depression/anxiety, delinquency) psychopathology was assessed with the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Optimal Data Analysis was used to generate a classification tree model to identify variables associated with whether or not youths initiated oral, vaginal, and/or anal sexual activity before or after age 14. Three social context variables (parental hostile control, negative and positive peer influence) and one personal characteristic (externalizing problems) correctly classified 87.4% of teenagers as initiating sexual activity at less than or equal to14 or >14 years of age. Conclusions: Parental behavior and peer influence were the most important variables associated with the timing of sexual debut. Results support a social-personal framework for understanding sexual risk-taking among adolescents in psychiatric care, and the data offer relatively strong evidence that specific factors could be used to identify troubled teens at risk for early sexual debut.

AB The prevalence and comorbidity of internalizing and externalizing syndromes was investigated in a clinical sample of children (n = 77) with dyslexia. In the normoriented broadband-screening of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) the rate of behavioral disorders is four times higher than in the standardisation sample. As a consequence of specific administrative prevalence the children have - in contrast to prospective studies - more internalizing than externalizing problems (according to the secondary scales of the CBCL). Psychiatric syndromes have been diagnosed in 66,2 percent: most frequently adjustment disorders, because of nonconformity to performance standards, followed by hyperkinetic disorders and anxiety. In all different diagnosis groups the scores of both secondary scales of the CBCL lie within or near the clinical range, only the priority was different. The high rate of psychiatric disorders indicates a great demand of personal or psychotherapeutic support in referred children with dyslexia, that has to be provided - besides interventions focusing on performance deficits.

AB Psychiatric co-morbidity is an important risk factor for chronification of primary headache into adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent and clinical relevance of emotional and behavioural problems in children and adolescents with primary headache. Children and adolescents (n = 128) with primary headache (International Headache Society, codes 1.1, 1.2, 2.1) and 83 matched controls aged 6-18 years were examined by standardized dimensional psychometrical tests (Child Behaviour Checklist, Depression Inventory for Children and Adolescents, Anxiety Questionnaire for Pupils). Children and adolescents with primary headache suffer more often from internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, somatization) than healthy controls. The detected emotional and behavioural problems are clinically relevant and require particular therapy in every third child suffering from headache. Two out of three children and adolescents with primary headache do not show clinically relevant psychopathology and may benefit from minimal therapeutic intervention. One of three examined headache patients needs additional psychiatric therapy.

AB This study investigates the subtypal patterns of psychosocial functioning of children with below average IQ (BAIQ) using the application of both Q-factor analysis and profile-matching. The results suggest that the psychosocial dimensions of children with BAIQ are quite similar to those of children with LD in a general sense. Many of the same subtypes were derived, and the proportions of children displaying normal, mild, and severe levels of psychopathology were not significantly different from those of children with LD. There were some minor differences, however: For example, children with BAIQ exhibited a greater tendency to display psychopathology with internalizing features. Consistent with previous research involving children with LD, there were no changes in either type or severity of psychopathology with advancing years.

Participants included 93 4th-grade children assigned to the treatment group or a no-treatment control group. The school-based program, which lasts the 9-month academic year, provides individual, group, classroom, teacher, and parent training in the RECAP skills-development curriculum, which was derived from empirically supported treatment programs for nonconcurrent internalizing and externalizing problems. Outcome assessments included parent-, teacher-, self-, and peer reports. A mixed hierarchical linear models analysis indicated that. overall, treatment children's rate of improvement in both internalizing and externalizing problems was significantly greater than that for control participants.

AB The association between enuresis and psychopathology (e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) has been well studied. However, past research failed to adjust this relationship for the influence of sociodemographic variables underlying both problems. This study, using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale, compares 154 enuretic children with a control group of 153 children who had urinary control. The results reveal that enuretic children show significantly higher scores on both questionnaires. However, when sociodemographic variables are entered in the analysis, group differences disappear, and social class category, as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES), becomes a significant factor in explaining the variance in problem scores. Although children with enuresis have more internalizing, externalizing, and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms than continent children, when the analysis is performed controlling for SES, this relationship is no longer present.

AB The adjustment problems associated with sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological maltreatment, neglect, and witnessing family violence during childhood were examined in three studies. Study 1 demonstrated significant overlap between maltreatment types in parent reports (N = 50) of maltreatment experiences of their child aged 5-12 years. Parental sexual punitiveness, traditionality, family adaptability and family cohesion significantly predicted scores on 4 maltreatment scales and children's externalizing behavior problems. Level of maltreatment predicted internalizing, externalizing, and sexual behavior problems. In Study 2, significant overlap was found between adults' retrospective reports (N = 138) of all 5 types of maltreating behaviors. Parental sexual punitiveness, traditionality, family adaptability, and family cohesion during childhood predicted the level of maltreatment and current psychopathology. Although child maltreatment scores predicted psychopathology, childhood family variables were better predictors of adjustment. Study 3 demonstrated that child maltreatment scores predicted positive aspects of adult adaptive functioning (N = 95).

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the spillover of youth perceptions of interparental conflict (IPC) into ineffective parenting and youth problem behaviors in a sample of 542 European-American (EA) and 150 African-American (AA) youth. Data were collected from youth aged 10 through 18 years using a school-based survey. The findings indicated that IPC was associated positively with youth problem behaviors in both European-American and African-American samples. For EA families, IPC was linked with youth externalizing problem behaviors through lower levels of parental monitoring, maternal acceptance, and higher levels of parent-youth conflict, and with internalizing problem behaviors through higher levels of maternal psychological control and parent-youth conflict. Although IPC was associated with higher levels of parent-youth conflict and maternal psychological control and lower levels of parental monitoring in AA families, the spillover model received minimal support because parenting measures were not associated systematically with youth problem behaviors.

AB The study examines how externalizing as well as internalizing behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence predict young adults' personalities as represented by Loevinger's (1976) model of ego development, The sample consisted of 103 individuals studied longitudinally from ages 7 to 22. Behavioral problems were measured by teacher ratings at ages 9, 12 and 15, whereas egolevel was assessed once at age 22. Overall, both kinds of behavioral problems were substantially associated with ego-level attainment at age 22, even when gender, SES and level of education were controlled. Externalizing problems specifically predicted ego-level attainment below conformity (less than or equal to E3). By contrast, internalizing problems were related particularly to difficulties in attaining ego-levels above conformity (greater than or equal to E6). The study demonstrates that behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence predict young adults' ego-level attainment in unique and meaningful ways.

AB We compared twins to their gender-matched singleton classmates in peer-assessed behavioral adjustment. Our samples include 1874 11- to 12-year-old Finnish twins (687 monozygotic, MZ; 610 same-sex dizygotic, SSDZ; 577 opposite-sex dizygotic, OSDZ) and their 23,200 non-twin classmates. Data were collected using a 30-item Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory containing three factors and their subscales. We found tvvin-singleton differences: classmates rated twin girls and boys higher than gender-matched singletons in Adaptive Behaviors (constructive, compliant, and socially active behavior), and those effects were particularly evident among OSDZ twins for assessments of social interaction, popularity, and leadership. We found no evidence that individual twins differ from singletons in Externalizing (hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, aggression) or Internalizing Problem Behaviors (depressive symptoms, social anxiety). Nor did we find systematic differences between MZ and SSDZ twins. Among both twins and singletons, boys exceeded girls in Externalizing, and girls exceeded boys in Internalizing Problem Behaviors. Results suggest that a twinship forms a positive developmental environment for socioemotional behavior, particularly among OSDZ twins.

AB This study examined the relative influence of three parenting behaviors (support, behavioral control, and psychological control) and deviant peers on trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems in early adolescence. A white, working-to-middle-class sample of adolescents and their mothers and fathers in two-earner families participated in a 31/2year longitudinal study (N = 109 families). The study began when the adolescents were in sixth grade (M age = 11.5 years). Analyses showed that parents' firm behavioral control seemed to halt the upward trajectory in externalizing problems among adolescents with deviant peers. Initial levels of internalizing problems were higher among adolescents with parents who reported lower levels of behavioral control and among adolescents with deviant peers. This study suggests that parenting exerts an important influence in adolescents' lives and may do so even in the face of potentially negative peer influence.

AB The current article presents a review on psychiatric pathology in delinquent adolescents. The putative developmental significance of this co-occurrence is discussed within Moffitt's [Psychol. Rev. 100 (1993) 674] developmental framework on antisocial behavior. Articles on psychopathology in delinquent adolescents were retrieved through search engines (MEDLINE, Psychlit) and by exploration of references in those articles.' Substantial evidence is at hand that delinquent adolescents have higher rates of externalizing and internalizing disorders when compared to adolescents in the general population. Although substantial limitations hamper interpretation of the findings, the marked similarities across a diversity of samples from different countries suggest that the findings are fairly generalizable. Evidence was found for differences in prevalence and developmental significance of psychiatric pathology between adolescent limited (AL) offenders and life-course persistent (LCP) offenders. Although psychopathology was more severe in LCP offenders, AL offenders still had significant and potential harmful levels of psychopathology. These findings emphasize the necessity of developing mental health services to delinquent adolescents and the necessity of adequate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in these adolescents.

AB In this longitudinal study, we examined the relations between emotion knowledge in first grade, teacher reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors from first grade, and children's self-reported internalizing behaviors in fifth grade. At Time 1, we assessed emotion knowledge, expressive vocabulary, caregiver-reported earned income, and teacher-rated internalizing and externalizing behaviors in 7-year-old children from economically disadvantaged families (N = 154). At Time 2, when the children were age 11, we collected children's self-reports of negative emotions, depression, anxiety, and loneliness. First grade teacher-reported externalizing behaviors, but not first grade internalizing behaviors, were positively related to children's self-reports of internalizing behaviors in fifth grade. First grade emotion knowledge accounted for a significant amount-of variance in children's self-reports of internalizing symptoms 4 years later, after controlling for per capita earned income, expressive vocabulary, and teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors in first grade.

AB Individual differences in salivary testosterone were examined in 213 adolescents (106 boys, 107 girls; mean age 13.66 years) in relation to externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. Self- and parent-report measures of behavior problems and psychiatric symptoms were obtained. Latent anxiety-depression, disruptive behavior, and attention problem constructs were developed using multitrait, multimethod procedures. Saliva samples were collected in the morning, midday, and late afternoon on multiple days and were later assayed for testosterone. Latent constructs were derived for testosterone level and diurnal variation across the six sampling occasions. Structural equations modeled relationships between problem behavior and intra- and interindividual differences in testosterone separately by gender. For boys, lower levels of testosterone and testosterone levels that decreased more slowly across the day were related to higher levels of anxiety-depression and attention problems. These associations were not moderated by pubertal development. For girls,steep declines in testosterone production across the day related to higher levels of disruptive behavior problems, but this association was only evident after including pubertal development as a moderator in the. model. These findings raise novel questions regarding the nature and magnitude of links between testosterone and problem behavior in youth.

AB A diathesis-stress interaction model is used to describe multifinality in adolescent internalizing and risky behavioral outcomes. Problematic behavior associated with adolescent insecure preoccupation (a diathesis) was expected to interact with the level of maternal autonomous discourse (a stressor) to predict specific adolescent outcomes. Assessments of adolescent preoccupied attachment organization, observations of maternal displays of autonomy in mother-adolescent interactions, and adolescent reports of internalizing symptoms and risky behaviors were obtained at age 16. As predicted, maternal autonomy in the mother-adolescent relationship helped to explain multifinality in dysfunctional symptoms among preoccupied adolescents. Adolescent preoccupation was more strongly linked to internalizing behavior when mothers demonstrated low levels of autonomy in interactions with their adolescents and more strongly linked to risky behavior when mothers displayed extremely high levels of autonomy. Implications for autonomy processes in increasing our understanding of how adolescent insecure-preoccupation relates to profiles of specific problems during adolescence are discussed as is the importance of exploring the role of attachment in different contexts.

TI Emotionality, Emotion Regulation, and Adaptation Among 5-to 8-Year-Old
   Children
SO EMOTION
LA English
DT Article
AB This study investigated relations between emotionality, emotion regulation, and children's behavioral adaptation in a longitudinal design. Mothers rated emotionality and emotion regulation related to anger, fear, and positive emotions-exuberance for 151 children at age 5 and later at age 6 years 6 months. Emotionality and emotion regulation measures were modestly related. Preschool ratings at age 6 (n = 125), maternal ratings at age 6 years 6 months (n = 133), and elementary school ratings at age 8 (n = 135) of problems and competence were also collected. High anger emotionality and low regulation of positive emotions and exuberance predicted externalizing problem behavior and prosocial behavior. High fear emotionality and low fear regulation predicted internalizing problem behavior. There were few interactive effects of emotionality and regulation.

AB In this paper we examine the prevalence of problem behaviors in samples of adolescents who were adopted from a foreign country as infants or young children. We reviewed ten studies and performed a meta-analysis, comparing 2317 internationally adopted adolescents with 14,345 nonadopted adolescents. Results indicate that internationally adopted adolescents exhibit more behavior problems than do nonadopted adolescents (d = 0.08; p = 0.02), with the difference seen in externalizing (d = 0.11; p = 0.00), but not in internalizing (d = 0.05; p = 0.12), behavior problems. Significantly more total behavior problems were seen in adopted than in nonadopted girls (d = 0.10; p = 0.03), but not in adopted boys compared to nonadopted ones (d = 0.07; p = 0.22). All differences, however, were small. The differences between adopted and nonadopted adolescents were somewhat larger when we considered behavior problems in the clinical range. The majority of the adopted adolescents are well adjusted and do not display significantly more problem behaviors than do their nonadopted peers.

AB Examined relations among family, instability and adolescent's psychological functioning using family models of children's emotional security in a sample of 220 young adolescents and their primary caregivers. Primary caregiver reports of family instability were associated with multiple informant measures of adolescent internalizing and externalizings symptoms. Findings from structural equation models supported the hypothesis that family instability increases adolescent risk for psychological problems by directly undermining their insecure appraisals of the family. Results also supported a pathway whereby family instability predicted parenting difficulties and parenting difficulties, in turn, indirectly predicted adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms through its association with lower levels of perceived insecurity in the family. Results are discussed in relation to how they advance process-oriented conceptualizations of family instability.

AB Investigated the relations among child maltreatment, children's social self-efficacy, and behavioral adjustment. Data were collected on 305 maltreated and 795 non-maltreated children from low-income families (ages 5 to 12 years) who were assessed on perceived social self-efficacy and evaluated by camp counselors on internalizing and externalizing symptomatology Younger (<8 years) maltreated children exhibited inflated levels of perceived self-efficacy in conflictual peer interactions compared to younger nonmaltreated children. Younger maltreated children with higher levels of social self-efficacy showed significantly less internalizing behaviors compared to younger maltreated children with lower levels of social self-efficacy. For older children (>8 years), regardless of maltreatment status, higher levels of perceived social self-efficacy in conflict situations were related to lower levels of internalizing symptomatology. The results are discussed as suggestive of the role of children's social self-efficacy as a protective factor in the link between maltreatment and internalizing symptomatology.

AB The purpose of this study was to document deficits in the perception of nonverbal emotion cues that have been implicated as a cause of social maladjustment in children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD). Thirty-three children between the ages of 9 and 14 identified as having NLD, verbal learning disabilities (VLD), or as nonlearning disabled psychiatric controls were administered the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy and Personality Inventory for Children-Revised (PIC-R) to measure social perception and social adjustment, respectively. The NLD group was significantly less accurate than were the VLD and control groups in interpreting adult facial expressions and gestures, and significantly less accurate than was control group in interpreting subtle (i.e., low intensity) adult facial expressions There was a nonsignificant trend toward more social skill deficits demonstrated on the PIER by the NLD group than the other study groups Children with NLD were twice as likely as children with VLD to be diagnosed with an internalizing disorder. There were also consistent and compelling trends in the predicted direction with the NLD group showing the most impairment on measures of nonverbal perception.

AB This study examined the interplay of marital and severe parental physical aggression, and their links to child behavior problems, in 232 families of clinic-referred adolescents. Combined reports from mothers and adolescents indicated that two thirds of adolescents exposed to marital aggression in the past year had also experienced parental aggression. Mothers and fathers who used and/or were victims of marital aggression were both more likely to direct aggression toward their adolescent. Mother and youth reports of marital aggression were tied to each party's report of greater externalizing problems and to youth reports of greater internalizing problems. Severe parental aggression uniquely predicted maternal reports of both behavior problems, after controlling for marital aggression; the reverse was not true. Also, adolescents exposed to both types of family aggression did not display greater maladjustment than those subjected to only one type of family aggression.

AB Objective: To evaluate short- and long-term effects of time-limited psychodynamic psychotherapy (PP) for children with internalizing disorders. Method: Fifty-eight outpatient children (6.3-10.9 years old), seen in a process of routine care and meeting DSM-IV criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder, were assigned to either active treatment or community services. Subjects were measured at baseline, after 6 months, and at a 2-year follow-up, by Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCC). Results: Major improvements in the experimental group were found in C-GAS and CBCL. These differences are noted at different times, with the C-GAS findings seen at 6 months and the CBCL findings at 2-year follow-up. Significant differences were found also for externalizing syndrome scales. Conclusions: PP is effective in treating internalizing disorders in routine outpatient care. The benefits of treatment are manifest both immediately and with delayed onset (sleeper effect). The finding that PP patients sought mental health services at a significantly lower rate than comparison conditions represents an important economic impact of PP.

AB The aim of this cross-sectional study is to report the self-destructive and suicidal behavior of 98 children and adolescents in child welfare institutions. The children were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and questionnaires about suicidal and violent behavior, filled in by the child's key worker. Thirty-two per cent of the sample had presented suicidal thoughts, threats or suicide attempts during the previous 6 months. Suicidality was associated with low general functioning level (CGAS < 61), self-mutilating behavior and violence. Furthermore, suicidal children had significantly higher CBCL total, externalizing, internalizing, anxious-depressive and aggressive scores. Children with suicide attempts (8% of the sample) had a significantly higher number of different types of traumatic experiences before the placement and higher somatization syndrome scores compared to children with suicidal ideation or non-suicidal children.

AB A study is presented which aims at measuring the Big Five factors in late childhood through self-report as well as parent and teacher ratings. First, several factor analyses examined self-report and teacher and parent ratings on a 65-item questionnaire developed for assessing the Big Five. Five clear factors emerged from these analyses conducted on self-report and other ratings of elementary and junior high school children. Factors showed a high degree of congruence. Self-reports, parent and teacher ratings resulted moderately although significantly convergent. Second, as a validation step, the Big Five factors were used as concurrent predictors of academic achievement and of Externalizing and Internalizing problematic behavior syndromes. Intellect/Openness rand Conscientiousness resulted as important predictors of Academic Achievement. Externalizing problems were associated to low Conscientiousness and low Emotional Stability, Internalizing problems, to low Emotional Stability. Finally, also the correlations of the Big Five factors with the dimensions of Sybil Eysenck's Junior Personality Questionnaire further corroborated the construct validity of the questionnaire.

AB This brief report details a study of the construct validity of the Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC) in comparison with the Child Self-Report Form of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC). Using self-reports of 121 students ages 8-12 from general education classes, who were administered both measures, correlational data were obtained between the scores of the two instruments. ISSC factor and total scores were found to have weak associations with the BASC School Adjustment Scales, and negatively associations with the BASC personal adjustment scales, providing discriminant evidence of the construct validity of the ISSC. Moderate to strong correlations were found between ISSC scores and the BASC Clinical Maladjustment, Other Problems, and Emotional Symptoms Index scores, evidencing convergent construct validity between the two measures. These results support the validity and clinical use of the ISSC as a measure of internalizing symptoms and emotional problems. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The study examines the implementation and efficacy of a social problem-solving program for preschool children with cognitive and social developmental deficits. Thirty-two children (16 in the training group and 16 controls) completed a social problem-solving task and were rated by their preschool teacher before (pretest), one month after (posttest), and four months after (follow up) the intervention. Program implementation was assessed by trainer ratings of the children's behavior during the training sessions. Results indicated that the implementation was adequate; because the children nearly always exhibited on-task behavior. Substantial program effects on social problem-solving measures as well as on internalizing and externalizing problem scores could be observed in both the posttest and the follow up. Because these effects correspond with findings from international evaluations of social problem-solving programs, it is concluded that such interventions are a useful tool in the field of selective prevention.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the association between seizures and behavior problems in children with new-onset seizures using teachers' ratings of behavior. Subjects were 209 children with new-onset seizures and 93 children with asthma. Teacher ratings of behavior were collected prospectively over 24 months to determine differences between children with recurrent seizures, children without recurrent seizures, and children with asthma. During the 2-year period, 155 (74%) children had at least one recurring seizure. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance both with and without covariates. Controlling for covariates, children experiencing recurrent seizures had higher Total (P = 0.002) and Internalizing (P = 0.018) Behavior Problems scores across all times than those not experiencing recurrent seizures. Children with asthma were similar to children not experiencing recurrent seizures. The association between seizures and behavioral problems was supported using behavioral ratings from teachers.

AB Examined whether parents' symptoms and qualitative and quantitative aspects of parent-child relationships make unique contributions to mothers' and fathers' reports of, and mother-child, father-child, and father-mother discrepancies on, children's behavior. Participants were 100 children, aged 10-12, and their mothers and fathers. Parents' symptoms and parent-child relationships made unique contributions to both parents' ratings of externalizing behavior. Although parent-child relationship variables were related to both parents' ratings of internalizing behavior, only parents' symptoms made unique contributions. On mother-child and father-child discrepancies, differences emerged between mother and father, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Both fathers' and mothers' symptoms contributed to father-mother discrepancies on both behavior types, with parent-child relationships contributing unique variance to discrepancies on internalizing behavior. Results highlight the importance of each informant's symptoms and relationship variables in understanding informant discrepancies.

AB Mothers generalized beliefs about adolescents were used to predict a mother's expectations for her own child's adolescent years. Participants were 75 mothers of children in either sixth grade or seventh grade. Generalized beliefs about adolescents predicted the mother's expectations for her own young adolescent even after accounting for the young adolescent's current attributes (e.g., depressed mood, closeness to mother). For example, the more likely a mother was to believe that adolescents as a group are conforming, risk-taking and rebellious, or internalizing, the more likely she was to expect adolescence to be difficult for her own child. Greater beliefs that adolescents are upstanding/prosocial predicted greater expectations for a closer parent/child relationship during the child's adolescence. The link between a mother's generalized beliefs and her expectations for her young adolescent did not vary by the child's pubertal development or gender Potential implications of parental beliefs concerning adolescence for parenting and parent/child relationships are discussed.

AB The impact of maternal victimization on the behavioral, social, emotional, and cognitive development in a group of 206 low- income, predominantly African American children from inner city, pediatric primary health care clinics was explored using mother, teacher, and self- report data. Results revealed that mothers with a victimization history reported more externalizing and internalizing behaviors in their children, compared to mothers who had not been victimized. Maternal victimization history was not related to teachers' ratings of children's behavior, child reports of social competence and depression, or standardized assessments of cognitive development. The relation between mothers' history of victimization and their reports of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in their children was mediated by pathways through maternal depression and disciplinary practices (verbal aggression). These findings provide evidence for the link between maternal victimization and children's behavior problems. Treatment for victimized mothers that reduces their depressive symptoms and promotes adaptive parenting practices may lead to fewer behavior problems in their children.

AB Objective: To investigate correlates of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in a clinical sample of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: Parent and teacher Child Behavior Checklists were administered to 300 children with ADHD to ascertain comorbid symptoms. Based on previous research, a seven-step hierarchical regression analysis was developed. Six hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with either parent or teacher Child Behavior Checklist aggression, delinquency, or anxious/depressive comorbid symptoms as dependent measures. Results: Controlling for (1) variables known to increase risk for ADHD child psychopathology and (2) estimated duration of ADHD, our results suggest that the presence of comorbid symptoms is influenced by age of onset. An early age of onset of ADHD was correlated with a greater rate of parent-reported child aggressive symptoms, and a later age of onset was correlated with a greater rate of parent-reported child anxious/depressive symptoms. Elevated levels of comorbid externalizing and internalizing symptoms are associated with greater ADHD symptom severity. Conclusions: Comorbid externalizing and internalizing symptoms are correlated with age of ADHD onset and are related to the severity of clinical presentation in a referred sample of children with ADHD.

AB This study examined internal consistency, concurrent validity, and test-retest reliability of a French-Canadian translation of Achenbach's Youth Self-Report YSR; (Achenbach, 1991a) in a nonreferred sample, ages 13-18. Forty-eight bilingual and 64 English-speaking adolescents and their parents participated. ANOVA comparing the standard English YSR and Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991b) indicated no main effects for adolescent gender or language, but adolescents reported more pathology than did their parents. The standard and French YSR scales were highly correlated (r = .96-.98), and parallel items elicited similar responses. Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the French YSR scales ranged from 0.83 to 0.92, and test-retest correlations were robust (r = .85-.88). Bilinguals who spoke predominantly French at home reported more internalizing pathology on the French than on the English YSR, but external validation is necessary to determine which report is more valid. Further investigation of the French YSR in referred samples is recommended.

AB Investigated in this study were hypothesized reciprocal influences between stressful life events and adolescent maladjustment using data from a 6-year, prospective longitudinal study Stressful life experiences, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors were assessed for a sample of adolescents (215 males, 236 females) living in the rural Midwest. From 7th to 12th grades, autoregressive analyses showed that stressful life events and these two forms of maladjustment were reciprocally interrelated over time. For example, stressful life events at One point significantly predicted delinquent behaviors 1 year. later, which, in turn, significantly predicted stressful life events I year later, and vice versa. The findings provide evidence for the accumulating disadvantage for adolescents that results from the mutual reinforcement of problematic situations and adjustment problems over time.

AB A diathesis-stress model was proposed in which the joint forces of individual vulnerability (anxious solitude) and interpersonal adversity (peer exclusion) predict depressive symptoms in children over time. Children's (N = 388; 50% female) social behavior, peer exclusion, and emotional adjustment were assessed at kindergarten entry and every spring thereafter through 4th grade, primarily by teacher report. Results indicated that anxious solitude and peer exclusion co-occur in children soon after kindergarten entry and that anxious solitary children who are excluded early on, in comparison with their nonexcluded anxious solitary counterparts, display greater stability in their subsequent display of anxious solitude. As hypothesized, the joint influence of anxious solitude and exclusion predicted the most elevated depressive symptom trajectories.

DT Article
DE metaphors; relaxation training; compliance; child therapy
AB Despite the widespread use of metaphors to teach relaxation, there is no research to explore whether children prefer and/or respond better to metaphorical compared to literal instructions. Thus, our primary goal was to investigate preference for and compliance with literal versus metaphorical instructions commonly used to teach relaxation to children. We exposed 33 non-clinical preschool children to both literal (e.g., squeeze your shoulders LIP to your ears) and metaphorical (e.g., pretend you are a turtle going into its shell) instructions. We assessed preferences by asking children to identify their "favorite" exercise(s), and coded compliance with instructions. Our results show that all children preferred metaphors to literal instructions. Although there was no overall difference in compliance to either set of instructions, compliance was high with both sets of instructions, and boys were more compliant with whichever instruction set was administered first. Our findings also suggest that internalizing symptoms and higher levels of cognitive functioning are related to greater compliance with metaphors. We discuss clinical and research implications and make specific suggestions regarding the effective use of metaphors in child behavior therapy. (C) 2003 by The Haworth Press Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Assessment issues with families of disruptive children ages 3 to 8 years, and depressed mothers are of significant clinical and research importance. Given the long-term deleterious effects that parenting styles of depressed mothers may have on children, and given that interventions for families with disruptive children frequently include behavioral family therapy, clinical assessment should include some evaluation of how parenting is related to the behavior of children of depressed mothers. Previous observational studies of depressed mothers and their disruptive children have failed to identity behavioral differences between these families and families of similarly disruptive children whose mothers are not depressed. This failure to identify differences presents a conundrum for clinicians: a widely reported parenting style, with well-reported child behavior sequelae has not yet been linked with identified moment-to moment interactions between mother and child. This paper investigates some characteristics of families with disruptive children and depressed mothers, and compares the observed behaviors of disruptive children of depressed and non-depressed mothers.
   Fifty mother-child dyads: 14 depressed mothers with disruptive children, 17 non-depressed mothers with disruptive children, and 19 nonproblem controls participated. Differences observed suggest that, while children of depressed mothers employed a similar range of disruptive behaviors to other disruptive children, the density of those behaviors differed. Implications for intervention are discussed. (C) 2003 by The Haworth Press. Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using data from a longitudinal sample of former and current welfare recipients in Michigan spanning 1997-1999, this study examines how transitions from welfare to work affect parenting behavior and child behavior problems. We use a fixed-effects regression design to control for all time-invariant characteristics of mothers and children that may bias estimates of the associations between maternal work behavior and child well-being. We find that moving from welfare-reliance to combining welfare and work is associated with a decrease in harsh parenting, an increase in positive parenting, and decreases in both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems among children. We do not find evidence that parenting practices account for the associations between the transition from welfare to work and children's behavior problems. Overall, these results suggest that policies that allow women to combine welfare and work may be most beneficial for children.

AB Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a chronic illness characterized by loss of motor function. The aim of the study was to investigate behavioural adjustment in 96 children and adolescents with SMA (47 males, 49 females; mean age 11 years 2 months, range 6 to 18 years). Forty-five non-affected siblings (26 males, 19 females; mean age 11 years 6 months, range 6 to 18 years) and 59 normally developing children (33 males, 26 females; mean age 10 years 8 months, range 6 to 18 years) were recruited as control participants. Behavioural symptoms were measured with the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and disorders were assessed with a structured psychiatric interview (Kinder-DIPS). Of the patients with SMA, 12.5% fulfilled the criteria for an ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnosis, with separation anxiety disorder being the most common diagnosis. The CBCL total score was in the clinical range for 11.5% of patients, 20% of the siblings, and 11.7% of the control children; the externalizing score rates were 2.1%, 22.2%, and 11.9% respectively; the internalizing score 18.9%,24.4%, and 13.6% respectively. Comorbid psychopathology was not influenced by sex, IQ, nor severity of SMA, and only externalizing behaviour was correlated to age. In conclusion, children and adolescents with SMA are characterized by a low psychiatric comorbidity not different from control individuals. The group with the highest rate of, behavioural. problems and with the greatest need for intervention were the non-affected siblings who had a two- to threefold higher rate of behavioural problems than the normative population.

AB Evaluations of early intervention for children facing biological and/or socioeconomic risk have tended to focus most directly on change in the child, treating family variables primarily as mediators of change. In contrast, the current study used developmental theory to articulate hypotheses that address one way in which a focus on the relationship between mother and child may be related to intervention efficacy. This study examined maternal control strategy and child compliance as a function of early intervention beginning at birth for low birth weight, preterm infants and their families and related these aspects of mother-child interaction to behavioral outcomes at age 3 (n = 645). Overall, mothers receiving early intervention were no more likely to use a preferred control strategy, guidance orientation, in a structured compliance task than were mothers participating in a follow-up only condition. However, an association between early intervention and maternal guidance was observed among mothers of children who were consistently noncompliant during the task. As a result, maternal guidance as observed in the compliance interaction was associated with reduced externalizing and internalizing behavior at program end for children participating in the intervention but not the follow-up only condition. Findings highlight the value of focusing on the mother-child dyad and illustrate one way in which developmental theory can assist in the specification of treatment effects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB In clinical practice, child psychologists' case formulations are often based on parental reports. In this study, we examined whether mothers reports of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in their children might be biased by maternal psychopathology. The target child sample consisted of 68 boys aged 6-12 years who were receiving treatment. Mothers' reports were compared with the reports of both teachers and group care workers as criterion ratings. After controlling for variance shared with the independent raters, multiple regression analysis indicated substantial partial correlations between various types of maternal psychopathology and the reporting of internalizing child behavior problems. Only small to insignificant partial correlations were found in the case of externalizing behavior problems. This finding is consistent with the social attribution theory that predicts greater distortion when observing more ambiguous stimuli.

AB Objective: To seek clues to the enhancement of primary care management by (i) Determining how often and in whom primary care clinicians in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada identify pediatric mood or anxiety syndromes; (ii) Determining which clinical and demographic features predict higher rates of identification; (iii) Describing assessment methods used. Methods: This report uses the database of the multi-site Child Behavior Study. This cross-sectional study involved 206 primary care practices in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada; 395 clinicians and 20,861 primary care attenders aged 4-15 years. Clinicians completed a visit questionnaire addressing presence and type of psychosocial problems and how assessed. Parents completed a questionnaire addressing family demographics, child symptoms (Pediatric Symptom Checklist) and functioning, and child service use. Results: Clinicians identified psychosocial problems on 17.9% of visits, but mood or anxiety syndromes on only 3.3%, most commonly in children judged to have co-morbid behavioral syndromes, of whom the majority (66.7%) already had contact with specialized mental health. Neither parental concerns about mood and anxiety symptoms nor clinician familiarity with the patient were major predictors of identification. When making a diagnosis of a pure internalizing syndrome (i.e., without a co-morbid behavioral syndrome) clinicians rarely used standardized tools or school reports. Conclusions: Neither screening for nor diagnosis of mood and anxiety syndromes is a routine part of primary care of children and adolescents. Efforts to improve care must include practical, validated screening procedures to enhance assessment for mood and anxiety syndromes, particularly among children in whom primary care clinicians identify psychosocial problems.

AB There is a paucity of knowledge on the role of sibling relationships in internalizing disorders. Research in nonclinical populations suggests an association between internalizing problems in children and negative sibling interactions. Further, an association is reported between internalizing problems and actual or perceived parental differential treatment.
   This study examines sibling relationship qualities and perceived parental differential treatment in a clinical sample. Participants included 24 anxiety disordered children (ages 8-13 years) and 25 nondisordered control children (ages 7-13 years). Anxiety disordered and nondisordered children do not differ with regard to perceived affection or hostility from a sibling. Anxiety disordered children, however, report significantly more parental differential treatment than do nondisordered children. (C) 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A total of 150 biological mother-father-adolescent triads were interviewed to investigate adolescents' perceptions of parents with and without high levels of psychological symptoms in relation to adolescents' emotional/behavioral functioning. There was a more consistent pattern for sons to show greater externalizing emotional/behavioral problems in relation to levels of adolescents' perceptions of maternal behaviors (i.e., lower acceptance and higher negative affect toward mother). Daughters, however, appeared to show greater internalizing emotional/behavioral problems in relation to higher levels of paternal depression and anxiety and lower levels of maternal control. Furthermore, both sons and daughters showed evidence of higher emotional/behavioral problems (especially internalizing problems) in relation to triangulation and interparental conflict. The complex patterns of the findings relating to the mother-father-adolescent triads emphasize the importance of including both mothers and fathers in future research of adolescents' perceptions of parents.

AB The combined effects of emotionality and self-regulation in predicting child adjustment problems and positive adjustment were examined using cross-sectional and longitudinal data from a community sample of mothers and children grades 3-5 (n = 89). Specificity in the associations of emotionality and self-regulation with adjustment was examined. Emotionality and self-regulation each predicted children's adjustment controlling for the other. Irritability was related to higher internalizing and externalizing problems and lower social competence; positive emotionality predicted higher wellbeing and social competence. Attention regulation was related to lower depression and higher social competence and well-being; inhibitory control was related to lower internalizing and externalizing problems and higher social competence. Impulsivity was unrelated to adjustment after the other emotionality and self-regulation variables were accounted. The findings support separate dimensions of emotionality and self-regulation and their unique contributions to child adjustment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Children (N=115) in a randomly selected nonclinic sample were evaluated by their mothers (using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, or CBCL) and a child psychiatrist (who conducted a clinical interview and observation) when they were 2 and 5 years old. Compared to psychiatrists, mothers tended to overreport externalizing problems and underreport internalizing problems (particularly separation anxiety) at age 2. Mothers' reports, however, were predictive of children's social and language abilities and problems assessed at later ages and by fathers. Psychiatrists' reports added to the predictability of child functioning beyond mothers' reports, particularly for problems reported by teachers when the children were 4 and 5 years old. Mothers' and psychiatrists' reports of children's problems at age 5 were more similar than at age 2, and there was no "value added" by psychiatrists' evaluations. Both mothers' and psychiatrists' reports of children's problems were related to risk factors of attachment insecurity and poor parenting, but mothers' reports, relative to psychiatrists', were more closely related to difficult temperament and mothers' own dysphoric functioning, whereas psychiatrists' reports were more closely related to child's gender.

AB Objective. To characterize children with asthma by their stress processing at school and their psychosocial functioning. To establish similarities and differences between children with and without asthma. Methods. Participants were 79 children with asthma and 359 children without asthma (ages 8-12). Children completed questionnaires on stress processing and their well-being at school. Parents filled in a questionnaire on behavior problems, and teachers provided data on school performance and absence rate. Results. Children with asthma had higher scores on absence rates, teacher-rated well-being, internalizing behavior problems, occurrence of "rejection by peers," and use of aggression when coping with "problems with school work." However, using discriminant analyses, the groups could not reliably be distinguished from one another by these variables. Conclusions. Children with asthma are similar to other children with regard to their stress processing at school and their psychosocial functioning. The value of conducting multivariate analysis over several univariate tests is underscored.

AB Research on the relations between specific stressors and specific psychological outcomes among children and adolescents is reviewed. Specificity, the notion that particular risk factors are uniquely related to particular outcomes is discussed from a theoretical perspective, and models of specificity are described. Several domains of stressors are examined from a specificity framework (e.g., exposure to violence, abuse, and divorce/marital conflict) in relation to broad-band outcomes of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Studies that tested for specificity conducted within the past 15 years are examined, and definitional problems are highlighted. Little evidence for specificity was found. Methodological problems in the literature and the lack of theory-driven specificity research are discussed, and directions for future research are identified.

AB In comparison to most other groups with intellectual disability individuals with Down syndrome are at lower risk for significant psychopathology, although relative to their typically developing peers they have higher rates of behavioural and emotional problems. A total of 43 Down syndrome patients (21 females and 22 males), who ranged in age from 5.33 to 30.58 years, were examined for the presence of age-related changes in the spectrum of externalizing and internalizing problems. Intelligence tests included Hamburg-Wechsler-Intelligenz Test fur Kinder III (HAWIK-III), Hamburg-Wechsler-Intelligenz Test ffir Erwachsene (HAWIE-R) and Kaufman-Assessment-Battery for Children, German Version (K-ABC). Behavioural and emotional problems were assessed by the the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for Parents, German Version (SDQ) and the Clinical Assessment Scale for Child and Adolescent Psychopathology (CASCAP). IQ was significantly inversly related to the age of patients. Externalizing behaviours (dominant, opposing/refusing, impulsiveness, inattention and increased motor activity) were significantly higher in the 5-10 years old group, whereas internalizing behaviours (shy/insecure, low selfconfidence, decreased motor activity) where more prevalent in adolescents and adults (10-30 years). Possible relationships between this age-related changes and increased risks of later-onset psychopathology (depression and dementia) are discussed.

AB Objective To review studies of psychological adjustment among children and adolescents with chronic arthritis to determine whether they are at more risk for development of adjustment problems than controls. Methods We used meta-analytic techniques to review 21 studies reporting overall adjustment problems, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, or self-concept among youths with arthritis. Results Youths with arthritis displayed increased risk for overall adjustment problems and internalizing symptoms, but not for externalizing symptoms or poor self-concept. Risk was greater in studies making comparisons to study controls rather than to norms and in studies including mixed disease samples (arthritis plus other rheumatic diseases) rather than samples of youths with arthritis only Conclusions Results suggest the importance of assessing for internalizing problems among youths with chronic arthritis. Future research may benefit from inclusion of child self-report of adjustment problems, diagnostic specificity in reporting results, and use of adjustment measures without somatic items.

AB This article explores the relationship between parental psychological control and parental autonomy granting, and the relations between these constructs and indicators of adolescent psychosocial functioning, in a sample of 9,564 adolescents from grades 9 to 12. Participants completed a comprehensive parenting questionnaire as well as several measures of psychosocial adjustment. Confirmatory factor analyses of the parenting items revealed discrete factors for psychological control and autonomy granting, suggesting that these are distinct parenting constructs rather than opposite ends of a parental control continuum. Moreover, structural equation modeling showed that these factors were weakly correlated and differentially related to adolescent internalizing symptoms. Findings have implications for future conceptualization and measurement of psychological control and autonomy granting, and for research examining their effects on adolescent development.

AB The current investigation cross-nationally examined the relationship between adolescent reports of family or parenting processes and a series of developmental outcomes in a sample of adolescents (N = 8,417) from Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States. Based on confirmatory factor analyses and tests of scalar equivalence, results suggest that the Adolescent Family Process Measure (AFP), which assesses maternal and paternal closeness, support, monitoring, communication, conflict, and peer approval, was valid and reliable for males, females, middle adolescents, and late adolescents in all four national contexts. In addition, based on model-free LISREL analyses, findings suggested that the relationships between these family processes and measures of adolescent externalizing (alcohol use, drug use, school misconduct, and total deviance) and internalizing (anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and low well-being) behaviors were similar cross-nationally. Findings are discussed in terms of their importance for the conceptualization and measurement of family and parenting processes.

AB Objective: To examine concordance of child, parent, and consensus agreement on the Anxiety Disorders interview Schedule, Child and Parent versions (ADIS-C/P), for an outpatient sample of children and adolescents and to explore moderators of those relations. Child characteristics (age, gender, social desirability), a family environment variable (conflict), and type of diagnoses (internalizing, externalizing) were systematically examined. Method: These relations were examined in 165 children and adolescents referred to a psychological clinic by family practitioners, pediatricians, schools, and mental health professionals. Participants were individuallyadministered the ADIS-C or ADIS-P by separate clinicians, and consensus diagnoses were determined In a clinical conference. Agreements between child-parent, child-consensus, and parent-consensus were determined. Results: Poor levels of agreement were found among our informants, especially between child and parent and to some extent between child and consensus. Agreement was higher between parent and consensus, suggesting that our clinicians tended to favor parent input over child input. Although the effects were complex, characteristics of the child, family, and type of diagnosis moderated or qualified these findings. Conclusions: Although discrepancies exist among our informants, our overall findings suggest important information is obtained from each informant and, when combined with certain modifying characteristics, may lead to diagnostic and treatment decisions.

ID DISORDERS; FAMILY
AB Objective: To investigate characteristics of suicidal and violent behavior in a community school sample of adolescents. Method: Self-report questionnaires were administered to 794 male students (aged 12-18 years) from Antwerp, Belgium. Subjects were classified into four groups: a suicidal-only (n = 40; suicidal ideation and/or self-harming behavior), a violent-only (n = 142), a suicidal-violent (n = 21), and a control group (n = 591). Results: Compared with controls, higher levels of internalizing problems, risk-taking behavior (substance use, diminished perception of risk, sensation seeking), and aggression were found in the comparison groups. The suicidal-violent group had the highest levels of depression, somatization, overt and covert aggression, and risk-taking behavior. Compared with the suicidal-only group, the violent-only group had less depression, anxiety, and covert aggression, but higher levels of overt aggression, sensation seeking, diminished perception of risk, and marijuana use. Conclusions: Although adolescent suicidal and violent behavior are both related to internalizing problems, aggression, and risk-taking behavior, marked differences in severity and nature exist in these relationships. Differentiation of suicidal youths based on the presence or absence of violent behavior may add to our understanding of suicidal phenomena and may thus have important clinical consequences.

ID VIOLENCE PREVENTION; CHILDREN; PROGRAMS
AB Children with good capacities in problem solving behavior have a lower risk of showing violent behavior in difficult emotional conflicts, because they do not tend to stabilize and compensate their self esteem in these situations. The development of social-emotional competences has therefore become an elementary part of violence prevention programs. In Germany the "Faustlos" curriculum has been used as an evaluated and systematically constructed tool for preventing aggressive behavior in children attending kindergartens and elementary schools. In a 3-year control-group design study a total of 44 classes of pupils (30 classes served as the experimental group, 14 classes as a control group) were investigated in the Heidelberg/Mannheim area. The results show significant changes in the emotional competences and prosocial developments in children aged 6-9 years. Children who participated in the "Faustios"-lessons showed significantly reduced anxiety and internalizing behavior compared with children who did not participate. The parents' self-report ratings with the Child Behaviour Checklist provide clear evidence of better social behavior outside the schools. For final conclusions concerning the efficacy of the "Faustlos" program, further studies focusing on the stability of the changes are necessary.

AB A one-year longitudinal study explored the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between norm-violating behavior, somatic complaints, and depression, considering the influence of parent and peer support. 326 students aged between 10 and 15 years participated in three assessments. Because of the lack of research concerning norm-violating behavior by girls, analyses were conducted for males and females seperately. Epidemiological research shows that aggressive behavior often co occurs with internalizing symptoms, whereas rejection by peers is discussed as a potential mediator (Kusch & Petermann, 1997). If aggressive behavior occurs chronologically before the development of internalizing symptoms, preventive measures could be taken at an early stage of the development of internalizing symptoms.

AB This study examined if children with reading und writing disorder (RWD) show deficient self-esteem and behavior disorders in addition to their learning problems and evaluated the efficacy of integrative learning therapy. The sample consisted of 69 children who were examined at three timepoints: at the beginning of therapy, at half a year, and one year later. At the beginning of the therapy, the RWD children had deficient self-esteem in the cognitive component in comparison to a group of normal children. From the parent's point of view, the children had above-average behavior disorders, especially internalizing problems. During the therapy, significant positive change on self-esteem was observed and the intensity of behavior disorders had diminished. One third of the children had significant positive changes in the cognitive components of self-esteem (33%) and a significant reduction of behavior disorders (37%). In the spelling test, 47% of the children improved their mark. The therapists estimated that the therapy was successful for 58% of the children.

AB Objective of this study was to screen phobic/anxiety and personality disorders of outpatients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to correlate that comorbidity to the level of social activities, burdens and impairment.
   48 untreated ADHD patients were examined for the above-mentioned disorders (according to DSM-IV) and their subjective social functioning.
   The subjective level of social activities was very low, social burdens and impairment were high or very high. These self-ratings correlated with a considerable psychiatric comorbidity as to phobic and anxiety, as well as to personality disorders. Especially the frequency of more internalizing (phobic and cluster-C) disorders leads to the assumption of a considerably large unidentified group of adults with undiagnosed ADHD and psychiatric comorbidity, yet marked suffering.

AB Objective. This study explores relations between mild parental symptoms of anxiety and depression and the temperament and behavior patterns in preschool age children. Design. Parental report and laboratory observations were collected in a community sample (N = 65) of Head Start and other preschool attendees, ages 3-5 years. Results. Mild parental dysphoria is associated with measures of both child temperament and problem behaviors and these child personality measures vary with parental symptomatology. Mild parental depression was diffusely associated with increased levels of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and with attention and emotion regulatory difficulties in children's temperament. Mild parental anxiety was more circumscribed in its association with child problem behavior but was specifically related to children's temperamental difficulties in attention and emotion regulation. Patterns differentiating association with depression and anxiety symptoms were evident from both parental and observer sources of information. Conclusions. Even mild levels of parental distress may relate to both parental perceptions of child temperament and behavior as well as what is observed by others.

AB Objective. This study examines the similarity of parenting and the associations between maternal behavior and child problem and prosocial behavior across two racial groups. Design. Using data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (SECC), analyses included an examination of the comparability of maternal and child behavior between African American (n = 123) and European American (n = 953) families using multiple-group mean and covariance structures analysis (MACS). Observational data from two mother - child activities and maternal report of child behavior were used to construct three parenting and four child latent constructs. Results. Comparable measures of parenting (Responsive, Harsh, and Intrusive), child problem behavior (Externalizing and Internalizing), and child prosocial behavior (Compliance and Expressiveness) were found using partial invariance methods across racial groups. The associations between harsh, intrusive and responsive parenting and child behaviors were found to be similar across racial groups. Conclusions. Generality in the organization of parenting and similarity in their association to child behavior obtain across racial groups.

AB To learn more about the roots of internalizing and externalizing problems in low-income, African-American children, aged 8-12 years, particularly for family and community factors, we aimed to determine which variables (mother's psychological functioning, mother's intimate partner violence status [IPV], family cohesion and adaptability, neighborhood disorder) uniquely predicted a child's internalizing distress and externalizing distress, and the amount of variance explained by the model. Results from the regression model predicting internalizing distress indicates that the five predictor variables accounted for 38% of the variance. Two of the five predictors were significantly related to child's internalizing distress scores: mother's intimate partner violence status and maternal psychological distress. Results from the regression model predicting externalizing distress indicates that the five predictor variables accounted for 8% of the variance. The two predictors significantly related to child's externalizing distress scores were levels of family cohesion and maternal psychological distress. Directions for future research and clinical implications are provided.

AB A large sample of 2-12 year old children (N = 2311) was studied to determine the relationship between three sexually intrusive behavior items (SIBs) measured by the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory (CSBI) and a range of developmental, ecological, and behavioral correlates. The variables studied included age, gender, race, family income, single parent status, maternal education, family sexual behaviors, physical abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence, social competence of the child, and three scales from the CBCL (Internalizing, Externalizing, and PTSD). Sexual abuse was not the primary predictor of SIB, but a model incorporating family adversity, modeling of coercive behavior, child behavior, and modeling of sexuality predicted a significant amount of variance.

AB The associations between marital conflict, maternal and paternal hostility, children interpretations of marital conflict, and children adjustment were examined in a sample of 136 school-aged children and their parents. Observational measures were collected from videotapes of marital interaction and family interaction. Self-report data were collected from parents and children. Results showed that mothers' and fathers' hostility mediated the association between martial conflict and children internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Children's feelings of being to blame for marital conflict and being threatened by it mediated between marital conflict and children internalizing problems but not their externalizing problems.

AB In the current study, 95 children of different social status classifications (rejected, neglected, average, and popular) were exposed to hypothetical vignettes designed to assess their 'generalized' rejection sensitivity (GRS) and a mild social rejection experience designed to assess their 'on-line' rejection sensitivity (ORS). Measures of internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed through a composite of peer-, parents, and self-reports. As expected, sociometric rejection was associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems. More importantly, both types of rejection sensitivity were associated with internalizing and externalizing problems after, controlling for the effect of peer rejection. High levels of GRS were associated with more internalizing problems for both boys and girls. In addition, rejection sensitivity emerged as a significant moderator of the relation between rejection and externalizing problems. The nature of the moderating effect varied as function of type of rejection sensitivity and gender Rejected girls with low GRS and rejected boys with high ORS displayed the highest levels of externalizing behavior problems.

ID 5-FACTOR MODEL; BIG 5; TEMPERAMENT; EMOTIONALITY; ADJUSTMENT; CHILDHOOD
AB Relations of personality dimensions to social behavior were examined for 381 preschool children. Their teachers reported on the children's adaptive and problem behavior, and rated their personality characteristics using bipolar adjective scales that represented markers of the Big Five. As previously established, making use of these scales yields a four-factor structure of personality in preschoolers, with two of the factors becoming more differentiated with increasing age. The results of the present study revealed that social competence (presence of adaptive behavior) and general adaptation (presence of adaptive as well as absence of maladaptive behavior) could be contemporaneously predicted in younger children (mean age of four years) by each of the four personality dimensions, a result also obtained for the general adaptation of older children (mean age of six and a half years), while social competence in the latter group was predicted by a combined Conscientiousness-Intellect/Openness factor, Extroversion and Agreeableness. The absence of internalizing problems in the younger group was predicted by Extroversion and Social Adaptability, whereas in the older one it was predicted by Extroversion, Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness-Intellect/Openness. Within both the age groups, the absence of externalizing behavior was predicted negatively by Extroversion and positively by Agreeableness (or Social Adaptability in the younger group) and Emotional Stability (or combined Emotional Stability/Amiability in younger preschoolers), as well as by Conscientiousness-Intellect/Openness in the older group.

AB Aims To evaluate the construct and predictive validity of six different subtyping classifications selected on the basis of their empirical support in the literature on adolescent substance abuse.
   Methods Typological data were collected from a heterogeneous sample of 600 adolescents presenting for marijuana treatment. The classification schemes onset age, family history, externalizing disorders, internalizing disorders and temperament. Subgroups were compared in terms of substance use frequency, substance abuse problems, social support for substance use, family conflict, school problems and negative peer associations.
   Results Each of the categorical classification schemes differentiated subtypes significantly on some or all of the construct validation measures after controlling for demographic factors, thereby indicating that each has valuable explanatory power from a theoretical perspective. Externalizing disorders, onset age, difficult temperament and internalizing disorders continued to add unique variance to discrimination after the effects of the other subtypes had been removed. At 12-month follow-up there were no differences between subtypes on substance use frequency, but adolescents with higher levels of externalizing disorders and internalizing disorders continued to experience more substance use problems.
   Conclusion Categorical subtypes may have particular relevance to the development of treatment interventions as well as prevention measures.

Those were the first data on the CBCL and TRF in Croatia. Both in the CBCL and TRF boys had higher scores compared to girls in the Externalizing and Total Problems scale (p<0.01 and p<0.05). Parents rated higher scores to the Internalizing and Externalizing scales and the Total Problems scale in both sexes (p<0.01 and p<0.05), with the exception of the Internalizing scale in boys. Parents are very important observers of mental health problems in children.

AB The current study examined the interactive effects of infant activity level and fear on growth trajectories of behavior problems in early childhood (age 4 to 8 year) using maternal ratings. The sample was drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and included children who were between 1 and 11 months in 1986. Findings suggested that boys characterized by high activity level and low levels of fear in infancy escalated in both externalizing and internalizing symptom,. Also, buys characterized by high fear and low activity level increased in internalizing symptoms and these effects seemed to be specific to depression rather than anxiety. Temperament did not predict escalation in externalizing symptomatology for girls. but low levels of fear predicted increases in internalizing symptom. There was also evidence for a decline in depression specific symptoms for girls characterized by high fear and low activity in infancy. These findings suggest the importance of examining interactive models of temperament risk and considering gender specific pathways to behavior problems.

   DELINQUENCY
AB A significant discrepancy between intelligence and daily adaptive functioning. or adaptive disability (AD). has been previously found to be a associated with significant psychological morbidity in preschool children with disruptive behavior (DB). The utility of AD as a predictor of later developmental risks was examined in a 3-year longitudinal study of normal (N = 43) and DB preschool children. The DB children Acre grouped into those with AD (DB+AD; N = 28) and those without AD (DB-only: N = 98). All children were followed with annual evaluations to the end of second grade. Both DB groups demonstrated substantial and pervasive psychological and educational morbidity at 3-year follow-up, In comparison to DB-only children. DB+AD children had more symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD), more severe and pervasive behavior problems at home. more parent-rated externalizing and internalizing. and lower academic competence and more behavioral problems at school. Parents of DB+AD children also reported greater parenting stress than did parents in the other groups. A significant contribution of AD to adverse outcomes in the DB group remained on some measures even after controlling for initial severity of DB, AD also contributed significantly to CD symptoms at follow-up after controlling for initial DB severity and initial CD symptoms. The results corroborate and extend earlier findings of the utility of AD as a risk indicator above severity of DB alone. They also imply that AD in the context of normal intellectual development may arise from both the deficient self-regulation associated with ADHD and from disrupted parenting, with exposure to kindergarten moderating these adverse effects.

AB This study examined the effects of being victimized by peers on children's behavioral, social, emotional, and academic functioning. We assessed an ethnically diverse sample of 1064 first, second, and fourth graders and followed them Over 2 years, locating 1.469 of the participants at the follow-up. Correlation and partial correlation analyses revealed that prior victimization predicted externalizing, internalizing, and social problems 2 years later for the sample as a whole. However, not all victimized children experienced the same types of outcomes instead, there was heterogeneity in children's responses to victimization. Using cluster analysis, we identified eight outcome patterns that represented different patterns of functioning. These were labeled as externalizing, internalizing, symptomatic, popular, disliked, absent, low achieving, and high achieving. Discriminant function analyses revealed that the symptomatic, externalizing, and disliked patterns were systematically related to victimization. Moreover, significant gender and age differences in the severity of effects were obtained. The discussion highlights the complexity of victimization effects.

AB Purpose: Children with epilepsy have high rates of behavior problems. The purpose was to describe prospectively the association of seizures and behavior problems in children with new-onset seizures.
   Methods: Subjects were 224 children with new-onset seizures (aged 4-14 years) and 159 siblings (4-18 years). Caregiver's ratings of the behavior were collected 4 times: at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 months. During the 2-year period, 163 (73%) children had at least one additional seizure, and 61 (27%) had none. Data were analyzed by using repeated measures analysis of variance both with and without covariates [site, age, gender, race, caregiver education (years), and seizure medications].
   Results: On average, children had higher CBCL Total and Internalizing Behavior Problems scores across all times when experiencing recurrent seizures than when not experiencing recurrent seizures (Total Problems, p = 0.041, controlling for demographics and seizure medications). Siblings had significantly lower Total and Internalizing Problems scores than both children experiencing (Total Problems adjusting for covariates, p = 0.0001) and not experiencing recurrent seizures (p = 0.0004). Externalizing Problems scores were not significantly different among children with recurring seizures, children without recurring seizures, and siblings.
   Conclusions: Recurrent seizures significantly predicted behavior problems very early in the course of a seizure condition, even when key child, demographic, and seizure variables were controlled. Explanations for these findings include the possibilities that both seizures and behavior problems are caused by an underlying neurological disorder, that seizures.per se disrupt behavior, or that children have negative psychological responses to seizure activity.

AB The present study investigated the relationship between children's perceptions of marital conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Additionally, investigating gender and age differences in children's perceptions and the type of problems they exhibited were the other purposes of the study. The sample consisted of 9- to 12-year-old, nonclinical children from intact families (N = 232), one of their parents, and teachers. The data were gathered by administering the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 4-18 and the Teacher's Report Form to adult participants and the Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict Scale and the Children's Depression Inventory to the child participants. Findings indicated that there was a significant relationship between children's perceptions of marital conflict and their internalizing and externalizing problems. More specifically, children's perceptions of conflict properties were associated with their internalizing problems in parents', teachers', and children's reports. Children's perceptions of threat were associated with child-reported depression. Children's perceptions of self-blame were associated with child-reported depression, parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems, and teacher-reported externalizing problems. Furthermore, it was found that there were gender and age differences in children's perceptions of marital conflict and their internalizing and externalizing problems. Findings indicated that boys have higher self-blame scores and teacher-reported externalizing problems than girls and that girls have more parent- and teacher-reported internalizing problems than boys. Additionally, it was found that 9-year-old children have more teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing problems than 12-year-old children. Also, 9-year-old boys have higher parent-reported externalizing problems than 9-year-old girls and 9-year-old boys have higher parent-reported externalizing problems than 12-year-old boys.

AB This community study assigned 129 4-year-olds to groups at risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), both ADHD and ODD, or no problems. Mothers of children at risk for ODD reported more family dysfunction, felt less competent as parents, suggested fewer solutions to child behavior problems, demonstrated a less assertive approach to child management, and reported more child internalizing problems than did mothers of children not elevated on ODD symptoms. Mothers of children at risk for ADHD reported higher personal depression scores than did those of the non-ADHD subgroup. Children at risk for ADHD evidenced the most difficulties in school where teachers reported more social behavior, classroom management, and internalizing problems relative to other children not at risk for ADHD. When solving child management problems, mothers of children in all groups suggested twice as many controlling/negative management strategies as positive/preventive strategies. In addition, faced with oppositional and conduct problems, mothers of children in all groups increased controlling/negative suggestions and decreased positive/preventive suggestions. Mothers of girls at risk for ADHD, ODD, and ADHD/ODD gave more rewards per positive behavior than did mothers of boys.

AB In this review, it is proposed that a systems approach to the study of the development of romantic relationships might enhance our understanding of the nature of social relationships, and the links between social relationships and individual psychosocial functioning. First, a selected literature review is provided on the normative development of romantic relationships during adolescence, antecedents of different romantic involvement pathways, and positive and negative qualities of these relationships. Second, the focus is placed on the how the development of romantic relationships occurs within existing systems of relationships including peer networks and close friendships. It is suggested that the development of romantic relationships may change the peer network and nature of relationships with friends and others, and particular types of transitions in social relationships will likely occur. The timing of these transitions and an understanding of the entire peer system as romantic relationships develop will likely improve our understanding of individual developmental processes such as identity formation and the development of externalizing and internalizing problems. Finally, it is proposed that adolescents are faced with a complicated task that includes developing romantic interests and relationships but managing their changing social networks.

AB Clinical diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is based on evaluation of behavioral functioning in three domains: inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Caudate and frontal lobe function figures prominently in several neuroanatomic models of attentional. functioning. Studies comparing children with and without ADHD have found differences in the size and symmetry of the caudate nuclei. Using multiple regression, we tested the hypothesis that caudate volume symmetry (log left minus log right caudate volume) measured from serial sagittal magnetic resonance images in a sample of nonreferred children (12 girls/15 boys, 7.0 to 16.6 years, 81 to 129 IQ) would predict the cumulative severity of parent-reported ADHD diagnostic behaviors beyond variance predicted by age, sex, and level of internalizing problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist. No child had been previously diagnosed with ADHD, although one child was found to meet diagnostic criteria based on the rating scale used for the study. The degree of caudate asymmetry significantly predicted cumulative severity ratings of inattentive behaviors (P = .015), uniquely accounting for 17.1% of the variance in inattention symptomatology over demographic variables and internalizing problems, which collectively predicted 28.9% of the variance. Caudate asymmetry uniquely accounted for only 4.3% of the variance in cumulative severity ratings of hyperactive/impulsive symptomatology over demographic variables and internalizing problems that collectively predicted 21.2% of the variance. A greater degree of right to left caudate volume asymmetry predicted subclinical inattentive behaviors in a sample of nonreferred children. This finding is congruent with neuroanatomic models of attention emphasizing lateralized alteration in prefrontal/striatal systems. The results support the view that clinical ADHD is the extreme of a behavioral continuum that extends into the normal population.

AB Studied 4th- through 8th-grade students in a rural school district (N = 382, 201 girls; M age = 12.48) who, at the end of the academic year, completed self-report measures assessing functional impairment, self-concept, reactance, and autonomy experiences in relation to parents. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a distinction between 2 aspects of autonomy: mutuality (perceptions of parents as encouraging of autonomy) and conflictual dependence (negative representations of "self-in-relation-to-parent" and related feelings of anger and shame). Path analysis findings mostly were consistent with a mediated model predicting personality from autonomy experiences and functional impairment from personality. However, conflictual dependence rather than negative self-feelings directly predicted girls' emotional difficulties. Comparisons of total effects suggested that conflictual dependence may have stronger and more consistent implications for adolescent psychopathology than mutuality. In general, significant relations between conflictual dependence and psychopathology remained significant even after controlling for a measure of negative affectivity (NA).

AB Examined the validity of the tripartite model of anxiety and depression and its internal structure in children. Measures of positive affect/surgency (PA/S) and negative affect/neuroticism (NA/N) and self-report and peer nominations of symptoms of depression and anxiety were completed by 104 children (mean age = 14.9 years, SD = 1.9). Parents completed measures of temperament and anxious and depressive symptoms. Multitrait-multimethod and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) supported a 3-factor model that included separate Child and Parent NA/N factors and a joint PANS factor. Child and Parent NA/N were related to symptoms of both depression and anxiety, but neither parent nor peer symptom ratings related to Child NA/N. PANS was primarily related to symptoms of depression. These results support aspects of the tripartite model in children and suggest caution in the use of multimethod assessment of children's temperament and internalizing symptoms.

AB Examined the tripartite model of personality, which emphasizes negative affectivity (NA) and positive affectivity (PA) as central organizing dimensions of personality that are useful for discriminating psychopathologies. Conceptualizations of youth temperament also include second-order, organizing factors of negative emotionality/neuroticism and positive emotionality/extroversion that may differentially predict psychopathologies. A community sample of 290 10- to 17-year-old youth completed the Emotionality, Activity and Sociability Temperament Survey (EAS), Positive and Negative Affectivity Schedule, and measures of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Factor analysis replicated the 5-factor structure of the EAS and revealed 2 independent second-order factors, negative temperament (NT) and positive temperament (PT). NT and PT demonstrated convergent and discriminant relations with NA and PA. Consistent with the tripartite model, NT was associated with both anxiety and depression scores, but PT was related to depression scores only.

AB Evaluated the psychometric properties of a newly created measure of cognitive vulnerability to depression for use with adolescents. Previous measures have shown poor internal consistency reliability and have not completely assessed all hypothesized components of cognitive vulnerability. High school students completed questionnaires assessing cognitive vulnerability to depression, negative life events, depressive symptoms, and general internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The Adolescent Cognitive Style Questionnaire (ACSQ) demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability and good test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis showed there were 3 latent factors to the ACSQ. Construct validity was supported by significant correlations with another attributional style questionnaire, as well as with depressive and internalizing symptoms. The interaction of ACSQ with negative events significantly predicted concurrent depressive and internalizing symptoms but not externalizing problems. Last, cognitive vulnerability mediated the gender difference in depressive symptoms. Overall, results suggest that the ACSQ is a highly reliable and valid measure of cognitive vulnerability to depression in adolescence.

LA English
DT Article
ID DIVORCE; RISK
AB Investigated the family drawings of 180 children ages 5 to 7 years in various family settings, including stepfather, single-parent, complex stepfamilies, and 2-parent control families. The relations of family type and biological relatedness to omission of family members and grouping of parents were examined. Children from step- and single-parent families were more likely to exclude family members than children from "control" non-step families, and exclusion was predicted from biological relatedness. Children who were biologically related to both resident parents were also more likely to group their parents together. Omission of family members was found to be associated with children's adjustment (specifically more externalizing and internalizing behavior) as reported by teachers and parents. The results indicate that biological relatedness is a salient aspect of very young children's representations of their families. The association between adjustment and exclusion of family members and grouping of parents indicates that family drawings may be useful research and clinical tools, when used in combination with other methods of assessment.

AB The Emotion Expression Scale for Children (EESC) is a new self-report scale designed to examine 2 aspects of deficient emotion expression: lack of emotion awareness and lack of motivation to express negative emotion. Validity was assessed using self-report measures of emotion regulation and self- and peer-report of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Using a community sample of 208 fourth- and fifth-grade children, reliability analyses revealed high internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability of the EESC. The results provide initial support for concurrent validity for the EESC factors evidenced by relations with measures of emotion management. Associations were found between the EESC and measures of internalizing symptoms.

Four groups were defined by multiple criteria (with 41 youth not able to be classified): aggressive-internalizing (AI, n = 22); aggressive-noninternalizing (AN, n = 14); nonaggressive-internalizing (NI, n = 27); and nonaggressive-noninternalizing (NN, n = 73). Groups did not differ on self-centered and minimizing types of self-serving processing distortions, although the comorbid group endorsed more self-serving distortions of assuming the worst and blaming others than the NN group. Aggressive, in comparison to nonaggressive, delinquents reported more self-serving distortions in reference to overt behavior content. In contrast, self-debasing cognitive content was related to internalizing problems, as both the AI and NI groups had more negative beliefs about self than both the AN and NN groups, and more negative beliefs about the world and the future than the NN group. The AI group also had more negative beliefs about the world than the AN group. Self-debasing processing distortions were not specifically related to internalizing problems, as no differences emerged between the AN and NI groups; however, the AI group differed from the NN group on 3 of 4 types of these distortions. Both of the internalizing groups had a more negative attributional,style than. the NN group. Theoretical and treatment implications are highlighted.

AB The research has shown that children surviving cancer are at risk for long-term emotional and behavioral problems secondary to the cumulative effects of cranial irradiation and chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the emotional and behavioral outcome of children diagnosed with brain tumor and treated with cranial irradiation and chemotherapy by looking at the association between treatment, time, age, and cognitive-related variables on externalizing and internalizing behaviors at 3 years posttreatment. Fifty-four brain tumor survivors were administered a neuropsychological test battery, whereas the parents filled out the CBCL and Conners' Parent Rating Scale. The results indicate that chemotherapy treatment with vincristine, cytoxan, cisplantinum, and/or VP16 was related to poorer internalizing and externalizing behavioral outcome, especially attention, social withdrawal, and anxious-depressive symptomatology. Age at time of diagnosis or treatment, time since discontinuation of treatment, type and/or total dose of radiation therapy was not significantly correlated with any of the behavioral outcome scales. Verbal memory and learning deficits accounted for a significant portion of the variance in social withdrawal, whereas lower scores in overall intellectual functioning and verbal fluency was related to disturbances in attention, inhibition, and social functioning. The findings suggest that children treated with 1 or a combination of any of the aforementioned chemotherapy agents who exhibit declines in intellectual functioning and memory are at increased risk for long-term behavioral problems 3 years after treatment cessation. These findings support the importance for early psychotherapeutic and supportive intervention services immediately after treatment cessation, with the goal of circumventing these potentially debilitating emotional problems.

AB This article reviews the empirical literature on psychosocial, psychopharmacological, and adjunctive treatments for children between the ages of 6 and 12 with internalizing disorders. The aim of this review was to identify interventions that have potential to prevent substance use disorders in adolescence by treating internalizing disorders in childhood. Results suggest that a variety of behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and pharmacological interventions are effective in reducing symptoms of childhood depression, phobias, and anxiety disorders. None of the studies reviewed included substance abuse outcomes. Thus, little can be said about the relationship between early treatment and the prevention of later substance use. The importance of evaluating the generalizability of research-supported interventions to community settings is highlighted and recommendations for future research are offered.

AB To determine whether female-typed personality disorders are associated with a different pattern of dysfunction than male-typed disorders, lay judges (N = 216) estimated the amount of social impairment, occupational impairment, and personal distress related to symptoms of personality disorders. Results for both the subset of six disorders originally rated by clinician judges in the research of Funtowicz and Widiger (1999) and for a larger set of nine disorders revealed a pattern originally reported by Funtowicz and Widiger where female-typed disorders were associated with relatively higher ratings of personal distress, whereas male-typed disorders were associated with relatively higher ratings of social (and sometimes occupational) impairment. Findings are discussed with respect to the emphasis of different forms of dysfunction for male- and female-typed disorders, lay versus clinician judgments, and directions for future research.

AB This study examined associations among perceived and actual father behavior and child social anxiety. Forty-eight children (22 high socially anxious, 26 low socially anxious) completed self-report measures of social anxiety, general anxiety, and depression. Children also completed a measure of perceived parental style and subsequently collaborated with their fathers on a challenging task (origami). After controlling for general anxiety and depression, fathers of high socially anxious children exhibited more controlling behavior during the origami task; high and low socially anxious children, however, did not differ behaviorally from one another. Perceptions of father child-rearing style did not differ as a function of child social anxiety, nor were significant relations found between perceived parenting and specific father behaviors. Findings underscore the importance of assessing various types of internalizing symptoms (i.e., controlling for shared construct variance), obtaining children's perceptions of parental style in conjunction with conducting behavioral observations, and including fathers in psychopathology research.

AB The Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders (DSMD), with its 3-factor model of measurement (i.e., Internalizing, Externalizing, and Critical Pathology), may be useful in screening for psychotic disorders in children. This study assessed the ability of the DSMD to differentiate between inpatient children and adolescents with psychotic disorders (n = 18) and those with other clinical syndromes (n = 71). Results of ANCOVAs indicated that the psychotic group scored significantly higher on most DSMD scales and composites than the nonpsychotic clinical group. However estimates of effect size were particularly large for the Critical Pathology Composite and the Autism and Acute Problems Scales. Diagnostic efficiency statistics revealed that the DSMD's Critical Pathology Composite was highly accurate in differentiating between the 2 clinical groups. These findings support the utility of the DSMD in identifying children and adolescents with psychotic disorders.

AB Objective: To explore the influences of adolescent self-reported and interviewer-rated perceptions of family functioning, parent perceptions of the family, and adolescent personality on internalizing symptoms.
   Method: Two hundred one adolescent twins (mean age = 16.2 +/- 2.0 years; 90% white) completed the Family Assessment Device (FAD), Eysenck Personality Inventory, Children's Depression Inventory, and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and participated in an interview about their relationships with parents. Parents completed the FAD. Twins were divided into two samples for analysis.
   Results: Multiple regression analyses in sample A showed that adolescent perceptions of family function accounted for 35% of the variance in depressive symptoms, but did not significantly predict anxiety. Self-reported perceptions were more strongly associated with symptoms than were interviewer-rated perceptions. Parent FAD and adolescent neuroticism accounted for 24% of the variance in adolescent self-reported perceptions. Results were similar in sample B.
   Conclusions: Adolescent perceptions of the family are linked to their depressive symptoms and associated with neuroticism. Adolescents who are high in neuroticism may perceive their families more negatively. Clinicians need to carefully discern components of family function that lead to teen depression versus biased cognitions that lead teenagers to perceive family relationships as negative. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2002, 41(12):1486-1494.

AB A total of 41 articles examined the social and emotional outcomes of childhood sexual abuse. The outcomes examined included suicide and substance use, gang involvement, pregnancy, running away, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), risky sexual behavior, and behavioral problems. Results for each of these outcomes tended to vary by developmental period. However, problems of internalizing and extemalizing behavior appeared to be specific to sexually abused children of all age groups. Some studies found differences in outcome according to gender, race, and age. Although findings related to abuse characteristics were found to vary from study to study, severity of the abuse, use of force, and victim's relationship to the perpetrator were found to be especially important. Other factors, such as family support and parental monitoring, were found to mitigate a negative outcome. Limitations are discussed along with suggestions for future research.

AB This research addresses a new construct, co-rumination. Co-rumination refers to extensively discussing and revisiting problems, speculating about problems, and focusing on negative feelings. Friendship research indicates that self-disclosure leads to close relationships; however, coping research indicates that dwelling on negative topics leads to emotional difficulties. Co-rumination is a single construct that integrates both perspectives and is proposed to be related both to positive friendship adjustment and problematic emotional adjustment. Third-, fifth-, seventh-, and ninth-grade participants (N = 608) responded to questionnaires, including a new measure of co-rumination. Co-rumination was related to high-quality close friendships and aspects of depression and anxiety. Girls reported co-ruminating more than did boys, which helped to account for girls' more positive friendship adjustment and greater internalizing symptoms. Other analyses addressed whether co-rumination and the related constructs of self-disclosure and rumination had different relations with friendship and emotional adjustment.

AB Guided by the emotional security hypothesis, this research identified (1) individual differences in children's strategies for preserving their emotional security in the interparental relationship, and (2) the psychosocial and family correlates of these individual differences. Study 1 assessed reactivity to parental conflict simulations among 56 school-age children, whereas Study 2 solicited child and mother reports of 170 young adolescents' reactions to actual marital conflict. Cluster analyses in both studies indicated that children fit three profiles: (1) secure children, who showed well-regulated concern and positive representations of interparental relationships; (2) insecure-preoccupied children, who evidenced heightened distress, involvement or avoidance, and negative representations of interparental relationships; and (3) insecure-dismissing children, who displayed overt signs of elevated distress, avoidance, and involvement and low levels of subjective distress, avoidance and intervention impulses, and negative internal representations. Results in both studies indicated that preoccupied and dismissing children experienced more interparental conflict than did secure children and preoccupied children evidenced the highest levels of internalizing symptoms. Study 2 results indicated that dismissing children had the highest levels of externalizing symptoms and preoccupied and dismissing children reported more coping, family, and personality difficulties than did secure children.

The 481 participants completed a well-validated measure of the FFM and a structured diagnostic interview at age 21 years. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that unique constellations of personality characteristics were associated with symptoms of alcohol abuse, marijuana abuse, APD, and internalizing disorders. For example, symptoms of alcohol abuse were associated with high Extraversion and low Conscientiousness, whereas symptoms of marijuana abuse were characterized by low Extraversion and high Openness to Experience. Findings have implications for models of the etiology and treatment of substance use and abuse.

ID CHILDREN; ADJUSTMENT; DIVORCE
AB Using a resiliency framework, we examined familial and extrafamilial factors associated with adolescent well-being in intact, blended, and divorced single-parent families. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using a large sample of 7th-, 9th-, and 11th-grade adolescents (N = 2,011) to test the moderating effect of peer support, school attachment, and neighbor support when parental support and monitoring were low. Significant two- and three-way interactions were probed. Findings indicate that divorced and blended families have some of the same forms of resiliency as intact families. For adolescents in a divorced single-parent family, peer support moderated the effect of low parental support on internalizing symptoms. We discuss the merits of examining divorce from a resiliency perspective.

AB Factorial structure of the Youth Self-Report. Principal components/varimax analyses of the YSR problem items (Achenbach, 1991) were performed for each gender group, in a sample of 2833 students aged 11-18. From the analysis of the common items found in the nine first-order factors derived for each gender, the following core syndromes were derived, that were slightly different from those obtained by Achenbach: Depression, Verbal aggression, Delinquent behaviour, Thought problems, Somatic complaints, Social (withdrawn) problems, Attention-seeking behaviour, and Phobic-anxious behaviour. Second-order factor analysis of the eight syndrome scales reflected a distinction between internalizing vs. externalizing psychopathology (i.e., emotional/conduct disorders), to a great extent similar to that found in some other multivariate analyses.

AB Construct validity (convergent and divergent) of the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA; McDermott, Marston, & Stott, 1993) and the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales (PKBS; Merrell, 1994a) is presented.(-) Regular classroom teachers (n = 38) randomly selected 5- and 6-year-old children (N = 123) and rated them on the ASCA and PKBS in counterbalanced order. Convergent evidence of construct validity was observed for the PKBS Externalizing Problems scale and the ASCA Overactivity syndrome. Divergent evidence of construct validity was provided for the PKBS Externalizing Problems scale and ASCA Underactivity syndrome. Convergent and divergent evidence of construct validity for the PKBS Internalizing Problems scale and ASCA Overactivity, and Underactivity syndromes was mixed.

ID PERSONALITY; NEUROTICISM; PSYCHOLOGY; HAPPINESS; PROGRESS; HAPPY
AB The relationships among stressful life events (SLEs), temperament, externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and global life satisfaction were investigated. The Students' Life Satisfaction Scale, the Youth Self Report (YSR) form of the Child Behavior Checklist, a portion of the Life Events Checklist, and the Abbreviated Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, were administered to 1,201 adolescents in grades 6 through 12 in a small city in the Southeast. A modest correlation was found between life satisfaction and Extraversion, whereas moderate correlations were found between life satisfaction and Neuroticism and life satisfaction and SLEs. Based upon hierarchical regression analyses, temperament variables accounted for approximately 16% of the variance in predictions of life satisfaction ratings. When SLEs were added, an additional 3% of the variance in life satisfaction ratings was subsequently explained. Life satisfaction did not operate as a moderator between SLEs and problem behavior. However, when global life satisfaction was added as a mediator variable, results indicated a partial mediational effect, particularly on internalizing behavior. Limitations of the study as well as implications for comprehensive psychological assessments are discussed. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID DEPRESSION; ADOLESCENCE; ADJUSTMENT; CHILDHOOD; PROGRAM; ANXIETY
AB Context Compared with their peers with nondivorced parents, adolescents with divorced parents are more likely to have mental health problems, drop out of school, and become pregnant. The long-term effects of intervention programs for this population are unknown.
   Objective To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of 2 programs designed to prevent mental health problems in children with divorced parents.
   Design and Setting Six-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of 2 intervention programs (mother program: 11 group and 2 individual sessions; mother plus child program: mother program and 11 group sessions for children) and a control condition (books on postdivorce adjustment), which was conducted in a large metropolitan US city from April 1998 through March 2000.
   Participants A total of 218 families (91% of the original sample) with adolescents aged between 15 and 19 years were reinterviewed.
   Main Outcome Measures Externalizing and internalizing problems, diagnosed mental disorders, drug and alcohol use, and number of sexual partners.
   Results Eleven percent of adolescents in the mother plus child program (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8%-18.2%) had a 1-year prevalence of diagnosed mental disorder compared with 23.5% (95% Cl, 13.8%-33.2%) of adolescents in the control program (P=.007). Adolescents in the mother plus child program had fewer sexual partners (mean [SE], 0.68 [0.16]) compared with adolescents in the control program 0.65 [0.37]; P=.01). Adolescents with higher initial mental health problems whose families were in the mother plus child program had lower externalizing problems (P=.007) and fewer symptoms of mental disorder (P=.02) compared with those in the control program. Compared with controls, adolescents whose mothers participated in the mother program and who had higher initial mental health problems had lower levels of externalizing problems (P<.001); fewer symptoms of mental disorder (P=.005); and less alcohol (P=.005), marijuana (P=.02), and other drug use (P=.01).
   Conclusions In adolescents of divorced parents, the mother program and the mother plus child program reduced symptoms of mental disorder; rates of diagnoses of mental disorder; levels of externalizing problems; marijuana, alcohol, and other drug use; and number of sexual partners.

AB This investigation examined relations among perceptions of mothers, attributional style, and counselor-rated behavior problems in 187 school age children (88 maltreated, 99 nonmaltreated). Hypotheses regarding the presence of higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in maltreated children were confirmed. Attributional style was found to function as a moderator of externalizing behavior problems, suggesting that attributional style exerts a protective role against the harmful effect of child maltreatment. Perceptions of mothers were found to operate as a mediator of both internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, with maltreated children with less positive perceptions of their mothers exhibiting greater internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. These findings advance knowledge of how cognitive processes contribute to behavior problems in maltreated children and possess implications for prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Effortful control, a temperamentally based ability to inhibit a dominant response and activate a subdominant response, was assessed on 3 occasions using a comprehensive, age-appropriate behavioral battery in this 4-year longitudinal study of children (N = 103) from toddlerhood to early school age. The focus was twofold: to explore the structure of effortful control in a normally developing sample and to examine the relations between effortful control and adaptive functioning. Exploratory factor analyses supported the contention that effortful control is a complex, multidimensional construct with longitudinally stable factors. Effortful control was also significantly associated with mother-reported total behavior problems in a nonlinear fashion, with lower and higher levels of effortful control contributing to higher total problem scores. These findings have implications for the assessment of temperament in children and, most importantly, for the study of nonlinear contributions of temperament to early childhood behaviors.

AB This study examined mothers' attributions of the causality of noncompliance in their children with Down syndrome (n = 37) compared with children with other causes of mental retardation (n = 22). Mothers rated two vignettes of simple noncompliance and completed questionnaires about their child's personality and maladaptive behaviors. Instead of attributing causality along the "classical" categories of locus, controllability, and stability, mothers in both groups used normalizing-temporary and excuse-making attributions. Higher ratings of normalizing-temporary compared with excuse-making occurred in both groups. There was also an interaction effect such that, compared with mothers in the mixed group, mothers in the Down syndrome group showed higher normalizing-temporary versus excuse-making attributions. In the Down syndrome group, normalizing-temporary attributions correlated negatively with children's internalizing behaviors and positively with children's personality. Excuse-making attributions correlated with children's externalizing behaviors in the Down syndrome group and with children's internalizing problems in the mixed group. Our results highlight the importance of understanding parental attributions for noncompliant behavior among children with different causes of mental retardation.

AB Objective: This is the third article in a series of 10-year reviews of rating scales. Here, the authors review scales that are useful in tapping the affective disturbances experienced with various psychiatric disorders, including suicidality, cognitive style, and self-esteem. Method: The authors sampled articles incorporating these constructs over the past 25 years and selected scales with established uses or new development. Those presented here have adequate psychometric properties and high utility for efficiently elucidating youths' functioning, plus either wide literature citations or a special niche. Results: These scales were developed bimodally. Many were developed in the 1980s when internalizing disorders were elucidated, but there has been a resurgence of interest in these constructs. Scales assessing suicidality have clear constructs, whereas scales of cognitive style demonstrate deficits in developmental relevance, and scales of self-esteem suffer from lax constructs. Conclusions: The constructs underlying these scales tap core symptoms of internalizing disorders, mediate the expression of affective disturbances associated with various disorders, and depict the impairments resulting from these disorders. Overall, the psychometrics of these scales are adequate. These scales provide a broader representation of youths' functioning than that conveyed with diagnostic scales alone.

AB The basis for cognitive impairment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is not well understood but may be related to abnormal expression of dystrophin in brain. The aim of this study was to determine whether regional brain glucose metabolism is altered in children with DMD and whether such metabolic disturbances are localized to regions shown to be normally rich in dystrophin expression. Ten boys (mean age, 11.8 years) with DMD and 17 normal adults as a control group (mean age, 27.6 years) underwent 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) and neuropsychological evaluation. The PET data were analyzed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The SPM analysis showed five clusters of decreased glucose metabolism in children with DMD, including the medial temporal structures and cerebellum bilaterally and the sensorimotor and lateral temporal cortex on the right side. At the voxel level, significant glucose hypometabolism was found in the right postcentral and middle temporal gyri, uncus, and VIIIB cerebellar lobule, as well as in the left hippocampal gyrus and cerebellar lobule. The neuropsychological profile of the DMD group revealed borderline nonverbal intellectual functioning, impaired manual dexterity bilaterally, borderline cognitive functioning, and internalizing behavioral difficulties. Our findings demonstrate region-specific hypometabolism, as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits in DMD children. As the regions showing hypometabolism on PET include those normally rich in dystrophin expression, it will be important to determine whether the hypometabolic regions also show cytoarchitectural abnormalities related to the lack of dystrophin.

AB Objective. Hunger, with its adverse consequences for children, continues to be an important national problem. Previous studies that document the deleterious effects of hunger among children cannot distinguish child from family hunger and do not take into account some critical environmental, maternal, and child variables that may influence child outcomes. This study examines the independent contribution of child hunger on children's physical and mental health and academic functioning, when controlling for a range of environmental, maternal, and child factors that have also been associated with poor outcomes among children.
   Methods. With the use of standardized tools, comprehensive demographic, psychosocial, and health data were collected in Worcester, Massachusetts, from homeless and low-income housed mothers and their children (180 preschool-aged children and 228 school-aged children). Mothers and children were part of a larger unmatched case-control study of homelessness among female-headed households. Hunger was measured by a set of 7 dichotomous items, each asking the mother whether she has or her children have experienced a particular aspect of hunger during the past year-1 concerns food insecurity for the entire family, 2 concern adult hunger, and 4 involve child hunger. The items, taken from the Childhood Hunger Identification Project measure, are summed to classify the family and divided into 3 categories: no hunger, adult or moderate child hunger, or severe child hunger (indicating multiple signs of child hunger). Outcome measures included children's chronic health condition count using questions adapted from the National Health Interview Survey, Child Health Supplement, and internalizing behavior problems and anxiety/depression, measured by the Child Behavior Checklist. Additional covariates included demographic variables (ie, age, gender, ethnicity, housing status, number of moves, family size, income), low birth weight, child life events (ie, care and protection order, out of home placement, abuse, severe life events count), developmental problems (ie, developmental delay, learning disability, emotional problems), and mother's distress and psychiatric illness. Multivariate regression analyses examined the effect of child hunger on physical and mental health outcomes.
   Results. The average family size for both preschoolers and school-aged children was 3; about one third of both groups were white and 40% Puerto Rican. The average income of families was approximately $11 000.
   Among the school-aged children, on average 10 years old, 50% experienced moderate child hunger and 16% severe child hunger. Compared with those with no hunger, school-aged children with severe hunger were more likely to be homeless (56% vs 29%), have low birth weights (23% vs 6%), and have more stressful life events (9 vs 6) when compared with those with no hunger. School-aged children with severe hunger scores had parent-reported anxiety scores that were more than double the scores for children with no hunger and significantly higher chronic illness counts (3.4 vs 1.8) and internalizing behavior problems when compared with children with no hunger. There was no relationship between hunger and academic achievement. Among preschool-aged children, who averaged 4 years of age, 51% experienced moderate child hunger and 8% severe child hunger. For preschoolers, compared with children with no hunger, severe hunger was associated with homelessness (75% vs 48%), more traumatic life events (8.5 vs 6), low birth weight (23% vs 6%), and higher levels of chronic illness and internalizing behavior problems. Mothers of both preschoolers and school-aged children who reported severe hunger were more likely to have a lifetime diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.
   For school-aged children, severe hunger was a significant predictor of chronic illness after controlling for housing status, mother's distress, low birth weight, and child live events. For preschoolers, moderate hunger was a significant predictor of health conditions while controlling for potential explanatory factors. For both preschoolers and school-aged children, severe child hunger was associated with higher levels of internalizing behavior problems. After controlling for housing status, mother's distress, and stressful life events, severe child hunger was also associated with higher reported anxiety/depression among school-aged children.
   Conclusion. This study goes beyond previous research and highlights the independent relationship between severe child hunger and adverse physical health and mental health outcomes among low-income children. Study findings underscore the importance of clinical recognition of child hunger and its outcomes, allowing for preventive interventions and efforts to increase access to food-related resources for families.

AB The Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIRGAS; Zero to Three, 1994) provides a continuously distributed scale of infant-parent relationship adaptation, raging from 'well-adapted' to 'dangerously impaired'. The present study examines the predictive validity of the PIRGAS in a high-risk sample by coding relationship adaptation level from a single sample of 10 min of unstructured free play between mothers and their 20-month-old infants and examining its relationship to subsequent interaction with mothers and behavior problems at 24 months. Relationship adaptation assessed reliably from observations of only 10 min of free play between mothers and their infants at 20 months of age using PIRGAS predicted subsequent mother- infant interaction in a laboratory based problem-solving paradigm (Crowell procedure) at 24 months and internalizing symptomatology of Child Behavior Checklist at age 24 months. These results contribute to the predictive validity of the PIRGAS as a measure of mother-infant relationship adaptation.

AB This review covers the past decade's research on the risk for exposure to community violence and the effects of exposure on children's and adolescents' functioning. The studies are incorporated into a developmental-ecological framework that takes into account five domains of context-community and neighborhood, family and household, relationships with parents and caregivers, relationships with peers, and personal characteristics-for the purpose of identifying the risks for exposure and its effects on outcome and for suggesting the processes involved. Evidence from the literature is consistent with our proposed ecological model showing that variables in each of the five domains have both direct and indirect effects on risk for exposure and on its effects on internalizing and externalizing problems and academic functioning. Implications of adopting an ecological model for future risk research and for prevention and intervention are considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The primary purposes of this study were to examine whether maternal optimism is related to positive parenting and child adjustment and whether it contributes beyond maternal depressive symptoms to our understanding. The participants were 141 African American single mothers and one of their children. Findings revealed that maternal optimism was associated with positive parenting and this association was only partially mediated by maternal depressive symptoms. Maternal optimism was not associated with child psychosocial adjustment, but positive parenting was associated with lower levels of both internalizing and externalizing difficulties. The utility of understanding the link between maternal optimism and parenting for prevention and intervention efforts aimed at enhancing quality of life and subsequent child adjustment is discussed, as well as directions for future research on maternal optimism.

AB The aim of this study was to describe the history, factor structure and psychometric properties of the Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale (CATS). The CATS is a self-report measure designed to assess a wide range of negative self-statements in children and adolescents. The results of confirmatory factor analyses supported four distinct but strongly correlated factors relating to automatic thoughts on physical threat, social threat, personal failure and hostility. The internal consistency of the total score and subscales was high and test-retest reliability at 1 and 3 months was acceptable. The CATS effectively discriminated between control children and adolescents, and clinically anxious, depressed, or behavior disorder children and adolescents, and showed good discriminant validity across clinical subgroups on the subscales. Results suggest that the CATS is a promising instrument in the assessment of a range of negative automatic thoughts across both internalizing and externalizing problems in young people.

AB The purpose of this study was to build on preliminary findings of unusually high internalizing symptoms and substance use among suburban high school students. The sample consisted of 302 sixth- and seventh-grade students in an affluent, suburban community. Findings corroborated expectations regarding several domains of vulnerability, showing (1) high rates of clinically significant depressive symptoms among older girls, (2) significant links between various internalizing symptoms and substance use among both boys and girls, and (3) peers' approval of substance use among older boys. In exploring potential causes of distress in this suburban sample, associations were found for achievement pressures (particularly excessive perfectionistic strivings), and isolation from parents (particularly low perceived closeness to mothers). Findings of this study are discussed in terms of widespread stereotypes about affluent families, as well as implications for future research and preventive interventions for a subgroup of youth typically viewed as being at "low risk".

AB We present an analysis of the role of emotions in normal and abnormal development and preventive intervention. The conceptual framework stems from three tenets of differential emotions theory (DET). These principles concern the constructs of emotion utilization; intersystem connections among modular emotion systems, cognition, and action; and the organizational and motivational functions of discrete emotions. Particular emotions and patterns of emotions function differentially in different periods of development and in influencing the cognition and behavior associated with different forms of psychopathology. Established prevention programs have not emphasized the concept of emotion as motivation. It is even more critical that they have generally neglected the idea of modulating emotions, not simply to achieve self-regulation, but also to utilize their inherently adaptive functions as a means of facilitating the development of social competence and preventing psychopathology. The paper includes a brief description of a theory-based prevention program and suggestions for complementary targeted interventions to address specific externalizing and internalizing problems. In the final section, we describe ways in which emotion-centered preventions can provide excellent opportunities for research on the development of normal and abnormal behavior.

AB The authors examined 223 children at age 4 years for the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure, exposure to other substances, maternal and environmental risk factors, and neonatal medical problems on IQ, externalizing problems. and internalizing problems. Regression analyses showed that maternal verbal IQ and low environmental risk predicted child IQ. Cocaine exposure negatively predicted children's overall IQ and verbal reasoning scores, but only for boys. Cocaine exposure also predicted poorer short-term memory. Maternal harsh discipline, maternal depressive symptoms, and increased environmental risk predicted externalizing problems. In contrast, only maternal depressive symptoms predicted internalizing problems. These findings indicate that early exposure to substances is largely unrelated to subsequent IQ or adjustment, particularly for girls.

AB This longitudinal study examined the relation between the instability of maternal intimate relationships and the school behavior of 3rd-grade children from economically disadvantaged families. After ecological correlates were controlled, chronic relationship instability predicted externalizing behavior for boys and girls and internalizing behavior for girls, but not academic competence. In addition, past and recent instability had independent effects: Recent instability moderated the relation for past instability, and child adjustment in highly unstable families varied with verbal ability and aspects of the family ecology. The theoretical implications concern conceptualizations of the diverse and dynamic nature of family arrangements experienced by disadvantaged children.

AB Associations between histories of family disruption (residential moves and separations from parent figures) and adolescent adjustment (including educational, internalizing, externalizing. and sexual behavior outcomes) were examined in a random sample of 267 African American girls from 3 urban poverty neighborhoods. Higher numbers of residential moves and parental separations significantly predicted greater adolescent adjustment problems after household demographic characteristics were controlled. Adolescents' perceptions of their current relationships and neighborhoods were significantly associated with adolescent adjustment but did not mediate the effects of family disruption. Associations between parental separations and adolescent outcomes were strongest for externalizing problems and were found for both male and female caregivers, for long-standing and more temporary caregivers, and for separations in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence.

AB Examined the relation between children's self-reported anger and sadness regulation and the presence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Participants were 121 boys and 106 girls in the fourth and fifth grades who completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), Emotion Expression Scale for Children (EESC), and Children's Emotion Management Scales (CSMS, CAMS) and rated each other on aggressive behavior Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that the inability to identify emotional states, the inhibition of anger the dysregulation of anger and sadness, and the constructive coping with anger predicted internalizing symptoms. The dysregulated expression of sadness and constructive coping with anger were inversely related to externalizing symptoms.

AB Office discipline referrals are one approach that educators could use (a) as a guide in the development and/or selection of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs; (b) as an outcome measure with which to assess the effectiveness of those programs; and (c) as an early screening procedure to identify children who might benefit from the secondary and tertiary programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which children who met the borderline and clinical cut-off scores on the Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, 1991 b) received one or more office discipline referrals (the most liberal criteria possible) to determine the levels of false negatives (failure to detect a problem when one exists) that would occur if one used office discipline referrals as an early screening device. The relatively high levels of false negatives suggest that the use of office discipline referrals as an early screening device may fail to identify relatively large numbers of young children in need of interventions and supports. This issue appears to be even more pronounced in the case of students who are experiencing internalizing-related problems. Results, limitations, and future research needs are discussed.

AB Being the recipient of favored parental treatment has been identified as a correlate of enhanced socioemotional well-being. However, knowledge of children's perceptions of the legitimacy of preferential treatment may provide a more complete understanding of associations between preferential treatment and children's socioemotional well-being. The current study investigated whether children's well-being varies in accordance with their views about the fairness of preferential parental treatment. One hundred thirty-five children (M = 11.74 years) and their older siblings (M = 14.64 years) were interviewed independently about parents' distribution of affection and control. Although the amount of preferential control children reported experiencing was related to more externalizing behavior problems, lower levels of internalizing behavior problems and greater global self-esteem were indicated when children perceived that such preferential behaviors were fair.

AB Background Although children with Down's syndrome (DS) are at lower risk for psychopathology than others with intellectual disability, they do show more problems than typically developing children. However, age-related trends in these problems remain unclear.
   Methods The present authors examined age-related changes in the maladaptive behaviours of 211 children and adolescents with DS aged between 4 and 19 years (mean = 9.74 years). Most participants (n = 180) were recruited from families residing in the greater Los Angeles area, California, USA, while a minority (n = 31) were patients from a clinic specializing in the psychiatric management of people with DS. The participants were divided into four age groups: (1) 4-6 years, (2) 7-9 years, (3) 10-13 years and (4) 14-19 years.
   Results Externalizing behaviours were lower across both the community and clinic samples, while internalizing behaviours were significantly higher in older adolescents aged between 14 and 19 years. Increases were found in withdrawal, seen in 63% of community-based adolescents, and 75% of clinic adolescents.
   Conclusions Older adolescents with DS may show decreased externalizing symptoms and subtle increases in withdrawal. Possible relationships are discussed between these shifts and increased risks of later-onset depression and Alzheimer's disease in adults with DS.

AB Evidence regarding the sensitivity of the Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC) in detecting differences between clinic-referred children identified as internalizers, clinic-referred noninternalizing children, and nonreferred children was examined. ISSC scores differentiated accurately among the three groups. Accuracy of ISSC scores in classifying children into clinic-referred and nonreferred children, as well as internalizers and noninternalizers, was also studied. Results indicated that children were classified into their respective diagnostic groups very efficiently using the overall pattern of all ISSC item scores. Evidence for the criterion-related validity of ISSC scores through correlations with scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was also evaluated. ISSC scores were correlated significantly with the CBCL broadband scores and with the classification of clinic-referred children as internalizers and noninternalizers. These results provide additional support for the validity of the ISSC as a measure of internalizing symptoms and positive and negative affectivity in elementary-age children.

AB Objective: Externalizing and internalizing problems may aggregate in families because (1) siblings share genetic risks for problem behaviors or (2) siblings are exposed to similar environmental risks. A genetically sensitive design was used to determine whether domestic violence accounted significantly for the variation and covariation of externalizing and internalizing problems, independent of additive genetic effects on these behavior problems. Method: Using the Achenbach family of instruments, mothers and teachers reported internalizing and externalizing problems for 1,116 monozygotic and dizygotic 5-year-old twin pairs in the United Kingdom (93% response rate). Mothers reported their experiences of domestic violence in the previous 5 years. Structural equation models were tested to determine the effect of mothers' experiences of domestic violence on children's emotional and conduct problems, controlling for latent genetic and environmental effects on these behaviors. Results: A multivariate model showed that adult domestic violence accounted for 2% and 5% of the variation in children's internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively, independent of genetic effects. The co-occurence of externalizing and internalizing scores was accounted for by genetic (62.6%) and shared environmental (29.2%) factors and by domestic violence (8%). Conclusions: Because domestic violence affects children's behavior problems beyond genetic influences, programs that successfully reduce domestic violence should also prevent children's psychopathology.

AB OBJECTIVES. Efficient and accurate instruments for assessing child psychopathology are increasingly important in clinical practice and research. For example, screening in primary care settings can identify children and adolescents with disorders that may otherwise go undetected. However, primary care offices are notorious for the brevity of visits and screening must not burden patients or staff with long questionnaires. One solution is to shorten assessment instruments, but dropping questions typically makes an instrument less accurate. An alternative is adaptive testing, in which a computer selects the items to be asked of a patient based on the patient's previous responses. This research used a simulation to test a child mental health screen based on this technology.
   RESEARCH DESIGN. Using half of a large sample of data, a computerized version was developed of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC), a parental-report psychosocial problem screen. With the unused data, a simulation was conducted to determine whether the Adaptive PSC can reproduce the results of the full PSC with greater efficiency.
   SUBJECTS. PSCs were completed by parents on 21,150 children seen in a national sample of primary care practices.
   RESULTS. Four latent psychosocial problem dimensions were identified through factor analysis: internalizing problems, externalizing problems, attention problems, and school problems. A simulated adaptive test measuring these traits asked an average of 11.6 questions per patient, and asked five or fewer questions for 49% of the sample. There was high agreement between the adaptive test and the full (35-item) PSC: only 1.3% of screening decisions were discordant (K = 0.93). This agreement was higher than that obtained using a comparable length (12-item) short-form PSC (3.2% of decisions discordant; K = 0.84).
   CONCLUSIONS. Multidimensional adaptive testing may be an accurate and efficient technology for screening for mental health problems in primary care settings.

Associations were stronger between maternal than paternal psychopathology and the presence of internalizing (but not externalizing) problems in children, with all average effect sizes being small in magnitude. Relations were moderated by variables that highlight theoretically relevant differences between psychopathology in mothers versus fathers (e.g., age of children studied, type of parental psychopathology) and by variables related to methodological differences across studies (e.g., method of assessing psychopathology in parents and children, type of sample recruited. familial composition).

AB The present study focuses on the evaluation of mental health outcome of 151 young people who received psychodynamic psychotherapy at the Brandon Centre, a community-based psychodynamic psychotherapy centre for young people. This paper reports the results from a 1-year follow-up based on self-report data. Participants aged 12-18 years completed either the Youth Self Report form or, if they were aged over 18, the Young Adult Self Report form at intake, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The domains evaluated included young people's externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and total problems. Outcome was measured in three different ways: the change in mean scores; the change in numbers from the clinical to the non-clinical range; and categorizing cases according to the presence of statistically reliable change in the level of adaptation. These approaches showed improvement among participants in all three domains. Although there was a high general tendency to improve, the rate of improvement dropped significantly over time. Several tentative predictors of improvement were identified. The paper discusses how the results from systematic monitoring of effectiveness at the Brandon Centre have formed an empirical basis that has led to changes in service delivery with the aim of optimizing provision for troubled young people.

AB The primary goals of this study were to (a) investigate the relationships among students' perceived social support and a wide range of academic, behavioral, and social indicators; and (b) determine critical levels of perceived social support associated with these academic, behavioral, and social indicators. This study consisted of data from a total of 1,711 students (n = 856 males and n = 855 females) in Grades 3 through 12 from seven states. The primary instruments used to collect data were the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (Malecki, Demaray, Elliott, & Nolten, 1999), the Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliott, 1990), the Student Self-Concept Scale (Gresham, Elliott, & Evans-Fernandez, 1993), and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1998). Significant, positive relationships among perceived social support and a variety of positive indicators (e.g., social skills, self-concept, and adaptive skills) were found. In addition, significant, negative relationships among perceived social support and a variety of problematic behavioral indicators (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behaviors) were found. Students were categorized as having low (bottom 25%), average (middle 50%), and high (top 25%) levels of perceived social support. Students with low perceived support obtained significantly higher scores on problematic behavior indicators (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behaviors) and significantly lower scores on positive behavior indicators (e.g., teacher-reported social skills, self-concept, adaptive skills) than students with average or high perceived support. Only student-rated social skills and self-concept were significantly higher for the high versus the average level of perceived support. These results are followed by a discussion of the importance of varying levels (low, average, high) of perceived social support in students' lives. Implications of the findings of this study for school psychologists are discussed.

AB Context The cognitive and behavioral outcomes of school-aged children who were born preterm have been reported extensively. Many of these studies have methodological flaws that preclude an accurate estimate of the long-term outcomes of prematurity.
   Objective To estimate the effect of preterm birth on cognition and behavior in school-aged children.
   Data Sources MEDLINE search (1980 to November 2001) for English-language articles, supplemented by a manual search of personal files maintained by 2 of the authors.
   Study Selection We included case-control studies reporting cognitive and/or behavioral data of children who were born preterm and who were evaluated after their fifth birthday if the attrition rate was less than 30%. From the 227 reviewed studies, cognitive data from 15 studies and behavioral data from 16 studies were selected.
   Data Extraction Data on population demographics, study characteristics, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes were extracted from each study, entered in a customized database, and reviewed twice to minimize error. Differences between the mean cognitive scores of cases and controls were pooled. Homogeneity across studies was formally tested using a general variance-based method and graphically using Galbraith plots. Linear meta-analysis regression models were fitted to explore the impact of birth weight and gestational age on cognitive outcomes. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) were calculated for the incidence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and pooled. Quality assessment of the studies was performed based on a 10-point scale. Publication bias was examined using Begg modified funnel plots and formally teste using the Egger weighted-linear regression method.
   Data Synthesis Among 1556 cases and 1720 controls, controls had significantly higher cognitive scores compared with children who were born preterm (weighted mean difference, 10.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2-12.5). The mean cognitive scores of preterm-born cases and term-born controls were directly proportional to their birth weight (R-2=0.51; P<.001) and gestational age (R-2=0.49; P<.001). Age at evaluation had no significant correlation with mean difference in cognitive scores (R-2=0.12; P=.20). Preterm-born children showed increases in externalizing and internalizing behaviors in 81% of studies and had more than twice the RR for developing ADHD (pooled RR, 2.64; 95% Cl, 1.85-3.78). No differences were noted in cognition and behaviors based on the quality of the study.
   Conclusions Children who were born preterm are at risk for reduced cognitive test scores and their immaturity at birth is directly proportional to the mean cognitive scores at school age. Preterm-born children also show an increased incidence of ADHD and other behaviors.

ID COMMUNITY VIOLENCE; ADOLESCENTS EXPOSURE; SYMPTOMS; PROJECT
AB Objectives: To examine how much distress children report in response to violence that they have witnessed and how this is associated with parental reports of children's behavior.
   Methods: As part of a study of in utero exposure to cocaine, children completed the Levonn interview for assessing children's symptoms of distress in response to witnessing violence. The children's caregivers completed the Exposure to Violence Interview (EVI), a caretaker-report measure of the child's exposure to violent events during the last 12 months. The EVI was analyzed as a 3-level variable: no exposure, low exposure, and high exposure. The caregivers also completed the Children's Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: Of 94 six-year-old children, 58% had no exposure to violence, 36% had low exposure to violence, and 6% had high exposure to violence, according to caretaker reports. The children's median SD Levonn score was 64 (SD +/- 19.3). The mean SD +/- CBCL total T-score was 53 (SD +/- 10.2). In multiple regression analyses with gender, low and high exposure on EVI, Levonn, and prenatal cocaine exposure status as predictors, the Levonn score explained 4.8% of total variance in children's CBCL internalizing scores. 9.1% of the total variance in CBCL externalizing score, and 12.2% of the total variance in CBCL total score (P=.04, P=.004, and P<.001, respectively).
   Conclusions: After accounting for the caretaker's report of the level of the child's exposure to violence, the child's own report significantly increased the amount of variance in predicting child behavior problems with the CBCL. These findings indicate that clinicians and researchers should elicit children's own accounts of exposure to violence in addition to the caretakers' when attempting to understand children's behavior.

AB Objective: To assess the relationship between risk and protective factors and the continuity of psychological problems from age 7 to age 33.
   Methods: Data on 5591 cohort members of the National Child Development Study were used to track continuity and discontinuity between internalizing and externalizing problems at age 7, as assessed by the Rutter 'A' Health and Behaviour Checklist, and psychological distress at age 33, as assessed by the Malaise Inventory, controlling for risk and protective groupings present at age 7.
   Results: There was no association between malaise in adulthood and internalizing problems in childhood. However, people who had externalizing problems in childhood were nearly twice as likely as those without such problems to have high Malaise scores in adulthood. A grouping of risk factors (police/probation experience by family, agency referral for difficulties in school, social services involvement, domestic tension) did not predict malaise in adulthood. Also a grouping of protective factors (outings with mother, father reads to child, good creative skills, good numeric skills) predicted that women were less likely to have high Malaise scores in adult life.
   Conclusions: Protective factors in childhood were strongly associated with lower Malaise scores in adulthood. Research on factors associated with discontinuity of psychological problems may prove fruitful.

AB The Spanish version of the Burnett Self-Talk Inventory (BSTI) was used to assess the dimensions of self-statements made in response to imaginary situations in a sample of 856 adolescents (13-17-year-olds). Participants completed both the BSTI and the Youth Self-Report. A series of confirmatory factor analyses showed that a hierarchical structure of self-talk was the most adequate. This model included 2 higher order factors (positive vs. negative self-talk) and 4 first-order factors (self-focused negative cognitions, other-focused negative cognitions, coping self-instructions, and positive cognitions). Likewise, it was evaluated whether positive, negative, or some proportion of positive to negative self-statements (states-of-mind-SOM ratios) would be most predictive of psychological maladjustment. Negative self-talk and SOM ratios showed a greater association with internalizing syndrome than did positive cognitions. Finally, self-talk was minimally related to the externalizing syndrome.

AB Objective: Children of alcoholics have been reported to have elevated levels of internalizing symptoms, including anxiety and depression. However, many studies have not adequately controlled for the influence of independent (i.e. not substance-induced) parental mood or anxiety disorders and other factors. The present evaluations assess the relationships of the family histories of alcohol use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders to internalizing symptoms in children of alcoholic and nonalcoholic subjects. Method: A behavioral checklist and a structured interview were administered to the parents of 140 children aged 7-18 years. The fathers of these offspring had been recruited 15 years previously from a university population to participate in a prospective study of 453 men from alcoholic and nonalcoholic families. Results: While a higher score for one of four measures of internalizing symptoms in the children was found to relate to a higher density of alcoholic relatives, this pattern was more robust in children of parents with mood or anxiety disorders. In a hierarchical regression, the family history of alcohol use disorders did not add significantly to the prediction of any of the four internalizing scores in the children after considering the impact of a family history of independent mood and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: The results indicate that internalizing symptoms in children of alcoholics were more strongly influenced by a positive family history of mood and anxiety disorders than the family history of alcohol use disorders.

AB This study examines whether fear of abandonment mediates the prospective relations between divorce stressors and mother-child relationship quality and adjustment problems of children of divorce. Participants were 216 children, ages 8-12, and their primary residential mothers. Children reported on divorce stressors and fear of abandonment; mothers and children reported on mother-child relationship quality and internalizing and externalizing problems. Structural equation models indicated that Time 1 fear of abandonment mediated the relation between Time 1 divorce stressors and Time 2 internalizing and externalizing problems. Time 1 fear of abandonment also mediated the relation between Time 1 mother-child relationship quality and Time 2 internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications of these results for understanding variability in children's postdivorce adjustment problems and interventions for divorced families are discussed.

Youth with major comorbid disorders were excluded. On the basis of an analysis of parent-derived Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ratings, significant variations in CBCL scores were associated with PTSD but not with exposure to exceptional stress in the absence of PTSD. The results also indicated that traumatic exposure without the development of PTSD was not associated with higher estimates of psychopathology.

AB Objective: To examine the prevalence of selective mutism (SM) in a public school sample and compare the functioning and symptoms of children with SM to age- and gender-matched unaffected children. Method: Kindergarten, first, and second grade teachers in a large district were asked to identify pupils who met DSM-IV-criteria for SM and to complete ratings of speaking behavior, social anxiety, other internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and overall functioning for these and comparison youngsters. Teachers completed the same ratings on the SM children 6 months later. Results: A participation rate of 94% (125 of 133 teachers) was obtained, and the prevalence of SM was 71% (16/2,256). Measures were completed for 12 (75%) of 16 identified children, Compared with peers, children with SM were more symptomatic on measures of frequency of speech, social anxiety, and other internalizing symptoms. As a group, children with SM had improved 6 months later but remained impaired and symptomatic when compared with the comparison group. Conclusions: SM may not be as rare as previously thought. The functioning of children with SM is impaired, and although there is some improvement overtime, notable impairment remains, suggesting that intervention is preferable to waiting for SM to remit spontaneously..

AB This study was carried out to examine associations between classroom climate and pupils' mental health in primary school, and whether pupils who had emotional and behavioural problems in the second grade are more vulnerable to the effects of a poor classroom climate 4 years later. The study was carried out by means of questionnaires to teachers. The students (n = 861) were surveyed in the second (aged 8 years, Time 1) and sixth grade (aged 12 years, Time 2). The Rutter Teacher Questionnaire (RB2) at Time 1 and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) at Time 2 were used to measure internalizing, externalizing and total problem scores. Classroom climate was measured using a composite variable at Time 2. The results show associations between poor sixth-grade classroom climate and an increase in emotional and behavioural problems in both boys and girls. In addition, the girls who were overall poorly adjusted, particularly those who had externalizing problems in the second grade, were especially vulnerable to a poor classroom climate in the sixth grade.

AB Objective: The authors compared self-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a cohort of Cuban children and adolescents with assessments of internalizing and externalizing behaviors by the children's teachers. Methods: Eighty-seven children and adolescents who had left Cuba by sea in the summer of 1994 and who had been confined to refugee camps for up to eight months before arriving in the United States were evaluated four to six months later. Self-reported symptoms of PTSD were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Reactive Index, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed with the Child Behavioral Check List-Teacher Report Form. Results: A majority of the children reported moderate to severe PTSD symptoms. The most common symptom clusters were avoidance (67 percent), regressive behaviors (64 percent), reexperiencing the traumatic events (60 percent), somatic symptoms (52 percent), and hyperarousal (51 percent). Eighty-six percent of the children reported that the refugee experience had severely affected most of their peers. A statistically significant dose-effect relationship was found between the number of stressors; and the severity of self-reported PTSD symptoms. There was a modest relationship between withdrawn behavior and children's feelings that they would die at sea and witnessing violence at the camps. Age and witnessing violence in the camps were moderately associated with PTSD. Teachers' overall ratings of externalizing and internalizing behaviors did not produce any clinically significant findings. Conclusions: PTSD symptoms among refugee children and adolescents who have been exposed to multiple and prolonged stressors; may continue unabated after the stressors are removed. The symptoms are expeirienced subjectively and may go unnoticed by adults.

TI Does sexual violence contribute to elevated rates of anxiety and

DT Article

   OUTCOMES; WOMEN
AB Background. It is well documented that females have higher rates of internalizing disorders (anxiety, depression) than males. It is also well known that females have higher exposure to childhood sexual abuse and sexual assault. Recently, it has been proposed that the higher levels of internalizing disorders in females may be caused by their greater exposure to sexual violence.
   Method. Data were gathered as part of the Christchurch Health and Development Study. In this study a cohort of 1265 children born in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1977 have been studied from birth to age 21 years. The measures collected included: major depression and anxiety, childhood sexual abuse and adolescent sexual assault.
   Results. Findings confirmed the established conclusion that internalizing disorders are over twice as common in females than males (ORs 2(.)2-2(.)7). In addition, it was found that females were exposed to higher rates of sexual violence than males (ORs 5(.)1-8(.)4). Statistical control for gender related differences in exposure to sexual violence reduced the associations between gender and anxiety and depression. Nonetheless, even after such control, gender was significantly (P < 0(.)0001) related to both anxiety (OR = 1(.)8; 95% CI, 1(.)3-2(.)4) and depression (OR = 1(.)9; 95% CI, 1(.)4-2(.)3).
   Conclusions. Greater female exposure to sexual violence may be a factor that contributes to greater female susceptibility to internalizing disorders. However, even after adjustment for gender differences in exposure to sexual violence it is clear that a substantial relationship between gender and internalizing disorder persists.

AB Past research with the Berkeley Adult Attachment Interview demonstrates that retrospectively defined earned-secures (who coherently describe negative childhood experiences) parent as effectively as do continuous-secures (who coherently describe positive childhood experiences), but manifest liabilities in the form of depressive symptomatology. This article presents data from a 23-year longitudinal study that replicate and extend prior research, testing a key premise that earned-secures so defined actually have a history of insecure attachments that change over time and/or endure consistently harsh or ineffective parenting in their youth. Discrepant with assumptions, retrospective earned-secures were not more likely than continuous-secures to have been anxiously attached in infancy and were observed in childhood and adolescence to have encountered among the most supportive and structured maternal parenting in a high-risk sample. Prospectively defined earned-secures (operationalized using participants' infant attachment classifications) did indeed go on to have success in their close relationships, many without reporting relatively high levels of internalizing distress in adulthood.

AB Objectives: To determine the psychosocial correlates of recurrent pediatric pain and its relationship to health service use and medical presentations for "unexplained" symptoms in primary care.
   Study design: Children 4 to 15 years of age who complained frequently of aches and pains to parents were compared with those with infrequent or no pain on measures of demographics, psychopathology, school attendance and performance, perceived health, and service use. Univariate analysis was followed by logistic regression.
   Results: Children who complained often of aches and pains used more health services, had more psychosocial problems, missed more school, and did worse academically. After controlling for health service use and demographics, recurrent pain was significantly associated with negative parental perceptions of child health and the presence of internalizing psychiatric symptoms. Higher levels of ambulatory health service use were associated with negative perceptions of child health, recurrent pain, visits for "unexplained" symptoms, and internalizing psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions: Pediatric recurrent pain challenges traditional service delivery models characterized by segregated systems of care for physical and mental disorders. Longitudinal and psychobiological studies of the relationship between recurrent pain, internalizing psychopathology, and health beliefs are warranted to direct future treatment efforts.

AB This study addressed two questions about single-parent African American families: Are parenting strategies associated with perceived risks in the environmental context? and Does the association between parenting and child adjustment depend on the context in which parenting occurs? Families (N = 277) resided in 2 communities that differed in violence-related risk: one rural (low risk) and one urban (high risk). Mother-reported monitoring and warm, supportive mother-child relationships and child-reported internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social competence were examined. Mothers monitored their children more in the urban than the rural community. The warmth and supportive nature of the mother-child relationship did not differ across contexts. A warm, supportive mother-child relationship was associated with fewer internalizing and externalizing child behaviors in both contexts. Monitoring was associated with fewer problem behaviors only in the urban community.

AB Objective: This article highlights the manner in which child neglect, the most common form of maltreatment, affects children's development.
   Method: The review is organized according to three developmental periods (i.e., infancy/preschool, school-aged and younger adolescents, and older adolescents and adults) and major developmental processes (cognitive, social-emotional, and behavioral). Although the focus is on specific and unique effects of various forms of child neglect, particular attention is paid to studies that allow comparisons of neglect and abuse that clarify their similarities and differences.
   Results: Past as well as very recent findings converge on the conclusion that child neglect can have severe, deleterious short- and long-term effects on children's cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral development. Consistent with attachment and related theories, neglect occurring early in life is particularly detrimental to subsequent development. Moreover, neglect is associated with effects that are, in many areas, unique from physical abuse, especially throughout childhood and early adolescence. Relative to physically abused children, neglected children have more severe cognitive and academic deficits, social withdrawal and limited peer interactions, and internalizing (as opposed to externalizing) problems.
   Conclusions: The current review offers further support for the long-standing conclusion that child neglect poses a significant challenge to children's development and well-being. Limitations with regard,to the state of the knowledge are discussed and directions for future research are outlined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to investigate whether behavioural or emotional problems in adolescents detected by their teachers are signs of a common psychosocial maladjustment and of the beginning of social marginalization. Altogether, 171 pupils (15 years of age) from the eastern part of Finland participated in the survey, Behavioural and emotional problems and academic achievements were assessed separately by two teachers. Pupils filled in a questionnaire about alcohol use, smoking, physical exercise and fitness, self-rated health, psychosomatic symptoms, social relationships and future educational plans. Results showed that poor success at school and the absence of or limited educational plans were associated with both externalizing and internalizing problems. Externalizing problems were associated with health-damaging behaviour and with bullying others. Internalizing problems were associated with poor perceived health and a low level of exercise, with mental symptoms, and with problems in social relationships, Thus, the pupils in both problem groups had a clustering of different risk factors. We conclude that the accumulation in adolescents of self-reported health-damaging behaviour, problems related to school, to future educational plans and to social relationships are already obvious in pupils with externalizing and/or internalizing problems detected by their teachers at the age of 15 years. The capacity of teachers to identify pupils at risk as early as possible should therefore be utilized. The development of a vicious circle might be prevented through early intervention at school, by offering pupils guidance, counselling and treatment.

AB A dynamic systems analysis was conducted to distinguish the parent-child interactions of "pure" externalizing children from children comorbid for externalizing and internalizing problems. Thirty-three parents and clinically referred children (8-12 years old) discussed a problem for 4 min and then tried to "wrap up" in response to a signal (a perturbation). The perturbation was intended to increase the pressure on the dyad, triggering a reorganization of their behavioral system. We hypothesized that the comorbid group would be distinguished from the externalizing-only group as a result of this reorganization, but not before. The sequential data were analyzed using a combination of case-sensitive (state space grids and chi-square analyses) and group-based, multivariate techniques (log-linear modeling). Results revealed that externalizing dyads engaged in a permissive pattern throughout the problem-solving session, whereas comorbid dyads shifted from a permissive pattern to a mutually hostile pattern after the perturbation. These findings punctuate the need for a dynamic systems approach to the study of relationship processes associated with the development of childhood psychopathology. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

AB This study describes the development and initial validation of the Peer-report Measure of Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior (PMIEB), a peer-nomination inventory that assesses internalizing (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints) and externalizing (aggression, delinquency, hyperactivity/attentional problems) psychopathology in school-aged children. Peer nomination inventories such as the PMIEB can provide an important perspective on children's behavioral and emotional functioning, for purposes ranging from descriptive psychopathology to outcome assessments of school-based treatment programs. However, although there currently are peer-nomination inventories for several specific domains of behavioral and emotional problems, the PMIEB represents the first broadband peer-nomination assessment instrument that can efficiently provide peer-report information across a wide range of child emotional and behavioral problems. Results of this study provide support for the reliability and validity of both broadband PMIEB subscales, as well as 5 of the 6 narrowband PMIEB subscales.

TI The Target Symptom Rating: A brief clinical measure of acute psychiatric

LA English
DT Article
ID PARENT
AB Describes the development and psychometric properties of the Target Symptom Rating (TSR), a brief multi-informant measure of commonly observed symptoms in child and adolescent clinical work. In a large sample of children and adolescents in inpatient and residential treatment, the 13 TSR items fell into 2 subscales: Emotional Problems and Behavior Problems, which were associated in expected ways with the Internalizing and Externalizing factors of the Achenbach scales and the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS). The measure was sensitive to change in brief and extended treatment, as rated by parents, patients, primary clinicians, and family therapists, and shows promise as a tool for outcome research in applied settings.

AB This project developed and examined the validity of a tailor-made life events checklist specific to the experiences of adolescents in stepfamilies (i.e., the Stepfamily Events Profile; STEP). The STEP was developed from information gathered in focus groups and interviews and includes positive and negative events that are meaningful to adolescents in stepfamilies. The STEP was given to 90 adolescents residing with their biological mother and stepfather. Negative events were significantly related to adolescent report of maladjustment, and positive events were significantly related to mother and adolescent report of internalizing problems, above and beyond the effects of several covariates. Also, the effects of negative and positive events were uniquely predictive of adolescent maladjustment. Events reflecting interactions within the adolescent's dyadic family relationships were most strongly predictive of adolescent maladjustment.

AB There has been little previous research about histories of child maltreatment and psychological symptoms in adolescent psychiatric patients. This study investigated whether type and characteristics of child physical and/or sexual abuse predicted individual differences in symptoms. Participants were 187 patients in day or residential treatment facilities. Abuse was assessed using structured interviews with the adolescent, the therapist, and the caseworker Participants completed a standardized, self-report measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Adolescents with histories of dual abuse (i.e., sexual and physical abuse) had elevated depression and anxiety compared with nonabused patients. Histories of any type of abuse were associated with elevated posttratanatic symptoms. Among physically abused patients, severity and duration of abuse predicted individual differences in depression and anxiety, whereas severity, and concomitant sexual abuse predicted elevated posttraumatic symptoms. Among sexually abused patients, the characteristics of sexual abuse did not predict individual differences in symptoms. Thus, child abuse, particularly dual abuse and severe physical abuse, predicted elevated internalizing symptoms, even in comparison with other adolescent psychiatric patients. The need for replication is discussed.

AB This article, the second in the Joumals series of 10-year updates on rating scales, summarizes scales assessing internalizing disorders. Method: The authors sampled articles on mood and anxiety disorders over the past 25 years, selected scales with multiple citations over many years, and reviewed their properties, Those with adequate psychometric properties, plus continued wide literature citations or a current special niche, are presented here, Results: Rating scales for depression were developed and/or examined in the 1980s. Despite generally strong properties, they lack clear construct validity. Most have parent-report forms that broaden their suitability with youths, Anxiety scales were developed bimodally. Those developed in the 1960s to 1970s were downward modifications of adult scales. They have been criticized for unclear constructs and unsuitability for youths. Newer scales developed in the 1990s have addressed these problems and have parent-report forms. However, their utility is still being determined. Conclusions: Rating scales can reliably, validly, and efficiently measure youths' internalizing psychopathology. They have great utility in research, treatment planning, and accountability in practice. However, the user must define the goals of measurement, consider the construct the scale measures, and use the scale within its defined capabilities. The use of more than one scale for a task is recommended.

AB To arrive at a better estimation of informant-specific correlates of suicidal behavior in young adolescents and to see how agreements and discrepancies between child and parent informants can contribute to the development of research and interventions. Method: The weighted sample from the Quebec Child Mental Health Survey conducted in 1992 included 825 adolescents, aged 12 to 14 years, and their parents. The adolescent and one parent were questioned by two different interviewers. The response rate was 80.3%. Three categories of independent variables were assessed: adolescent, family, and socioeconomic characteristics. Logistic regression models were based on the adolescent and parent informant reports. Results: Parents identified 6 of the 59 adolescents having reported suicidal ideation and 2 of the 36 adolescents having reported suicide attempts. Two informant-specific models of correlates of suicidal behavior were found. The adolescent model included internalizing and externalizing mental disorders, family stressful events, and parent-adolescent relationship difficulties, while the parent model included perceiving a need for help for the adolescent, parent's depressive disorders, and parent-adolescent relationship difficulties. Conclusion: The study shows the relevance of considering informant-specific correlates of suicidal behavior in the development of research and interventions targeting youths suicidal behavior.

TI Cognitive-behavioral/interpersonal group treatment for anxious
   adolescents
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL PHOBIA
AB Group treatments are potentially very helpful for adolescents struggling with internalizing disorders, given the importance of peer relationships at this developmental stage. Group treatment may reduce the sense of isolation experienced by anxious teenagers, who may assume that others do not share their distress. Unfortunately, groups are a poorly studied treatment modality in this population.
   This article describes our clinical experience with mixed-gender groups of young adolescents, aged 12 to 15 years, with a diagnosed DSM-IV anxiety disorder (separation anxiety, overanxious disorder, social phobia, or simple phobia) and treated with a 20-session, manual-based, cognitive-behavioral/ interpersonal group intervention. After a brief review of the relevant literature, developmental issues of early adolescence are examined and their contribution to reducing anxiety is illustrated by using examples from the group.
   Studies to date have found that cognitive-behavioral group treatment for adolescents with social phobia have shown promising results. Two separate studies found reduction of anxiety symptoms after treatment; one study showed maintenance of treatment effects over 1 year (Albano et al., 1995; Hayward et al., 2000). Barrett's (1998) evaluation of a cognitive-behavioral group family-based intervention for childhood anxiety disorders, including young adolescents (7-14 years), demonstrated treatment efficacy with 64.8% of children no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at 12-month follow-up in comparison with 25.2% of children on a waiting list.
   Studies suggest the effectiveness of group treatment for anxiety using brief cognitive-behavioral parent/child models and suggest considering developmental and interpersonal contexts in the treatment of anxiety. Indeed, peer and family relationships are important considerations in group work with teenagersand often become a focus of concern as teenagers move toward greater autonomy.
   Developmental and interpersonal contexts have been cited as important therapeutic factors in adolescent treatment (Grunebaum and Solomon, 1982; Holmbeck et al., 2000). Interpersonal approaches to adolescent group treatment have been discussed by Cramer-Azima (1991), Corder (1994), and Grunebaum and Solomon (1982). Many anxious teenagers report feeling "different" from their peers and avoid peer interactions, thus reducing opportunities for social development, putting undue pressure on the parent-child relationship, and increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression.
   In our setting, a cognitive-behavioral/interpersonal group treatment for young adolescents appeared to reduce anxiety symptoms and increase support-seeking coping behaviors on standardized self-report measures (Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale [Reynolds and Richmond, 1985]; Children's Coping Strategies Checklist [Sandler and Ayers, 1990]). The group addressed developmental issues of early adolescence as well as anxiety-related difficulties. Group treatments provide adolescents with social exposure and peer feedback and the opportunity to practice adaptive behaviors with peers. Cognitive-behavioral approaches for anxiety management and problem solving can be taught within an interpersonal group context, utilizing the here-and-now focus of the group to optimize opportunities for modeling, social reinforcement, identification, and skill-building (Satterfield, 1994). Factors that may have contributed to the reduction in adolescents' anxiety symptoms will now be illustrated.
   Anxiety management training is presented early in the group, allowing ongoing reinforcement of these cognitive skills throughout die duration of the group. Group interactions that may have contributed to anxiety reduction include cohesion-building activities, psychoeducation, exposure to peer models, opportunities for observational learning, and general group therapeutic factors such as instillation of hope, universality, and cohesion. The group may also function as a transitional social environment, providing a safe forum for social problem solving in a context that mirrors the adolescents' usual social milieu.

AB Background. Limited longitudinal research has been conducted on the impact of neglect on children's health and well-being. There is a need to consider the impact of specific subtypes of neglect on children's functioning. In addition, there is interest in examining the cumulative effect of experiencing >1 subtype of neglect.
   Objective. To examine the individual and cumulative relationships among physical, psychological, and environmental neglect and children's behavior and development at age 3, and the impact on changes in children's behavior and development between ages 3 and 5.
   Methods. One hundred thirty-six children and their primary caregivers participating in a prospective longitudinal study of children's development and maltreatment were assessed when the children were aged 3 and 5 years. The children were recruited from primary care clinics because of failure to thrive, risk for human immunodeficiency virus, or as a comparison group. Evaluations were conducted in laboratory and home settings using observations, maternal self-report, and standardized testing of the children. Scores on physical, psychological, and environmental neglect were combined into a Cumulative Neglect Index. Regression analyses were run to examine the association of specific subtypes of neglect and of cumulative neglect with children's functioning at age 3, controlling for group, sociodemographic risk, and maternal depression. The analyses were repeated examining the impact on child outcomes at age 5, controlling for the above 3 variables as well as the children's cognitive development and behavior at age 3.
   Results. Of the subtypes of neglect at age 3, only psychological neglect was significantly associated with increased internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 3; the Cumulative Neglect Index was associated with internalizing problems. None of the neglect subtypes or cumulative neglect were predictive of changes in children's behavior and development between ages 3 and 5. Cognitive development of the entire sample was impaired at age 5, averaging 0.85 standard deviations below the norm, and their average externalizing behavior score was significantly problematic with an average of 0.60 standard deviations above the norm.
   Conclusions. In the context of poverty where many preschool children have poor cognitive development and increased behavior problems, psychological neglect is significantly related to reported behavior problems. Children who experienced multiple types of neglect had increased internalizing problems. Neglect did not explain changes in children's behavior or development between ages 3 and 5. There is a need for pediatricians to identify and address child neglect, particularly psychological neglect, as early as possible. Pediatricians should also screen for maternal depression.

AB This validity study examined the extent to which the Draw-A-Person Screening Procedure for Emotional Disturbance (DAP:SPED; J. A. Naglieri, T. J. McNeish, & A. N. Bardos, 1991) was a significant predictor of behavioral functioning within a clinical sample of 68 latency-age children (6-12 years old) receiving counseling services at outpatient and residential treatment facilities. Study results showed that the total DAP:SPED (man, woman, and self scores summed) was a significant predictor in explaining variation in internalizing behavioral disturbance. Specifically, the DAP:SPED remained a moderate strength predictor of internalizing behavioral disturbance after controlling for the Child and Adolescent Adjustment Profile parent-report behavioral measure. Findings lend preliminary support to the DAP:SPED's validity in providing assessment information about child behavioral functioning. Continued validation investigation along these lines is recommended.

   CONTEXT
AB The aim of the current study was to assess the equivalence of Sudanese and North American versions of the Conners' Rating Scales. The reliability, internal consistency, factor score intercorrelation, levels of sex differences and prevalence of symptoms found with Sudanese Arabic adaptations of the parent and teacher scales were compared with previously reported data from North American studies. The scales were translated into Sudanese Arabic, backtranslated and piloted among teachers and parents. These scales were administered to parents and teachers from a stratified normative sample of 300 families with children between 6 and 10 years of age. Both versions of the questionnaire displayed high levels of reliability and satisfactory internal consistency. The associations of ratings by Sudanese adults differed from those typically seen in North American samples in a number of ways. There was little evidence of the existence of broadband distinctions between internalizing and externalizing problems, practically no sex differences, only nonspecific associations between parent and teacher ratings and, most strikingly, very low levels of behaviour problems reported. The results provide evidence of the potential utility of the Sudanese versions of the Conners' Rating Scales while raising important questions about cultural differences in the structure and associations of behaviour problems and the appropriateness of applying North American norms to other cultural groups. Future research should look to supplement studies using adaptations of scales developed in Western settings with more open-ended questions about problems of specific significance to Sudanese parents.

AB The development of culturally and linguistically appropriate measurement is necessary to enable accurate assessment of preschool children's interpersonal competence and behavioral difficulties. This need is most pressing for children from Hispanic backgrounds, who currently represent the fastest growing population of U.S. children. The present study investigated the psychometric properties of a Spanish and English version of the Penn Interactive Peer Play Scale (PIPPS; Fantuzzo et al., 1995) when employed with Spanish- and English-speaking teachers and students in an urban, Southeastern community. Psychometrically sound structures were obtained with the Spanish translation of the PIPPS in support of the three original dimensions named Play Interaction, Play Disruption, and Play Disconnection, which were derived from studies of African American preschool children in lower income, Northeastern communities. Concurrent validity was supported by significant correlations between the three Spanish PIPPS constructs and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Significant group differences in classroom peer play interactions were also detected for children's gender and ethnicity. The independent emergence of comparable Spanish and English PIPPS factor structures across two distinct regional samples provides initial support for use of this measure in research with Hispanic preschool children from low-income backgrounds. Implications for school psychologists engaging in outreach to preschool programs servicing diverse groups of children are discussed, including the generalizability of interactive peer play constructs for preschool children across racial, ethnic, linguistic, and geographic backgrounds.

AB This study investigated the risk factors associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among 169 gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents, ages 13 to 18, in northern New England, who were recruited through multiple methods. Data were gathered on individual, family, and community risk factors and youths' mental health and behavioral functioning. The youths did not differ on internalizing or externalizing problems by gender or by sexual orientation. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that risk factors unrelated to sexual orientation explained 18 percent and 19 percent of the variance in internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Risk factors related to sexual orientation explained an additional 4 percent of the variance in youths' internalizing problems and I percent in youths' externalizing problems. The results suggest that adolescent service providers should carefully assess gay, lesbian, and bisexual adolescents for concerns related and not directly related to their sexual orientation, as well as concerns specific to their identity. Even youths with positive feelings about their sexual orientation may be at risk.

AB Background: Sex differences in the medical and mental health care of adults are well established.
   Objective: To study the effect of child patient's sex on whether primary care clinicians (PCCs), including pediatricians, family physicians, and nurse practitioners, found or treated mental health problems in primary care settings.
   Design: The data were collected by clinicians and parents from 21065 individual child visits (50.3% girls) in 204 primary care practices.
   Methods: Each PCC enrolled a consecutive sample of approximately 55 children and adolescents aged 4 to 15 years. Parents filled out questionnaires, including the Pediatric Symptom Checklist, before seeing the clinician. Clinicians completed a survey after the visit about the psychosocial problems and recommended treatments, but they did not see the results of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist or any other data collected from the parents.
   Results: Boys were more likely to be been tor a mental health-related visit and by a clinician who identified them as "my patient," Boys with parent-reported symptom profiles that were similar to those of girls were more likely to be identified as problems or behavior or conduct problems and less likely to be identified a, having internalizing problems. Adjusting for parent-reported Symptom, PCCs were more likely to prescribe medications for boys. Child sex differences in referrals to mental health specialist and the provision of counseling to families were not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: There are substantial sex differences in the mental health care of children in the primary care system.

AB We undertook a systematic review of the literature on the long-term treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We used systematic strategies to identify randomized treatment studies in which treatment was administered for 12 weeks or more. We included 14 studies involving 1379 subjects. Because of the limited number of high-quality studies and the heterogeneity of outcome measures, we did not perform metaanalysis. We rated 5 studies as adequate for methodological quality. Five studies followed children for more than 26 weeks. Pharmacologic interventions were studied more frequently than nonpharmacologic ones, Six studies permitted evaluation of the effects of combined drug and behavioural intervention. Twenty-five different outcomes were measured using 26 different tests. Stimulant medication appears to reduce ADHD (7 studies), dysfunctional social behaviour (6 studies), and internalizing symptoms (2 studies). Available studies provide little evidence for improved academic performance with stimulants Q studies). Medications other than stimulants have not been studied extensively (3 studies). Only I study showed that combination therapy adds to the effects of medication. Rigorous treatment research among representative samples of ADHD individuals is needed.

AB This paper reviews the literature on the psychological adjustment and quality of life in children who survive brain tumors. A total of 31 studies were reviewed. Findings are discussed in terms of the rates of general psychological adjustment, internalizing behavior problems, externalizing behavior problems, social competence, correlates or predictors of adjustment, and quality of life among survivors. Although these survivors appear to be at risk for compromised social competence and long-term quality of life, reports in the literature on rates of psychological adjustment in this population vary widely. Limitations in the current literature are discussed including inadequate assessment techniques, lack of appropriate comparison groups, and small sample sizes. Directions for future research are offered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines parenting by temperament interactions in predicting child adjustment. Participants included 40 first and second graders, their mothers, and teachers. Child report of maternal psychological control and hostility was assessed Using the Child Puppet Interview. Mothers completed temperament scales from the Child Behavior Questionnaire, and teachers provided information on child adjustment. As expected, among children high in irritable distress, maternal psychological control was associated with internalizing problems and maternal hostility was associated with externalizing problems. Among children with poor effortful control, maternal hostility was associated with externalizing behavior. This study offers evidence that the effects of negative parenting are accentuated among children with temperamental vulnerabilities.

AB Objectives: (1) To evaluate the psychometric properties of the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ) in two studies of 4- to 8-year-old children and (2) to explore the empirical and theoretical implications of HBQ-based study findings. Method: Samples of children were recruited from (1) mental health clinics (n = 53) and community schools (n = 67) for a case-control study in three research sites and (2) a Wisconsin-based community cohort study of families and work, comprising children with high levels of internalizing and/or externalizing behavior problems and asymptomatic children (N = 122). Combinations of mothers, fathers, and teachers completed the HBQ at one or two time points in four geographically and culturally distinctive settings. Results: Assessment of HBQ reliability showed high test-retest stability and cross-informant agreement. The instrument discriminated strongly and significantly among symptom groups (i.e., high internalizing, high externalizing, high both, and low both) and showed moderate to large effect sizes for between-group differences, Substantial covariance was also found among the HBQ mental, physical, social, and academic problem subscales. Conclusions: The HBQ is a reliable and valid parent- and teacher-report instrument for assessing multiple dimensions of health and dysfunction in middle childhood and for identifying children on whom more intensive diagnostic procedures may be warranted. Confluences among the four health dimensions suggest phenomenological and perhaps etiological commonalities among traditionally partitioned childhood difficulties and suggest possible artificiality in the conventional distinction between pediatric and child psychiatric morbidities.

AB Background: The P3b component of the event-related potential (ERP) has frequently been reported to be reduced in children and adolescents at high risk for developing alcoholism relative to control children and adolescents without familial loading for alcohol dependence. P300 amplitude changes during development for all children. Previously it has been shown that high-risk offspring display a pattern in which the amplitude is lower at age 8 with a smaller rate of change during adolescence.
   Methods: Admixture analysis was applied to data obtained for those children and adolescents having five or more annual assessments of ERPs to determine if multiple P3b growth patterns exist. The P3b amplitude patterns obtained were related to risk status, concurrent presence of childhood psychopathology (internalizing or externalizing), and age of onset to develop a diagnosis.
   Results: A pattern characterized by lower P3b amplitude at study entry and a slower rate of change during child and adolescent development (pattern 3) was most often associated with high-risk status in boys and high-risk status in combination with the presence of a childhood diagnosis in girls. Pattern 3 was significantly, related to the overall presence of childhood psychopathology (internalizing or externalizing) and to the presence of an Axis I diagnosis at young adult follow-tip.
   Conclusions: The developmental pattern previously described for offspring at high risk for developing alcoholism because of their familial/genetic background was confirmed. Admixture analysis has refined this observation and suggests that among all children and adolescents tested, three developmental patterns can be identified, one of which is most often seen in association with male high-risk children and adolescents.

AB Objective: Family functioning and peer influences are theoretically linked to child psychopathology. This study quantified the functional status of families with fathers with substance dependence with or without comorbid antisocial personality disorder and evaluated the peer environments of preadolescent offspring. The authors examined associations between the child's psychopathology, paternal substance dependence/antisocial personality disorder status, and measures of family and peer environments.
   Method: Families with the presence or absence of paternal substance dependence were subdivided into those with and without paternal antisocial personality disorder, Grouped families were contrasted on measures of family functioning, the child's peer affiliation, and the child's problem behaviors. Regression analysis determined the influence of these factors on the child's psychopathology.
   Results: Families with paternal substance dependence functioned worse than normal comparison families, However, families with paternal substance dependence and antisocial personality disorder (N=34) did not differ markedly from those with substance dependence without antisocial personality disorder (N=84). The children of fathers with both substance dependence and antisocial personality disorder had greater affiliation with deviant peers than those with substance dependence without antisocial personality disorder and comparison families (N=104).
   Conclusions: Children of fathers with substance dependence and antisocial personality disorder demonstrated higher externalizing and internalizing psychopathology than those with substance dependence but not antisocial personality disorder and those without either condition. Paternal substance dependence/antisocial personality disorder status and the child's affiliation with deviant peers were most robustly associated with the child's psychopathology. Research is needed to develop interventions that effectively address parental risk and healthy peer relations.

AB This study evaluates the acceptability and efficacy of a combined cognitive-behavioral family education intervention for fourth through sixth graders reporting depressive symptoms. When compared to a wait list control group, children receiving the intervention were more likely to show improvements in depressive symptoms, reductions in negative automatic thoughts, and less internalizing coping. Children and their parents reported high satisfaction with the intervention. All of the parents rated the family education component as useful, and 60% indicated that despite its brevity more sessions were not needed. Results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of the intervention and suggest that brief family interventions are acceptable and feasible.

AB We tested associations in structural models among parent individual problems (severity of drug problems, medical problems, psychiatric symptoms), family problems, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Results were compared for cocaine versus opiate dependent parents, mothers versus fathers, boys versus girls, and older versus younger children. Cocaine and opiate dependent parents in treatment (N=211) were interviewed about their substance use, psychiatric symptoms, and interpersonal problems and completed a measure of family problems. Parents also rated children's internalizing and externalizing problems. In structural models controlling for the significant correlations between parent and family problems and between children's internalizing and externalizing problems. family problems but not individual parent problems predicted children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Models were similar across all groups compared with the exception of parent gender, with significant relations between parent and family problems for mothers but not for fathers. In addition. older girls were more deviant relative to their same-age and gender peers than the younger girls and boys. These results suggest that the personal problems of drug dependent mothers may influence children's problems indirectly by increasing family problems. For drug dependent fathers, family problems were an independent predictor of children's problems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This report details a follow-up study of the parent-child relationship and the child's psychosocial development after IVF. The pilot study compared 31 IVF families and 31 families with a naturally conceived child when the children were aged 2 years. Twenty-seven IVF and 23 control families participated again when the children were aged 8-9 years. Methods: Fathers and mothers completed questionnaires assessing parenting variables and the child's behaviour. For most children, behavioural ratings were also obtained from the child's teacher. Results: No significant differences were found between IVF and control parents' reports of child behaviour, parenting behaviour, parenting stress and most of the parenting goals. The parenting goal adjustment was significantly more important for IVF than for control fathers; religion was more important for IVF than for naturally conceiving mothers. Teacher ratings of the child's behaviour did not differ significantly between the IVF and control groups. All couples but one had talked to other persons about the IVF conception; 75% of the IVF parents had not yet informed their children. IVF parents who had informed their child observed more (internalizing and for fathers also overall) problem behaviours in their child, compared with IVF parents who had not yet disclosed the IVF conception. Conclusions: Parenting and the children's psychosocial development do not differ significantly between IVF families and control families.

AB The past decade has seen a notable increase in interest in and research concerning the physiological correlates of behavior problems in childhood. The present article reviews what this growing body of research has revealed. The main tenet is that disruptions in both sympathetic and adrenocortical regulation appear to be common among children with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The associations between such neuroenclocrine alterations and behavior are discussed and their implications for the fields of stress physiology, neuroendocrinology, and developmental psychopathology are outlined. It is proposed that substantial advances can be made by investigating patterns of physiological responses among multiple, concurrent systems rather than individual response systems.

AB Objective: To examine, in children, relationships between self-reported recurrent pain and emotion regulation indicated by rated internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors and adjustment.
   Method. Finnish 11-12-year-old schoolchildren (N = 414) completed a questionnaire measuring recurrent pain. Emotion regulation was assessed by a Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory, Teacher Rating Form. Relationships between recurrent pain and emotion regulation were examined in logistic regression analyses, after controlling for past injuries and chronic illnesses.
   Results: Independent of injuries and chronic illnesses, externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors related to recurrent pain, and more so together than separately. Gender differences were found; constructive behavior associated with recurrent pain only in girls.
   Conclusions. Low self-control of emotions, indicated by internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, was related to pain in both boys and girls; high self-control of emotions, indicated by constructive behavior, associated with pain only in girls.

AB Objective: To examine the impact of prenatal cocaine exposure and maternal behavioral health (recent drug use and psychological functioning) on child behavior at age 5 years.
   Method. In this longitudinal investigation, maternal report of child behavior was assessed using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in 140 cocaine-exposed and 181 noncocaine-exposed (61 alcohol, tobacco, and/or marijuana-exposed, and 120 nondrug-exposed) low-income, African American children. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate suspected causal relationships between indicators of maternal behavioral health at 5-year follow-up, according to self-report on a modified Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and CBCL scores.
   Results: Prenatal cocaine exposure was not related to child behavior at age 5. Recent maternal drug use and psychological functioning had relationships with CBCL Internalizing and Externalizing scores. However, when considered within a combined model, only maternal psychological functioning remained significant.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of maternal functioning in the behavioral outcome of children exposed prenatally to cocaine.

AB Objective: To examine differences in psychiatric comorbidity between African-American and Hispanic substance-abusing adolescents referred for outpatient therapy. Method: Participants were 167 substance-abusing adolescents and their family members who completed an intake assessment. As part of the intake assessment, adolescents and parents were administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Predictive Scales to screen for the presence of nine psychiatric diagnoses representing both externalizing and internalizing disorders. Results: Both African-American and Hispanic youths presented with high-above-threshold symptom rates of co-occurring disorders. However, both adolescents and parents reported that Hispanic youths (78.3% and 83.9%, respectively) demonstrated greater rates of externalizing symptoms than African-American youths (65.2% and 70.1%, respectively). African-American youths (40%) reported significantly more symptoms of agoraphobia than Hispanic youths (19.5%). Conclusions: The presence of high rates of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems provides evidence of the need for developing and implementing multifaceted interventions that address the complex emotional and behavioral needs of adolescent substance abusers, Among Hispanic youths in particular, treatments must address constellations of problem behaviors that appear to co-occur and likely represent the child's entrenchment in a deviant subculture.

ID POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; EVENT SCALE;

AB Objective: According to most studies, more than half of children exposed to war meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although we know that children are adversely affected by atrocities of war, we do not know which specific war events are associated with children's stress reactions. For example, it is unclear whether differences exist in response to violent versus nonviolent war-trauma experiences. This study examined the relationship of violent and nonviolent war experiences to children's trauma reactions and adjustment in a group of children from Bosnia. Method: During the 1994 siege in Sarajevo, 791 children aged 6 to 16 years participated in a study of trauma experience and response, in which assessment questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, PTSD Reaction Index, Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist, and War Experience Questionnaire) were completed by children and their teachers. Results: In this sample 41% had clinically significant PTSD symptoms. Children were adversely affected by exposure to both violent and nonviolent war-traumas. An additive effect of trauma exposure on trauma reactions was also found. However, many war experiences were not associated with children's adjustment and trauma reactions. Conclusions: Additive effects of violence and deprivations during war may overwhelm the coping skills of children and leave them vulnerable to externalizing and internalizing adjustment difficulties and symptoms of PTSD.

AB Objective: Three sites collaborated to evaluate the differential performance of the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV) in identifying DSM-IV psychopathology in young children. Method: A sample of 120 four- to eight-year-old nonreferred (community) (n = 67) and referred (clinical) (n = 53) children was examined. Mothers reported on their child's mental health symptoms using the HBQ (a dimensional measure with a clinical cutoff score) and the DISC-IV. Teachers independently reported on the child's symptoms and impairment in school using the teacher HBQ. Children self-reported on their symptoms using the companion Berkeley Puppet Interview. Results: On the basis of its derived clinical cutoff scores, the HBO identified significantly more children with clinical symptoms of DSM-IV internalizing psychopathology than the DISC-IV in both referred and nonreferred groups. There was a high level of agreement between the two measures in the identification of externalizing psychopathology. Children identified as having internalizing psychopathology by the HBO were also rated as highly symptomatic and impaired by teachers. Conclusion: The findings support the general validity of the parent HBO for the assessment of young child psychopathology and the hypothesis that it captures more internalizing psychopathology than the DISC-IV in this population.

AB Examined the outcome of a mentoring program aimed at minimizing conduct problems for young adolescent children at risk for delinquent behavior. The program was designed to give an alternative, prosocial role model for children with a history of rule-breaking and acting out behavior in school. Thirteen mentors attended weekly supervision sessions and were responsible for working with I at-risk child for 15 It per week. Both parents and teachers assessed behavior change at 4 intervals. Mentors and mentees also completed several evaluations of the program. The parent-report indicated significant decreases in both internalizing and externalizing behavior in the mentees during and at the end of the program. However, no significant changes were found for teacher-reported behavior. The mentors indicated that participating as a mentor enhanced their learning about children and further directed their educational goals. Implications of the effectiveness of mentoring are discussed.

AB Objective. To investigate whether living in a 3-generation household (grandmother-mother-child) is associated with fewer behavior problems and better cognitive development among preschool children of mothers who gave birth during adolescence and whether it protects children from the behavior and developmental problems associated with maltreatment and maternal depression.
   Design. Cohort study.
   Setting. Participants included low-income families recruited from 4 sites: East, Northwest, Midwest, and South, who are part of LONGSCAN, a longitudinal study of children's health, development, and maltreatment.
   Participants. One hundred ninety-four mothers who were adolescents (less than age 19) at delivery. Data were gathered when children were 4 to 5 years of age. Twenty-six percent of the children lived in 3-generation households, 39% had a history of maltreatment, and 32% of the mothers had depression scores in the clinical range.
   Main Outcome Measures. Child behavioral problems were measured with the Child Behavior Checklist, completed by the mother, and child developmental status was assessed with the Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test, administered by research assistants.
   Results. Multiple regression analyses revealed that children who had been reported for maltreatment and had mothers with depressive symptoms had more externalizing behavior problems, compared with children who experienced neither risk or only 1 risk. However, when residential status was considered, children with the greatest number of externalizing behavior problems were those who experienced both maltreatment and maternal depressive symptoms and lived in 3-generation households. Children who had been reported for maltreatment or had mothers with depressive symptoms were more likely to have internalizing problems, compared with children with neither risk. Residential status was not related to children's internalizing behavior problems or cognitive development.
   Conclusions. Living in a 3-generation household did not protect preschool children from the behavior problems associated with maltreatment and depression. In contrast, living in a 3-generation household was associated with more behavior problems among the highest risk group of children-those who had been maltreated and had mothers with symptoms of depression. Although 3-generation families may provide an important source of support and stability for adolescent mothers and their infants early in the parenting process, it may not be advisable to rely on 3-generation households as young mothers enter adulthood, particularly among those with a history of maltreatment or depression. Children with the fewest number of behavior problems were living with their mothers in their own household (often with the father), had not been maltreated, and had mothers with few symptoms of depression.

AB Rationale: Recent data suggest that children with new-onset seizures may be at increased risk for behaviour problems. Teachers are an excellent source of data about such problems. They do not have the potential bias that a parent worried about a new onset of seizures might have and, furthermore, they are accustomed to comparing performance of children and work in an environment in which the behavioural problems associated with epilepsy may be quite evident. We obtained teachers' reports of behaviour problems in children in the 2 months prior to their first recognized seizure. We also obtained similar data on children with new-onset, moderate severity asthma. In addition to comparing behavioural scores between children with seizures and children with asthma, we compared teachers' assessments of behaviour in children with no prior seizures to those of children with previously unrecognized seizures.
   Methods: We evaluated 192 children with new-onset seizures, including 129 children with no prior episodes and 63 children with recognized prior seizure-like episodes. The comparison group consisted of 78 children with new-onset, moderate severity asthma. Behaviour was assessed by the teacher's report form (TRF) of the child behaviour checklist (CBCL) or the caregiver-teacher report form for ages 2-5 (C-TRF). Mean scores were compared by two-sample t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
   Results: The children with new-onset seizures had more thought problems than children with asthma. In comparison to children with no prior seizures, the children with prior unrecognized seizures had higher scores in total behaviour problems, internalizing problems, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, thought problems, and attention problems.
   Conclusions: In this sample, children with prior unrecognized seizures were already at increased risk of teacher-rated behaviour problems before starting medication and before any possible stigma effects related to seizures. This sequence suggests underlying neurological problems causing both behavioural problems and seizures. (C) 2002 BEA Trading Ltd. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Associations between a preference for violent electronic games and adolescents' self-perceptions of problem behaviors and emotions were examined. It was predicted that a preference for violent games would be associated with negative externalizing characteristics, in particular aggressive emotions and behaviors, on the Youth Self-Report (YSR), a standardized self-report measure of adolescent problem behaviors. Thirty-two 11- through 15-year-olds (17 girls) listed and categorized favorite electronic games into one of six predetermined categories and completed the YSR. MANOVA revealed significant relationships between a preference for violent games and the Thought Problems subscale (P < .01) and YSR Total Score (P < .05), with trends noted for the Internalizing (P < .06) and Anxious-Depressed (P < .08) subscales. Expected relationships with externalizing behaviors, including aggression, were not found. However, across all YSR subscales, children with higher preference for violent games had more clinically significant elevations than those with low preference for violent games. On the Total Problems subscale, of the eight children receiving scores in the clinically significant range, six were in the High preference group (three boys and three girls). The failure to rind the expected relationships between a preference for violent games and aggressive, externalizing behaviors is puzzling. It is possible that individuals with a preference for violent games may have high exposure to all forms of media violence. Their perceptions of their own behavior, in comparison, may not seem sufficiently aggressive to justify endorsement of problems in this area. Or, playing violent electronic games may promote a disconnection between the emotions normally associated with violence and violent acts. These explanations are consistent with a desensitization model where exposure to media violence decreases sensitivity to aggression. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This report examines the concurrent validity of different informant and self-report assessment instruments of psychopathology, both general and specific for anxiety and/or depression, in referred mentally retarded adolescents with a depressive and anxiety disorders, according to DSM IV criteria, A consecutive, unselected sample of 50 mildly and moderate mentally retarded adolescents (29 males and 21 females, aged 11.8 to 18 years, mean age 15.1) were assessed using standardized assessment techniques: Psychopathology Instrument for Mentally Retarded Adults (PIMRA) (informant version) (total score, affective and anxiety subscales), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (informant version) (total score, internalizing and externalizing scores, anxiety-depression scale), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Patterns of correlation among measures were calculated. PIMRA and CBCL total scores were closely intercorrelated. Internalizing and externalizing scores of CBCL were not intercorrelated, but they both correlated with CBCL and PIMRA total scores. Anxiety measures were positively correlated; they correlated with PIMRA and CBCL total scores, as well as with the internalizing score of CBCL. Depression measures were not correlated; their correlation with more general measures of psychopathology was weak. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB This study examined the relation of negative emotionality in infancy to child social and cognitive developmental outcomes among low birth weight (LBW) preterm infants participating in the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), a comprehensive compensatory education intervention beginning in infancy and lasting through a e 3 years. In this analysis, intervention effects at age 36 months on maternal report of child behavior as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist externalizing and internalizing scales and on intelligence as measured by the Stanford-Binet scale were largest among children characterized by higher levels of negative emotionality in infancy. Findings indicate that for LBW preterm infants characterized by negative emotionality at age 12 months the intervention was associated with a twofold decrease in the occurrence of clinically meaningful levels of behavior problems at age 3 years and a fourfold decrease in the occurrence of a high-risk profile in which both internalizing and externalizing scores are in the clinically meaningful range. The intervention was also associated with a Fivefold decrease in the occurrence of IQ : 75 at age 3 years among children with higher levels of negative emotionality and heavier LBW (2001-2500 g). However, specific aspects of temperamental difficulty such as fearfulness and anger were related to internalizing and externalizing, respectively, in both the intervention and control groups. Findings are consistent with research linking negative emotionality in infancy with social and cognitive developmental outcomes in early childhood among normal birth weight infants. Results suggest the need for further attention to child temperament in early intervention research.

AB Research suggests that disruptions in early caretaking can have long-term effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which mediates the stress response. Children of depressed mothers are at increased risk for developing internalizing problems in part because of disruptions in their caretaking environment. The present study investigated whether children of depressed mothers exhibit elevated salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol samples were collected from 45 7- to 8-year-old children of mothers with a history of depression and 29 children of nondepressed mothers. Samples were collected soon after arrival to the laboratory and after a mild laboratory stressor and at home after wakeup and before bedtime. Children who had elevated levels of internalizing symptoms and whose mothers had a history of depression showed elevated laboratory baseline cortisol levels. Children who were reported to have clinically significant internalizing symptoms were also more likely to show an elevated stress response to a mild laboratory stressor. When the longitudinal history of maternal depression was examined, maternal depression during the child's first 2 years of life was the best predictor of elevations in baseline cortisol at age 7 years. This study provides evidence that internalizing symptoms exist in conjunction with a more reactive hormonal stress system in children of depressed mothers. The results also provide preliminary evidence that exposure to maternal depression in the first 2 years of life may be related to children's cortisol levels later in life.

AB This study of 422 two-caregiver African American families, each with a 10-11-year-old focal child (54% girls), evaluated the applicability of the family stress model of economic hardship for understanding economic influences on child development in this population. The findings generally replicated earlier research with European American families. The results showed that economic hardship positively relates to economic pressure in families. Economic pressure was related to the emotional distress of caregivers, which in turn was associated with problems in the caregiver relationship. These problems were related to disrupted parenting practices, which predicted lower positive child adjustment and higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The results provide significant support for the family stress model of economic hardship and its generalizability to diverse populations.

AB Investigated how maternal depression influenced the relation between mothers' perceptions of the quality of their partner interactions and behavior problems among their preschool children. Participants included 194 low-income families from 4 sites. Approximately three fourths of the mothers (72%, n = 139) identified a male partner and comprised the analysis sample. Mothers were adolescents (less than or equal toage 19) at delivery, and data were gathered when children were 4 to 5 years of age. In this high-risk sample, 42.4% of the children had been maltreated, 36% had externalizing scores in the clinical range, and 10.8% had internalizing scores in the clinical range. Multiple regression analyses revealed (a) maternal perceptions of negative partner interactions were associated with more internalizing behavior problems among the children, adjusting for the effects of maltreatment; (b) maternal depression mediated the relation between the maternal perceptions of the quality of partner interactions and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems: and (c) maternal perceptions of positive partner interactions did not protect children from internalizing or externalizing behavior problems associated with maltreatment. Programs for adolescent mothers should provide screening and treatment for depressive symptoms and help partners negotiate caregiving roles and mutually satisfying relationships.

AB Examined the relations between the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SRAI-C) and the Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised (SASC-R) in community (n = 178) and clinic (n = 57) samples. A large proportion of children exceeded the recommended SPAI-C and SASC-R cutoffs for suggesting clinically significant levels of social phobia and social anxiety in the community (37% SPAI-C and 20% SASC-R) and clinic (58% SPAI-C and 42% SASC-R) samples. A large proportion of children scoring in the clinical range on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) exceeded the SASC-R and SPAI-C cutoff scores; however there was notable variability with respect to sample, age group (less than or equal to10 years and greater than or equal to11 years), sex, and measure (SPAI-C vs. SASC-R, and CBCL Internalizing vs. Social Competence scale). Using the recommended cutoffs, discriminant function analyses found the classification correspondence between the SPAI-C and SASC-R was significant, with some variability found in the 2 samples, age groups, and sexes (ranging from 82% to 91% classification correspondence). These initial findings highlight a need to consider sample, age, and sex in further examination of the utility and validity of these measures and their recommended cutoffs. Implications for future work examining the linkages between social anxiety and social phobia, as well as for the assessment of children's social anxiety and social fears, are discussed.

AB Economic hardship is a stressor that affects large numbers of children and their families. This study estimated a model that included pathways linking economic conditions to the internalizing and externalizing symptoms of a multiethnic sample of urban adolescents. Similar to other prominent models, this model included parental distress and parenting as key constructs, but the expanded ecological model also included stressors outside the family and adolescents' associations with deviant peers as possible explanatory factors. Data from 300 adolescents and their parents were consistent with a model that showed linkages between economic conditions, parental depressive symptoms, supportive parenting, and internalizing symptoms. Stressors outside the family were associated with deviant peer affiliations which, in turn, predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The implications of these findings for understanding economic conditions' influence on adolescents' mental health are discussed. (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.

AB This study, tests a model of the effects on child behavioral outcome of the child's exposure to partner violence and child abuse, in children who have experienced the two forms of victimization either separately or together. Recognizing that family contextual factors play an important role in influencing child outcome, an ecological model is proposed that designates family stress as the principal exogenous factor, with effects on child outcome mediated through caretaker distress, partner violence, and child abuse. The sample consists of 100 confirmed cases of physically abused New York City schoolchildren, ages 9 to 12 years, and their families, and 100 nonmaltreated classmates, matched for gender, age, and, as closely as possible, for race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, and their families. Child behavioral outcome is assessed by classmates for antisocial, prosocial, and withdrawn behavior and by parents and teachers for externalizing and internalizing problem behavior. Results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that partner violence and caretaker distress, both associated with family stress, increase the risk for child abuse and thereby raise the child's risk for poor outcome. Implications of differences among raters for the model's applicability, and implications of the results for clinical intervention, are discussed.

AB Objective: To test hypotheses that social support moderates the effects of microstressors on the psychosocial adjustment of children with pediatric rheumatic diseases (PRDs) and that among multiple sources of support, classmate and parent support are significant predictors of adjustment, after controlling for demographic and disease severity variables.
   Methods: Children with PRDs (N = 160 children; 8-17 years) were recruited from three pediatric rheumatology centers and completed measures of daily hassles, social support, depressive symptoms, and state and trait anxiety; their parents completed measures of internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
   Results: Fewer daily hassles and higher social support predicted fewer adjustment problems. Among the sources of support, classmate and parent support were significant predictors. Tests for moderation were significant only for a Hassles X Classmate Support interaction in the prediction of depression. A plot of the interaction between hassles and classmate support showed that children with high classmate support had lower levels of depression than children with low classmate support under high or low levels of daily hassles. Furthermore, children with high classmate support had lower levels of depression under conditions of low versus high daily hassles.
   Discussion: Results are consistent with a main effect rather than buffering model for social support.
   Conclusions: Interventions should focus on management of daily hassles and increasing social support for children with PRDs.

AB Background: Relationships among adopted children's appraisals of birthparent loss, their coping strategies for managing such loss, and child and parent reports of child adjustment were investigated within the context of a stress and coping model of adoption adjustment. Methods: Eighty-two 8-12 year-old adopted children and one of their parents participated. Children completed questionnaires assessing their negative affect about birthparent loss, their curiosity about birthparents, their use of coping strategies to manage birthparent-related distress, and their levels of depression, anxiety, and global self-worth. Parents reported on children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and social competence. Results: Children who reported higher levels of negative affect about birthparent loss also reported higher levels of depression and lower self-worth. Curiosity about birthparents predicted parent-rated externalizing behavior. Behavioral avoidant coping was associated with greater self-reported anxiety and parent-rated externalizing behavior, whereas problem solving coping was associated with increased parent-rated social competence. Conclusions: The findings, though limited by issues of measurement and sampling, add to the knowledge base regarding adopted children's appraisal and coping behaviors, and provide partial support for a stress and coping model of adopted children's adjustment.

AB Background: An atypical EEG pattern of frontal brain activation has been found in infants and adults with emotional disorders. Eighty-two 8-year-old children and 56 1 I-year-old children were examined with regard to the following questions: 1. Do children who are diagnosed with anxiety disorder exhibit an atypical pattern of frontal brain activation? 2. Can this pattern be demonstrated in children of different ages? and 3. Are there gender differences in these patterns similar to those that have been demonstrated in adults? Baseline EEG activity was subjected to power spectral analysis. Results: In 8- and 11-year-old anxious girls, the well-known pattern of greater right than left frontal activation emerged that has been found previously in internalizing preschoolers. Healthy girls showed no frontal asymmetry at 8 years of age, and a greater left than right frontal brain activation at 11 years. In contrast, healthy boys demonstrated a significantly greater right than left frontal activation, whereas anxious boys displayed no frontal asymmetry at the age of 8, and a greater left than right frontal activation at the age of 11. Conclusions: Children suffering from anxiety disorders exhibited a significantly different pattern of frontal brain activation than healthy children without any lifetime diagnosis of mental disorder. Distinct gender differences in frontal activation were found in anxious as well as in healthy children. This could be demonstrated in two samples of different ages.

AB Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is widely used in both clinical and research settings. little is known about agreement between clinician and standardized research diagnoses. Diagnoses generated by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-P-2.3) were compared with clinician-generated diagnoses for 245 referred youths. Agreement was poor for all individual disorders and broader diagnostic clusters. Agreement was higher for externalizing categories than for internalizing, but no association was found between agreement and child, family, or clinician characteristics. Clinicians were more likely than the DISC to assign 1 diagnosis and less likely to assign 0 diagnoses. suggesting that clinic policies may play a role. Implications for the use of the DSM across different setting,, are discussed.

AB Three models of risk were examined for 277 African American children from single-mother-headed homes: cumulative, additive, and indirect models. Risk factors were mother-reported community risks, inadequate income, maternal depressive symptoms, and inadequate parenting. Child-reported internalizing and externalizing difficulties served as dependent measures of adjustment. Whereas the cumulative risk model identified a subset of children within this group as at-risk for adjustment difficulties, only more proximal family variables (maternal depressive symptoms and inadequate parenting) accounted for unique variance in child outcomes (additive risk model). However, the more distal risk factors community risk and inadequate income-were linked to both internalizing and externalizing difficulties through the proximal family variables (indirect effects model).

AB Research examining teachers' judgments of children's behavior has typically used archival data, staged videos, or written vignettes describing children's behavior. The main advantage of using staged videos and written vignettes has been that those methodologies have led to well-controlled studies. The main disadvantage is that little is known about teachers' perceptions of the problems of children in their own classrooms. In the current study, Ill first-, second-, and third-grade teachers described children in their classrooms whose behavior concerned them. Teachers identified significantly more children with externalizing problems than internalizing problems and significantly more boys than girls as having problems that concerned them. However, when teachers identified children as having internalizing problems, they were just as likely to judge them as needing referral as children with externalizing problems. Similarly, when teachers judged children to have problems that concerned them, they were just as likely to judge girls as needing referral as boys.

AB Background: This paper addresses bulimia symptoms in a large community sample of twins aged 8 to 17 years. We aim to identify environmental correlates of bulimia symptoms and relationships with other psychiatric disorder symptoms. The twin design allows examination of the structure of genetic and environmental effects.
   Methods: DSM-IIIR bulimia symptoms and consequential impairment were measured by interview in the first wave of the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development. Comorbidity with other psychiatric symptoms and environmental correlates were examined and the relative contributions of genes and environment were assessed using structural equation modeling.
   Results: An item-response theory model indicated that the range of bulimic symptoms represented a single underlying trait. Bulimia symptoms were more common in post-menarche girls and positively associated with body-mass index. Subdiagnostic symptomatology was associated with impairment in psychosocial functioning. Bulimia symptoms were strongly associated with other psychiatric disorders symptoms including anxiety and depression. Genetic model fitting identified strong additive genetic effects on the symptom score. Accounting for a potential violation of the equal environment assumption for identical and fraternal twins slightly reduced estimated genetic variance.
   Conclusions: The pattern of comorbidity suggests overlap between bulimia symptoms and those of internalizing disorders. Substantial genetic variance (44%) was evident in the most conservative model. Biol Psychiatry 2002;51: 172-182 (C) 2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Tanzania. were compared with 41 matched non-orphans front the same neighbourhoods. The subjects were given an arithmetic test and a semi-structured questionnaire concerning any internalizing problems, their attendance at school and their experiences of punishment, reward and hunger. The scale of internalizing problems comprised 21 items adapted from the Rand Mental Health and Beck Depression Inventories concerning mood. pessimism, somatic symptoms. sense of failure, anxiety. positive affect and emotional ties. Most orphans lived with aunts and uncles. Compared with non-orphans. they were significantly less likely to be in school but those who did attend school had similar arithmetic scores. Significantly more orphans went to bed hungry. Orphans had markedly increased internalizing problems compared with non-orphans (p < 0.0001) and 34% reported they had contemplated suicide in the past Year. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the independent predictors of internalizing problem scores were sex (females higher than males), going to bed hungry. no reward for good behaviour, not currently attending school, as well as being an orphan.
   Conclusion: The orphan,, not only had unmet basic needs, but also had markedly increased internalizing problems, thus their long-term mental health would be in jeopardy. There is an urgent need to expand and improve Current intervention programmes not only to meet the basic needs but also to include psychosocial support. counselling services for the orphans. and training for their carers and teachers.

AB Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the U.S. population. Surveys have estimated that the lifetime prevalence rate for cannabis dependence is approximately 4%. Though the presence of a psychiatric disorder increases the likelihood of developing substance dependence, the field lacks data regarding the association between mental disorders and cannabis dependence. The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among individuals with cannabis dependence. The National Comorbidity Survey was used to obtain these data. We found that 90% of respondents with cannabis dependence had a lifetime mental disorder, compared to 55% without cannabis dependence. Alcohol dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and conduct disorder had the strongest associations with cannabis dependence, followed by anxiety and mood disorders. A large proportion of respondents with internalizing disorders developed mood or anxiety disorders prior to onset of their first cannabis dependence symptom. Data regarding the prevalence of comorbid mental disorders underscore the importance of thorough and systematic evaluation of patients seeking treatment for cannabis dependence. The failure to identify comorbidity may lead to inadequate treatment, and a poorer prognosis.

AB This study investigated families of children with internalized verb sus externalized symptoms according to linear and curvilinear conceptions of the circumplex model. Two family characteristics were examined: cohesion and adaptability. It was hypothesized that families of children with externalized symptoms would be more likely to be classified as chaotic and disengaged, whereas families of children with internalized symptoms would be more likely to be classified as rigid and enmeshed. Participants included 118 nuclear, two-parent families with a "target child" age 10-17. The research sample comprised 3 groups: 35 families with an externalizing child, 46 families with an internalizing child, and 37 families with nonsymptomatic children. The results supported the hypotheses in part, in that only the dimension of family cohesion was associated to children's symptoms. The data revealed that, on the curvilinear model, the families of externalizing children were located most frequently in the disengaged domain. On the linear model, this group obtained the lowest scores of family cohesion. Families of children with internalized problems were found with almost equal frequency in enmeshed and disengaged areas of the curvilinear model. On the linear model, this group was located midway between families with externalizing children and families with nonsymptomatic children, and did not differ significantly from either of these groups.

AB This study aimed to expand research on coparenting to include families of school-age children by investigating the psychometric properties of an observational coparenting measure, and by examining relations between coparenting and child adjustment in this population. Participants included 67 couples and a first-born, 7- to 11-year-old child. Family interactions were coded with the Coparenting and Family Rating System (CFRS; McHale, Kuersten-Hogan, & Lauretti, 2000). For boys, Hostility-Competitiveness (i.e., coparental competition, coparental verbal sparring, and child-centredness) correlated with anxiety on the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (Reynolds & Richmond, 1978) and with mother-reported Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991a). For girls, Parenting Discrepancy (i.e., mother-father differences in parent-child warmth and investment) correlated with mother-reported CBCL Internalizing. Results demonstrate the utility of the CFRS with school-age children and suggest that coparenting-adjustment linkages may differ by child gender.

AB This study, based on a sample of 172 children, examined the relation between average afternoon salivary cortisol levels measured at home at age 4.5 years and socioemotional adjustment a year and a half later, as reported by mothers, fathers, and teachers. Cortisol levels were hypothesized to be positively associated with withdrawal-type behaviors (e.g., internalizing, social wariness) and inversely related to approach-type behaviors, both negative and positive (e.g., externalizing, school engagement). Higher cortisol levels at age 4.5 predicted more internalizing behavior and social wariness as reported by teachers and mothers, although child gender moderated the relation between cortisol and mother report measures. An inverse relation was found between boys' cortisol levels and father report of externalizing behavior. A marginal inverse relation was found between child cortisol levels and teacher report of school engagement. Behavior assessed concurrently with cortisol collection did not account for. the prospective relations observed, suggesting that cortisol adds uniquely to an understanding of behavioral development.

SO CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDREN; OUTCOMES
AB With a growing number of children living in kinship foster care, it is important to understand how youths are faring in kinship care compared to youths in non-kinship care. In the present study, we first evaluate teacher ratings of problem behaviors exhibited in school by youths in kinship and non-kinship foster care. We then examine whether correspondences between parent and teacher ratings of problem behaviors across home and school settings differ by kinship status. The youths in the study represent an ethnically diverse sample (N = 185), with significantly more children of color in kinship placements. Across the majority of problem behavior scales on the Teacher's Report Form (TRF: Achenbach, 1991), teacher perceptions of youth behavior did not, differ significantly according to kinship or non-kinship care, placement. Furthermore, the youths in this study had elevated scores relative to general population norms on only a few TRF problem behavior scales. A,sub-sample (N = 122) with foster parent assessments on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL: Achenbach, 1991) permitted comparison of perceptions of youth behavior across the home and school settings for youths in kinship and non-kinship placements. Correlations between the TRIF and CBCL composite scale scores (internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors) indicated slightly higher agreement between teacher and foster parent ratings for kinship placements. The non-kinship foster parents reported higher levels of problem behavior at home relative to school. The paper interprets these results and suggests implications for practice and future research directions.

AB Factors predicting long-term rejection in school class were studied among 217 pupils, who were 13 years of age at baseline and 16 years at follow-up. Rejection was determined by means of sociometric measurement undertaken by pupils. At baseline teachers assessed pupils' problem behaviour and social skills by the Social Skills Rating scales, self-images were measured by the Offer Self-Image Questionnaire and academic achievement was also assessed. Factor, (at baseline) predicting long-term rejection included male sex (odds rations [OR] 7.2 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 - 41.5), poor performance in physical education (OR 6.4 95% CI 1.8 - 20.0), negative sexual self-image (OR 2.3 95% CI 15 - 3.6) and internalizing problems (OR 4.3 95% CI 2.0 - 9.2). Knowledge of risk factors for rejection in school can be valuable for planning of preventive interventions.

AB In this investigation, we examined the influence of distal and proximal risk factors (family economic hardship, perceived neighborhood threats, intensity of negative life events, maternal alcohol abuse, maternal depression, and poor quality of the home environment) on child competence (externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors and cognitive performance) at ages 5 and 6. These complex interrelationships were examined using four explanatory statistical models: (a) independent-additive, (b) cumulative/exponential, (c) mediating, and (4) interactive. The sample included 217 African American mothers and their children recruited from primary care clinics serving low-income, urban families. Mothers and children participated in annual evaluations that included standardized developmental assessments, home observations, and questionnaires on demographics, children's behavior, and maternal and family functioning. Children demonstrated more behavior problems and scored lower on measures of cognitive performance than national norms at ages 5 and 6. Results supported the four statistical models (although to different degrees) on how and under what conditions distal and proximal risk factors were linked to child competence. Results indicated that distal and proximal risk factors predict cross-sectional models of competence but show limited long-term effect, partly due to the stability and maintenance of behaviors over time. Interventions to prevent behavioral and developmental problems among young children should begin early and target both distal and proximal risk factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Concurrent and longitudinal associations between peer crowd affiliation and internalized distress were examined in a sample of 246 youth (148 girls, 98 boys). Children completed measures of depression, social anxiety, loneliness, and self-esteem when they were in grades 4 to 6 (Time 1), and again 6 years later during adolescence (grades 10-12; Time 2). At Time 2, adolescents also reported their self-concept and their identification with reputation-based peer crowds, including Populars, Jocks, Brains, Burnouts, Non-Conformists, and None/Average crowds. Results indicated that adolescents' report of peer crowd affiliation was concurrently associated with self-concept and levels of internalizing distress, Follow-back analyses of internalizing trajectories revealed that Populars/Jocks had experienced significant declines in internalizing distress across development, whereas Brains exhibited some increases in internalizing distress between childhood and adolescence.

AB This study provides empirical verification that variations in patterns of coping can explain current and future functioning of youth. The study evaluated the methods and styles of coping of inner-city youth and their relation to age, gender, ethnicity, stress levels, and,internalizing and externalizing symptom levels. Three hundred seventy-two-12- to 16-year-old adolescents from inner-city schools (67.0% African American; 24.4% Hispanic; 53.41% males) participated. One hundred forty-nine were also included in a follow-up evaluation of the prospective relation of coping to functioning. A seven-factor model of coping methods was identified and found to be applicable across age groups, genders, and ethnic groups. The model was robust over time. Coping methods were categorized through cluster analysis into five styles. Styles were found to relate somewhat to demographic characteristics and stress levels. Controlling for demographic characteristics and stress levels, coping style related concurrently and prospectively to internalizing and externalizing symptom levels. Except in one instance, age, ethnicity, and gender did not interact with coping in predicting symptoms. Implications for further coping research and risk and intervention design are discussed.

AB Background
   It was suggested that the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) was associated with ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder). The major polymorphism of the DAT1 involves a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) situated in the 3' untranslated region of the gene. The 10 repeat allele (480 bp) was reported to be high risk allele for ADHD. It was suggested that the response to drug and clinical characteristics differed according to the type of DAT1 polymorphism in ADHD. The 10 repeat allele was related to the symptoms of internalizing disorders in both clinically referred children and controls. The 9 repeat allele (440bp) was related to the externalizing behavior problems in a community sample of children. On the bases of these findings, it is expected that children with ADHD show different emotional and behavioral problems according to the DAT1 polymorphism.
   Method
   Thirty-seven unrelated ADHD patients were recruited. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood, and analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction(PCR) to determine the genotype. Parents filled in the Korean-Child Behavior Checklist (K-CBCL) to evaluate the emotional and behavioral problems of the children. The K-CBCL subscale scores were compared to the 10/10 genotype and the 10/9 genotype using a Mann Whitney U test. The correlation between the attention problems score and other subscale scores were computed using a Spearman's correlation test in each group.
   Result
   The thought problems score was higher in the 10/9 genotype than in the 10/10 genotype(Z=0.024, p<0.05). In the 10/10 genotype, the attention problems score negatively correlated with the social competence and positively correlated with the withdrawn, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior but not in the 10/9 genotype.
   Conclusion
   Patients with the 10/10 genotype and patients with the 10/9 genotype appear to have different emotional and behavioral problems. Patients with the 10/9 genotype have a risk of thought problems, which may require intervention. In the 10/10 genotype, the more severe the attention problem is, the more clinical attention is needed to treat the comorbid emotional and behavioral problems. However, the small sample size of this study is a limitation to generalizing these results. A further study with a larger sample is currently underway.

ID AGE-CHILDREN; DEATH; ADOLESCENTS; CANCER; IMPACT
AB Forty parentally bereaved youngsters (age 6-16; 22 girls, 18 boys) and their surviving parent were interviewed and administered standardized measures (BSI, CBCL, CDI, RCMAS, WISC) to assess their emotional adjustment approximately 18 months after their parent's death. The sample was predominantly middle class Caucasian, with children relatively free of prior confounding non-bereavement related major stresses. There were marked discrepancies between parent CBCL reports of their children's adjustment and the children's self-report, while teacher reports (TRF) were somewhat more closely correlated with parent reports. On average, these bereaved children appeared to be faring well, though with heightened internalizing problems: adolescent boys seemed to be having the most difficulty. Full sample means concealed important differences revealed in gender and age group analyses. Strikingly, the full sample of children scored below national norms for non-bereaved children on depression and anxiety measures. Parent adjustment was the best predictor of child adjustment.

LA English
DT Article
AB Objective. This study considered the role of mothers' depressive symptoms and hostile-controlling behavior in young children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Pathways of influence between mothers' depressive symptoms and hostile-controlling behavior and children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems also were examined. Design. Data were collected at child ages 4 and 6 years from a nonclinical, community sample of 51 mothers and their children. At both assessments, mothers' behavior was observed during a structured mother - child play activity, and mothers completed questionnaires to assess their depressive symptoms and children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Results. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed different patterns of findings across the 2 assessments as well as different patterns of findings for children's externalizing versus internalizing behaviors. At age 4, mothers' depressive symptoms and hostile-controlling behavior predicted children's externalizing behaviors; at age 6, only mothers' hostile-controlling behavior predicted children's externalizing behaviors. Regarding children's internalizing behaviors, mothers' depressive symptoms were significant predictors at child age 4; however, by age 6, mothers' depressive symptoms were no longer significant predictors. When longitudinal modeling was applied to the data, some support for both maternal and child effects was found. Conclusions. Findings highlight the importance of considering mothers' depressive symptoms and hostile-controlling behavior in predicting children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and suggest different etiological pathways for externalizing versus internalizing expressions of dysfunction.

ID ADOLESCENTS; INPATIENT
AB Objective: The study investigated the settings in which children and adolescents were treated to determine whether clinicians assigned individuals who had greater needs to more intensive treatment. Methods: Subjects were 603 children four to 16 years of age who visited a mental health treatment facility in Western Australia, where, as is the case throughout Australia, universal publicly funded health care is provided. DSM-IV criteria were used to make diagnoses, and clinicians assessed each child's level of impairment. The clinicians assigned the children to inpatient treatment, day treatment, or outpatient treatment, or they saw the child only for a psychiatric consultation. Measures included parents' and children's reports of children's psychopathology and parents' reports of family functioning, family, life events, and parental mental health symptoms and treatment. Results: Clinicians' ratings of impairment were highest for children assigned to the inpatient and day treatment settings. Parents' ratings of total psychopathology and of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were highest for children in the inpatient and day, treatment settings. Parents' reports also indicated that family dysfunction and parental alcohol problems were most severe in the inpatient group. No differences in parents' mental health problems were found across treatment settings. Conclusions: Children with more severe psychopathology and more severe family dysfunction and parental problems were more likely to be provided treatment in the most costly and time-intensive treatment settings. The results provide empirical evidence for what many clinicians consider best clinical practice-to assign children and families to treatment settings appropriate to their level of impairment.

AB In this paper we intend to provide an overview on the current state of developmental epidemiology of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence. Median rate of prevalence estimates was 18 % with 3/4 of prevalence estimates ranging between 15 % and 22 %. Mental disorders in children and adolescents are as frequent as those in adults. the most frequent disorders were anxiety disorders with a mean prevalence rate of 10.4 %, followed by conduct disorders with a mean prevalence rate of 7.5 %. The overall persistence of mental disorders was as high as 50 %, with conduct disorders showing the most unfavourable courses. The most frequent comorbid conditions of hyperkinetic disorders are conduct disorders, and the most frequent comorbid conditions of depressive disorders are anxiety disorders. Until age 13, mental disorders are more prevalent in boys, prevalences become similar for both sexes in adolescence. Boys showed higher rates of externalizing disorders, whereas girls showed higher rates of eating disorders. Internalizing disorders showed a change in sex ratios over time. From late adolescence onwards, these disorders are twice as common in women, whereas at school age depression is more common in boys. The findings show the urgent need for strengthening prevention and intervention research in childhood and adolescence.

AB The aims of this study were to examine family type (nonstep, stepfather, stepmother, and single mother) and sibling type (full- and half-siblings) differences in sibling relationship quality (positivity and negativity), and to investigate links between sibling relationship quality and child externalizing and internalizing problems. The sample included 192 families with a 5-year-old target child and an older sibling. In addition, 80 of these families included a third older child. Mothers and the older siblings (8 years and older) completed questionnaires and interviews regarding conflict and support in their sibling relationships, and parents and teachers reported on each child social-emotional adjustment. Sibling negativity (conflict, aggression) was highest in single-mother families and full-siblings were more negative than half- and stepsiblings. There was some evidence that sibling antagonism was associated with more child behavioral and emotional problems, but these effects were moderated by family type.

AB This paper introduces an empirically derived psychosocial assessment form that may facilitate the incorporation of the growing body of research on sickle cell into the psychosocial assessment process. The psychosocial assessment form was guided by two theoretical models that explain the variability in adjustment among children and adolescents with sickle cell-the Disability-Stress-Coping Model (Wallender, Varni, Babani, Banis, & Wilcox, 1989) and the Transactional Stress and Coping Model (Thompson, Gustafson, George Spock, 1994). The Psychosocial Assessment Form consists of two sections. The first section includes primary indicators of adjustment such as internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, school performance, and difficulties in social relationships. The second section lists secondary indicators of adjustment including intrapersonal. factors, stress processing factors, and social ecological factors. The literature that guided this form is also reviewed. (C) 2002 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Zurich Adolescent Psychology and Psychopathology Study (ZAPPS) investigated the coping strategies in a representative sample of 10-17-year-old subjects (N = 1110) using a modified version of the Coping Across Situations Questionnaire (Seiffge-Krenke, 1989a). Factor analysis revealed two dimensions of active and avoidant coping. Internal consistencies of the two scales were satisfactory. Girls scored higher than boys for active coping by means of social resources und lower for avoidant coping. In general, scores for avoidant coping decreased with increasing age. In line with previous research, active coping correlated positively with self-esteem, perceived parental warmth, and perceived size and efficiency of the social network. Avoidant coping correlated positively with internalizing and externalizing problems and perceived rejection by the parents. Following a pattern-oriented approach four coping styles were identified by use of cluster analysis, These types of coping differ markedly with respect to the criterion variables.

AB This prospective longitudinal study addresses the research gap in the literature regarding multidimensional variation in welfare use and employment patterns, and relationships of such variation with parent earnings and child development outcomes. This study also aims to address the limitations of welfare dynamics studies that do not examine how multiple dimensions of welfare receipt and employment co-occur. Cluster analysis was utilized, using monthly welfare and employment data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, to examine variation within the welfare population in their welfare and work patterns across the first 5 years of children's lives. Six cluster profiles of welfare and work dynamics were found: Short-Term, Short-Term Work Exit, Working Cyclers, Nonworking Cyclers, Cycle to Long-Term Exit, and Long-Term. The clusters were validated using mother's 6th-year earnings as the criterion. The clusters' associations with child development outcomes in the cognitive and mental health domains ( at ages 6 and 7) were then explored. Work following short-term welfare use was associated with higher child reading scores than that following long-term use (a moderate-size effect). Cycling on and off welfare in the context of high levels of employment was associated with higher child internalizing symptoms than cycling accompanied by low levels of employment (a moderate-size effect). Implications for evaluation of TANF welfare-to-work policies are discussed.

ID CHILDREN; DEFICITS; MODEL
AB The purpose of the study was to examine if survivors of pediatric brain tumors exhibit a pattern of performance consistent with nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) and to explore the relationship between neuropsychological and social functioning in these children. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery and objective measures of psychosocial function designed to assess NVLD were administered to 15 survivors of brain tumors, ages 8-12 years. Despite the small sample size, a trend for better verbal skills compared to nonverbal skills was found using composite scores. Parents reported significant social deficits and a tendency for greater internalizing behavior problems as expected in NVLD. Additionally, there was a trend for a positive association between nonverbal scores and social function. Further research is needed to determine if the NVLD pattern observed is attributable to white matter damage of the right hemisphere. Routine neuropsychological and psychosocial assessment and intervention are indicated.

AB Behavioral and cognitive-behavioral strategies, including exposure, social skills training, and peer-mediated approaches, used to treat childhood shyness and related impairments are described. In addition, relevant outcome studies published within the past 20 years are evaluated, and limitations regarding the generalization, maintenance, and social validity of the reported treatment gains are addressed. Although the interventions reviewed have demonstrated short-term merit in ameliorating social and emotional impairments, such as problematic peer relations and internalizing difficulties, there currently is a lack of evidence to support the social validity and long-term generalization and maintenance of such behavioral gains. Thus, recommendations for future research are made, including the need to (a) assess the social validity of treatment outcomes, (b) utilize important socialization agents (e.g., parents, teachers, peers), and (c) conduct prevention research and longitudinal outcome studies.

AB Relations between attachment and child emotional and behavioral regulation were studied longitudinally in a sample of 223 children from urban, low-income families. Attachment in the Strange Situation at 12 and 18 months was scored using the infant classification system and at 24 months was scored using a preschool classification system. Only modest stability was found in attachment whether within or across classification systems, with the percentage of insecure attachments consistently increasing over time. Results indicated both concurrent and predictive associations with indices of child regulation based on observer ratings or maternal report. However, only the 24-month classification predicted maternal report of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at age 3.5 years, with additional variance accounted for by selected measures of child emotional and behavior regulation from the same assessment. Attachment security (B) and atypical attachment classifications (D, A/C, and AD) appear to provide the most consistently useful information about child functioning. Results are discussed in terms of continuity and change from the perspective of developmental psychopathology.

AB Examined the relative and combined associations among relational and overt forms of aggression and victimization and adolescents' concurrent depression symptoms, loneliness, self-esteem, and externalizing behavior An ethnically diverse sample of 566 adolescents (55% girls) in Grades 9 to 12 participated. Results replicated prior work on relational aggression and victimization as distinct forms of peer behavior that are uniquely associated with concurrent social-psychological adjustment. Victimization was associated most closely with internalizing symptoms, and peer aggression was related to symptoms of disruptive behavior disorder Findings also supported the hypothesis that victims of multiple forms of aggression are at greater risk for adjustment difficulties than victims of one or no form of aggression. Social support from close friends appeared to buffer the effects of victimization on adjustment.

AB Examined the reliability, construct, and concurrent validity of the Parenting Scale (PS), a brief instrument designed to measure dysfunctional parenting practices for parents of young children. In Study 1, 183 primarily African American mothers and their Head Start children completed the PS. The PS, which consists of 3 subscales-Laxness, Overreactivity, and Verbosity-was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (CEA). Neither the original 3-factor structure, nora 2-factor structure consisting of the original Laxness and Overreactivity factors, fit the data. A subsequent exploratory factor analysis yielded a 2-factor solution that was generally consistent with the Overreactivity and Laxness subscales identified by Arnold, O'Leary, Wolff, and Acker (1993). The 2-factor CFA solution was replicated with a sample of 216 similar mothers, and the 5-item Overreactivity and Laxness subscales retained internal consistencies above .70. Analysis of the convergent validity of the modified PS and its 2 subscales revealed moderate associations with measures of permissiveness, authoritarianism, involvement, and limit setting. Scores on the PS were not correlated significantly with measures of social desirability, maternal education level, or parent report of internalizing behavior problems. Concurrent validity evidence was obtained by correlating the PS with measures of parenting satisfaction and support, parenting stress, maternal depression, and measures of externalizing child behavior problems.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ANXIETY DISORDERS; DEPRESSION; CHILDHOOD; ADOLESCENTS; PERFORMANCE;
   ADJUSTMENT; EFFORTFUL; SYMPTOMS; CONDUCT; MODELS
AB Examined a conceptual model in which dual developmental pathways (behavioral and cognitive) are hypothesized to account for the relation among internalizing behavior problems, intelligence, and later scholastic achievement using a cross-sectional sample of 325 children. Classroom behavior and select aspects of cognitive functioning (vigilance, short-term memory) were hypothesized to mediate the relations among internalizing problems, IQ, and long-term scholastic achievement. Hierarchical tests applied to a nested series of models demonstrated that (a) individual differences in measured intelligence among children are associated with variations in classroom performance and cognitive functioning, (b) classroom performance and cognitive functioning make unique contributions to prediction of later achievement over and above the influence of intelligence, (c) anxious/depressive features are correlated but separable constructs, and (d) anxiety/depression and withdrawal contribute to prediction of classroom performance and cognitive functioning over and above the effects of intelligence. Classroom performance and cognitive functioning thus appear to mediate the effects of internalizing behaviors as well as intelligence. Particular attention to the presence and potential impact of social withdrawal on children's functioning, both alone and concomitant with anxiety/depression, appears warranted during the course of clinical evaluations owing to the strong continuity among these variables.

After accounting for the effects of age, gender, and family life events other than violence, support from family buffered the relations between exposure to violence and adjustment; this relation was strongest for girls and younger adolescents. Disclosure to friends appeared to be protective for younger adolescents but harmful for older adolescents, and this relation was only observed for hopelessness. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive processing models of adjustment to violence.

The authors asked 381 outpatient-clinic-referred children and their parents to list, independently, the child's target problems. Of the parent-child pairs, 63% failed in agree on even a single problem. When problems were grouped into broad categories (e.g., delinquent, withdrawn), more than a third of the pairs still failed to agree on a single broad problem area. Parent-child agreement was higher for externalizing than for internalizing problem categories (though poor for both). Low parent-child agreement may help explain the poor outcomes often reported for clinic-based child therapy.

AB This study is a meta-analytic review of the behavioral adjustment of children and adolescents with asthma. Of 78 studies initially reviewed, 26 studies (encompassing 28 data sets), reflecting data on nearly 5000 children with asthma (mean age = 8.4 years; 40% female), met criteria for inclusion. Effect size estimates were calculated across studies using standard methods. Separate effect sizes were calculated for internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems, degrees of asthma severity, and differences in control group used (i.e., sample controls or normative data). Results indicate that children with asthma have more behavioral difficulties than do healthy children, with the effect for internalizing behaviors being greater than that for externalizing behaviors (d(mn) = .73 vs .40). Increased asthma severity was associated with greater behavioral difficulties. Results did not differ by comparison group (healthy controls vs normative data). The findings suggest that patients with asthma, particularly children with severe asthma, should be considered at higher risk for behavioral difficulties that may necessitate psychosocial intervention.

AB This study investigated internalizing and externalizing symptoms as potential mediators of the relationship between perceived discrimination and early substance abuse among 195 American Indian 5 through 8 graders from three reservations that share a common culture (e.g., language, spiritual beliefs, and traditional practices) in the upper Midwest. The findings indicated that, although perceived discrimination contributed significantly to internalizing symptoms among the adolescents, internalizing symptoms were unrelated to early substance abuse. Rather, the effects of perceived discrimination on early, substance abuse were mediated by adolescent anger and delinquent behaviors. The results are discussed in terms of the consequences of perceived discrimination on the development of American Indian early adolescents.

AB Objective: To compare the psychosocial adaptation of boys with hypospadias after genital surgery to a community sample.
   Methods: Boys (6 to 10 years) with a history of hypospadias repair (n = 175) were compared with a community sample (n = 333) in a postal questionnaire survey using the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Few significant differences between cases and controls emerged. Boys with hypospadias were (slightly) lower in social involvement but did not perform more poorly in school. Boys with hypospadias displayed fewer externalizing behavior problems than controls, but a significant difference in nocturnal enuresis was not detected. Level of behavior problems did not differentiate hypospadias severity subgroups, but greater surgical and hospitalization experiences were associated with increased internalizing problems. Poorer cosmetic appearance of the genitals was associated with worse school performance.
   Conclusions: Surgically corrected hypospadias should not be considered a risk factor for poor psychosocial adaptation in childhood, but emotional problems increase with the number of hospital-related experiences.

AB Objective: To identify adulthood impairments associated with major depression and drug disorders in adolescence. distinguishing between general impairments for both disorders and specific impairments for each disorder. Method: Within a longitudinal community study (N = 365), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule provided 1-year diagnoses of major depression and drug abuse/dependence at age 18. At age 21, current functioning was assessed. Results: Adolescents with either depression or drug disorders had substantial deficits in later functioning, with few impairments shared in common. General areas of impairment included lower global functioning, externalizing behavior problems, and suicidal behaviors. Difficulties specific to depression encompassed multiple internalizing problems: interpersonal difficulties, decreased psychological well-being, career dissatisfaction, and active major depression at age 21. For males only, overall poor health was also a specific depression outcome. Age 21 problems unique to drug disorders included lower likelihood of post-high school education, being fired, and active drug disorders. Males, but not females, were also more likely to report antisocial behaviors in adulthood. Conclusions: Despite several significant commonalities, including suicide attempts, deficits associated with depression and drug disorders were primarily specific, suggesting distinct trajectories. Results highlight the need for specific follow-up services to alleviate continuing problems associated with these disorders.

TI Behavioral characteristics of children with daytime wetting
SO JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE behavior; psychology; urinary tract infections; enuresis
AB Purpose: We hypothesized in this descriptive investigation that children with daytime wetting demonstrate unique emotional/behavioral patterns, independent of gender and age, compared to children with nocturnal wetting.
   Materials and Methods: Two groups of children 5 to 17 years old with day wetting and urinary tract infections in the absence of organic etiology were recruited for study. There were 488 children in group 1 and 418 in group 2. Group 1 was given a short set of behavioral questions and group 2 was evaluated for behavioral characteristics with a revised and longer set of questions. Also in group 2 children with nocturnal wetting only were recruited as a comparison group. A subgroup of 58 children was randomly selected from group 2 and administered 2 standardized questionnaires.
   Results: Children with day wetting and urinary tract infection had a significantly higher rate of constipation (35%) than those with day wetting and no infection (25%, p <0.02). Parents of group 1 children reported the level of frustration and anger to be similar whether the children had urinary tract infection or not. Parents also reported that only 3.8% of children had significant learning or school problems. Parents of group 2 did not report any differences between nighttime and daytime wetting with respect to positive outlook, organizational skills or willingness to talk. Differences were noted, with daytime wetters perceived as more stubborn (p <0.0001), secretive (p <0.0001), refusing to follow parental requests (p <0.002) and constipation (p <0.0003). Of the subsample group the incidence of verified attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder was highest in children with daytime wetting and no infection (21%), and nighttime wetting (22%) compared to 0% in daytime wetting and infection. The Child Behavioral Checklist results on this sample suggested that 35% of the children with daytime wetting and no infection earned significant T scores of mixed or externalizing symptoms, while the nocturnal enuresis group demonstrated 16% significant T scores, primarily externalizing. All females with the daytime wetting and infection showed significant T scores within the internalizing domain. The Child Behavioral Checklist defines externalizing behaviors as aggressive and acting out behaviors, while internalizing behaviors include withdrawn and anxious/depressed behaviors. Mixed behaviors on this questionnaire include social, attention and thought problems.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that a minority of children with daytime wetting and infection tend to show an internalizing style of problems (11%) and constipation, while those with daytime wetting and no infection show a more mixed style of psychological problem (35%). In contrast, the nighttime wetting group tends to show externalizing problems (16%). Based on a subsample of the data children with daytime wetting and no infection, and nighttime wetting showed a significantly incidence of verified attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to the general population. According to parent perceptions, stubbornness and secretiveness seem to describe a style that the children with daytime wetting exhibit that is not present in those with nighttime wetting. There is a possible role of uncontrol and over control psychological styles to the development and treatment of daytime wetting as well as the relationship of these styles to treatment outcome. Further research is needed to clarify the psychological style of children with daytime wetting to customized treatment protocols.

AB Physiological regulation, as indexed by baseline vagal tone and delta vagal tone (the change in vagal tone during an attention-demanding or challenging task), was examined as a moderator in the relations between exposure to verbal and physical parental marital conflict and children's adjustment and physical health. Higher vagal tone was posited to serve a protective function (i.e., buffer) for children exposed to higher levels of marital conflict. Seventy-five 8- to 12-year-olds and their mothers completed measures of parental conflict, and children's adjustment and physical health. Children's vagal tone was assessed during baseline conditions and during exposure to an audiotaped interadult argument. Results indicate that higher vagal tone buffered children against increased externalizing, internalizing, and health problems related to exposure to more frequent marital conflict, especially verbal conflict. Further, higher levels of delta vagal tone protected boys against externalizing problems associated with verbal conflict, and health problems associated with physical conflict.

AB Children's appraisals of marital conflict were examined as moderators and mediators of conflict and children's adjustment, physical health, and physiological reactivity. Mothers completed measures of marital conflict and children's adjustment and physical health, and elementary school children provided information on their parents' marital conflict, appraisals of perceived threat and self-blame in relation to parents' conflicts, and their internalizing symptomatology. Children's heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and skin conductance response and level were examined during both a baseline and an interadult argument. Higher levels of both self-blame and perceived threat functioned as robust vulnerability factors for children exposed to higher levels of marital conflict in relation to internalizing behaviors, health problems, and higher levels of cardiovascular reactivity to the argument. Further, a higher level of perceived threat was a vulnerability factor for externalizing problems associated with exposure to marital conflict.

AB Children's emotional regulation (as indexed by vagal suppression) and children's emotional reactivity during an argument were examined as moderators and mediators of parental problem drinking and children's adjustment in a sample of 6- to 12-year-olds. Cardiac vagal tone was assessed during both a baseline condition and exposure to an audiotaped argument. Vagal suppression was calculated by subtracting vagal tone during the baseline from that recorded during the argument, with a higher number representing increased suppression of vagal tone during the argument. Emotional reactivity was based on both observations of overt behaviors of children and their reported feelings during the argument. A higher level of vagal suppression was a protective factor against children's externalizing, internalizing, and social problems associated with exposure to parental problem drinking. Emotional reactivity was a vulnerability factor, and children's increased anger and fear, and to a lesser degree sadness, each moderated and exacerbated the effects of parental problem drinking on child outcomes.

AB We examined executive functions using performance tasks in 126 boys aged 6 to 16 years, who attended public schools and therapeutic schools for children with emotional and behavioral problems. Children were further grouped based on the presence or absence of substantiated abuse histories. Based on their abuse histories and schools of origin, children were classified as Therapeutic, Abused (TA, N = 25), Therapeutic, Nonabused (TN, N = 52), and Public School (PS, N = 48). Controlling IQ and medication status, we compared children in the three groups on teacher ratings of behavior, on experimenter observations of behavior during testing, and on performance tasks challenging the capacities to inhibit an act in progress, and to passively avoid responses associated with adverse consequences. We examined mean group differences in symptoms, behaviors, and task performance. as well as differential age-dependent changes in these dimensions. Independent of abuse history, therapeutic school children demonstrated comparable levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and comparable levels of redirections to task during testing sessions, that were significantly higher than those of the public school children. Both groups of therapeutic school children also showed comparable overall performance on the capacities to inhibit an act in progress, and to passively avoid responses associated with adverse consequences that were poorer than the performance of children from the public school. Children with histories of substantiated abuse showed diminished improvement with increasing age in the capacity to passively avoid responses associated with adverse consequences when compared not only to the public school children, but also to the children from the therapeutic schools without histories of abuse. Our findings complement reports of behavioral observations of abused children, and reports associating child abuse with altered cognitive development in other areas of competence. They suggest that child abuse may negatively influence the expected developmental progression of competence in certain executive functions. This in turn could have implications for the nature and the persistence of certain forms of psychopathology associated with abuse and poor self-control. Given the cross-sectional nature of our data, however, longitudinal developmental studies of the relations between child abuse and executive functions are needed to elucidate the influence of abuse on the growth and development of such organizing principles of behavioral self-regulation.

AB Objective: To describe the psychometric properties of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief measure of the prosocial behavior and psychopathology of 3-16-year-olds that can be completed by parents, teachers, or youths. Method: A nationwide epidemiological sample of 10,438 British 5-15-year-olds obtained SDQs from 96% of parents, 70% of teachers, and 91% of 11-15-year-olds. Blind to the SDQ findings, all subjects were also assigned DSM-IV diagnoses based on a clinical review of detailed interview measures. Results: The predicted five-factor structure (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity-inattention, peer, prosocial) was confirmed. Internalizing and externalizing scales were relatively "uncontaminated" by one another. Reliability was generally satisfactory, whether judged by internal consistency (mean Cronbach alpha: .73), cross-informant correlation (mean: 0.34), or retest stability after 4 to 6 months (mean: 0.62). SDQ scores above the 90th percentile predicted a substantially raised probability of independently diagnosed psychiatric disorders (mean odds ratio: 15.7 for parent scales, 15.2 for teacher scales, 6.2 for youth scales). Conclusion: The reliability and validity of the SDQ make It a useful brief measure of the adjustment and psychopathology of children and adolescents.

AB Objective. Fragile X syndrome, caused by mutations in a single gene of the X chromosome (FMR1), is associated with neurobehavioral characteristics including social deficits with peers, social withdrawal, gaze aversion, inattention, hyperactivity, anxiety, depression, and autistic behavior. However, there is considerable variability in the behavioral and psychiatric problems among children with this condition. The purpose of this study was to measure genetic and environmental factors influencing behavior problems and autistic symptoms in children with fragile X syndrome.
   Design. We conducted an in-home evaluation of 120 children (80 boys and 40 girls) with the fragile X full mutation and their unaffected siblings, including measurements of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), quality of the home environment, maternal and paternal psychopathology, effectiveness of educational and therapeutic services, and child behavior problems. Results.
   Results of multiple regression analyses showed that for boys with fragile X, effectiveness of educational and therapeutic services and parental psychological problems predicted internalizing and externalizing types of problems, while the quality of the home environment predicted autistic behavior. For girls with fragile X, the results emphasized significant effects of FMRP on behavior, in particular social withdrawal and anxious/depressed behavior.
   Conclusions. These findings are among the first to link FMRP expression to behavior. They also emphasize the significance of home- and school-based environmental variables in the neurobehavioral phenotype and help to lay the foundation for studies designed to identify specific interventions for reducing problem behavior in children with fragile X syndrome.

   Method: Sexually abused girls and their caretakers (N = 159), of which 52% (n = 82) were AA (mean age 9.8 years, SD = 3.4, R = 6 -17) and 48 % (n = 77) were HN (mean age 10. 1 years, SD = 3.8, R = 6-181), were included in the study. The mother/caretaker was administered a demographic form, the Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Family Assessment Measure (FAM-P). The child completed the FA-M-C and the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). The clinician completed the Parental Reaction to Incest Disclosure Scale (PRIDS).
   Results: HN girls were found to have a greater number of sexually abusive episodes and waited longer to disclose their abuse while AA girls were more likely to have experienced vaginal penetration. The perpetrators of HN girls were older and more likely to be fathers or stepfathers. The mothers/caretakers of HN girls perceived their children as having significantly more aggressive behavior, anxiety/depression, somatic complaints, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and had a higher total score on the CBCL than did AA girls. The HN girls were more likely to see their family as dysfunctional with confusion regarding family values and rules. HN mothers/caretakers perceived their families as more conflicted regarding adaptability and family controls.
   Conclusions: HN girls experienced more emotional and behavioral problems, and both HN girls and their mothers/caretakers perceived their families as more disturbed and dysfunctional. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hypothesis that physical aggression in the family affects children's adjustment through both observational learning/modeling and through its impact on parenting was tested (via LISREL) using data from a representative sample of Canadian children (N = 11,221). Results showed that observational learning and disrupted parenting provide reasonable, if only partial explanations, of mothers' assessments of children's adjustment in families characterized by physical aggression. Models for preschool (4-5 years), young (6-9 years), and older school-age (10-11 years) children fit acceptably and showed similar but weak effects, Children reported to witness more aggression also were reported to behave more aggressively. Mothers who reported being less warm and responsive in parenting reported that their children were more aggressive, had more internalizing behaviors, and had fewer prosocial behaviors.

AB We examined marital conflict, parent-child conflict, and maternal and paternal depression symptoms as mediators and moderators in the associations between fathers' and mothers' problem drinking and children's adjustment. A community sample of 6-12-year-old boys and girls and their mothers, fathers, and teachers participated. Marital conflict, parent-child conflict, and maternal depression symptomatology each functioned as a mediator of the association between father's problem drinking and children's externalizing and internalizing problems, and maternal depression symptoms accounted partially for the link between father's problem drinking and children's social problems. For mother's problem drinking, marital conflict, parent-child conflict, and maternal depression symptoms each mediated the association with children's externalizing problems. Further, parent-child conflict explained partially the link between mother's problem drinking and internalizing problems, and marital conflict accounted for the association between mother's problem drinking and social problems. When the mediators were simultaneously examined, parent-child conflict was the most robust mediator of the association between parental problem drinking and externalizing problems, and maternal depression symptomatology was the most consistent mediator of the relation between parental problem drinking and internalizing problems. Further, parent-child conflict and paternal and maternal depression symptoms each interacted with parental problem drinking to moderate some domains of children's adjustment. The significant moderation effects indicate that parent-child conflict is a robust vulnerability factor for internalizing problems.

AB Child Behavior Checklist questionnaires (Achenbach, 1992), filled in separately by mothers and fathers, were collected for an effective sample of 3501 Dutch 3-year-old twin pairs. To disentangle the child's phenotype from that of the rater, two contrasting models were fitted to the data. One model, called a Rater Bias model, is based on the assumption that both parents assess exactly the same behaviors in the child. A weaker alternative of this model, called a Psychometric model, assumes that apart from these common behavioral views, each parent also assesses a unique aspect of the child's behavior. A Psychometric model fitted the data of both Internalizing and Externalizing scales significantly better than a Rater Bias model. This implied that each parent provided unique information from his or her own perspective, apart from the common behavioral view. Using this best fitting model, the etiology of both the Internalizing and Externalizing scales was studied. Common factors (influencing behaviors similarly assessed by both parents) were more important than unique factors (influencing behaviors uniquely assessed by one parent). Common genetic factors explained about 50 % of the Variance of both scales, indicating a possible inborn Vulnerability to childhood psychopathology. Common environmental factors not shared between twins (free of unreliability and error) explained around 14 % of both scales, suggesting the importance of pure idiosyncratic experiences even for children as young as 3 years. Common environmental factors shared between twins (unconfounded by rater bias) were only found for the Externalizing scale, explaining 18 % of the variance. Rater bias and unreliability, if present in the data. were included in the estimates of the unique factors. Unique genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental factors each explained around 8 % of the variance for both scales. These small effects could be detected because of the large sample of twin pairs used.

AB This study examined social resources and psychosocial adaptation of 38 children between the ages of 6 and 12 (21 male, 17 female) who were currently experiencing a housing crisis. Results indicate that the impact of stressors depended on the informant. mother-reported stressors significantly predicted negative parenting, internalizing, and externalizing; and child-reported stressors were inversely associated with positive parenting and school adaptation, and positively correlated with child's negative affect. Mothers were nominated over three times more frequently than any other social network member, and almost half of the children did not identify any friends in their social network. Network size did not significantly predict children's psychosocial adaptation, but satisfaction with support was associated with less negative affect. Results suggest that social resources provide unique opportunities for the development of competence for children.

AB Fourth-grade children's peer groups were identified using the Social Cognitive Mapping (SCM) procedure. Children (N = 143) and caregivers then participated in interviews in which they provided information used to construct a measure of social network (intergenerational) closure, defined as the extent to which meaningful social relationships existed between children and their friends' parents and among parents whose children were friends. Higher levels of social network closure were linked with higher achievement test scores and lower levels of parent-reported externalizing behavior. Among European American children only, higher levels of social network closure also were linked with higher levels of teacher-rated social competence. Higher levels of closure were associated with more externalizing behavior (as reported by parents and teachers) among African American children, but less externalizing behavior among European American children. Negative associations between closure and internalizing behaviors were strongest among girls who were bused from a different neighborhood to attend the target school.

AB family history of asthma, asthma onset by 3 years of age was found previously to be positively associated with variables from the first year of life, including elevated total immunoglobulin E (IgE), frequent respiratory infections, and parenting difficulties. We followed this cohort of genetically at-risk children to investigate the relationship between factors assessed in infancy and asthma, allergy, and psychological status at school age.
   Methods. A cohort of 150 children who were at risk for developing asthma were identified prenatally on the basis of the mothers' having asthma. For 28 children, the father had asthma as well, putting them at bilateral genetic risk. Families primarily were middle and upper middle class Caucasians. Parents came to the clinic during the third trimester of pregnancy for assessments of medical and psychosocial functioning. A home visit took place when the infant was 3 weeks old, when parenting risk was assessed before the onset of any asthma symptoms. Parenting difficulties included problems with infant caregiving as well as components of maternal functioning, such as postpartum depression and inadequate marital support. Blood was drawn for serum IgE at 6 months of age. Parents and offspring subsequently came to the clinic multiple times, with the last clinic visit during the child's sixth year. Follow-up at age 6 involved a clinic visit for allergy and psychosocial evaluations, consisting of interviews and a behavior questionnaire. Seventy-seven children received the allergy and psychosocial evaluation, 26 received the psychosocial evaluation in the clinic, and 30 families received telephone interviews and mailed in questionnaires. Additional monitoring of families by telephone and mail was maintained over the next 2 years, until the children were 8, to ensure accurate characterization of the course of illness. Comprehensive medical records were obtained and reviewed for all health care contacts. Children were designated as having asthma when there was documentation in medical records of physician-diagnosed asthma, observed wheezing, and/or prescription of asthma medications during the time period when the child was between 6 and 8 years of age. Parental reports of the occurrence of asthma corroborated the medical record data.
   Results. Data regarding asthma status were available for 145 children through 8 years of age. Forty (28%) of the children manifested asthma between 6 and 8 years of age. Among variables previously reported to predict asthma onset by age 3, 3 proved to have significant univariate relationships with asthma between ages 6 and 8: elevated IgE levels measured when the children were 6 months of age, global ratings of parenting difficulties measured when infants were 3 weeks old, and higher numbers of respiratory infections in the first year of life. Among these offspring of mothers with asthma, paternal asthma showed a significant association with asthma between ages 6 and 8. Eczema in the first year was not significantly related to later asthma. Multiple logistic regression showed that the model that best predicted asthma at ages 6 to 8 from infancy variables included 2 main effects. The adjusted odds ratio for 6-month IgE was 2.15 (1.51, 3.05) and for parenting difficulties was 2.07 (1.15, 3.71). Although socioeconomic status (SES) was not associated with asthma at ages 6 to 8, families of lower SES were more likely to be rated as having parenting difficulties early in the child's life. The mothers of lower SES breastfed for a shorter period of time and were more likely to smoke during their infant's first year. There were more respiratory infections during the first year of life among infants whose mother was rated as having more parenting difficulties. Mothers who reported smoking breastfed their infants for a shorter length of time. Male gender was significantly associated with higher IgE levels when infants were 6 months of age. Laboratory testing was completed for 77 children at age 6. Total serum IgE levels were significantly higher for the children with asthma between ages 6 and 8. Skin-prick testing showed that the children with asthma had significantly more positive skin test reactions than did the children without asthma. Psychosocial interview data at 6 years of age were available for 103 families, and behavioral questionnaires were available for 133 families. On the basis of 6-year interviews, children with asthma were rated as being at greater psychological risk than were the children without asthma. Mothers' Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ratings of their children's behavior indicated higher internalizing scores for the children with asthma as compared with the children without asthma. Like the 6-month IgE, 6-year IgE was higher for boys. IgE levels measured at 6 months of age were significantly correlated with 6-year IgE levels. Parenting difficulties measured at 3 weeks were significantly correlated with 6-year measures of maternal depression, CBCL Internalizing score, and Child Psychological Risk (CPR) score. There also were significant correlations among the psychosocial variables assessed when the children were 6 years of age; maternal depression was significantly associated with child CBCL Internalizing score and CPR score, and the last 2 also were significantly correlated. Multiple logistic regression showed that 2 concurrently measured variables entered the model showing the strongest associations with asthma at ages 6 to 8. The adjusted odds ratio for CPR score was 3.21 (1.29-7.96) and for 6-year IgE was 1.71 (1.04-2.80).
   Conclusions. This study of the natural history of childhood asthma focused on the development of asthma into the school-age years in a genetically at-risk group of children. The relationships between biological and psychosocial variables in the first year and school-age asthma support the formulation of asthma as beginning early in life, with the developing immune system interacting with environmental influences. The data provide support for the possible contribution of psychosocial factors to asthma onset and persistence into childhood.

AB Objective: To determine if a home-based nurse intervention (INT), focusing on parenting education/skills and caregiver emotional support, reduces child behavioral problems and parenting stress in caregivers of in utero drug-exposed children.
   Design: Randomized clinical trial of a home-based INT.
   Settings: Two urban hospital newborn nurseries; homes of infants (the term infant is used interchangeably in this study with the term child to denote those from birth to the age of 36 months); and a research clinic in Baltimore, Md.
   Participants: In utero drug-exposed children and their caregivers (N =100) were examined when the child was between the ages of 2 and 3 years. Two groups were studied: standard care (SC) (n = 51) and INT (n = 49).
   Intervention: A home nurse INT consisting of 16 home visits from birth to the age of 18 months to provide caregivers with emotional support and parenting education and to provide health monitoring for the infant.
   Main Outcome Measures: Scores on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Parenting Stress Index.
   Results: Significantly more drug-exposed children in the SC group earned t scores indicative of significant emotional or behavioral problems than did children in the INT group on the Child Behavior Checklist Total (16 [31%] vs 7 [14%]; P = .04), Externalizing (19 [37%] vs 8 [16%]; P = .02), and Internalizing (14 [27%] vs 6 [12%]; P = .05) scales and on the anxiety-depression subscale (16 [31%] vs 5 [10%]; P = .009). There was a trend (P = .06) in more caregivers of children in the SC group reporting higher parenting distress than caregivers of children in the INT group.
   Conclusions: In utero drug-exposed children receiving a home-based nurse INT had significantly fewer behavioral problems than did in utero drug-exposed children receiving SC (P = .04). Furthermore, those caregivers receiving the home-based INT reported a trend toward lower total parenting distress compared with caregivers of children who received SC with no home visits.

AB This research assessed the relation between husbands' marital violence and child problems in a sample of families seeking clinical services for their children's (4 to 7 years) oppositional, noncompliant behavior. We assessed whether husbands' marital violence was associated with increased levels of child problems after accounting for parental marital discord, parent-child aggression, and wives' acts of aggression toward husbands. We also assessed the contribution of data collected from fathers in evaluating the relation between husbands' marital violence and child problems. Ninety mothers and fathers each provided data on husbands' marital violence, their children's externalizing and internalizing problems, general marital discord, parental aggression toward children, and wives' aggression toward husbands. Husbands' marital violence was associated with child problems, even after accounting for general marital discord, parental aggression toward children, and wives' aggression toward husbands. The documented relations were more a function of fathers' than mothers' reports of child problems.

AB The object of this prospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a therapeutic nursery program for troubled preschoolers attending the Preschool Day Treatment Center of The Menninger Clinic. Thirty-eight seriously disturbed prescboolers were assessed both at admission and at 9 months or at discharge (if before 9 months) in a pre-post design. Commonly used assessment instruments were collected by independent research clinicians. Significant gains were found in both internalizing and externalizing behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The Kohn Social Competence Scale showed significant improvement in learning, pleasurable play activities, and peer interactions. The socialization domain on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale also indicated improvement beyond expectable maturation. In the Behavioral Observations test, both the capacities of the child and the qualities of the relationship were shown to be improved. As measured by the Epidemiologic Studies of Depression Scale (CES-D), mothers also became less depressed. Overall, the researchers conclude that a therapeutic nursery with a comprehensive program is an effective way to help seriously troubled prescboolers make gains in behavior, as well as in social and emotional growth.

AB Objective: Dissociation is linked to the experience of child maltreatment for adults and for school-aged children. The goals of the current paper were: First, to extend existing research and examine the link between child maltreatment and preschool-aged children; and second, to examine which subgroups of maltreated preschoolers are most likely to evidence dissociation.
   Method: A well-validated measure of dissociation in children, The Child Dissociative Checklist (CDC; Putnam, Helmers, & Trickett, 1993), was utilized in a sample of low SES maltreated and nonmaltreated preschoolers (N = 198). A measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms was also utilized. The maltreated children were assessed for sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, and also for severity, chronicity, and multiple subtypes of maltreatment.
   Results: The sexually abused, physically abused, and neglected groups each demonstrated more dissociation than did the nonmaltreated group. Dissociation in the clinical (psychopathological) range was associated with physical abuse. Moreover, maltreatment severity, chronicity, multiple subtypes, and internalizing and externalizing symptomatology were each related to dissociation.
   Conclusions: Child maltreatment is a factor in dissociation in preschool-aged children as it is in older children and in adults. Sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect, severity, and chronicity are all implicated. Developmentally sensitive interventions that look beyond comorbidity with behavioral symptoms for dissociative preschool-aged children are needed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A significant percentage of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have comorbid, associated problems, such as learning disabilities, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and internalizing disorders. However, it will be argued that comorbid diagnoses are not useful in treatment planning. In order to effectively treat the problematic behaviours associated with these comorbidities, clinicians must systematically assess for the impairment related to these comorbidities and implement treatment aimed to reduce impaired functioning and increase competencies in important functional domains. Clinicians who utilize this approach will find (1) that diagnosis matters little for treatment planning, while functional impairment matters a great deal, and (2) that the systematic application of behaviour modification principles improves functioning across diagnostic categories. A case study of a multiply comorbid child with ADHD is presented to illustrate effective treatment for ADHD and comorbid disorders. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Young children who present for treatment with oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) frequently exhibit these symptoms across settings and often show comorbid symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or internalizing symptoms such as anxiety or depression. Parent training programs to treat these children must be flexible and comprehensive enough to address these issues. This article outlines a case in which the Incredible Years Parent, Teacher, and Child Training programs were used to treat a young boy, John, with ODD, His problems were pervasive and occurred at home, at school, and with peers. In addition to the ODD symptoms John exhibited symptoms of ADHD as well as significant anxious and depressed behaviors. This case study outlines how a multimodal, manualized treatment can be applied flexibly to attend to individual family needs and address issues of comorbidity.

AB This investigation examined the dimensions of developmental timing, subtype, and severity of maltreatment and their relations with child adaptation. The 814 children who participated in a summer day camp, 492 of whom were maltreated and 322 of whom were nonmaltreated comparison children, were assessed by camp counselors on their internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, aggressive, withdrawn, and cooperative behavior, and on personality dimensions of ego resiliency and ego control, and were rated by peers on disruptive, aggressive, and cooperative behavior. The severity within each subtype of maltreatment and the developmental period in which each subtype occurred were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. Additionally, children with similar timing or subtype patterns were grouped to explore diversity in outcomes. Results highlighted the role of severity of emotional maltreatment in the infancy-toddlerhood period and physical abuse during the preschool period in predicting externalizing behavior and aggression. Severity of physical neglect, particularly when it occurred during the preschool period, was associated with internalizing symptomatology and withdrawn behavior. Additionally, maltreatment during the school-age period contributed significant variance after earlier maltreatment was controlled. Chronic maltreatment, especially with onset during infancy-toddlerhood or preschool periods, was linked with more maladaptive outcomes. The implications of measuring multiple dimensions for improving research in child maltreatment are discussed.

AB Cortisol regulation was investigated in a sample of school-aged maltreated (n = 167) and demographically comparable low-income nonmaltreated (n = 204) boys and girls in the context of a day camp research program. The presence of clinical-level internalizing and clinical-level externalizing symptomatology was determined through adult report and child self report. Children who exhibited clinical-level internalizing problems only, clinical-level externalizing problems only, and comorbid clinical-level internalizing and externalizing problems were identified. Clinical-level cases were more prevalent among the maltreated children. Maltreated children with clinical-level internalizing problems were distinguished by higher morning, afternoon, and average daily cortisol levels across the week of camp attendance. In contrast, nonmaltreated boys with clinical-level externalizing problems emerged as distinct in terms of low levels of morning and average daily levels of cortisol. Maltreated children with comorbid clinical-level internalizing and externalizing problems were more likely not to show the expected diurnal decrease in cortisol. The findings are discussed in terms of the joint impact of maltreatment and different forms of psychopathology on neuroendocrine regulation.

AB This study proposes a model explaining the association between physical abuse of children and children's social and affective status as one in which children's social expectations and behavior, developed within the context of abusive parenting, mediate current functioning in these two outcome domains. Subjects included one hundred 9 to 12-year-old physically abused children recruited from consecutive entries onto the New York State Register for Child Abuse for New York City and 100 case-matched classmate nonabused comparison children. Sociometric assessments were carried out in classrooms, interviews were conducted with the children and their parents, and teachers, parents, and classmates rated the children's behavior. Path analysis was utilized to test the conceptually derived models. Children's social expectations regarding peers, and two social behaviors-aggressive behavior and prosocial behavior-were found to mediate between abuse and positive and negative social status, as well as between abuse and positive and negative reciprocity. Social expectations and withdrawn behavior mediated between abuse and positive social status, but only where withdrawn behavior was a function of social expectations. Social expectations were generally found to mediate between abuse and internalizing problems. Negative social status (peer rejection) added to social expectations in producing internalizing problems. Identification of these mediating pathways can serve to guide secondary preventive intervention efforts so that they best address the problems abused children face in the absence of adequate parental and peer support as the children enter adolescence.

AB The study examined the predictive utility of blame attributions for maltreatment. Integrating theory and research on blame attribution, it was predicted that self-blame would mediate or moderate internalizing problems, whereas other-blame would mediate or moderate externalizing problems. Mediator and moderator models were tested separately. Adolescents (N = 160, ages 11-17 years) were randomly selected from the open caseload of a child protection agency. Participants made global maltreatment severity ratings for each of physical abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, and exposure to family violence. Participants also completed the Attribution for Maltreatment Inter-view (AFMI), a structured clinical interview that assessed self- and perpetrator blame for each type of maltreatment they experienced. The AFMI yielded five subscales: self-blaming cognition, self-blaming affect, self-excusing, perpetrator blame, and perpetrator excusing. Caretaker-reported (Child Behavior Checklist) and self-reported (Youth Self Report) internalizing and externalizing were the adjustment criteria. Controlling for maltreatment severity, the AFMI subscales explained significant variance in self-reported adjustment. Self-blaming affect was the most potent attribution, particularly among females. Attributions mediated maltreatment severity for self-reported adjustment but moderated it for caretaker-reported adjustment. The sophistication and relevance of blame attributions to adjustment are discussed, and implications for research and clinical practice are identified.

AB In a sample of 578 children assessed in kindergarten through the eighth grade, we used growth modeling to determine the basic developmental trajectories of mother-reported and teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors for three physical maltreatment groups of children-early-harmed (prior to age 5 years), later-harmed (age 5 years and over), and nonharmed-controlling for SES and gender. Results demonstrated that the earlier children experienced harsh physical treatment by significant adults, the more likely they were to experience adjustment problems in early adolescence. Over multiple domains, early physical maltreatment was related to more negative sequelae than the same type of maltreatment occurring at later periods. In addition, the fitted growth models revealed that the early-harmed group exhibited somewhat higher initial levels of teacher-reported externalizing problems in kindergarten and significantly different rates of chang in these problem behaviors than other children. as reported by mothers over the 9 years of this study. The early-harmed children were also seen by teachers, in kindergarten, as exhibiting higher levels of internalizing behaviors. The later-harmed children were seen by their teachers as increasing their externalizing problem behaviors more rapidly over the 9 years than did the early- or nonharmed children. These findings indicate that the timing of maltreatment is a salient factor in examining the developmental effects of physical harm.

AB Using a prospective longitudinal design, we examined internalizing problems and perceptions of control in a community sample of 785 children, 59 of whom had been maltreated. Children's internalizing problems and perceptions of control were measured via self-report at annual assessments in third grade through seventh grade (modal ages 9-13 years). Children's experiences of multiple types of maltreatment were rated based on social service records, using a standard coding system. Results of longitudinal analyses examining the roles of specific types of maltreatment (neglect, harsh parenting, and sexual abuse) revealed that neglect and sexual abuse were each associated with more internalizing problems, especially among children who experienced both these maltreatment types. Neglected children reported higher levels of perceived external control than other children did. Sexual abuse was associated with higher levels of perceived external control, but only among children who had also been neglected. Results of mediation analyses showed that higher levels of perceived external control accounted substantially for associations between specific maltreatment types and children's internalizing problems. Results of moderator analyses revealed that, among maltreated children, greater perceived internal control predicted fewer internalizing problems, suggesting that perceived internal control functioned as a protective factor. Children maltreated early in life were less likely to have this protective characteristic, Results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the developmental consequences of specific and co-occurring types of maltreatment.

AB A substantial body of literature suggests that childhood maltreatment is related to negative outcomes during adolescence, including delinquency, drug use, teenage pregnancy, and school failure. There has been relatively little research examining the impact that variation in the developmental stage during which the maltreatment occurs has on these relationships, however. In this paper, we reassess the impact of maltreatment on a number of adverse outcomes when developmentally specific measures of maltreatment-maltreatment that occurs only in childhood, only in adolescence, or in both childhood and adolescence-are considered. Data are drawn from the Rochester Youth Development Study, a broad-based longitudinal study of adolescent development. The analysis examines how maltreatment affects delinquency, drug use, alcohol-related problems, depressive symptoms, teen pregnancy, school dropout, and internalizing and externalizing problems during adolescence. We also examine whether the type of maltreatment experienced at various developmental stages influences the outcomes. Overall, our results suggest that adolescent and persistent maltreatment have stronger and more consistent negative consequences during adolescence than does maltreatment experienced only in childhood.

AB Longitudinal studies of adults have reported finding insomnia to significantly predict onset of substance abuse. This study estimated the association between sleep problems and substance use among adolescents in the context of psychiatric problems. Data come from the US National Household Survey on Drug Abuse 1994-1996 that included 13,831 adolescents. Use of cigarettes, alcohol and any illicit drug were each associated with adolescents' reports of having frequent sleep problems, adjusting for age, sex, race and family income (odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to 3.8). Adjusting for internalizing (e.g. depression and anxiety) and externalizing (e.g. deviance and aggression) problems reduced the associations between sleep problems and use of these substances, suggesting that part of the association is attributable to psychiatric problems. The part of the association not attributable to psychiatric problems was limited to the associations between sleep problems and use of illicit drugs. These results suggest that the relationship between sleep problems and drug use/abuse must be viewed in the context of psychiatric problems. Longitudinal research that employs more specific measures of sleep problems is indicated. Such research may provide information on the relationship of sleep problems to the immediate health and well being of adolescents, as well as their trajectories into adulthood.

AB The purpose of this study was twofold: to determine (1) the degree to which specific qualities of maternal touch may contribute to the low birth weight infant's emotional and behavioural problems as well as social adaptation, and (2) the relationship between maternal touch and a mother's other caregiving behaviour. The sample included 114 socioculturally diverse infants and their mothers who were videotaped during an infant feeding when the baby was 3 months old. This videotape was analysed to assess dimensions of mother-infant interaction, including maternal touch. Data on perinatal risk and the mother's acceptance versus rejection of the infant were also acquired. Social adaptation and emotional/behavioural problems were measured when the child was 2 years of age. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that maternal touch accounted for 15% of the variance in the likelihood of a child having emotional/behavioural problems at age 2. Children who received more nurturing touch had significantly fewer internalizing problems (such as depression) while children receiving both more frequent touch and harsh touch had more externalizing problems (such as aggressive behaviour). Infants who were less responsive to their caregivers were especially at risk of developing aggressive/destructive behaviour as a result of frequent touch. But less responsive infants also appeared to benefit most from greater use of diverse types of maternal touch, accounting for 6% of the variance in superior adaptive behaviour at age 2. Nurturing touch was the only quality that showed even a modest relationship to other caregiving behaviour, suggesting that touch may play a distinct role in the infant's psychosocial development.

AB Temperamental characteristics have been related to later externalizing and internalizing behavioral outcomes. To assess the relationship between temperament and the early family environment, we measured infant temperament, pleasure in parenting, and marital happiness via parent report in 99 families with a nonrelative adoptive infant, Perceptions of child temperament were assessed using two subscales of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ; Rothbart, 1981). Mothers and fathers who rated their adoptive child as showing more Distress to Limitations (on the IBQ) reported less pleasure in routine parenting activities;, this effect was mediated by marital happiness for fathers. Mothers reported less pleasure in parenting with infants perceived to be more temperamentally fearful (on the IBQ). The bidirectional relationship between temperamental characteristics and pleasure in parenting is discussed,

AB Examined correlates of treatment response in a clinic providing cognitive-behavioral therapy for children with anxiety disorders. Youth (ages 7 to IS) with a primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed:, rev., or 4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1987, 1994) anxiety-disorder diagnosis (overanxious disorder, generalized anxiety disorder; separation anxiety disorder; social phobia, or avoidant disorder) participated. After completing a full course of treatment and posttreatment (n = 135) and 1-year follow-up (n = 107) assessments, participants were classified into 1 of 2 groups poor treatment response and good treatment response-using parent diagnostic reports. Discriminant function analyses indicated that higher levels of maternal- and teacher-reported child-internalizing psychopathology at pretreatment, higher levels of maternal self-reported depressive symptoms, and older-child age were all associated with less favorable treatment response. Other factors, such as child ethnicity, child sex, family income, family composition (i.e., dual parent vs. single parent), child-reported symptomatology, and maternal-reported level of child-externalizing behavior problems did not predict treatment response. Both practical and conceptual implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Objective: To assess for significant differences in psychological functioning between caregivers of HIV-infected children and caregivers of healthy children, and to examine the utility of applying a stress and coping model to caregivers of children with HIV disease.
   Methods: Participants included caregivers of HIV-infected children (n = 36) and caregivers of a demographically matched control group of healthy children (n = 32). During their child's pediatric clinic visits, caregivers completed measures of psychological adjustment, stress, coping style, and family resources and support. They also completed a measure of their child's psychological adjustment.
   Results: Caregiver psychological distress scores did not significantly differ between the HIV and control groups, and clinically significant rates of psychological distress were reported by more than a third of caregivers in both groups. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that independent of their child's illness status, stress and coping style were significant predictors of caregiver's psychological adjustment. In addition, caregiver psychological distress was a significant predictor of children's maladjustment.
   Conclusions: High rates of psychological distress were observed in caregivers of children with HIV disease; however, similarly high rates of psychological adjustment problems were found in caregivers of healthy children. Caregivers who reported high levels of daily stress and emotion-focused coping styles tended to report more psychological distress. Further, caregivers who reported more psychological distress also reported more internalizing and more externalizing behavior problems in their children, regardless of the child's illness status. These findings reflect the impact of poverty and environmental stress on caregivers' adjustment.

   Methods: Participants included HIV-infected children (ages 6-16) and their caregivers (n = 36) and a control group of healthy children and their caregivers (n = 32). During routine clinic visits, children completed measures of psychological adjustment, health locus of control, and coping style, and caregivers completed measures of their own and their child's psychological adjustment.
   Results: Caregiver-reported and child self-reported psychological adjustment scores did not significantly differ between the HIV and control groups, with the exception of significantly more internalizing behavior problems reported in the control group. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the stress and coping model accounted for 36% of the variance in HIV-infected children's self-reported psychological adjustment. In addition, child age and coping style were significant predictors of child self-reported psychological adjustment, but not of caregiver-reported child adjustment.
   Conclusions: Approximately 25% of children with HIV disease exhibited clinically significant emotional or behavioral problems; however, even higher rates of psychological adjustment problems were found in healthy children. Children with HIV disease who have not been told their diagnosis and children who endorse more emotion-focused coping strategies tend to exhibit more psychological adjustment problems.

AB Objective: To investigate the independent predictive value of parent-reported psychopathology and family risk factors in early preschool in relation to parent-reported internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in preadolescence, Method: Subjects were participants in a longitudinal study of 420 two- to three-year-olds from the general population of Zuid-Holland, the Netherlands, which started in 1989. At a second follow-up 8 years later (ages 10-11 years), 358 children participated. For this study, 332 children were included for whom DSM-IV diagnoses (derived from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version 4-Parent Version) were obtained at age 10 to 11 years. Preschool risk factors were obtained through the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 2 to 3 years and a parent interview. Results: Early preschool internalizing and externalizing problems were predictive of their DSM-IV counterparts 8 years later, independent of the influence of early parent-reported family risk factors. Preschool child physical problems were independently predictive of both internalizing and externalizing diagnoses in preadolescence. Of the environmental risk factors, only stressful life events contributed independently to the prediction of later externalizing problems. Conclusion: Early adverse family circumstances and parenting characteristics do not contribute to the prediction of later psychopathology once child characteristics are accounted for.

AB There are strong social pressures for U.S. females, particularly those of European heritage, to achieve and maintain an extremely low body weight. These pressures are reflected in a variety of media sources, including advertising. We argue that valuing thinness, exposure to thinness-depicting media, and lacking skepticism about tobacco advertisements have adverse effects on young women's decisions about smoking, particularly smoking for weight control. We tested these hypotheses in a study of 188 female undergraduates, both never-smokers and daily smokers. Believing that smoking controls weight, exposure to thinness-depicting media, and low levels of skepticism about tobacco advertising were associated with being a smoker. Among smokers, believing that smoking controls weight, internalizing thinness pressures, and low levels of feminist consciousness were associated with smoking for weight control. Results are discussed with the aim of encouraging public health anti-smoking campaigns targeted at women, and smoking cessation programs that are responsive to the needs of weight-concerned female smokers.

AB Anxiety disorders are common in patients with depressive disorders. This preliminary study investigated some clinical correlates of comorbidity between dysthymic disorder (DD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in a clinically referred sample of children and adolescents. After psychiatric evaluation, including a diagnostic clinical interview (DICA-R), 51 patients (25 males and 26 females, mean age 13.1 years) with an index diagnosis of DID associated with GAD were compared with 22 patients (13 males and 9 females, mean age 12.9 years) diagnosed as having pure DID. The comparison between subjects (DID with or without GAD) regarding the number of depressive symptoms did not show a significant main effect of group. Suicidal ideation was significantly more frequent in the group with comorbid GAD. Internalizing disorders were more frequent in the group of DID with GAD, while externalizing disorders were more frequent in the group without GAD. Functional impairment, assessed with the Children's Global Assessment Scale, did not show significant differences between the two groups. Data are discussed in the light of conceptualizations about the relationship between chronic anxiety and depressive disorders. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The objective of this article was to analyze the structure of the Child Behavior Checklist (CB CL), which is often used to measure children's emotional and behavioral problems. Considering its potential uses in social work, we logically deduced the optimal format for each use. Confirmatory factor analysis of the CBCL problem scales was the method conducted. Three alternative models were also proposed and tested. Data analyzed were parent responses from two clinical samples consisting of 542 children ages 3 to 18 years old living in Oregon or North Carolina. The CBCL author's eight-correlated-factor model was confirmed. The data also fit the three alternative models to varying degrees. Conclusions reached were that the original model was judged most useful for diagnosis; the one-, two-, and three-factor models all were useful for screening; and individual items were most useful for treatment planning and outcome assessment. Using only the original internalizing and externalizing scores is not recommended.

AB Background: The association of age at first drink (AFD) and alcoholism may reflect a common inherited vulnerability to disinhibitory behavior and psychopathology rather than a direct influence of the former on the latter. We tested the common-inherited-vulnerability hypothesis by determining whether AFD is familial and heritable.
   Methods: A sample of 1,232 14-year-old twins was classified according to their biological parents' AFD.
   Results: Lifetime symptoms of externalizing disorders (i.e., conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder) were significantly higher in the sons but not the daughters of parents whose AFD came before age 15 years. Offspring symptoms of internalizing disorders (i.e., major depressive disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and overanxious disorder) were not significantly associated with parental early use of alcohol in either sons or daughters. Early use of alcohol in mothers but not fathers was associated with a significant increase in both sons' and daughters' risk of alcohol use by age 14. The contribution of genetic and environmental factors to risk of early alcohol use was investigated in a sample of 416 monozygotic (MZ) and 225 like-sex dizygotic (DZ) 14-year-old twin pairs. Twin similarity for early alcohol use was substantially greater in MZ than DZ twins in boys but about equally similar in MZ and DZ twins in girls. Estimated heritability of early alcohol use was significantly greater in boys (55%) than girls (11%), in part because the genetic factors underlying symptoms of disinhibitory psychopathology contributed more to risk of early alcohol use in boys than girls.
   Conclusions: Early use of alcohol is familial and, at least in males, heritable. The familial transmission of early alcohol use is caused in part by genetic risk for disinhibitory psychopathology in males and to shared environmental factors in girls. These results provide some support for a common-inherited-vulnerability hypothesis, and suggest that the processes underlying early alcohol use may differ in boys and girls.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSULTING AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY

ID CONFLICT; ADJUSTMENT; AGGRESSION; CHILDHOOD; DISCORD
AB The authors examined the relation between parents' hostility during conflict-focused discussions and child behavior problems. Parents engaged in 3 discussions: a dyadic marital discussion of marital disagreements, a dyadic marital discussion of child-related disagreements, and a triadic family discussion with the child about the child-related disagreements. Eighty-nine 2-parent community families with a child aged 9-13 years participated. A significant 3-way interaction between interparental hostility, parent-to-child hostility, and child sex accounted for variance in children's behavior problems. Among boys, higher levels of parent-to-child hostility during family discussions exacerbated the effects of interparental hostility on boys' adjustment. Thus, exposure to higher levels of both interparental and parent-to-child hostility may put boys at risk for developing internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.

AB Gender-specific rates of violence exposure and violence perpetration among psychiatrically ill adolescents has received little scientific attention. We examined 130 adolescent inpatients and found no difference between male and female subjects with respect to self-reported violence potential or actual violence perpetration. Female inpatients, however, were significantly more often victims of sexual assault, and male inpatients were significantly more often victims of physical assault. For male inpatients, a history of violence perpetration in one area was closely linked with a history of violence victimization in the same area. Alternatively, patterns of victimization and perpetration among female inpatients were less predictable and had crossover to victimization and perpetration experiences in other areas. Correlational analyses revealed that violence risk was associated with a broad range of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Significant associations with hopelessness, suicidality, and childhood trauma differentiated the violence risk of male and female inpatients. We propose a hypothesis for understanding these differences and conclude that although psychiatrically ill adolescent male and female patients may commonly fall victim to differing forms of violence, both genders are at equal risk for actual violence perpetration.

AB This longitudinal study examined dramatic-erratic personality disorder symptoms (histrionic, borderline, and narcissistic symptoms) in a community sample of 407 adolescents to assess whether this diagnostic construct is meaningful in young people. Based on latent variable models and dimensional symptom scales, these so-called Cluster B symptoms were highly stable across an eight-year interval from early adolescence to early adulthood. Furthermore, when compared with internalizing and externalizing symptoms, dramatic-erratic symptoms were more stable over time than these well-established Axis I symptom clusters. Based on high correlations with co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms, Cluster B symptoms clearly reflect emotional distress during adolescence. These analyses reinforce recent efforts to establish personality disorders as a clinically significant and valid diagnostic construct in young people.

AB This study examined the relationship over time between Cluster B personality disorder symptoms (borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic symptoms) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing symptoms in a community sample of 407 adolescents. Cross-lagged longitudinal models tested (a) the hypothesis that Cluster B symptoms reflect primary disturbances that give rise to co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms; and (b) the alternative hypothesis that these Axis I symptom clusters reflect primary problems that interfere with normal personality development. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms each predicted subsequent Cluster B symptoms in girls. although these effects occurred only at specific developmental stages. Cluster B symptoms in boys and girls at ages 10 to 14 years predicted externalizing symptoms two years later. instead of clearly supporting one hypothesis over the other, longitudinal models suggested gender-specific developmental effects that were partially consistent with both hypotheses.

AB Three questions were examined in this study: (a) What is the course of emotional disturbance and delinquency during adolescence and young adulthood? (b) To what extent do emotional disturbance and delinquency co-occur during adolescence and young adulthood? and (c) What are the longitudinal associations between emotional disturbance and delinquency in different age and gender categories during adolescence and young adulthood? Data were used from a national sample of 1,302 adolescents and young adults, who participated in a 6-year 3-wave longitudinal study. Findings showed an increase of emotional disturbance and delinqueney from early to midadolescence, after which emotional disturbance stabilized and delinquency declined into young adulthood. A significant but relatively weak co-occurrence of emotional disturbance and delinquency was found. Multigroup LISREL analyses demonstrated that a stability model with no cross-lagged relations fit best for the total sample, and across age and gender categories. Thus, co-occurrence of emotional disturbance and delinquency during adolescence and young adulthood seems to result from associated but separate psychopathological processes. The strong stability of internalizing and externalizing behavior suggests that prevention efforts should be aimed at children and young adolescents.

AB The present study examined (1) rates of somatic complaints and (2) the association between stress and somatic complaints in low-income urban youth. Participants were 1030 low-income urban 6th-8th grade adolescents. Results indicate that, for both boys and girls, somatization was the most commonly reported internalizing symptom in this sample, and that heightened rates of urban stress predicted heightened rates of somatic complaints. In addition, a significantly, higher percentage of youth in this sample reported clinically, elevated levels of somatic complaints (17%) relative to that reported by normative samples (5%). The 2 most common somatic complaints were stomachaches and headaches, and females reported higher rates of somatic complaints than males. These findings suggest that somatic complaints are the most common expression of internalizing symptoms among low-income urban youth, and that exposure to heightened rates of stress places low-income urban adolescents at heightened risk for somatization. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Objective. Moderate to heavy levels of prenatal alcohol exposure have been associated with alterations in child behavior, but limited data are available on adverse effects after low levels of exposure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-response effect of prenatal alcohol exposure for adverse child behavior outcomes at 6 to 7 years of age.
   Methods. Beginning in 1986, women attending the urban university-based maternity clinic were routinely screened at their first prenatal visit for alcohol and drug use by trained research assistants from the Fetal Alcohol Research Center. All women reporting alcohol consumption at conception of at least 0.5 oz absolute alcohol/day and a 5% random sample of lower level drinkers and abstainers were invited to participate to be able to identify the associations between alcohol intake and child development. Maternal alcohol, cigarette, and illicit drug use were prospectively assessed during pregnancy and postnatally. The independent variable in this study, prenatal alcohol exposure, was computed as the average absolute alcohol intake (oz) per day across pregnancy. At each prenatal visit, mothers were interviewed about alcohol use during the previous 2 weeks. Quantities and types of alcohol consumed were converted to fluid ounces of absolute alcohol and averaged across visits to generate a summary measure of alcohol exposure throughout pregnancy. Alcohol was initially used as a dichotomous variable comparing children with no prenatal alcohol exposure to children with any exposure. To evaluate the effects of different levels of exposure, the average absolute alcohol intake was relatively arbitrarily categorized into no, low (>0 but <0.3 fl oz of absolute alcohol/day), and moderate/heavy (>0.3 fl oz of absolute alcohol/day) for the purpose of this study. Six years later, 665 families were contacted. Ninety-four percent agreed to testing. Exclusions included children who missed multiple test appointments, had major congenital malformations (other than fetal alcohol syndrome), possessed an IQ >2 standard deviations from the sample mean, or had incomplete data. The Achenbach Child Behavior Check-list (CBCL) was used to assess child behavior. The CBCL is a parent questionnaire applicable to children ages 4 to 16 years. It is widely used in the clinical assessment of children's behavior problems and has been extensively used in research. Eight syndrome scales are further grouped into Externalizing or undercontrolled (Aggressive and Delinquent) behavior and Internalizing or overcontrolled (Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, and Withdrawn) behaviors. Three syndromes (Social, Thought, and Attention Problems) fit neither group. Higher scores are associated with more problem behaviors. Research assistants who were trained and blinded to exposure status independently interviewed the child and caretaker. Data were collected on a broad range of control variables known to influence childhood behavior and/or to be associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. These included perinatal factors of maternal age, education, cigarette, cocaine, and other substances of abuse and the gestational age of the baby. Postnatal factors studied included maternal psychopathology, continuing alcohol and drug use, family structure, socioeconomic status, children's whole blood lead level, and exposure to violence. Data were collected only from black women as there was inadequate representation of other racial groups.
   Statistical Analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package. Frequency distribution, cross-tabulation, odds ratio, and chi (2) tests were used for analyzing categorical data. Continuous data were analyzed using t tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with posthoc tests, and regression analysis.
   Results. Testing was available for 501 parent-children dyads. Almost one fourth of the women denied alcohol use during pregnancy. Low levels of alcohol use were reported in 63.8% and moderate/heavy use in 13% of pregnancies. Increasing prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with lower birth weight and gestational age, higher lead levels, higher maternal age, and lower education level, prenatal exposure to cocaine and smoking, custody changes, lower socioeconomic status, and paternal drinking and drug use at the time of pregnancy. Children with any prenatal alcohol exposure were more likely to have higher CBCL scores on Externalizing (Aggressive and Delinquent) and Internalizing (Anxious/Depressed and Withdrawn) syndrome scales and the Total Problem Score. The odds ratio of scoring in the clinical range for Delinquent behavior was 3.2 (1.3-7.6) in children with any prenatal exposure to alcohol compared with nonexposed controls. The threshold dose was evaluated with the 3 prenatal alcohol exposure groups. One-way ANOVA revealed a significant between group difference for Externalizing (Aggressive and Delinquent) and the Total Problem Score. Posthoc tests revealed the between group differences to be significant (no and low-exposure group) for Aggressive and Externalizing behavior suggesting that the adverse effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on child behavior at age 6 to 7 years are evident even at low levels of exposure. For Delinquent and Total Problem behavior, the difference was significant between the no and moderate-heavy exposure group, suggesting a higher threshold for these behaviors. Prenatal alcohol exposure remained a significant predictor of behavior after adjusting for covariates. Although maternal psychopathology was the most important predictor of behavior, gender was also a significant predictor, with boys having higher scores on Externalizing (Delinquent) and Attention Problems. The amount of variance uniquely accounted for by prenatal alcohol exposure ranged between 0.6% to 1.7%.
   Conclusions. Maternal alcohol consumption even at low levels was adversely related to child behavior; a dose-response relationship was also identified. The effect was observed at average levels of exposure of as low as 1 drink per week. Although effects on mean scores for Externalizing and Aggressive behaviors were observed at low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure, effects on Delinquent behavior and Total Problem Scores were observed at moderate/heavy levels of exposure. Children with any prenatal alcohol exposure were 3.2 times as likely to have Delinquent behavior scores in the clinical range compared with nonexposed children. The relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and adverse childhood behavior outcome persisted after controlling for other factors associated with adverse behavioral outcomes. Clinicians are often asked by pregnant women if small amounts of alcohol intake are acceptable during pregnancy. These data suggest that no alcohol during pregnancy remains the best medical advice.

AB In this article. the authors present data from two longitudinal studies starting long before German reunification in East and West Germany. After unification, 533 twenty-five-year-olds and their parents were interviewed about mental health status, experience of life events and difficulties, and social support. The findings show that (a) externalizing disorders were more common in West Germany. whereas internalizing disorders were more common in East Germany: (b) there was a generation-specific differential course of disorders in East Germany after unification; and (c) the detrimental effect of life events and chronic difficulties on mental health could be weakened by kin and nonkin social support.

AB Objective: The authors assessed the longterm consequences of the SCUD missile attack in Israel on children as a function of their mothers' psychological functioning, family cohesion, and the event itself.
   Method: Five years after the Gulf War, the authors assessed the internalizing, externalizing, stress, and posttraumatic symptoms of 81 children aged 8-10 years whose homes were damaged in the SCUD missile attack, as well as general and posttraumatic symptoms, defensive style, and object relations in their mothers.
   Results: There was a significant decrease in severity in most symptom domains and an increase in avoidant symptoms in the children. Greater severity of symptoms was associated with being displaced, living in a family with inadequate cohesion, and having a mother with poor psychological functioning. The association between the symptoms of children and mothers was stronger among the younger children. Posttraumatic symptoms increased in one-third of the children and decreased in one-third over the last 30 months of the study. Severe posttraumatic symptoms were reported in 8% of the children.
   Conclusions: Despite a continuous decrease in symptom severity, risk factors identified shortly after the Gulf War continued to exert their influence on children 5 years after the traumatic exposure.

AB This article provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical basis of parent management training (PMT), the fundamental treatment characteristics of PMT, outcome findings fur PMT, and process issues pertinent to PMT Effectiveness. PMT involves teaching parents to understand a child's behavior in terms of its antecedents and consequences. Subsequently, parents are coached to develop prosocial behavior in the child by using reinforcement, extinction, and punishment. Significant attention is paid to methods designed to improve structure in the home and the nature of the parent-child relationship. Outcome findings strongly support the efficacy of PMT for treatment of conduct disorders, whereas more modest results have been found for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and internalizing disorders. More recently PMT has been used in preventive efforts with promising outcome results. Limitations on the benefits of PMT are noted for situations in which the parents are experiencing stress and competing influences that inhibit their ability to attend to and respond in a timely and appropriate manner to parenting tasks.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relation of different types of negative emotion and regulation and control to 55- to 97-month-olds' internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Parents and teachers provided information on children's (N = 214) adjustment, dispositional regulation and control, and emotion, and children's regulation was observed during several behavioral tasks. Internalizing was defined in two ways: as social withdrawal (to avoid overlap of items with measures of emotionality) or, more broadly, as anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. In general, children with externalizing problems, compared with children with internalizing problems and nondisordered children, were more prone to anger, impulsivity, and low regulation. Children with internalizing symptoms were prone to sadness, low attentional regulation, and low impulsivity Relations between internalizing problems and emotionality were more frequent when the entire internalizing scale was used. Findings suggest that emotion and regulation are associated with adjustment in systematic ways and that there is an important difference between effortful control and less voluntary modes of control.

AB To examine psychological and behavioral correlates of community violence exposure in psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents, 89 inpatients were administered a battery of psychometrically well-established self-report instruments, Violence exposure was assessed using the Child's Exposure to Violence Checklist (CEVC), Half of the patients reported exposure to multiple incidents violence in their community (52%) and home (53%). Sixty-one percent were victims of physical assault, and 39% were victims of sexual assault. Patients who had witnessed community violence reported significantly more post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, drug use, and violence potential than patients without a history of witnessing community violence. Patients exposed to community violence were also more likely to be the victim of childhood maltreatment, as well as a perpetrator of violence. In conclusion, traumatization via exposure to community violence may serve as one important determinant in the development of mixed internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in adolescent inpatients, thus necessitating accurate assessment and treatment planning.

AB The goal of the present study was to examine the relations between different forms of children's nonsocial play behaviors and adjustment in kindergarten. The participants in this study were 77 kindergarten children (38 boys, 39 girls; mean age = 66.16 months, SD = 4.11 months). Mothers completed ratings of child shyness and emotion dysregulation. Children's nonsocial play behaviors (reticent, solitary-passive, solitary-active) were observed during free play. In addition, teachers rated child behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing) and social competence; academic achievement was assessed through child interviews. Results from regression analyses revealed that different types of nonsocial play were differentially associated with child characteristics and indices of adjustment. For some forms of nonsocial play, the nature of these associations differed significantly for boys and girls.

AB The relations between mothers' expressed positive and negative emotion and 55-79-month-olds' (76% European American) regulation, social competence, and adjustment were examined. Structural equation modeling was used to test the plausibility of the hypothesis that the effects of maternal expression of emotion on children's adjustment and social competence are mediated through children's dispositional regulation. Mothers' expressed emotions were assessed during interactions with their children and with maternal reports of emotions expressed in the family. Children's regulation, externalizing and internalizing problems, and social competence were rated by parents and teachers, and children's persistence was surreptitiously observed. There were unique effects of positive and negative maternal expressed emotion on children's regulation, and the relations of maternal expressed emotion to children's externalizing problem behaviors and social competence were mediated through children's regulation. Alternative models of causation were tested; a child-directed model in which maternal expressivity mediated the effects of child regulation on child outcomes did not fit the data as well.

Results indicated that maternal depression significantly moderated the relation between emotional autonomy and adolescent adjustment. Among offspring of depressed mothers, higher levels of emotional autonomy (detachment) significantly predicted increases in internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas among offspring of nondepressed mothers, higher levels of emotional autonomy significantly predicted decreases in adolescents' symptoms. Within families of depressed mothers, family dysfunction significantly predicted adolescent symptoms, and this relation was partially mediated through emotional autonomy. These results further highlight the importance of considering the family context in studies of adolescent autonomy.

Several processes are considered. including peer rejection (e.g., exclusion and victimization), social withdrawal and avoidance of peer interaction. and the socialization of deviant behavior and internalizing problems. The mediating influences of several proximal components are examined, including cognitive-perceptual factors and emotion regulation. In addition, the moderating influences of close friendship. age, gender, ethnicity, and group norms are considered. Several promising avenues for future directions in research are highlighted, including the examination of heterogeneity in developmental processes. further investigation of gender-based norms. and the application of multi-level modeling techniques and gene-environment process models.

AB The present study investigated longitudinal pathways from specific early preschool behavioral problems (ages 2-3 years) to internalizing and externalizing problems in preadolescence (ages 10-11 years), and the role of social problems at school entry (ages 4-5 years) in such pathways. Path analyses were performed using both parent and teacher reports in a sample of 251 to 346 children from the general population. depending on the availability of parent and teacher data at each time of assessment. Structural equation modeling revealed homotypic internalizing and externalizing pathways, predictions from early preschool externalizing problems to later internalizing problems. and negative predictive paths from early internalizing problems to externalizing problems in preadolescence. Cross-informant predictions spanning 8 years were found between parent-reported aggression and overactivity at ages 2-3 years and teacher- reported externalizing problems at ages 10- 11 years. Further. results showed that boys' pathways were more complex and showed greater predictive validity than pathways for girls, and that social problems at school entry played a significant role in pathways to internalizing problems, but only for boys. The results are discussed from a developmental psychopathology perspective.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effects of behavioral, family-based treatment on disordered eating and child behavior problems for obese 8- to 12-year-old children.
   Study design: We examined disordered eating in children and parents using the Kids' Eating Disorder Survey (KEDS) and the Binge Eating Scale, respectively; and psychologic problems in children and their parents using the Child Behavior Checklist and Symptom Checklist-90, respectively, in 47 families who participated in a family-based obesity treatment program.
   Results: Obese children showed significant decreases (-12.5 +/- 13.5) in percent overweight, internalizing problems (-7.0 +/-7.3), and total behavior problems (-4.8 +/-6.6) and increases in behavioral competence (3.7 +/-5.0) over 2 years of measurement; and their parents showed significant decreases in weight (-5.0 +/- 8.3 kg) and reductions in parental distress (-2.3 +/-7.6) and in disturbed eating and weight-related cognition (-3.2 +/-5.3). No significant changes were observed in total KEDS (-0.2 +/-1.9), weight dissatisfaction (-0.3 +/-1.7), or purging/restricting (0.2 +/-0.6) scores. Decreases in total KEDS were related to decreases in total behavior problems and externalizing behavior problems.
   Conclusions: These results document improvements in child behavior problems and competence and no change in symptoms of disordered eating in a standardized behavioral weight control program.

AB Objective: This study examined behavioral and emotional problems in Chinese adolescents. Method: A sample of 1,694 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years participated in this study in 1997. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Results: For both parent and teacher reports. internalizing syndromes were scored higher in girls and externalizing syndromes were scored higher in boys. Scores on most of the CBCL and TRF subscales were higher for the older adolescents. The overall prevalence rates of parent- and teacher-reported behavioral problems were 23.1% and 19.2%, respectively. The eight cross-informant syndromes were highly comorbid, with a significant association across syndromes (mean odds ratio = 16.1 for CBCL and 22.5 for TRF). Correlations between parent and teacher reports were 0.51 for eight subscales and 0.68 for Total Problems. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that behavioral and emotional problems tend to increase with age and cluster in the same individuals. The prevalence rates of behavioral problems in Chinese adolescents are comparable to those reported in Western countries. In contrast to findings for Western samples, parent reports of behavioral problems were highly correlated with teacher reports.

AB Objective. Returning children to their biological families after placement in foster care (ie, reunification) has been prioritized with legislation. Comprehensive studies of child behavioral health functioning after reunification, however, have not been conducted. This study examined outcomes for youth who were reunified after placement in foster care as compared with youth who did not reunify.
   Design. Prospective cohort.
   Setting. Children who entered foster care in San Diego, California, and who remained in foster care for at least 5 months.
   Participants. A cohort of 149 ethnically diverse youth, 7 to 12 years old, who entered foster care between May 1990, and October 1991. Seventy-five percent of those interviewed at Time 1 were interviewed at Time 2 (6 years later).
   Outcome Measures. 1) Risk behaviors: delinquent, sexual, self-destructive, substance use, and total risk behaviors; 2) Life-course outcomes: pregnancy, tickets/arrests, suspensions, dropping out of school, and grades; 3) Current symptomatology: externalizing, internalizing, total behavior problems, and total competence.
   Results. Compared with youth who were not reunified, reunified youth showed more self-destructive behavior (0.15 vs -0.11), substance use (0.16 vs -0.11), and total risk behavior problem standardized scores (0.12 vs -0.09). Reunified youth were more likely to have received a ticket or have been arrested (49.2% vs 30.2%), to have dropped out of school (20.6% vs 9.4%), and to have received lower grades (6.5 vs 7.4). Reunified youth reported more current problems in internalizing behaviors (56.6 vs 53.0), and total behavior problems (59.5 vs 55.7), and lower total competence (41.1 vs 45.0). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on delinquency, sexual behaviors, pregnancy, suspensions, or externalizing behaviors. Reunification status was a significant predictor of negative outcomes in 8 of the 9 regression equations after controlling for Time 1 behavior problems, age, and gender.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that youth who reunify with their biological families after placement in foster care have more negative outcomes than youth who do not reunify. The implications of these findings for policy and practice are discussed.

ID RISK; STUDENTS
AB Three separate studies focusing on convergent and discriminant validity evidence for the Home and Community Social Behavior Scales are presented. The HCSBS is a 65-item social behavior rating scale for use by parents and caretakers of children and youth ages 5-18. It is a parent-rating version of the School Social Behavior Scales. Within these studies, relationships with five behavior-rating scales were examined: the Social Skills Rating System. Conners parent Rating Scale-Revised-Short Form. Child Behavior Checklist, and the child and adolescent versions of the Behavior Assessment System for Children. HCSBS Scale A, Social Competence. evidenced strong positive correlations with measures of social skills and adaptability, strong negative correlations with measures of externalizing behavior problems, and modest negative correlations with measures of internalizing and atypical behavior problems. HCSBS Scale B. Antisocial Behavior. evidenced strong positive correlations with measures of externalizing behavior problems, modest positive correlations with measures of internalizing and atypical behavior problems. and strong negative correlations with measures of social skills and adaptability These results support the HCSBS as a measure of social competence and antisocial behavior of children and youth.

TI Family interactions of alcoholics as related to alcoholism type and

SO ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE sequential analysis; family dyad interactions; antisocial alcoholics
ID MARITAL INTERACTIONS; COMMUNICATION; STABILITY; PATTERNS; COUPLES;
   SUBTYPE; ABUSE; WIVES
AB Background: Several studies have reported that the marital interactions of antisocial and aggressive, versus nonantisocial and nonaggressive, alcoholics exhibit higher rates of aversive-defensive communications and higher levels of negative reciprocity. To extend these findings, we examined the effect of alcoholism type (high- versus low-antisocial alcoholics: HAS, LAS) and drinking condition on family communication patterns.
   Methods: Marital and parent-child dyads from 100 alcoholic families were videotaped while they discussed personally relevant issues during drinking and no-drinking sessions (no children were offered any alcohol). All interactions were coded with the Marital Interaction Coding System, and the data were assessed for differences in rate of positive, negative, and problem-solving behaviors, as well as sequential structures.
   Results: HAS couples were more negative during the drink versus no-drink condition, whereas drinking did not affect negativity for LAS couples. In addition, the negative communications of HAS versus LAS alcoholics were more likely to increase spouse negativity during the drink versus no-drink condition. Group differences for parent-child interactions were few.
   Conclusions: The nature of family interactions was related to both alcoholism type and alcohol consumption, and the marital interactions of alcoholism types could be differentiated on the basis of the frequency and sequential structure of negative exchanges. It is most important to note that it is the interactions of the HAS alcoholic that undergo the most change as a function of drinking condition, with little support for the "adaptive consequences" hypothesis that alcohol consumption leads to more effective problem-solving for couples in which the alcoholic exhibits fewer antisocial and more internalizing characteristics. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

AB We compared psychiatric disorders and problem behavior scores in pre-adolescent children of fathers with alcohol or other drug dependence and ASP (SD+/ASP+), children whose fathers had substance dependence without ASP (SD+/ASP-), and children whose fathers were without either disorder (SD-/ASP-). SD+/ASP+ children showed elevated rates of major depression, conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and separation anxiety disorder when compared to SD+/ASP- and SD-/ASP- children. SD+/ASP+ children had higher internalizing and externalizing problem behavior scores than the other two groups of children. The results suggest that SD+/ASP+ children are at significant risk for internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.

AB In the present study we examined the longitudinal effects of an early attachment-based intervention on children's social development, personality development, and incidence of behaviour problems at age 7. The behaviourally focused intervention was carried out in families with internationally, transracially adopted children placed before 6 months of age. The intervention was implemented during the child's first year of life in mixed families (i.e, adoptive families with biological children) and in all-adoptive families (i.e. adoptive families without biological children). In the small sample of mixed families (N = 35), we found delayed positive intervention effects at age 7 on ego-resiliency and optimal ego-control in girls, and on internalizing behaviour problems in both boys and girls. In all-adoptive families (N = 112), the intervention had been effective in changing maternal sensitive responsiveness, security of attachment, and infant exploratory competence in early childhood, but enduring intervention effects could not be traced at the child's age of 7.

Parents (n = 41) of children with nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, or kidney transplant completed family environment and child behavior questionnaires. Medical indicators (utilization and medications) were collected from medical records. A model including child age, diagnostic group, and family environment variables successfully predicted all outcomes except internalizing behavior. Higher family conflict predicted more externalizing symptoms and higher number of prescribed medications; higher family cohesion predicted fewer hospitalizations. Nontraditional family structure predicted higher number of prescribed medications. Results are discussed as they relate to a stress and resistance framework. need for research on direction of effect, and clinical recommendations.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine adrenocortical activity (basal, diurnal variation, and responses to social stressors) in adolescents at risk for psychopathology. Salivary cortisol levels were examined in normally developing and at-risk youth with internalizing and externalizing symptoms ranging from subclinical to clinical levels. Adolescents showed expected patterns of diurnal variation, with high early morning cortisol levels and a pattern of decline throughout the day. Females showed higher midday and late afternoon levels than mates, and these patterns interacted with risk status. Internalizing problems sometimes were associated with gradual rather than steep declines in basal cortisol production. Both immediate and delayed cortisol reactivity to a social performance stressor were associated with internalizing symptoms. There was no evidence of relations between externalizing problems and underarousal of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. These and other results suggest that gender is an important moderating factor linking psychopathology, development, and context with HPA axis functioning in adolescence.

AB Discusses the increased public attention on violence-related problems among youth and the concomitant increased diversity in research. Youth violence involvement is a complex construct that includes violence experienced in multiple settings (home, school, neighborhood) and in multiple forms las victims, witnesses, perpetrators, and through family members, friends, and the medial. Potential impacts of such violence involvement are considerable, including increased internalizing and externalizing behaviors among youth and future problems in school adjustment and life-course development. This introductory article reviews key dimensions of youth-related violence, describes an American Psychological Association Task Force (Division 12) developed to advance relevant research, and presents examples of national resources and efforts that attempt to address this critical public health issue.

AB Used multiple methods and measures (i.e., youth report, psychiatric interviews, psychophysiological assessment) to investigate the emotional and behavioral impacts of exposure to community violence. Participants were 185 inner-city high school students (M age = 15.4 years; 42% female; 90% African American). Youth with high levels of community violence exposure reported more fears, anxiety, internalizing behavior and negative life experiences than those with low: exposure. No depression or externalizing behavior differences were observed In a psychophysiological assessment in which adolescents watched a montage of media violence. youth exposed to high levels of community violence had lower baseline heart rates than those with low exposure. There were no between-group differences in physiologic reactivity Regression analyses revealed that community violence exposure predicted posttraumatic stress and separation anxiety symptoms. The results suggest a significant link between community violence exposure and anxiety symptomatology Clinical implications are discussed.

AB Investigated children's responses for coping with overt and relational aggression. Children in Grades 3 through 6 (N = 491) in a rural Midwestern public school district completed a survey designed to assess how students cope M,hen they are the targets of peer aggression. Children endorsed greater use of internalizing and distancing strategies for coping with relational aggression and greater use of externalizing strategies for coping with overt aggression. In addition, older children reported greater use of externalizing and less use of internalizing and distancing strategies than younger children. Significant differences were also found between boys and girls. Regardless of type of aggression, girls endorsed greater use of problem-solving and support strategies and less use of externalizing strategies than boys. Coping of high target children and of children who frequently received prosocial treatment from peers were also examined.

AB Mothers, fathers, and their 6-year-old children (N = 164) participated in a study testing key tenets of the specific emotions model of marital conflict. Parents reported their marital conflict strategies, were observed interacting with their children, and rated children's behavioral adjustment. Children reported their emotional reactions to specific interparental conflicts. Results support the specific emotions model. Children's behaviors mirrored the marital or parental behaviors of same-gender parents. Indirect effects of marital aggression through parental behavior were detected, and marital and parental behaviors interacted to predict girls' externalizing. Girls' anger, sadness, and fear increased with fathers' marital aggression. Fear and the anger by fear interaction predicted girls' internalizing. Fathers' marital aggression interacted with anger to predict externalizing and interacted with fear to predict internalizing behavior in boys.

AB We investigated the association between parental factors (including infection with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] diagnosis, parental medical illness, and depression) and children's behavioral and emotional problems among children of injection drug users (IDUs). IDUs were recruited through community outreach. The sample included 73 parents of 73 children, aged 4 to 12 years. Parental depression (odds ratio [OR] = 4.61) and medical illness (OR = 4.70) were found to be significantly associated with internalizing (depressive and anxiety-related symptoms), but not with externalizing (aggressive and disruptive behaviors) symptoms in the children of IDUs. The clinical implications are that children of IDUs are known to be at high risk for psychiatric symptoms and disorders; these data suggest that children of depressed and/or medically ill IDU parents may be at even higher risk of internalizing symptoms (depression and anxiety symptoms) than children of IDUs who do not suffer from these conditions.

AB The aim of the study, was to elucidate the relative contribution to and function of general risk factors for mental disorders as well as compensatory, vulnerability, and protective factors in a general population sample of preadolescent and adolescent students. Data were collected in a representative sample of 1,110 (10 to 17 year-old) subjects of a school-based quota sample in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. The factors under study were assessed using questionnaires. The Youth Self Report (YSR) was used as an indicator of emotional and behavioral abnormalities. Further questionnaires were concerned with life events, coping strategies, self-esteem, self-awareness, parental child-rearing behaviors, the school environment, and the social network, General risk factors for both sexes included increased self-awareness, avoidance behavior, perceived rejection by the parents, competitive behavior among classmates, and controlling behavior of the teachers. General compensatory factors included self-esteem and acceptance by the parents. Performance stress served as a risk factor for internalizing disorders in both sexes; for externalizing disorders it was a risk factor in girls and a vulnerability factor in boys. Active coping and peer acceptance were protective factors for internalizing disorders and peer acceptance was also a compensatory factor for externalizing disorders. In addition, some gender-specific interactions were identified.

AB Background: The study examines the associations of parent, teacher and self-report evaluations of child psychopathology, help-seeking variables and family factors with the use of child mental health services. Method: The study comprised an 8-year follow-up of the Epidemiological Child Psychiatry Study in Finland. Children were evaluated at age 8 with Rutter parent and teacher scales and with the Child Depression Inventory, and at age 16, with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self Report. Information was obtained from about 70 % of the follow-up sample (n=857). Results. About 7 % of the sample had been in contact with child mental health services during the follow-up. The most potent predictors at age 8 of later referral were total problem behaviours and antisocial problems in parental evaluation, teacher's evaluation of the child's need for referral and living in other than a biological two-parent family. At age 16, externalizing and internalizing problems, total competence and family composition were independently associated with service use. Conclusions: Both child psychopathology and family disruption were associated with service use. Only a minority of children at risk of psychiatric disorders had used child mental health services.

AB Recent case reports of individuals with early-onset damage to the prefrontal cortex have suggested that such early insults could result in severely impaired social behaviour in later childhood and adolescence. The investigators speculated that the acquisition of complex social conventions and moral rules had been impaired, In a large cohort of children, we sought to determine whether early focal brain insults might result in clinically significant behavioural or emotional problems. This study reports on 39 children with pre- or perinatal-onset unilateral brain damage (focal lesion) from cerebral infarction or intraparenchymal haemorrhage, using the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist to assess the presence or absence of behavioural and emotional difficulties. Two-thirds of the subjects had left hemisphere (LH) lesions and one-third had right hemisphere (RH) lesions, Age range was 4.0-15.4 years at the time of questionnaire completion. Their results were compared with those of 54 control children. Analyses were conducted on focal lesion versus controls, RH versus LH lesion, frontal versus non-frontal lesion, and seizure versus non-seizure groups. When the effect of IQ was partialled out, there were no significant differences on the nine Behavior Problem scales, the Internalizing-Externalizing dichotomy or the Total Problem score for any of the group comparisons. Our subjects showed no evidence of clinically significant behavioural or emotional problems, even when the frontal lobe was involved. Individuals with more extensive and bilateral damage may be at higher risk of significant behavioural and emotional dysfunction than were those in our study population. In future studies of brain-behaviour relationships in developing children, all potential causes for any observed behavioural abnormalities, such as genetic and environmental factors and toxin exposure, must be considered before concluding that specific anatomical lesions are causally related to specific behavioural outcomes.

AB The development of behaviour problems in infants born with biological risk (low birthweight) and psychosocial risk (psychosocially disadvantaged family) was studied in a sample of 347 children (171 males, 176 females) at the ages of 2, 4:6, and 8 years. In the search for factors that moderate the effects of early risks, the role of early responsive caregiving was examined. Results indicate that infants at psychosocial risk exhibited both more externalizing and internalizing problems across ages than infants not at psychosocial risk, while no overall differences were apparent between normal- and low-birthweight groups. With one exception, no interactions between biological and psychosocial risk factors emerged, suggesting that their simultaneous effect is largely additive. Maternal responsivity was found to moderate the effects of low birthweight on hyperkinetic and internalizing problems as well as to influence the consequences of family disadvantage on total problems. These findings stress the importance of early parenting in the behavioural development of at-risk children.

D. Cole, K. A. Dodge, and H. Coppotelli's (CDC; 1982) sociometric categories; and (c) compare these groups regarding their longitudinal trajectories of antisocial, hyperactive, and anxious behavior. Based on 299 children, 3 groups were identified: a stable popular group, a stable average group, and an unpopular group whose social preference decreased over time. Each of the groups showed considerable overlap over time with their closest corresponding CDC category (popular, average, rejected). Growth curve analyses showed that externalizing and internalizing behavior generally decreased over time, but overall means and the rates of decrease differed in the 3 groups.

AB We tested the hypothesis that there are three major prototypic patterns of personality description (resilient, overcontrolled, and undercontrolled) in a series of studies including adults' self-descriptions on the Big Five and parents' Big Five and Q-Sort judgments of their childern, using both replicated cluster analyses and replicated Q-factor analyses. The consistency of the prototypes across ages, judges, and methods was quantitatively measured. The results confirmed the hypothesis in all studies. Personality social relationship, and social interaction correlates of the prototypes indicated externalizing tendencies for undercontrollers and internalizing tendencies for overcontrollers for both childern and adults. The studies provide strong evidence for a three-prototype model of personality description at the highest level of analysis for both childhood and adulthood.

AB This overview outlines the magnitude of the impact of parental substance abuse on children's development. The aim of this special issue is described: to encourage research productivity by promoting integration between two traditionally separate literatures with quite different theoretical perspectives: (1) the effects of prenatal substance exposure; and (2) the impact on children of postnatal rearing by parents addicted to substances. Because study of the developmental impact of parental alcohol use has a long research tradition, lessons learned can guide the field. Thus, this overview focuses on the role of maternal drinking in the emergence of childhood psychopathology, a topic of interest to infant mental health. As an example, this article features multiple findings from O'Connor's programmatic research, which is built upon current models of development and integrated theoretical perspectives, and includes both lower and higher risk samples. These data show that women in a middle-class sample who drank more heavily during pregnancy had infants with higher levels of negative affect and insecure attachments. At ages 5-6, a greater percentage of these alcohol-exposed children showed significant levels of depression than expected for their age. Prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal depression both contributed significantly to prediction of preschoolers' depression, and findings could not be explained by mother's current drinking. Congruent results from a higher risk sample show how cumulative risk can exacerbate problems, and extend earlier data by documenting the mother-child interplay that can maintain or reduce the deleterious effects of prenatal alcohol exposure over time. Results are discussed in light of current theory about the early emergence of internalizing disorders, with implications for research and intervention. This overview ends by introducing the articles in this special issue, and how each contributes to advancing its aim.

AB This study examined the association between paternal alcoholism and 12-month infant temperament and 18-month behavior problems. The role of associated parental psychopathology and maternal drinking in exacerbating risk for maladaptive behavioral outcomes was also examined. Participants were 213 families (102 control families, 94 paternal alcoholic families, and 17 families with alcoholic fathers and heavy drinking mothers) who were assessed when their child was 12 months old and reassessed again when their child was 18 months old. Infants of alcoholics displayed marginally more stubborn/persistent temperaments at 12 months of age, but significantly more internalizing problems at 18 months. Analyses suggested that internalizing problems in the infants of alcoholics could be attributed to the paternal depression concomitant with paternal alcoholism. In addition, an interaction was observed, indicating that paternal alcohol problems predicted 18-month externalizing problems among families with low maternal depression, but not among families with high maternal depression. Children of depressed mothers exhibited uniformly higher externalizing scores, but were not further impacted by paternal alcohol problems. However, children of nondepressed mothers were adversely affected by fathers' drinking as reflected by higher externalizing behavior scores. The results highlight the necessity of addressing the overall contextual risks that occur with paternal alcoholism in studies of the development of children in alcoholic families.

AB This study investigated whether the relationships between dimensions of early child temperament and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems differ in relation to the degree of parental psychopathology to which children are exposed. Tn addition, the reciprocal relation between externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, and stability patterns (i.e., autoregression) of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems were investigated using a two-group structural model. A sample of 215 boys (mean age = 4.22) and their parents were assessed when the boys were 3-5 years old and again when they were 6-8 years old. For the children of parents with two or more lifetime psychopathology diagnoses, high activity, short attention span/distractibility, and high reactivity were linked to extemalizing behavior problems, whereas withdrawal was linked to internalizing behavior problems. For children from low parental psychopathology families, only reactivity was linked to externalizing behavior problems, whereas withdrawal was linked to internalizing behavior problems. Children from high parental psychopathology families (alcohol use disorder and antisocial personality disorder) showed lower stability (autoregression) estimates of behavior problems. The reciprocal relation between externalizing and internalizing behavior problems was supported when children were 6-8 years old, but not when they were 3-5 years old.

AB The present study examined psychiatric functioning in a community sample of adolescents aged 14 to 17 years (average age of 15 years). We administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule fur Children - 2.25 (DISC-2.25) to 1201 adolescents and their mothers to obtain prevalence estimates of DSM-III-R disorders and the amount of perceived impairment associated with these disorders. While adolescent females reported a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders than males (15.5 % vs. 8.5 %), mothers indicated no sex difference. Compared with adolescent males. females had significantly higher rates of internalizing, anxiety, and depressive disorders. In contrast, the prevalence of externalizing disorders was significantly higher among adolescent males. The inclusion of an impairment criterion had a significant impact in reducing the prevalence rates of overall psychiatric disorders. This reduction occurred mainly through impairment's effects un internalizing disorders, specifically anxiety-based disorders (i.e., simple and social phobia). Given the limited research on the effect of impairment on the prevalence of adolescent psychiatric disorders, future work in this area seems warranted.

Mothers reported on children's behavior problems, sibling conflict resolution strategies, and the quality of the sibling relationship, Children reported on the quality of their sibling relationships, Sibling interactions were observed during both cooperative and competitive tasks. Shelter children had more internalizing problems than comparison children did. Mothers reported that siblings from violent homes used less verbal and physical aggression than the comparison group. Siblings in the shelter group were supportive. There were no significant differences in observed conflictual behavior. The importance of the sibling relationship and implications for intervention are discussed. (C) 2001 John Wiley (C) Sons, Inc.

AB This study assessed thr temporal stability and convergent validity of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC). Teachers and parents rated 85 nonclinical kindergarten and fir st-grade students over a 6-month interval with the BASC and the Social Skills Rating System. Teachers were more stable than parents in rating children's externalizing behaviors and attention problems. Significant associations were found between the two rating systems' adaptive and clinical scales, and negative associations between the School Problems and Internalizing scales with standardized math and reading scores. The Externalizing Composite was negatively related to classroom conduct. Results are discussed in terms of the accuracy of information provided by different informants in social-emotional assessments of early school-age children.

AB Objective: To assess lifetime and current psychiatric disorders at least 1 year after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children and adolescents. Method: Forty-six youths who sustained a TBI between the ages of 6 through 15 years were evaluated at least 1 year post-TBI to identify the presence of lifetime and/or novel psychiatric disorders. Semistructured interviews of the parent and child and standardized parent self report rating instruments were used. Results: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depressive disorders were the most common lifetime and novel diagnoses. A wide variety and high rate of never psychiatric disorders were identified; 74% of these disorders persisted in 48% of the injured children. Internalizing disorders were more likely to resolve than externalizing disorders; Both interviews and parent ratings were Sensitive to current externalizing behaviors; interviews more often detected internalizing disorders, whereas parent ratings also identified cognitive difficulties. Conclusions: Findings were generally consistent with previous research demonstrating the high rate of novel psychiatric disorders following pediatric TBI. Psychiatric interviews were Sensitive in identifying both lifetime and novel disorders.

TI Risk domains associated with an adolescent alcohol dependence diagnosis
SO ADDICTION
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; PERSONALITY; AGREEMENT; CHILDREN; AGE
AB Aims. To determine the contribution of familial, interpersonal, academic and early substance use factors to relative risk for an alcohol dependence (AD) diagnosis in adolescents. Methods. Information on 619 adolescents and their 390 sets of biological parents was obtained using the adolescent version of the Child Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (C-SSAGA) and the adult counterpart of this instrument, the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA). The C-SSAGA elicits a wide range of environmental, social, and psychiatric diagnostic information. Specific domain scale scores associated with an adolescent AD were computed, and generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling was used to determine the odds ratio (relative risk) of the specified risk domains for an alcohol dependence diagnosis. Findings. Risk factors for a DSM-III-R AD diagnosis included being at least 16 years of age, as well as negative parent-child interactions, school and personal-related difficulties (including the presence of an externalizing or internalizing DSM-III- R non-alcohol-related diagnosis), and early experimentations with a variety of substances. Conclusions. An array of familial, interpersonal, academic and early substance use factors were strongly associated with adolescent AD. Given the findings of this study, further research to determine temporal relationships that might influence the onset of adolescent alcohol dependence is warranted.

AB This paper examines the psychometric properties of the Children's Somatization Inventory (CSI) in 600 10-12-year old children in Kyiv, Ukraine, replicating and extending the original findings from a sample in Nashville, Tennessee (J. Garber et al. 1991). The Kyiv children had significantly lower CSI total scores and reported significantly fewer symptoms than the American children. The Kyiv mothers, however, reported significantly more somatization symptoms in their children than did the American mothers. A factor analysis of the children's data yielded four similar factors encompassing pseudoneurologic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and pain/weakness symptoms. Consistent with the findings from the Nashville study, the CSI was significantly related to the children's self-reports of health and depressive and anxiety symptoms and to maternal reports of child depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, although more children with the highest CSI scores (25+) reported various illness experiences than those with 0-1 symptoms, no differences were found in the school absentee records. Thus, the results were congruent with the findings of the Nashville study, indicating that the CSI reliably measured somatization in this Ukrainian sample.

AB The authors examined the specificity of the relation between 3 types of control-related beliefs and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in a sample of 290 clinic-referred children aged 7 to 17 years. Self-reported beliefs about control (the capacity to cause an intended outcome), contingency (the degree to which a desired outcome can be controlled by a relevant behavior), and competence (an individual's ability to produce the relevant behavior) across 3 domains (academic, behavioral, and social) showed more specific relations with psychopathology than have been previously reported. Among children with externalizing psychopathology, internalizing psychopathology may be specifically associated with increased self-critical awareness about their conduct; externalizing psychopathology may attenuate the specific negative relation between internalizing psychopathology and control-related beliefs in the social domain.

AB Positive change was demonstrated on a number of self-report scales administered to 129 adolescents at a hospital-based substance abuse program, of whom 72 were posttested after 8 weeks. Female subjects showed change on more measures than male subjects, and a greater number of female subjects went from the clinical to subclinical range. Based on number of sessions attended, subjects were grouped by "dose" into either "hi-attenders" or "lo-attenders." A Trials (pretest/posttest) x Dose interaction revealed significant reduction in drug use at posttest for hi-attenders who were initially heavier users. Multiple regression analyses determined how well "comorbidity" predicted attendance and change in drug use. Although comorbidity failed to predict attendance consistently, male subjects who reported more internalizing symptomatology reduced their drug use to a greater extent than those low on this dimension, and female subjects who initially reported experiencing more family problems became more self-efficacious about future drug avoidance.

AB Objectives: To examine whether children with Navy mothers exhibit higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior than children in civilian families and whether deployment affects children's internalizing and externalizing behavior. Method: Navy mothers who experienced deployment completed a measure assessing children's internalizing and externalizing behavior before and after a deployment land at similar intervals for the Navy and civilian comparison groups). Data collection took place between 1996 and 1998. Results: Navy children with deployed mothers exhibited higher levels of internalizing behavior than children with nondeployed Navy mothers. Navy children whose mothers experienced deployment were more likely to exhibit clinical levels of internalizing behavior than Navy children with nondeployed mothers or civilian children. Group differences, however, were modest and overall mean scores were in the normal range. Conclusions: Findings do not suggest greater pathology in children of Navy mothers; however. findings do indicate we should be particularly attentive of deployed mothers and their children.

AB Objectives. There is mounting concern about how mothers' own victimization experiences affect their children. This study examines the effects of mothers' victimization on their own mental health and parenting and on their children's behavior, development, and health. The effects of both timing and type of victimization are assessed. A related objective was to determine if there was a cumulative risk effect produced by victimization during both childhood and adulthood, or both physical and sexual.
   Setting. Urban families in an eastern state and urban and rural families in a southern state.
   Participants. A total of 419 mothers and their children 6 to 7 years old were identified from 2 sites. The eastern sample was recruited in the first 2 years of life from 3 pediatric clinics: 1 for children at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus disease, 1 for children with failure to thrive, and a third providing pediatric primary care. The southern sample was derived from a cohort of children at risk for adverse health or developmental outcomes, plus a systematic sampling of controls, recruited from area hospitals. At age 4, a random sample of children from the original cohort who had been maltreated along with a matched comparison group of non-maltreated children were selected.
   Results. In general, mothers victimized during both childhood and adulthood had poorer outcomes than mothers victimized during either childhood/adolescence or adulthood who in turn had worse outcomes than mothers with no history of victimization. This manifested as more maternal depressive symptoms, harsher parenting, and more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in their children. There were no significant differences in maternal functioning or child outcomes between those abused in childhood and those abused in adulthood. These findings were similar for type of victimization. Mothers' depression and harsh parenting were directly associated with their children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.
   Conclusions. Maternal victimization appears to be a highly prevalent problem in high-risk samples and is associated with harmful implications for mental health and parenting, as well as for the offspring. Pediatricians need to consider past and current victimization of mothers. Routine screening for these problems, followed by appropriate evaluation and intervention may reduce maternal depression, improve parenting, and reduce the incidence of behavior problems in children.

AB We review the risk and protective factors for child physical abuse (CPA). An etiological model based on moderate to strongly supported risk factors would begin with distal perpetrator variables of being abused as a child/teen and receiving less family social support as a child. Next might come current family variables such as parents' youth, father's drinking, and family's living in a community that is impoverished and/or has a lower percentage of two parent families. More proximal variables that increase the probability of parents, especially mothers, employing severe or abusive physical tactics could include mothers' dysphoria (e.g., unhappiness, emotional distress, anxiety, loneliness and isolation, depression, somatic complaints, interpersonal problems, feelings of incompetence as a parent, a tendency toward becoming upset and angry), and stress (more stressful life events, including parenting and other family stresses) and coping (most likely a protective factor, including problem solving and social support). Finally, risk factors that are proximal to abuse could include mothers' high reactivity (impulsivity, high negative affect and autonomic nervous system arousal), high-risk parenting (harsh discipline strategies, verbal aggression, yelling), and negative attributions, and children's behavior problems (e.g., socialized aggression, attention deficits, and internalizing and externalizing problems).

AB Five-year-old children's moral development was assessed using a projective doll-play technique (the MacArthur Story Stem Battery; MSSB), an emotion-understanding task, concurrent maternal reports of behaviour problems and child performance in a cheating task. Three narrative scales were derived from the children's MSSB play themes: a non-physical punishment scale, a prosocial scale and an antisocial scale. The children's use of non-physical disciplining themes was related to their awareness of moral emotions. The antisocial and prosocial narrative scales were related to concurrent maternal ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems, respectively. Although the emotions children anticipated in the emotion-understanding task did not predict behaviour in the cheating task, their justifications for the different emotions tended to do so, as did the prosocial play narrative scale. The findings suggest a degree of coherence across the assessments of moral development, and are discussed with reference to children's script-based understanding.

AB This study examined how maternal distress mediates the link between exposure to community violence (CV) and the development of early child behavior problems. Research was conducted among 160 children, 3,0 to 5,11 in age, who resided in high-crime neighborhoods. Using structural equation modeling, latent variables were constructed to identify model components: maternal socioeconomic status (SES) and public assistance status, exposure to CV (maternal perceptions of local violence, social disorder, and fear of crime; and frequency of child cowitnessing violent events), family aggression (partner aggression toward mother and partner aggression toward child), maternal distress (global distress and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms), and early child behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing). Bivariate correlations indicated that CV, maternal distress, and early child behavior problems were significantly intercorrelated. A series of structural equation models was specified to estimate the direct and indirect effect of CV on early child behavior problems. A direct model indicated a significant path from CV to early child behavior problems, after controlling for maternal SES and family aggression. The direct CV-early child behavior problems path diminished, however, when maternal distress was included in the model, after controlling for maternal SES and family aggression. Results are consistent with a mediation model of the impact of maternal distress symptoms on the link between CV and early child behavior problems.

AB In the last decade, cardiac vagal tone has emerged as a psychophysiological marker of many aspects of behavioral functioning in both children and adults. Research efforts during this time have produced an extensive list of vagal tone correlates that includes temperamental variables as well as both anxious/internalizing and disruptive/externalizing behaviors. This potentially confusing state of affairs is compounded by developmental shifts in vagal tone-behavior relations that to date have not been elucidated. In this paper, the vagal tone literature is reviewed, and discrepancies, including the lack of specificity of vagal tone as a psychophysiological marker, are clarified. Such clarification requires that we (a) view vagal tone-behavior relations in developmental context, (b) juxtapose vagal tone-behavior relations in typical and atypical samples, and (c) consider the parasympathetic underpinnings of vagal tone as but one component in a broader model of autonomic nervous system functioning. Such a model is provided by combining Gray's motivational theory with Forges's polyvagal theory. Together these models account for behavioral and emotional differences in a diverse range of psychological disorders that are not differentiated by either model alone. Moreover, use of the integrated model offers a theory-driven approach to the study of autonomic nervous system-behavior relations.

AB This study tested whether adolescent internalizing problems, externalizing problems, heavy alcohol use, fathers' parenting, and family conflict varied over time with fluctuations in fathers' alcohol impairment and also whether children of recovered alcoholic fathers differed from children of nonalcoholic fathers. Fathers and adolescent children (N = 267 families) were interviewed in 3 annual assessments. Results showed that adolescent symptomatology and the family environment did not vary over time as a function of different trajectories of paternal alcohol impairment. However, children of recovered alcoholic fathers exhibited more symptomatology than did children of nonalcoholic fathers. Even though paternal alcoholism has remitted in these families, children of recovered alcoholic fathers might remain on a general higher risk trajectory relative to children of nonalcoholic fathers.

AB Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR) questionnaire is accepted worldwide for the assessment of adolescent competencies and behaviour problems. As with any similar instrument, it is liable to cultural influences, hence requires standardization for the culture in which it is to be used. This study reports on the standardization of the YSR in Greece, in a national school-based sample of 1456 high school students, 11-18 years of age. Responses at the item level seem to follow the culturally expected gender behaviour. Behaviour problem scale scores were not affected by degree of urbanization, reflecting a high degree of cultural homogeneity between urban and rural areas in Greece. Sex effects were important, with girls showing a greater tendency towards Internalizing and boys towards Externalizing Problems. Age effects were also statistically significant (older adolescents showing more problems, especially of the delinquent type), but numerically small. There was considerable correlation between Internalizing and Externalizing problems, with an odds ratio of 6.9 (95% confidence interval. 4.6-10.4) for exceeding both cut-offs. The analysis showed that Creek adolescents obtained significantly higher mean scores than their American counterparts on all scales. Cut-off points based on the 90th and 98th percentile developed from this sample are presented for the competencies and the problem scales.

AB Background: To study the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal behaviour among 580 adolescents. Methods: An 8-year longitudinal study included questions about suicidal attempts and thoughts at age 16. Children were evaluated with parent and teacher Rutter scales and self-reported Child Depression Inventory at age 8. At age 16, parents filled in the Child Behaviour Check List and adolescents the Youth Self Report. Results: 14% of girls and 7% of boys reported suicidal thoughts or preoccupations at age 16. Emotional and behavioural problems at age 8, especially antisocial symptoms, reported by parents and teachers and depressive symptoms reported by the child were correlated with suicidal thoughts and behaviour 8 years later. At age 16, internalizing and externalizing problems and low social competence were associated with suicidal features. Only about 20% of those who reported suicidal features had been referred to child mental health services. Conclusions: Many adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviour had a high rate of behavioural and emotional problems already at age 8. Clinical implications: The early school years represent an opportunity for interventions which may prevent self-destructive behaviours in adolescence. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

One possible source of conflict between parents and adolescents is the discrepant ways in which they perceive their relationship, which ma), contribute to adolescent adjustment difficulties. The present study examined the association between mother-adolescent discrepant views in their relationship and adolescent adjustment difficulties concurrently and longitudinally. In addition, the role of a family stressor, in this case parental divorce, in enhancing the discrepant views and moderating the relationship between discrepancy in perceptions and adolescent adjustment was examined. Results indicated that discrepancies in mother perception and adolescent perception of their relationship were associated with mother report of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems concurrently and longitudinally. Furthermore, discrepancies were significantly higher in divorced families than intact families, but divorce did plot moderate the relationship between discrepancies and adolescent adjustment. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

In this study. parenting behaviors, five-factor model personality characteristics, and internalizing and externalizing problems were examined in a community sample of 14- to 21-year-olds (N = 402). A comprehensive sweep of the multivariate space defined by the five-factor model revealed numerous conditional effects for parental behavior in the prediction of problems that varied depending on adolescent personality characteristics. The interactions occurred primarily for males and for aggression and delinquency. Examinations of the interaction patterns provided preliminary answers to questions about the relative frequency of problem-prone child personality types, personality resiliency, and the varying effects of parental behavior.

   CONTEXT
AB In this study, we used data collected from early adolescents (ages 12 to 14 years) in the San Francisco Bay area of the United States and Amsterdam, The Netherlands to examine two questions concerning their social-emotional and school functioning. First, we compared adolescents' self-reported emotional-behavioral problems, general self-esteem, and their sense that negative moods interfered with their ability to learn in school across the two samples. Consistent with previous research, we Found that American youth reported more internalizing and externalizing problems than did their Dutch peers, and said that negative moods interfered more with their ability to learn in school. Second, we examined the relative predictive relations between adolescents' social-emotional functioning and motivation to learn and their reported investment in or disaffection from school. Both sets of indices predicted investment in both samples, although the pattern of significant relations differed by country. Findings are discussed in relation to a broader model of the social, demographic, and psychological processes that shape patterns of academic investment or disaffection, achievement, and choice during the adolescent years.

AB ;The present study used a person-environment-fit framework to examine the interaction of psychological vulnerabilities and perceptions of school climate to explain the emergence of behavioral and emotional problems during the middle school pars. Cross-sectional and 1-year longitudinal analyses were conducted using data from 230 female and 230 male sixth- and seventh-glade students (50% non-Hispanic white, 27% Hispanic, 22% African American, and 3% other) attending a large ethnically and socioeconomically diverse middle school. Positive perceptions of school climate moderated the negative effects of self-criticism on both internalizing and externalizing problems and of a lack of efficacy on internalizing problems. Youth with high levels of self-criticism did not show expected increases in internalizing and externalizing problems when the perceived a positive e school climate. Results were consistent with the idea that careful attention needs to be given to the social-emotional environment of middle schools, particularly for young adolescents preoccupied with issues of self-definition.

AB Objective. To examine psychosocial problems and adaptation of adolescent girls with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
   Methodology. Thirty-six adolescent girls with CFS (mean age: 15.2 years; mean syndrome duration: 19.7 months) who fulfilled the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were examined by interviews regarding premorbid problems and by questionnaires regarding psychosocial functioning and distress, psychological attitudes, and coping resources. Data were compared with normative data.
   Results. Of the adolescents, 86.1% reported 1 or more premorbid problems (58.3% physical, 38.9% psychological, and 52.8% familial). Normal adjustment was reported for psychosocial self-esteem, social abilities, and attentional abilities. High adjustment to adult social standards of behavior was found, but low perceived competence in specific adolescent domains, such as athletic ability, romance, and participation in recreational activities. The girls reported predominantly internalizing problems. Normal achievement motivation, no debilitating fear of failure, and high internal locus of control were observed. Palliative reaction patterns and optimism were predominantly used as coping strategies.
   Conclusions. The large number of premorbid problems suggests a possible contributing factor to the onset of the syndrome, although there were no reference data of healthy adolescents. In distinct domains of psychosocial adjustment, the adolescent girls with CFS showed strengths such as adequate self-esteem and scholastic and social abilities, and weaknesses such as low competence in adolescent-specific tasks and internalizing distress, which may partly be explained by syndrome-specific somatic complaints. The use of optimistic and palliative reaction patterns as coping strategies in this patient group indicates that the patients with CFS seem to retain an active and positive outlook on life, which may result in a rather adequate psychological adaptation to the syndrome, but also in maintenance of the syndrome by exceeding the physical limits brought about by the CFS. Our results on adjustment and coping strategies may be helpful to implement (individual) rehabilitation programs.

AB The authors hypothesized that anxiety and unipolar mood disorders are often comorbid because each disorder indicates a broad, higher order factor. In a clinical subsample of the nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey participants (N = 251), a one-factor model fit the correlations among 7 dichotomous anxiety and unipolar mood diagnoses. Following the lead provided by literature on the structure of emotional and behavioral problems in children, we labeled this factor internalizing. Item response theory was used to explore how each diagnosis mapped onto the internalizing factor. The test information function derived from the 7 diagnoses suggested that they measure primarily the higher end of the factor. In addition, very high scores on internalizing (meeting criteria for 6-7 disorders) were associated with increased social costs, a phenomenon not well captured by the "comorbidity" concept. The results underscore the need to develop clinical assessment instruments that span the full range of the internalizing factor and measure both the shared and distinctive features of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders in a graded, continuous fashion.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the behavioral and emotional problems of former unaccompanied refugee children who had repatriated to Vietnam from refugee centers in Hong Kong and South East Asia. The children were compared with a matched sample of children who had never left Vietnam.
   Method: The participants consisted of 455 Vietnamese children aged between 10 and 22 years; 238 of the children had formerly resided in refugee camps without their parents. Data were collected using the Achenbach Youth Self-Report, the Cowen Perceived Self-Efficacy scale, a Social Support scale as well as an Exposure to Trauma scale.
   Results: No significant difference was found between the two groups of children on the YSR Total Score. The former refugee children had significantly lower Externalizing scores and failed marginally to report significantly higher Internalizing scores than the local children. The study showed that the perceived self-efficacy, number of social supports and experience of social support did not differ between the two groups of children. Further analysis showed that a significant interaction between the immigration status of the children and the children's subjective perception of their current standard of living explained the differences in the YSR.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the experience of living without parents in a refugee camp does not lead to increased behavioral and emotional problems in the immediate years after repatriation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate some children's Depression Inventory (CDI) psychometric properties and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in an unselected Italian sample of two hundred and eighty-four children aged 8 years. The CDI internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach's alpha:.80). The mean and standard deviation of CDI and the percentage of children at risk of depression (10.6%) in this sample are consistent with the figures reported by other studies carried out in northern Europe and North America. There were differences in gender and socioeconomic level in that boys scored higher than girls, and in the lower socioeconomic level there were more children at risk of depression. Ten items best discriminated children at risk for depression with 94% of correct classification. Most of these items consisted of observable signs. It is suggested that the CDI has noteworthy consistency across samples of relatively different cultures, that it can reliably be employed in the assessment of young children, and that observable signs outnumber internalizing symptoms of depression among children at risk (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB It was tested whether boys with attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), subgrouped by aggressive status, would show higher rates of depressive symptomatology and lower levels of self-esteem than would comparison boys and, in a subsample, explored attributional mechanisms that may be related to such internalizing features. Study 1 utilized 114 boys with ADHD (all prior recipients of stimulant medication) and 87 comparison boys, aged 7-12 years. Aggressive boys with ADHD reported more symptoms of depression than did nonaggressive boys with ADHD, who, in turn, reported more depression than did comparison boys. Effect sizes were moderate to large and did not vary with a depression rating scale uncontaminated by ADHD-related items. For self-esteem, the most pronounced effect was that aggressive boys with ADHD showed lower levels than did nonaggressive ADHD or comparison boys; effects were again moderate to large. Study 2 participants were a subsample of boys with ADHD from Study 1 (N = 27). We probed causal attributions in ADHD-related domains through responses to hypothetical vignettes, in which the protagonist's medication status (medicated, not medicated) was crossed with type of outcome (good, bad). Medication-related attributions were frequent. In describing the protagonist's success in relation to medication treatment, the sample showed significant associations between (a) medication-related attributions and (b) increased depressive symptomatology as well as decreased self-esteem. We discuss attributional processes that may help to explain the variation in internalizing symptoms among children with ADHD.

AB In this study we examined the factor structure of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) filled out by group care workers. Group care workers' judgements were collected on 846 children and adolescents treated in various residential settings in The Netherlands. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we were able to show that the original CBCL factor model based on parental judgments of child behavior also fits for the judgments of group care workers. This means that the well known 8 narrow-band syndromes (Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, etc.) as well as the 2 broad-band syndromes (Internalizing and Externalizing) can be used to interpret the CBCL scores of group care workers. This confirmation of the CBCL factor structure is a first step to add a group care worker version to the CBCL family. However, as a second step, normative data need to be gathered to further enhance the use of the CBCL for group care workers.

AB Besides their well-known externalizing behavior, children with conduct disorder (CD) often have additional impairments outside the criteria for the CD diagnosis. In a 5-year study of 984 treated children (ages 5-17 years), those with CD had an average of 2.2 primary diagnoses. Children with CD showed the worst problem and impairment scores in comparison with 11 common diagnoses. Compared with other treated children, children with CD achieved worse scores on 14 of 15 syndromes, including internalizing problems such as withdrawal and major depression. The average child with CD had larger relapse scores in the 1.5- to 3-year period after admission to treatment. This pattern, pervasive at intake and chronic in course, resembles a global disability more than a circumscribed problem managed with a narrow range of treatments specific to it.

AB This study examined the interpersonal and psychological functioning of expectant and nonexpectant adolescent couples. Interpersonal processes were assessed using the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (L. S. Benjamin, 1974) and psychological functioning was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (W. Reich, 1991). Compared with their nonexpectant peers, expectant couples exhibited higher rates of negative interpersonal processes, including demand-withdraw behaviors and lower rates of positive interpersonal processes. Expectant males reported higher rates of behavior disorders, substance use disorders, and internalizing disorders than nonexpectant males. Higher rates of substance-use disorders mediated the effect of expectancy status on demand-withdraw behavior. Results help clarify the links between the psychological risks associated with adolescent pregnancy and the interpersonal functioning of young expectant couples.

AB Using data on 189 adolescents who have a living biological father and a resident stepfather, we examined the effects of children's relationships, with both fathers on child outcomes. Interview data from mothers and stepfathers provide an assessment of two types of child outcomes, internalizing and externalizing problems. Interviews with the children themselves provide data about the child's relationships with the mother, stepfather, and biological father. Results show a significant positive association between quality of relationship with stepfathers and child outcomes. Relationships with noncustodial fathers have less consistent but appear to have positive effects on child outcomes. We find that many children have good relationships with both fathers and that, even controlling for quality of relationship with the mother, good relationships with both fathers are associated with better child outcomes.

AB Objectives: Previous research has been inconclusive whether attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), when comorbid with disruptive disorders (oppositional defiant disorder [ODD] or conduct disorder [CD]), with the internalizing disorders (anxiety and/or depression), or with both, should constitute separate clinical entities. Determination of the clinical significance of potential ADHD + internalizing disorder or ADHD + ODD/CD syndromes could yield better diagnostic decision-making, treatment planning, and treatment outcomes. Method: Drawing upon cross-sectional and longitudinal information from 579 children (aged 7-9.9 years) with ADHD participating in the NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA), investigators applied validational criteria to compare ADHD subjects with and without comorbid internalizing disorders and ODD/CD. Results: Substantial evidence of main effects of internalizing and externalizing comorbid disorders was found. Moderate evidence of interactions of parent-reported anxiety and ODD/CD status were noted on response to treatment, indicating that children with ADHD and anxiety disorders (but no ODD/CD) were likely to respond equally well to the MTA behavioral and medication treatments. Children with ADHD-only or ADHD with ODD/CD (but without anxiety disorders) responded best to MTA medication treatments (with or without behavioral treatments), while children with multiple comorbid disorders (anxiety and ODD/CD) responded optimally to combined (medication and behavioral) treatments. Conclusions: Findings indicate that three clinical profiles, ADHD co-occurring with internalizing disorders (principally parent-reported anxiety disorders) absent any concurrent disruptive disorder (ADHD + ANX), ADHD co-occurring with ODD/CD but no anxiety (ADHD + ODD/CD), and ADHD with both anxiety and ODD/CD (ADHD + ANX + ODD/CD) may be sufficiently distinct to warrant classification as ADHD subtypes different from "pure" ADHD with neither comorbidity. Future clinical, etiological, and genetics research should explore the merits of these three ADHD classification options.

AB Conduct-disordered and substance-abusing adolescents (N = 132) completed the Youth Happiness With Parent Scale (YHPS). The YHPS measures youth happiness with parental behaviors across 11 domains (e.g., communication, chores, and discipline) as well as a single item reflecting overall happiness. Results indicated that youth satisfaction did not vary as a function of parents' or youths' age, ethnic minority status, or gender. Although youth were relatively dissatisfied with their parents across behavioral domains (particularly illegal behaviors, drug use, school conduct, and alcohol use), they were fairly satisfied with their parents overall. Youth happiness with parental behaviors was negatively related to externalizing but not internalizing behavioral problems of the youth. Study implications and future directions are discussed in light of the results.

AB Differences in the rate and quality of parent-child communication in parents of socially anxious and normal children 9-12-years-old were examined. Socially anxious and control children were video-taped with their parents completing a puzzle task under three conditions, mother with child, father with child, and mother and father with child. Videotapes were coded for six types of verbalizations. Group differences were found in parents for frequency of total verbalizations,as well as frequency of types of verbalizations, with parents of anxious children using fewer total verbalizations, less positive feedback, and more negative feedback than control group parents. No difference was observed in the three observation conditions. Like their parents, Socially anxious children engaged in fewer total verbalizations, and used more negative feed-back and less positive feedback than control group children. Sequential analyses revealed that parents and children in the control group displayed similar patterns of communication in that they showed a strong tendency to mirror the quality of the other's verbalizations. Socially anxious children, like the control group children, tended to mirror the verbalizations of their parents. In contrast, parents of socially anxious children did not show the same similarities in responsiveness. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB Maltreatment was predicted to negatively affect children's academic and behavioral adjustment through the creation of deficits in academic engagement, social competencies, ego resiliency, and ego control. Teachers' comprehensive evaluations, school records, and camp counselors' ratings were obtained for 229 socioeconomically disadvantaged children (ages 5-12 years), 146 of whom had been maltreated. Maltreated children showed less academic engagement, more social skills deficits, and lower ego resiliency than nonmaltreated comparison children. Maltreated children manifested multiple forms of academic risk and showed more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The effects of maltreatment on academic maladjustment were partially mediated by academic engagement, whereas maltreatment's effects on behavior problems were mediated fully by social competencies and ego resiliency.

AB The paper evaluates the "Zurich Brief Questionnaire for the Assessment of Parental Behaviors" by mothers and fathers from the children's perspective. A sample (N = 877) of 11- to 17 year-old students from the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, was used, The questionnaire reliably measures the three dimensions "warmth and support," "psychological pressure," and "demands and control." In line with previous research on family socialization, high levels of parental support corresponded to children's positive developmental outcomes such as higher self-esteem, greater endorsement of active coping strategies and lower frequencies of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Higher levels of psychological pressure, however. were associated with lower self-esteem, greater preference for repressive coping strategies and higher incidence of psychopathological symptoms. Moreover, from the three scales, multidimensional types of parenting (e.g., authoritative parenting) can be derived that markedly differ with respect to children's developmental outcomes.

AB objective: This study aimed at the evaluation of the subjective experience and long-term behavioral and psychological effects of precocious puberty (PP). Methods: 19 female patients who had been treated with GnRH agonists participated in a semistructured interview and completed two standardized checklists. Their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: The CBCL yielded significantly elevated Internalizing and Total Behavior Problem scores. An elevated risk was found for patients with short adult stature and a relatively late onset of PP. The latter tended to neuroticism, to accentuation of their physical appearance, and felt significantly more insecure than age-related non-PP girls. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PP can lead to specific behavioral problems, and that patients with a risk factor may need psychosocial support. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB This study examined the significance of peer victimization in early and middle childhood by assessing the reliability and validity of peer nominations of victimization in 210 first-grade and 359 fifth-grade boys and girls. Measurement analyses suggested that peer nominations of victimization were stable and were consistently correlated with teacher reports of victimization for fifth graders but not for first graders. Structural equation modeling was used to examine how peer victimization predicted aggression and internalizing behavior outcomes for fifth-grade boys and girls. The results suggested that peer victimization and aggression were orthogonal constructs and that peer victimization predicted later internalizing behaviors, after controlling for initial levels.

AB Adolescent substance abusers demonstrate numerous emotional and behavioral difficulties in conjunction with drug problems. In this study, 236 clinically referred substance abusing adolescents were grouped on level of self-reported and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms and compared on important variables. Three groups emerged: Externalizers, Exclusive Substance Abusers, and Mixed (adolescents with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms). Exclusive Substance Abusers showed a general pattern of more positive functioning than adolescents in the other groups. This study reveals that clinically referred adolescent substance abusers can be meaningfully distinguished on levels of externalizing and internalizing problems, and that family characteristics differentiate these groups.
