AB This study examined the variance in teacher ratings attributable to teacher, occasion, and child on the original Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). Teachers rated approximately 1,100 girls (52%) and boys (48%) at four public elementary schools over 3 years. About half of the students were rated twice and about a seventh 3 times. Approximately 30% of students were White, 50% African American, 9% Hispanic, 2% multiracial, and 2% Asian. Children were in kindergarten to fifth grade. Cross-classified random effects models were used to account for multiple occasions of data nested within both children and teachers. Overall, the child accounted for the largest amount of variance in ratings (52.3%) followed by occasion (34.2%) and teacher (13.5%). However, large differences existed across composites and scales. The findings suggest that teachers' ratings of adaptive competencies, externalizing behaviors, and school problems are based primarily on child behavior/characteristics. Ratings of internalizing problems may be more situational.

AB Background/Objective The aim of this study was to systematically assess the association of insulin-manipulation (intentional under- and/or overdosing of insulin), psychiatric comorbidity and diabetes complications. Methods Two diagnostic interviews (Diabetes-Self-Management-Patient-Interview and Children's-Diagnostic-Interview for Psychiatric Disorders) were conducted with 241 patients (age 10-22) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from 21 randomly selected Austrian diabetes care centers. Medical data was derived from medical records. Results Psychiatric comorbidity was found in nearly half of the patients with insulin-manipulation (46.3%) compared to a rate of 17.5% in patients, adherent to the prescribed insulin therapy. Depression (18.3% vs 4.9%), specific phobia (21.1% vs 2.9%), social phobia (7.0% vs 0%), and eating disorders (12.7% vs 1.9%) were elevated in patients with insulin-manipulation. Females (37.7%) were more often diagnosed (P = 0.001) with psychiatric disorders than males (18.4%). In females, the percentage of psychiatric comorbidity significantly increased with the level of non-adherence to insulin therapy. Insulin-manipulation had an effect of +0.89% in HbA1c (P = <0.001) compared to patients adherent to insulin therapy, while there was no association of psychiatric comorbidity with metabolic control (HbA1c 8.16% vs 8.12% [65.68 vs 65.25 mmol/mol]). Ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, and frequency of outpatient visits in a diabetes center were highest in patients with insulin-manipulation. Conclusions This is the first study using a systematic approach to assess the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients who do or do not manipulate insulin in terms of intentional under- and/or overdosing. Internalizing psychiatric disorders were associated with insulin-manipulation, especially in female patients and insulin-manipulation was associated with deteriorated metabolic control and diabetes complications.

AB Given the increasing societal concerns about youth's mental health problems in the context of rapid sociocultural changes in urban China, studying the links of appraisals and coping to Chinese children's adjustment can inform cultural adaptations of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions for this population. In a school-based sample of 591 Chinese preadolescent children (53.6% girls, X over bar age = 11.6 years, in fifth and sixth grades) in Beijing, we tested the concurrent relations between (a) children's self-reported threat appraisals of stressors and use of coping strategies (active, avoidant, distraction, and support seeking), and (b) three domains of adjustment (externalizing and internalizing problems, and social competence) rated by parents, teachers, and children. Structural equation modeling revealed that controlling for stressors and family demographics, threat appraisals and avoidant coping were positively associated with internalizing problems. Active coping was negatively associated with externalizing problems and positively associated with social competence, and support seeking coping was negatively associated with internalizing problems. Gender did not moderate threat/coping-adjustment associations.

AB Background: We aimed to investigate associations between childhood sexual abuse and maltreatment and internalizing disorders (anxiety, depression, PTSD) across adulthood.
   Methods: Following a postal survey of 2220 women, a subsample was selected to participate in an interview. The subsample included 276 women reporting childhood sexual abuse and 221 women with no reported history of childhood sexual abuse. Interviews were repeated six and 25 years following the first interview. Internalizing disorders were assessed using ICD-8 and DSM-III criteria.
   Results: There was a lower probability of having an internalizing disorder at older ages than younger ages for all women, regardless of maltreatment history. Latent class analysis was used to define three classes (no/low maltreatment, sexual abuse, poly-victimisation). Compared with no/low maltreatment, a history of childhood sexual abuse was associated with almost double the risk of an internalizing disorder and a history of poly-victimisation was associated with over four times the risk of an internalizing disorder. Childhood sexual abuse and poly-victimisation remained associated with an elevated risk of a disorder in older age.
   Limitations: Findings are limited by attrition (39% participated at Time 3), low prevalence of severe physical abuse, and changes in assessment practice of childhood maltreatment and mental disorder in the past 30 years.
   Conclusions: Screening and treatment for internalizing disorders in women with histories of childhood maltreatment remains important in older aged populations.

AB BackgroundStudies throughout Europe have shown that asylum-seeking children and adolescents (ASC) are at risk of developing mental disorders. The most common mental-health problems in ASC include posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety, and externalizing behaviour. Being an unaccompanied refugee minor (URM) was found to be highly predictive for higher levels of psychological distress within ASC. Nevertheless, and even though Germany is Europe's biggest host country for ASC, studies that reliably examine the mental health of both URM and accompanied refugee minors (ARM) in Germany with psychometrically tested measures are still lacking.MethodsA cross-sectional survey in 19 facilities for minor refugees in Bavaria, Germany, screening for PTSS, depression, anxiety, externalizing behaviour, and post-migration factors was conducted. Participants were 98 ASC (URM, n=68; ARM, n=30) primarily from Afghanistan, Syria, and Eritrea. In 35.7% of interviews, interpreters were involved.ResultsBoth URM and ARM reported high levels of psychological distress and large numbers of potentially traumatic events, with 64.7% of URM and 36.7% of ARM scoring above the clinical cut-off for PTSS, 42.6% of URM and 30% of ARM for depression, and 38.2% of URM and 23.3% of ARM for anxiety. The total number of traumatic experiences was found to be the most robust predictor for PTSS, depression, and anxiety. Lower levels of individual resources, lower levels of social support in the host country, and poorer German language proficiency were associated with higher levels of psychological distress within both groups. URM reported significantly more traumatic events than ARM.ConclusionsASC in Germany are severely distressed and burdened by the experiences of various types of potentially traumatic events. The levels of distress found in the current study correspond with rates that have been reported in previous studies with ASC throughout Europe. Limitations of the present study include the convenience sample and the cross-sectional nature of findings.

AB Physical and mental health problems are becoming more common among the general population. Studies examining mental and physical health often indicate that mental illness early in life is associated with more detrimental health outcomes later. However, additional work is needed to better identity which psychological problems may contribute to poorer health outcomes. Given recent increases in childhood anxiety and depression specifically, it is beneficial to further investigate the relationship between internalizing problems, both early and later in life, and related health problems. Furthermore, little work has focused on studying internalizing problems in children as young as preschool-aged. Therefore, the current project used a longitudinal design to assess the effects of preschool and adolescent internalizing problems on health-related problems in adolescence. We analyzed data from 70 youth (47% male) who had been tested in our lab when they were 5 years old and then were administered questionnaires over a telephone interview when they were adolescents, between the ages of 12 and 20 years old. We used multi-informant measures, including parent-report at age 5 and youth-report at follow-up, 7 to 15 years later. Parents reported on children's internalizing behavior problems and negative emotionality (NE). Youth reported on their own internalizing behavior problems as well as health problems, physical activity, and overeating behaviors. Path modeling was used to examine predictions of internalizing and health behaviors. At age 5, parent-reported NE and internalizing problems were related, in addition to 5-year-old internalizing predicting health problems and overeating at follow-up. At follow-up, youth-reported internalizing was positively related to health problems and negatively related to physical activity, suggesting some similarities and differences between parent and youth responses. Additionally, girls reported significantly higher rates of internalizing and health problems at follow-up. These results indicate a significant relationship between preschool-aged and adolescent internalizing problems and related health outcomes experienced in adolescence.

AB Internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, social anxiety, somatic complaints, post-traumatic symptoms, and obsession-compulsion) are very important in adolescents' development. These problems can be related with people who lack social skills and poorly handle their emotions. This study assessed 1358 secondary education students (12-17years) to analyze the relationship linking internalizing problems, emotional intelligence, and social skills. The results showed not only how these constructs were related, but how students' internalizing problems varied according to their emotional intelligence and social skills. They also indicated that two in every three males, and just over one in every two females, obtained high scores for internalizing problems. The model showed a good fit: (2)(85)=201.161 p<0.001; (2)/gl=2.367; CFI=0.919; NFI=0.869; TLI=0.900; RMSEA=0.075, IC 95% (0.062-0.089). Finally, gender influenced the way that internalizing problems, emotional intelligence, and social skills were related, and an inverse relation appeared to link internalizing problems, emotional intelligence (r=-.77), and social skills (r=-.52) for females, while this relationship was poorer for males. By way of conclusion, we state that internalizing problems are related with emotional intelligence and social skills in secondary education students, but this relationship differs according to gender.

AB The present study investigates religiosity, moral disengagement, attachment to God, and interpersonal attachment in 30 offenders within Italian jails. We administered a semi-structured interview to collect data about family, social and medical history, and the manner in which the deviant act was carried out; the Moral Disengagement Scale; the Attachment to God Inventory; the Revised Intrinsic/Extrinsic Religious Orientation Scale; and the Attachment Style Questionnaire. Results show how intrinsic religiosity negatively predicts moral disengagement; the "Preoccupation with Relationships" Scale (anxious/ambivalent attachment) predicts avoidant attachment to God; and the "Secondariety for Relationship" Scale (dismissing attachment) predicts personal extrinsic religiosity and negatively predicts intrinsic religiosity. Studying these constructs in offenders is important not only to increase the literature but also to implement interventions aimed at reeducation focused on issues relevant to personal adjustment.

AB The Galilee Study is the first large epidemiological study to compare correlates of mental disorders between two Arab Palestinian minority groups of adolescents in Israel.
   A two-stage cross-sectional study, carried out between 2012 and 2014, included all 9th grade students from 5 Arab localities, representative of 77% of the Muslim and 100% of Druze citizens in Israel. During the screening stage, 1639 students completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in the classroom (response rate = 69.3%). During the follow-up stage, 704 adolescent-mother dyads were interviewed at home; using the Development and Well-Being Assessment, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12, the Subjective Feeling of Discrimination Index (FDI), and socio-demographic questions (response rate = 84.4%).
   Prevalence of any disorder, internalizing or externalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were 19.2, 15.8 and 4.2%, respectively and among Druze adolescents 10.9, 5.9 and 5.5%, respectively. Muslim adolescents were 3.2 times more likely than Druze adolescents to have an internalizing disorder, while Druze were 2 times more likely than Muslim to have an externalizing disorder. Males were at higher risk than females for externalizing disorders in both populations, though among Druze the risk was more striking. Learning disabilities increased the likelihood of having an externalizing disorder in both populations. Risk factors for internalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were female gender, a very low socio-economic level, few siblings, LD, high maternal GHQ-12 score and high FDI; and for externalizing disorders, male gender, a relatively low socio-economic level but not the lowest, learning disability and high maternal GHQ-12 score.
   We found an association between religion/ethnicity and internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as a strong correlation between religion/ethnicity and socio-economic variables. Therefore, we tend to conclude that not religion per se but the multifaceted socio-cultural and economic factors that characterize religious groups are associated with mental disorders. Very low socio-economic level and feeling discriminated which were traits connected only to Muslim adolescents, were associated with internalizing disorders. When preparing preventive measures aimed at furthering mental health among minority adolescents, authorities should focus on improving the socio-economic status of minorities and reducing institutional and personal discrimination. The educational and mental health establishments could undertake measures to improve resilience and coping strategies of Muslim families living in the most adverse conditions, such as providing special support through the school counseling services and coordinating, at the ministerial levels, school and community health services in order to carry out joint preventive programs and referrals to specialist services when needed.

AB Decreased reward responsiveness, as demonstrated utilizing the event-related potential (ERP) component the reward positivity (RewP), is an established correlate of internalizing psychopathologies (IPs), such as depressive and anxiety disorders. Although IPs are highly comorbid with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and despite evidence that AUDs are also characterized by aberrant reward processing styles, no studies have examined how AUD history impacts the RewP among adults with IPs. The current preliminary study sought to examine this question in a sample of 65 adults with 1) current IPs (i.e., depression, social anxiety, and/or generalized anxiety, 2) current IPs with a history of an AUD (IP + Past AUD), and 3) no history of a DSM-IV disorder. Participants completed a guessing reward task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results indicated that participants in the IP group exhibited a more attenuated RewP relative to IP + Past AUD and healthy control individuals. Findings from this study highlight the importance of examining diagnostic subgroups among adults with anxiety and depressive disorders, and suggest that a history of AUD may enhance reward reactivity at the neural level in individuals with IPs.

AB BackgroundA limitation of measuring sedentary time with an accelerometer is device removal. The resulting nonwear time is typically deleted from the data prior to calculating sedentary time. This could impact estimates of sedentary time and its associations with health indicators. We evaluated whether using multiple imputation to replace nonwear accelerometer epochs influences such estimates in children.Methods452 children (50% male) aged 10-13 were tasked with wearing an accelerometer (15s epochs) for 7days. On average, 8% of waking time was classified as nonwear time. Sedentary time was derived from a nonimputed dataset using the typical approach of deleting epochs that occurred during nonwear time, as well as from an imputed dataset. In the imputed dataset, each nonwear epoch was re-classified as being as sedentary or not using multiple imputation (5 iterations) which was informed by the likelihood of a wear time epoch being classified as sedentary or not using parameter estimates from a logistic regression model. Estimates of sedentary time and associations between sedentary time and health indicators (cardiometabolic risk factor and internalizing mental health symptoms Z-scores) were compared between the nonimputed and imputed datasets.ResultsOn average, sedentary time was 33min/day higher in the imputed dataset than in the nonimputed dataset (632 vs. 599min/day). The association between sedentary time and the cardiometabolic risk factor Z-score was stronger in the imputed vs. the nonimputed dataset (=0.137 vs. =0.092 per 60min/day change, respectively). These findings were more pronounced among children who had <7days with 10h of wear time.ConclusionResearchers should consider using multiple imputation to address accelerometer nonwear time, rather than deleting it, in order to derive more unbiased estimates of sedentary time and its associations with health indicators.

AB There is a critical need for fast, inexpensive, objective, and accurate screening tools for childhood psychopathology. Perhaps most compelling is in the case of internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression, where unobservable symptoms cause children to go unassessed-suffering in silence because they never exhibiting the disruptive behaviors that would lead to a referral for diagnostic assessment. If left untreated these disorders are associated with long-term negative outcomes including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This paper presents a new approach for identifying children with internalizing disorders using an instrumented 90-second mood induction task. Participant motion during the task is monitored using a commercially available wearable sensor. We show that machine learning can be used to differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with 81% accuracy (67% sensitivity, 88% specificity). We provide a detailed description of the modeling methodology used to arrive at these results and explore further the predictive ability of each temporal phase of the mood induction task. Kinematical measures most discriminative of internalizing diagnosis are analyzed in detail, showing affected children exhibit significantly more avoidance of ambiguous threat. Performance of the proposed approach is compared to clinical thresholds on parent-reported child symptoms which differentiate children with an internalizing diagnosis from controls with slightly lower accuracy (.68-. 75 vs. .81), slightly higher specificity (.88-1.00 vs. .88), and lower sensitivity (.00-. 42 vs. .67) than the proposed, instrumented method. These results point toward the future use of this approach for screening children for internalizing disorders so that interventions can be deployed when they have the highest chance for long-term success.

AB Symptoms of internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety increase in adolescence, especially in females. However, gender differences in depression and anxiety symptoms emerge only after puberty onset. Levels of alexithymia, characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one's emotions, are elevated in depression and anxiety, and fluctuate across adolescence in a gender-specific manner. This study investigated changes in alexithymia across adolescence, and explored the potential role of alexithymia in the development of depression and anxiety, separately for females and males. Accordingly, 140 adolescents aged 11 to 21 years (77 female) completed self-report measures of alexithymia, depression and anxiety, and pubertal development. For females alone, pubertal maturation was associated with alexithymic traits (specifically difficulties identifying and describing feelings), as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety. After accounting for alexithymia, the relationship between puberty and depression and anxiety was absent or reduced in females. Thus, alexithymic traits may have differential consequences for males and females, and possibly contribute towards increased depression and anxiety symptoms in females during adolescence. We propose that developmental changes in alexithymia should be considered when studying the onset and development of internalizing psychological disorders during adolescence.

AB BACKGROUND: Maternal cortisol during pregnancy has the potential to influence rapidly developing fetal brain systems that are commonly altered in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Research examining maternal cortisol concentrations across pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment proximal to birth is needed to advance understanding in this area and lead to insight into the etiology of these disorders.
   METHODS: Participants were 70 adult women recruited during early pregnancy and their infants born after 34 weeks gestation. Maternal cortisol concentrations were assessed serially over 4 days in early, mid, and late gestation. Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging of the neonatal amygdala was examined. Mothers reported on children's internalizing behavior problems at 24 months of age.
   RESULTS: Maternal cortisol concentrations during pregnancy were significantly associated with neonatal amygdala connectivity in a sex-specific manner. Elevated maternal cortisol was associated with stronger amygdala connectivity to brain regions involved in sensory processing and integration, as well as the default mode network in girls, and with weaker connectivity to these brain regions in boys. Elevated maternal cortisol was associated with higher internalizing symptoms in girls only, and this association was mediated by stronger neonatal amygdala connectivity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Normative variation in maternal cortisol during pregnancy is associated with the coordinated functioning of the amygdala soon after birth in a sex-specific manner. The identified pathway from maternal cortisol to higher internalizing symptoms in girls via alterations in neonatal amygdala connectivity may be relevant for the etiology of sex differences in internalizing psychiatric disorders, which are more prevalent in women.

AB Background: Biases in socio-emotional attention may be early markers of risk for self-regulation difficulties and mental illness. We examined the associations between maternal pre- and postnatal anxiety symptoms and infant attention patterns to faces, with particular focus on attentional biases to threat, across male and female infants.
   Methods: A general population, Caucasian sample of eight-month old infants (N = 362) were tested using eye-tracking and an attention disengagement (overlap) paradigm, with happy, fearful, neutral, and phase-scrambled faces and distractors. Maternal self-reported anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90/anxiety subscale at five time points between gestational week 14 and 6 months postpartum.
   Results: Probability of disengagement was lowest for fearful faces in the whole sample. Maternal pre- but not postnatal anxiety symptoms associated with higher threat bias in infants, and the relation between maternal anxiety symptoms in early pregnancy and higher threat bias in infants remained significant after controlling for maternal postnatal symptoms. Maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms, in turn, associated with higher overall probability of disengagement from faces to distractors, but the effects varied by child sex.
   Limitations: The small number of mothers suffering from very severe symptoms. No control for the comorbidity of depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Maternal prenatal anxiety symptoms associate with infant's heightened attention bias for threat. Maternal postnatal anxiety symptoms, in turn, associate with infant's overall disengagement probability differently for boys and girls. Boys may show enhanced vigilance for distractors, except when viewing fearful faces, and girls enhanced vigilance for all socio-emotional stimuli. Long-term implications of these findings remain to be explored.

AB The adolescent brain undergoes profound structural changes which is influenced by many factors. Screen media activity (SMA; e.g., watching television or videos, playing video games, or using social media) is a common recreational activity in children and adolescents; however, its effect on brain structure is not well understood. A multivariate approach with the first cross-sectional data release from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study was used to test the maturational coupling hypothesis, i.e. the notion that coordinated patterns of structural change related to specific behaviors. Moreover, the utility of this approach was tested by determining the association between these structural correlation networks and psychopathology or cognition. ABCD participants with usable structural imaging and SMA data (N = 4277 of 4524) were subjected to a Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to identify latent variables that relate SMA to cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and gray matter volume. Subject scores from these latent variables were used in generalized linear mixed-effect models to investigate associations between SMA and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, as well as fluid and crystalized intelligence. Four SMA-related GFAs explained 37% of the variance between SMA and structural brain indices. SMA-related GFAs correlated with brain areas that support homologous functions. Some but not all SMA-related factors corresponded with higher externalizing (Cohen's d effect size (ES) 0.06-0.1) but not internalizing psychopathology and lower crystalized (ES: 0.08-0.1) and fluid intelligence (ES: 0.04-0.09). Taken together, these findings support the notion of SMA related maturational coupling or structural correlation networks in the brain and provides evidence that individual differences of these networks have mixed consequences for psychopathology and cognitive performance.

AB Based on the evidence that emotion regulation difficulties underpin many mental health struggles during adolescence, including substance use disorders (SUDs), we focused on distress tolerance as a particularly salient mechanism of action for bolstering emotion regulation outcomes for adolescents in early SUD recovery. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective in improving distress tolerance through teaching skills to reduce individuals' perceived stress or feelings of crisis and increasing a sense of agency and self-regulatory efficacy. The aim of the present study was to improve emotion regulation outcomes in the student body of a recovery high school (N = 27) through six weeks of mindfulness intervention content delivered in a small-group format. Thus, we tested feasibility through recruitment and retention rates and examined preliminary efficacy outcomes from two, randomized mindfulness intervention conditions, and used a comparison group of students without an SUD diagnosis (N = 29) sampled from the community. Results indicate significant post-intervention impacts on recovery students' depression symptomology and on two separate measures of impulsivity (t(22) = 2.358, p < .05; t(20) = 2.358, p < .05; t(17) = 3.979, p < .01, respectively), although no significant differences between intervention condition were noted. Findings from the current study echo similar studies with comparable samples. Implications for the dosage and approach of group-format mindfulness interventions for adolescent samples are discussed.

AB Youth in high achieving schools (HAS) are at elevated risk for serious adjustment problems-including internalizing and externalizing symptoms and substance use-given unrelenting pressures to be "the best." For resilience researchers, successful risk evasion in these high-pressure settings should, arguably, be defined in terms of the absence of serious symptoms plus behaviorally manifested integrity and altruism. Future interventions should target that which is the fundamental basis of resilience: Dependable, supportive relationships in everyday settings. These must be promoted between adults and children and among them, toward enhancing positive development among youth and families in these high stress environments.

AB To examine whether trajectories of participation in organized activities during the high school years and beyond (from ages 14 to 20) predicted outcomes at age 21 (externalizing problems, internalizing problems, civic engagement, number of years of education, and perception of physical health), 354 youths (60% girls) were surveyed annually over nine years. Four trajectories were found: (a) "Low and decreasing" (71%), (b) "Moderate and stable" (12%), (c) "High and decreasing after high school" (12%), and (d) "High and increasing after high school" (5%). Results revealed that the predicted outcomes varied according to the different trajectories. Pursuing high levels of activity participation beyond high school was especially beneficial with respect to externalizing problems and educational attainment.

AB According to attachment theory, being securely attached to one's primary caregiver early in life should be related to personality adulthood. However, no studies to date have investigated this key premise using prospective data. To address this gap, we discuss evolutionary-based models of attachment and use them to examine how secure versus insecure children might score differently on Big 5 traits that underlie the meta-trait stability. We modeled data from Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (N = 170), which has followed participants across 30 years. Participant's early attachment status was assessed in Ainsworth's Strange at 12 and 18 months and personality was assessed on Big 5 measures at age 32. Being securely attached early in childhood predicted three of the Big 5 traits known to tap the meta-trait stability. Specifically, participants rated as secure early in life scored higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness and lower on neuroticism in adulthood, whereas those rated as insecure scored lower on agreeableness and conscientiousness and higher on neuroticism. Exploratory mediation analyses revealed that neither adult attachment representations nor internalizing/externalizing symptoms mediated the association between early security and stability. The implications of these findings for understanding the origins of personality variation are discussed.

AB Background and objectives: Stress is well established as a strong risk factor for internalizing psychopathology. Learned helplessness research demonstrates that perceived controllability of stressors affects internalizing symptoms. Furthermore, subjective perceived stress is associated with psychopathology. However, most recent research has focused on measuring the frequency and expert-rated severity of stressful life events despite evidence for the importance of stress perceptions. The present study brings together past and current literatures to investigate the importance of perceived severity and controllability of recent life events in the association between stressors and internalizing symptoms. Design and methods: We used a revised version of the Adolescent Life Events Questionnaire (ALEQ) that asked participants (ages 13-22, N = 328) to rate the frequency of 65 stressful events typical to youth, as well as the perceived stressfulness and control they felt over each event. Events were categorized prior to analysis as dependent (self-generated), independent (fateful) or neither. Results: Controllability and severity appraisals were associated with depression and anxiety symptoms, controlling for stressor frequency (which also predicted symptoms), for dependent but not independent stressors. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of controllability and severity appraisals as potential risk factors for internalizing disorders, exposing a potential target for therapy.

AB This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a parent-mediated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group anxiety intervention with young children with high functioning forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thirty-one children aged four to six years with ASD and anxiety were randomly assigned to treatment or waitlist control conditions. Outcomes were assessed via parent-report measures of child anxiety and emotional awareness. Parental outcomes were also investigated via self-report. At post-treatment no treatment effects were found for child or parent outcomes. However, by three-month follow-up for the completer sample, children in the treatment group demonstrated significant reductions in internalizing behaviours and there was a trend for a reduction in anxiety compared to pre-treatment. For parent outcomes, at three-month follow-up for the completer sample, no significant effects were found. Results provided preliminary evidence that children may make some gains in terms of anxiety subsequent to their parents attending a group CBT intervention for anxiety.

AB Childhood maltreatment has well-documented relationships with emotional dysregulation. Emotional dysregulation confers heightened risk for psychopathology and therefore represents an important therapeutic target for survivors of childhood maltreatment. Emerging research suggests that deficits in self-compassion may be one pathway by which childhood maltreatment adversely impacts emotional regulation processes. The current study sought to replicate previous research by investigating the mitigating effects of self-compassion on emotional dysregulation in a nonclinical sample of women with varying degrees of childhood maltreatment (N = 245). Hierarchical regression analyses showed that self-compassion predicted emotional dysregulation above and beyond childhood maltreatment and current substance use (including current alcohol use). Additionally, mediation analyses revealed that self-compassion exerted an indirect effect on the relationship between childhood maltreatment and emotional dysregulation. Overall, these results replicate previous findings and further support self-compassion as an explanatory mechanism connecting childhood maltreatment with later emotional dysregulation. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB Aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of mental models of attachment and of locus of control on the emergence of both internalizing (anxiety and mood disorders) and externalizing (aggressive behaviors) disorders. They have also been considered differences due to gender and age. Participants were 241 children, 133 males (55.2%) and 108 females (44.8%) aged between 8 and 14 years (M = 9.94, SD = 1.48). Instruments administered were: the Separation Anxiety Test for the measurement of the mental models of attachment, the Nowicki-Strikland Scale for the locus of control, the Self-Report Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents for the psychopathological disorders and the Social Emotional Dimension Scales for the assessment of behavioral patterns. Results highlight association between female gender and internalizing disorders and between male gender and externalizing disorders. As for age, no significant differences between primary and secondary school subjects were found. Multiple linear regression analyzes show a significant effect of insecure attachment and external locus of control on the dimensions of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, eating disorders and somatic disorders. Aggressive behavior, on the other hand, is more influenced only by insecure attachment. In particular, in the comparison between subjects who have no disorder and those who present internalizing, externalizing or both types of disorder, a preponderance of ambivalent mental models emerges.

AB Emotions and self-esteem are critical components of well-being and adaptation during adolescence. People differ in their average levels of affect and self-esteem, as well as in how much their affect and self-esteem fluctuate from moment to moment. Fluctuations in affect in particular have not been extensively examined in relation to adolescent-relevant variables. The present study investigates internalizing symptoms, social functioning, and overt and relational aggression as correlates of average levels and within-person variability in daily positive and negative affect (PA and NA) and self-esteem. Crucially, unique association were examined controlling for the other variables. Early adolescents (mean age 10.8 years, N= 94) completed daily diaries across four days on PA, NA, and self-esteem. They also completed general questionnaires, as did peers. Some key findings were that more internalizing symptoms were significantly associated with more variability in NA. The importance of peer relationships for adolescents' daily mean levels of PA and NA were shown. Peer-perceived social functioning was associated with less fluctuations in self-esteem. Some unexpected, non-significant, findings for aggression appeared. Finally, higher mean NA were associated with more NA fluctuations, whereas higher mean PA and self-esteem were associated with less fluctuations.

AB Research findings to prosocial behavior like helping voluntarily among youths with internalizing and externalizing problems are contradictory. It has not been examined whether prosocial behavior decreases subjective stress perception in peer relations among adolescents with behavior problems. This study explores whether prosocial behavior as a protective factor moderates the link between behavior problems (internalizing and/or externalizing problems) and stress in peer relations. Based on a sample of 1019 adolescents aged 13-18 (including 678 with behavior problems according to an aggregated teacher-student-rating), standardized instruments were used. ANCOVAs show moderating impacts of prosocial behavior. In particular, prosocial, hyperactive adolescents feel lower stress in peer relations. The discussion points out the necessity of resource based perspectives, however, it also reflects how far prosocial behaviour can actually be employed as a resource by hyperactive adolescents.

AB The acculturation gap-distress theory postulates that parent-offspring acculturation mismatch precipitates greater intergenerational conflict in immigrant families, which in turn increases the risk for psychological problems among offspring. Whereas cross-sectional studies have shown support for these theory-informed relations, comparatively little is known about whether acculturation mismatch negatively affects psychological functioning, or whether offspring's psychological problems precipitate greater perceived acculturation mismatch via intergenerational cultural conflict. Furthermore, more research is needed to investigate how acculturation and family conflict affect Asian Americans transitioning into college and emerging adulthood. Across two measurement occasions, two cohorts of Asian American first-year college students (N = 555, M-age = 17.99, 56.0% women) completed survey questionnaires assessing their perception of parent-offspring acculturation discrepancies, acculturation-related intergenerational conflict, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For both sets of psychological functioning, gender invariant structural equation models testing the bidirectional relations demonstrated adequate fit for the data. In the case of externalizing symptoms, acculturation mismatch marginally significantly predicted subsequent intergenerational conflict, but acculturation mismatch did not predict externalizing symptoms via intergenerational cultural conflict. By contrast, offspring's internalizing and externalizing symptoms respectively predicted greater self-reported intergenerational cultural conflict, which in turn predicted perceived parent-offspring acculturation mismatch over time. These indirect relations suggested that both internalizing and externalizing symptoms indirectly contributed to greater acculturation mismatch through the presence of intergenerational cultural conflict, but data did not support the acculturation gap-distress theory. Theoretical and clinical implications as they pertain to Asian American emerging adults are discussed.

AB The objective of this study was to analytically identify risk profiles for juvenile human trafficking (JHT) based on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and health risk behaviors. First, the study examined which types of ACEs and health risk behaviors were more prevalent among trafficked adolescents using a sample of 913 male and female juvenile-justice-involved adolescents with suspected or verified JHT abuse reports documented between 2009 and 2015 and a comparison group (matched by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and location). Second, latent class analysis was used to identify profiles of risk for JHT. Finally, associations between JHT risk profiles and demographic characteristics provided a more comprehensive depiction of various types of trafficked adolescents. Study findings indicate that adolescents with JHT abuse reports were more likely to report child maltreatment and internalizing health risk behaviors reflective of self-harm and attempts to cope with trauma. Trafficked youth were less likely to report externalizing health risk behaviors related to violence or harming others. Six distinctive profiles of risk for JHT were identified. Three JHT risk profiles were characterized by extensive child maltreatment and health risk behaviors and were differentiated by placement in foster care and substance use. Three JHT risk profiles were characterized by less extensive histories of child maltreatment and were differentiated by drug use. In conclusion, these findings highlight that the current depictions of adolescent victims of human trafficking are too narrow and may lead to critical health care and service provision disparities for many trafficked adolescents.

   6-7 years
AB A number of studies have shown the relationship between emotional regulation difficulties and subjective well-being. Reappraisal is considered a form of emotional regulation better than suppression. However, suppressing emotional expression increases the activity of physiological responses which actually harms the human health in the long run. Early age children still have difficulty in regulating their emotions, and this is likely to affect their psychological well-being if not properly managed. This study aims to examine the relationship between emotional regulation difficulties and subjective wellbeing in children aged 6-7 years. Study participants (N = 55) were children in their early childhood who were transitioned from kindergartens to Gorontalo elementary school. Data were obtained through questionnaires using an Emotional Regulation Checklist / ERC (shiedls & ciccheti, 2003) and subjective welfare questionnaire. Based on data analysis using Pearson product moment correlation test, the researcher found that the correlation coefficient (rxy) is 0.408 with p = 0.000 (p < 0.01). This indicates that there is a significant negative relationship between the variable of the value of emotional regulation difficulties with subjective wellbeing.

AB BACKGROUND
   Diagnosis of chronic illness, which constitutes a life-threatening situation such as in Marfan syndrome or disease with periods of remission and severity such as in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), leads to problems with the functioning of the adolescent and the whole family system. Therefore the aim of the study was to determine the differences in severity of internalizing and externalizing problems and in the perception of the family system between adolescents with Marfan syndrome, with JIA, and without chronic disease, as well as to determine whether characteristics of the family system are associated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors in those groups.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   The study involved three groups of adolescents: 1) with Marfan syndrome (n = 25), 2) with JIA (n = 29), and 3) without chronic illness (n = 20). We used the adolescent version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Family Assessment Scale.
   RESULTS
   Our results indicated that adolescents with Marfan syndrome have similar scores compared to adolescents with-out illness on all subscales concerning both internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as well as the family system's characteristics. Compared to adolescents with JIA, adolescents with Marfan syndrome had lower scores on externalization symptoms and Attention Problems and they also perceive their families as less balanced. Additionally, in the perception of adolescents with Marfan syndrome and with JIA the weaker the family bond, the stronger the intensity of externalizing behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Although in the light of our novel research, adolescents with Marfan syndrome do not present behavioral problems different from healthy peers, it is worth continuing such research in order to verify the results. Adolescents with JIA present more externalizing behaviors than peers without chronic illness, which is consistent with some previous research. Research on families of an adolescent child with Marfan and JIA are quite novel and they should be continued.

AB Children experiencing internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, somatization) can have difficulty transitioning to preschool. Some research has shown that children who experience increased internalizing problems form negative relationships with their teachers. Other research has found that children who share more positive relationships with their teachers show fewer internalizing problems over time. The current study tests three conceptual models of the directional associations between children's internalizing problems and teacher-child relationship quality across the preschool year: relationship driven, child-driven, and transactional models. Participants included 443 ethnically diverse, low-income preschool children (47.9% girls, M-age =4.08 years, SD-.34 years) who were assessed in the fall and spring of preschool. Children's internalizing problems were rated by teachers using the Behavior Assessment System for Children 11. The teacher-child relationship was rated by teachers using the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale and observers using the Individualized Classroom Assessment Scoring System. Results supported the child-driven model: internalizing problems in the fall of preschool predicted more teacher-child dependency and a less positive teacher-child relationship by spring of preschool. Findings suggest that children who enter preschool as more sad or anxious are perceived to interact less positively with teachers across the preschool year. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the link between peer victimization and substance use and tested the mediating role of internalizing problems in urban African American adolescents in Chicago. Six hundred and thirty-eight adolescents in Chicago's Southside participated in the study. Results from the hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that youth who reported peer victimization were at risk of internalizing problems. Those who were bullied by their peers were more likely to display internalizing problems, which was also significantly associated with substance use. Consistent with the self-medication hypothesis, findings from the study suggest that bullied youth are likely to display internalizing problems and turn to substance use. Implications for mental health practice in school settings are also discussed.

AB Repeated child and adolescent mental health residential treatment placements are important given such patterns can indicate inefficient and costly services, system of care imbalances and/or earlier treatment failure. Identifying factors that predict subsequent residential treatment placement at the same or more restrictive level of care can help the field consider assessment and intervention approaches to lessen multiple placements. The current study examined predictors of youth returning to the same or higher (more restrictive) level of care (vs. those who were successfully transitioned to home-based services) after an initial episode of community-based residential treatment. Although multiple variables predicted subsequent residential treatment placement, when entered together in a multiple logistic regression, younger age, the presence of an internalizing diagnosis (often with one or more externalizing diagnoses), rural facility location, and an unsuccessful discharge status from the initial residential treatment placement predicted greater likelihood of subsequent placement. Research and practice implications are discussed.

AB Results: The higher traumatic exposure during the war, the greater the tendency to have emotional problems and behavioral problems for both kinds of participants. The result showed that there were no differences on the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems between the two groups, and both veterans and wives of veterans had no differences on seeking professional help for their emotional and behavioral problems. Wives of veterans living in rural areas showed higher scores on almost all ASR scales compared with those living in urban areas or even with those of veterans from urban and rural areas. Veterans with elementary education level had the highest scores compared with other groups. Veterans with poor well-being had the highest scores compared with other groups. Using Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems as outcome variables and trauma exposure, smoking, drinking alcohol, and well-being as predictors, we found that the model was a significant predictor for both male and female participants on these three scales.

LA English
DT Article
DE Pragmatic impairment; mental health problems: CAMHS; ASEBA
ID SOCIAL COMMUNICATION DEFICITS; FOLLOW-UP; CHECKLIST; DISORDER;
   DIFFICULTIES; BEHAVIOR; HISTORY; SLI
AB Background: The results of several international studies indicate a high prevalence of language and communication impairments among children who are referred to child psychiatric services. However, these impairments are likely to remain undetected unless language and communication impairments are evaluated during the psychiatric assessment.
   Aims: The aim of the present study is to investigate the specific association between general and specific mental health problems, as expressed by the problem scales of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teachers Report Form (TRF), and pragmatic skills and pragmatic language impairments (PLI) as defined the Pragmatic Composite of the Child Communication Checklist (CCC-PC).
   Methods: Children aged from 8 to 13 years (n = 73) were recruited in sequence following referral to a child and adolescent psychiatry (CAMHS) outpatient clinic within 12 months. Children with possible or established autism or intellectual disability were excluded. Standardized instruments measuring language, communication and mental health symptoms were distributed to parents and teachers, an intelligence test administered for clinical purposes, and demographic information was included.
   Results: The parent reports showed PLI among 38% of the children and revealed strong associations with the CBCL scales for emotional problems, thought problems and, especially, social and withdrawal symptoms, which mean more associations to internalized and non-externalized problems. PC-scores were at similar levels and PLI was reported by teachers at similar rates (compared to parent reports) with moderate agreement. Teacher PC-scores showed associations to only one TRF-scale, social problems. The CCC-PC subscale with the strongest associations to mental health symptoms was "Use of Context" ("Social Relationships" do not contribute to the CCC-PC scores).
   Conclusion: There was a general increase in PC-scores and increased prevalence of PLI in this clinical sample. PC-scores correlated with symptom scores for internalizing and non-externalizing problems scales. The strongest common factors appear to be related to the social aspects of mental health. Pragmatic skills should be considered as a protective factor for mental health rather than investigating pragmatic impairment as a risk or vulnerability factor.

AB Background: Findings show that deficiencies in the ability to understand mental states are related to many forms of psychopathology. Mentalizing dysfunctions are suggested to be the core pathology underlying borderline personality disorder (BPD). Moreover, research suggests that BPD predicts psychopathology in general and findings display that diminished mentalization is related to a range of psychiatric disorders. As yet, no study has investigated the potential link between borderline personality features, mentalization and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and whether internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in BPD might be driven by impaired mentalization.
   Objective: In a cross-sectional study, 109 patients referred to a child and adolescent psychiatric clinic were assessed with a battery of self-report instruments to asses borderline personality features, mentalization, and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.
   Method: Simple mediation model was used to examine whether mentalizing abilities mediated the relationship between borderline features and psychopathology in regard to externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents.
   Results: The results indicated that mentalization mediated the relationship between borderline personality features and both externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents, indicating that mentalization underlie externalizing and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents with borderline personality features.
   Conclusion: The current study is the first empirical study to evaluate mentalization as a mediating factor between adolescents who met full or sub-threshold criteria for BPD and psychopathology. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB Resilience models suggest that there are likely to be multiple trajectories of self-worth and that despite experiencing impairment, some youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may maintain a positive self-worth, which could buffer them against negative outcomes. The present study used a cohort-sequential longitudinal design to evaluate developmental trajectories of global self-worth in a sample of 324 middle-school-age adolescents (71% male) diagnosed with ADHD between ages 11 and 14 in predicting outcomes at age 15. Sex, medication status, and ADHD/oppositional defiant disorder symptom severity were included as covariates in the models. Using growth mixture modeling, 3 distinct self-worth trajectory groups were identified: (a) high and increasing (44.4% of participants), (b) moderate and decreasing (48.8%), and (c) low and decreasing (6.8%). Participants with high and increasing global self-worth were less likely to exhibit co-occurring depressive symptoms and had better social functioning and higher grades at age 15 relative to those in either decreasing trajectory. Implications of these findings for monitoring and supporting positive global self-worth for adolescents with ADHD are discussed.

AB Irritability is a common feature of many psychiatric disorders, including both externalizing and internalizing disorders. There is little research, however, examining associations between irritability and these symptom domains, particularly during the important developmental period of adolescence, characterized by sex differences in the prevalence of disorders. We examined the cross-sectional associations between irritability, measured with the Affective Reactivity Index, and symptoms of externalizing and internalizing domains of psychopathology, measured with the Youth Self Report, in a volunteer community sample (N = 183) of 9- to 13-year-old (M = 11.39, SD = 1.07) boys and girls (37% White/Caucasian, 8% Asian, 11% Hispanic, 8% African American, 2% Native American, 2% Pacific Islander, 28% Other, and 3% not reported). A subset of the sample (n = 112) provided data at a 2-year follow-up, used to extend these associations. There were no sex differences in levels of irritability; however, the associations between irritability and symptom domains were moderated by sex. Specifically, in girls, irritability was associated equally with externalizing and internalizing symptoms. In contrast, in boys, irritability was associated more strongly with externalizing symptoms than with internalizing symptoms. Thus, across both sexes, irritability was moderately associated with externalizing symptoms, but the association between irritability and internalizing symptoms was stronger in girls than in boys. At follow-up, sex moderated the association between baseline irritability and later externalizing and internalizing symptoms. These findings indicate that irritability is associated with both externalizing and internalizing symptoms in early adolescence and that irritability is associated with internalizing symptoms more strongly in girls than in boys.

AB Objective: Alcohol-related disorders (i.e., abuse and dependence) are significant problems that may result in numerous negative consequences. Although a number of studies have examined factors that predict alcohol abuse and dependence in European samples. only a few studies have examined whether genetic and environmental factors influence the pathogenesis of alcohol-related disorders among African Americans. The present study examined whether gene (internalizing symptoms polygenic risk score) by environment (parental monitoring, community disadvantage) interactions were associated with alcohol-related disorders in a sample of African American adults. Method: Participants (N= 640; 39.7% male) were initially recruited for an elementary school-based universal prevention trial in a mid-Atlantic city and followed into adulthood. Participants reported on their perceptions of parental monitoring in sixth grade. At 30 years of age, participants reported on their alcohol abuse and dependence, and DNA was obtained and genotyped using Affymetrix 6.0 microarrays. An internalizing symptoms polygenic risk score was created using discovery samples results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that involved three large population-based studies. Community disadvantage was calculated based on census data when participants were in first grade. Results: There was a significant interaction between the internalizing symptoms polygenic risk score and community disadvantage such that exposure to higher community disadvantage was associated with lower risk for alcohol-related disorders among participants with a higher internalizing symptoms polygenic risk score. Conclusions: Our findings highlight that higher genetic loading for internalizing symptoms may protect urban African Americans from alcohol-related disorders, particularly in more disadvantaged areas.

AB The response patterns of youth who witness bullying have potential to influence future occurrence and persistence of bullying behaviors. Prevention efforts have included an increased focus on bystander interventions; however, the majority of adolescents rarely intervene in bullying situations. When they do, they often display of mixed pattern of behaviors. To better understand factors related to adolescent responses to witnessing bullying, the current study drew upon school climate survey data reported by 57,314 middle and high school students. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated higher odds of bully assisting behavior among those with higher externalizing symptoms and higher odds of defending the targets among those with elevated internalizing symptoms. Prior victimization was associated with higher odds of all bystander-behavior response types. These findings highlight the salient role of youth's prior victimization and mental health in youth responses to witnessing bullying. Implications for bystander-focused bullying prevention efforts are considered.

AB Few studies have examined parental variables in relation to gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) youth outcomes. This study aimed to establish the reliability and validity of observational codes that examined parental acceptance, emotional support, and ambivalence, and to examine the impact of these parental variables on GLB youth internalizing and externalizing problems, substance use problem severity, and GLB negative identity. Participants included 36 GLB parent-youth dyads at baseline, and out of those, 27 completed the 2-year follow-up. Results provided support for the reliability and validity of the observational codes. Parental ambivalence was positively correlated to youth-report of parental rejection, but was unrelated to parents' self-reports of rejection. Additionally, parental acceptance of sexual orientation at baseline was inversely related to GLB youth externalizing symptoms 2 years later, and parental emotional support was inversely related to GLB youth internalizing symptoms and substance use problem severity; however, there were no associations with GLB negative identity. Parental ambivalence was not related to longitudinal outcomes. The results of this study have implications for interventions targeting GLB youth and their parents.

AB We investigated relationships between binge-eating symptoms and emotional-behavioral problems in 382 community-adolescents (aged 13-18 years, M = 15, SD = 1; 61% girls), analyzing gender differences. Few studies have investigated binge eating in community-adolescents and none have explored gender differences in Italy. Participants completed the Binge Eating Scale (BES) and the Youth Self Report (YSR 11/18), which measures internalizing, externalizing and other problems (e.g. binge-drinking, substance abuse). 6% of adolescents (99% girls) were at-risk of binge-eating symptoms. In both gender, binge-eating symptoms were correlated with internalizing and other problems (all p < .001), but unexpectedly they were correlated with externalizing problems only in girls. The set of internalizing, externalizing and other problems predicted 23% of variance in BES among girls; only other problems predicted 12% of variance in BES among boys. Results identified gender-specific and non-specific risk factors for binge eating in Italian community-adolescents, that should be further investigated.

AB Research has shown a link between specific learning disorders (SLD) and both internalizing (e.g., anxiety and depression) and externalizing problems (e.g., anger and aggressive behavior). However, the predictive factors of these behaviors have not been examined in significant depth. The main purpose of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the possible presence of learned helplessness as the main predictor of the development of internalizing/externalizing problems in students. The present study also aims to verify whether there are differences between pre-adolescent students with and without SLD in terms of learned helplessness in school and the development of internalizing/externalizing problems. The sample consisted of 84 students, with an average age of 12.9 years (SD=1.42). A total of 52 males (62 %) and 32 females (38 %) were divided into two groups, based on the presence of SLD (44 students with SLD and 40 without). The results showed that students with SLD demonstrated higher levels of internalizing problems. Further, although learned helplessness in a student was not a predictor of externalizing problems in the group without SLD, it was predictive of internalizing and externalizing problems in the group with it. The study's results, directions for future research, and implications for the psychological wellbeing of students are also discussed.

AB Given that young children of mothers with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) exhibit increased risk for maladaptive outcomes (including being maltreated by their caregivers), this study investigated a comprehensive model for predicting children's emotional and behavioral problems in the context of mothers' ACEs. A community sample of 146 mothers with children aged one and onehalf to five years provided ratings of their ACEs, depressive symptoms, parenting characteristics, mother-young child attachment, and young children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Mothers' ACEs and depressive symptoms predicted uniquely young children's internalizing problems. In contrast, mothers' ACEs, depressive symptoms, and punitive parenting behaviors predicted uniquely young children's externalizing problems. These results suggested the importance of trauma-informed interventions for high-risk mothers who may be involved with child welfare systems and for their young children who are likely to exhibit emotional and behavioral problems as child custody decisions are made.

   SAMPLE
AB Background: The investigation aimed to estimate the association between carbonated soft drink consumption frequency and externalizing and internalizing behaviour among university students in five ASEAN counties.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey included 3353 university students from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, median age 20 years (interquartile range 3 years).
   Results: In all five ASEAN countries, the study found a prevalence no soft drink consumption in the past 30 days of 20.3%, less than one time a day 44.7%, once a day 25.4% and two or more times a day 9.6%. In the adjusted logistic regression analysis, higher frequency of soft drink consumption (one and/or two or more times a day) was associated with externalizing behaviour (in physical fight, injury, current tobacco use, problem drinking, drug use, pathological internet use and gambling behaviour), and higher frequency of soft drink consumption (two or more times a day) was associated with depression in females, but no association was found for the general student population in relation to internalizing behaviour (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt and sleeping problem).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that carbonated soft drink consumption is associated with a number of externalizing but not internalizing health risk behaviours.

AB There is general agreement in the research literature that youth in juvenile justice facilities are more likely to experience mental health disorders than their general population peers. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the methodological characteristics and effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered in juvenile justice settings on symptoms associated with internalizing disorders. The 11 studies included in the current review incorporated pretest-posttest research designs and were conducted with juveniles in secure facilities that reported outcome measures of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, or internalizing disorders. Meta-analytic findings indicate mixed results for interventions affecting internalizing symptoms and varying results between studies implementing an experimental design compared to those using a single group non-experimental design. Additionally, no studies examined how interventions could be incorporated into daily activities in juvenile justice facilities, such as school and classroom activities. Lastly, the limited number of studies included in the current review indicates a continued need for further experimental research on the effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered to youth in juvenile justice facilities.

AB This randomized controlled trial examined the longitudinal effects of two school-based indicated depression prevention programs on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as measured by adolescents, their parents, and their teachers. One hundred eighty-six adolescents participated in this study. The average age was 14.01 (SD = 1.22) years, and the sample was 66.7% female. One third of the sample belonged to a racial minority. Youth received either Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training or group counseling. Symptoms were assessed using adolescent, parent, and teacher reports on the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment at baseline, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. Adolescents reported the most robust effects in favor of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training. Adolescents in Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training reported significantly greater reductions in internalizing symptoms through the 6-month follow-up and significantly greater reductions in externalizing symptoms during the intervention as compared to group counseling. Less robust effects were found when examining parent and teacher reports, although there was evidence of significant within-group change in parent-and teacher-reported internalizing symptoms for both interventions and significant between-group differences in teacher-reported externalizing symptoms. This study provides additional evidence supporting the efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training as a depression prevention program for adolescents. Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training appears to have fast-acting effects on broadband internalizing and externalizing symptoms as reported by adolescents. This suggests that Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training may serve as a transdiagnostic preventive intervention. Moreover, given the disparate reports of adolescents, parents, and teachers, this study demonstrates the significance of collecting information from multiple sources when possible.

AB Our aim was to investigate whether four treatment features (i.e., the inclusion of parental involvement, goal-setting strategies, maintenance/relapse prevention sessions, the addition of booster sessions) were associated with posttreatment and follow-up effect size of youth cognitive behavioral therapies (yCBTs) for anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in age groups spanning young children to adolescents. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of 106 yCBTs tested in 76 randomized clinical trials from the PracticeWise Database to examine average effects of yCBTs posttreatment and at a later follow-up assessment. We coded the use of parental involvement, goal setting, booster sessions, and maintenance/relapse prevention in each yCBT and conducted random-effects meta-regression analyses to investigate whether these treatment features were associated with yCBT effects at posttreatment as well as at follow-up. Overall, yCBTs produced large pre- to posttreatment effects (d = 1.05), 95% confidence interval [0.94, 1.15], and larger pre-to follow-up effects (d = 1.29), 95% confidence interval [1.18, 1.40]. Metaregression results indicated that parental involvement was significantly associated with larger pre- to posttreatment effect sizes as well as pre-to follow-up effect sizes. Booster sessions, goal setting, and maintenance/relapse prevention were not significantly related to effect sizes at posttreatment or follow-up. Parental involvement may be helpful for maximizing long-term effectiveness of yCBT. Future studies should investigate for whom and under what conditions inclusion of yCBT treatment features is related to the durability of treatment gains.

AB Self-esteem is a potent indicator of mental health in typically developing (TYP) individuals. It is surprising that there have been few comprehensive investigations of self-esteem in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), given that they are at high risk for comorbid mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. The objectives of the current study were to assess how youth with ASD rate their self-esteem compared to age-matched TYP youth and to examine how self-esteem relates to internalizing psychopathology and theory of mind in the two groups. Seventy-three children and adolescents, ages 9 to 17, were administered a battery of questionnaires assessing self-esteem and internalizing symptoms, as well as tasks designed to measure theory of mind. Results indicated that youth with ASD rated their self-esteem significantly lower than did TYP youth. Self-esteem was strongly related to depression in both groups but was negatively related to theory of mind only for youth with ASD. These results may provide important insights into how individuals with ASD form evaluations of their own self-worth and illustrate how increasing self-awareness in individuals with ASD is not without risks.

AB Empirical work has examined the utility of using person-centered statistical approaches emphasizing traits to parsing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) heterogeneity in preschool and school-age children. However, trait-based profiles have not yet been examined in other age ranges, specifically adolescence and young adulthood. Therefore, the goal of the present study is to examine trait-based profiles in adolescents and young adults with ADHD to evaluate their similarity with trait-based profiles in preschoolers and children with ADHD and through comparison with external correlates (e.g., comorbidity). One hundred eighty-two adolescents and 287 young adults completed measures of ADHD symptoms, personality and temperament traits, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Latent profile analysis suggested at least 3 consistent trait-based profiles related to ADHD within adolescents and young adults: low extraversion, high extraversion, and high neuroticism. These profiles were largely similar to those found in preschool and middle childhood and demonstrated similar comorbidity patterns, namely, the low-extraversion profile exhibited higher internalizing problems, the high-extraversion profile exhibited higher externalizing problems, and the small high-neuroticism profile exhibited descriptively higher levels of all comorbid problems. Such profiles may have utility for personalization of intervention based on trait profiles and comorbidity patterns, as well as-more speculatively-possible prognostic utility.

   ASSOCIATION; ADJUSTMENT; QUANTITY; SYMPTOMS; QUALITY
AB Efforts to establish an empirical basis for recommended sleep durations during adolescence need to take into account individual differences in optimum sleep, defined as the amount of sleep at which peak functioning is observed. A total of 419 adolescents (M-age=15.03 years) with Mexican American backgrounds reported their nightly sleep duration and daily mood for a 2-week period at 1 or 2 waves of data collection, 1 year apart. Adolescents also completed an established measure of symptomatology. Multilevel modeling revealed a nonlinear association between sleep duration and next-day mood, whereby both too little and too much sleep were associated with elevated levels of daily distress. Significant individual differences in optimum sleep were observed such that younger adolescents and those with elevated levels of internalizing and total symptomatology evidenced greater sleep durations on nights before they reported their lowest levels of daily distress. Younger adolescents and those with higher internalizing and total symptomatology may need more sleep to reach their peak functioning the next day, at least in terms of daily mood.

AB The current study examined the associations between internalizing symptoms and adolescents' recognition of vocal socioemotional expressions produced by youth. Fifty-seven youth (8-17years old, M=12.62, SD=2.66; 29 anxious, 28 nonanxious; 32 female, 25 male) were asked to identify the intended expression in auditory recordings of youth's portrayals of basic emotions and social attitudes. Recognition accuracy increased with age, suggesting that the ability to recognize vocal affect continues to develop into adolescence. Anxiety symptoms were not associated with recognition ability, but youth's depressive symptoms were related to poorer identification of anger and happiness. Youth experiencing symptoms of depression may be likely to misinterpret vocal expressions of happiness and anger.

AB Although convergence in parent-youth reports of adolescent psychopathology is critical for treatment planning, research documents a pervasive lack of agreement in ratings of adolescents' symptoms. Attachment insecurity (particularly disorganized attachment) and impoverished reflective functioning (RF) are 2 theoretically implicated predictors of low convergence that have not been examined in the literature. In a cross-sectional investigation of adolescents receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment, we examined whether disorganized attachment and low (adolescent and parent) RF were associated with patterns of convergence in adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Compared with organized adolescents, disorganized adolescents had lower parent-youth convergence in reports of their internalizing symptoms and higher convergence in reports of their externalizing symptoms; low adolescent self-focused RF was associated with low convergence in parent-adolescent reports of internalizing symptoms, whereas low adolescent global RF was associated with high convergence in parent-adolescent reports of externalizing symptoms. Among adolescents receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment, disorganized attachment and lower RF were associated with weaker internalizing symptom convergence and greater externalizing symptom convergence, which if replicated, could inform assessment strategies and treatment planning in this setting.

AB Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the development of depressive disorders. Recent research has demonstrated the importance of distress tolerance in the onset and maintenance of depression during adulthood; however, little is known about its role in predicting depressive symptoms among adolescents. The current study examines the effect of distress tolerance and co-occurring negative life events on the developmental trajectory of depressive symptoms from middle to late adolescence. Our sample included 117 adolescent boys and girls (44.4% female, 54.6% White). Participants were, on average, 16 years old at baseline (SD=0.90) and completed self-report inventories of negative life events and depressive symptoms; distress tolerance was assessed using a behavioral measure. Utilizing a latent growth curve approach, we found a significant interaction between distress tolerance and negative life events in predicting increases in depressive symptoms over time. Follow-up analyses suggest that negative life events were associated with greater increases in depressive symptoms over time for adolescents with lower levels of distress tolerance only. The study highlights the moderating role of distress intolerance in the relation between negative life events and depressive symptoms, and underscores the importance of targeting distress tolerance for treating depression among youth.

AB Background: The aim of this investigation was to estimate the prevalence of past 12-month suicide attempts and associated factors among in-school adolescents in Guatemala.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 2014 "Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS)'' included 4,274 students (median age 14 years, interquartile range=2 years) that were representative of all middle school students in Guatemala.
   Results: The prevalence of past 12-month suicide attempt was 16.6%, 12.2% among boys and 20.2% among girls. Among students with a suicide attempt in the past year, 52.8% had a suicide plan in the past year. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, male sex and loneliness were associated with past 12-month suicide attempt, and among boys, none of the variables, and among girls, loneliness and current alcohol use were associated with past 12-month suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: A high prevalence and several specific factors associated with suicide attempt were identified which can help in guiding preventive strategies.

AB Self-efficacy has an impact on the academic results of our students. This can be related to the internalizing and externalizing problems of the individual. We evaluated 1402 secondary students between 12 to 17 years old (50.71% male, M = 14.94 years) in the region of Zaragoza in order to analyse the relationship between internalizing, externalizing and self-efficacy problems. The results show how women obtained higher scores in internalizing problems and men in externalizing problems regarding aggression and antisocial behaviour. Internalizing problems such as Depression, Obsession-Compulsion (R-2=.302) in the case of men and Depression and Anxiety (R-2=.458) in the case women acted as predictors of self-efficacy. In addition, none of the externalizing problems predicted self-efficacy. The model between self-efficacy, internalizing and externalizing problems obtained a good fit and internalizing factors showed an inverse relationship with self-efficacy (r=-.36), while externalizing problems showed a low correlation (r=.12) with this. In conclusion, the study showed how a greater presence of internalizing problems leads to lower self-efficacy in secondary students as well as the scarce influence of externalizing problems in relation to self-efficacy.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to analyze the discriminant validity and the clinical cut off scores of the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 (CBCL 1.5-5) in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and non-ASD.
   Methods: In total, 104 ASD and 441 non-ASD infants were included in the study. T-test, discriminant analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and odds ratio analysis were performed on the data.
   Results: The discriminant validity was confirmed by mean differences and discriminant analysis on the subscales of Emotionally reactive, Somatic complaints, Withdrawn, Sleep problems, Attention problems, Aggressive behavior, Internalizing problems, Externalizing problems, and Total problems, along with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented scales between the two groups. ROC analysis showed that the following subscales significantly separated ASD from normal infants: Emotionally reactive, Somatic complaints, Withdrawn, Sleep problems, Attention problems, Aggressive behavior, Internalizing problems, Externalizing problems, Total problems, and DSM pervasive developmental problems. Moreover, the clinical cut off score criteria adopted in the Korean-CBCL 1.5-5 were shown to be valid for the subscales Withdrawn, Internalizing problems, Externalizing problems, Total problems, and DSM pervasive developmental problems.
   Conclusion: The subscales of Withdrawn, Internalizing problems, Externalizing problems, Total problems, and DSM pervasive developmental problems significantly discriminated infants with ASD.

AB Sickle cell disease (SCD), a common hematological disorder, has received increased interest from researchers who set to discover whether individuals with SCD are at risk for depression. However, the prevalence of depression varies substantially between published studies. Therefore, two aims were identified in this critical review: (1) to summarize the prevalence of depression among children and adolescents diagnosed with SCD and (2) identify if disease severity predicts rates of depression within this population. Results from the 13 studies included in this review show the prevalence of depression was between 4%-46%. Pain predicted a higher occurrence of depression within this population.

AB The present study examined the effects of family socialization in the form of family processes and parenting practices on youth children's internalizing and externalizing problems concomitantly in a sample of Chinese parent-child dyads. The results generally support that (1) family socialization is crucially influential on the youth outcomes, in which parenting is a function of family processes; (2) youth's psychosocial maturity significantly mediates the effects of family socialization on their outcomes; (3) effects of family processes are observed more pronounced as compared with parenting practices; and (4) more complicatedly varying effects of family processes and parenting practices on the youth outcomes appear when setting free the mediations of psychosocial maturity across different structural models. Service implications of the findings and future research directions are briefly discussed.

AB Background: Birth weight (BW) is often used as a proxy for gestational age (GA) in studies on preterm birth. Recent findings indicate that, in addition to perinatal outcomes, subjects born very preterm (VP; GA < 32 weeks) differ from those with a very low birth weight (VLBW; BW < 1,500 g) in postnatal growth up to their final height. Objective: To study whether neurodevelopmental and functional outcomes at the age of 19 years differ in VP and/or VLBW subjects. Methods: 705 19-year-old subjects from the Project on Preterm and Small-for-Gestational-Age Infants (POPS) cohort were classified as (1) VP+/VLBW+ (n = 354), (2) VP+/VLBW-(n = 144), or (3) VP-/VLBW+ (n = 207), and compared with regard to IQ as assessed with the Multicultural Capacity Test-intermediate level; neuromotor function using Touwen's examination of mild neurologic dysfunction; hearing loss; self-and parent-reported behavioral and emotional functioning; educational achievement and occupation; and self-assessed health using the Health Utilities Index and the London Handicap Scale. Results: VP+/VLBW-infants, on average, had 3.8-point higher IQ scores (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57.1), a trend towards higher educational achievement, 3.3dB better hearing (95% CI 1.2-5.4), and less anxious behavior, attention problems, and internalizing behavior than to VP+/VLBW+ subjects. VP-/VLBW+ infants reported 1.8 increased odds (95% CI 1.2-2.6) of poor health compared to VP+/VLBW+ subjects. Conclusions: At the age of 19 years, subjects born VP+/VLBW+, VP+/VLBW-, and VP-/VLBW+ have different neurodevelopmental and functional outcomes, although effect sizes are small. Hence, the terms VP and VLBW are not interchangeable. We recommend, at least for industrialized countries, to base inclusion in future studies on preterm populations on GA instead of on BW.

AB The aim of this study is threefold: a. to investigate the psychometric characteristics of the Turkish Form of Student Risk Screening Scale (SRSS-T) that was developed to determine the risk students for emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), b. to examine whether the SRSS scores of the students change according to the gender and grade levels, and c. to determine the elementary school students at high-risk group for emotional and behavioral problems based on SRSS scores. 108 teachers from 10 public elementary school administrated the SRSS for 2378 students. According to results of the analyses, the Turkish Form of the instrument has good validity and reliability, similar to the original form and the percentage of high-risk students in elementary school was approximately 6%. Total score and externalizing score of the boys and internalizing behaviors of girls were significantly higher than that of the others. In addition, total and subscale scores of 4th graders were higher than the scores of remaining of the groups. Results were discussed in terms of literature, limitation of the study was explained and recommendations for future studies were presented.

AB An emerging body of evidence shows that parents' non-standard work schedules have a detrimental effect on children's well-being. However, only a limited number of studies have investigated mediating factors that underpin this association. Likewise, only a few studies have examined the impact of fathers' non-standard work schedules on children's well-being. Based on data from the Families in Germany Study (FiD), this study aimed to address these research gaps. The sample consists of parents and their children at ages 7-8 and 9-10 (n = 838 child observations in dual-earner families). The data were collected in the years 2010-2013. Non-standard work hours were defined as working in evenings and or at night (every day, several times a week, or changing as shifts). Children's social and emotional well-being was measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The findings show that both mothers' and fathers' evening and night work schedules are linked to an increase in children's externalizing and internalizing behavior and that this association is partially mediated by mothers' and fathers' harsh and strict parenting, with a stronger mediation effect for fathers parenting.

AB Supportive parenting is known to protect against psychosomatic manifestations of distress, yet the mechanisms through which this association operates are less clear. The present study evaluates children's self-esteem as a mediator, partially explaining the association between parent-child relationship quality and psychosomatic problems from late childhood to mid-adolescence. Results from a large, nationally-representative Canadian sample indicated that self-esteem partially mediated these associations, and self-esteem accounted for more shared variance between parent-child relationship quality and psychosomatic problems among younger children. Among older children, shared variance with self-esteem explained a smaller portion of this association, but the remaining direct effect of parent-child relationship on psychosomatic problems was larger. These findings suggest that supportive parents protect against psychosomatic problems, and that they do so by promoting self-esteem for younger children and through other mechanisms as children age. Results are discussed in the context of attachment theory and age-related trends in self-esteem development.

AB The prevalence of bullying has increased over the past decade and is a public health concern. Existing measures of bullying lack breadth and/or psychometric support, which may inaccurately represent current rates of bullying. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a psychometrically sound measure, the Multidimensional Bullying Victimization Scale (MBVS), to evaluate bullying in adolescents. An initial pool of items was generated and rated by 600 adolescents. Exploratory factor analyses yielded three factors-direct bulling, indirect bullying, and evaluative bullying. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on independent sample of 623 adolescents, supporting the original three-factor solution. Results indicate that the MBVS demonstrates good internal consistency, construct validity, and concurrent validity. The MBVS scores were significantly and positively correlated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The MBVS provides a reliable and valid assessment of adolescents' experiences with bully victimization.

AB Increasing data indicate that prevalent forms of psychopathology can be organized into second-order dimensions based on their correlations, including a general factor of psychopathology that explains the common variance among all disorders and specific second-order externalizing and internalizing factors. Nevertheless, most existing studies on the neural correlates of psychopathology employ case-control designs that treat diagnoses as independent categories, ignoring the highly correlated nature of psychopathology. Thus, for instance, although perturbations in white matter microstructure have been identified across a range of mental disorders, nearly all such studies used case-control designs, leaving it unclear whether observed relations reflect disorder-specific characteristics or transdiagnostic associations. Using a representative sample of 410 young adult twins oversampled for psychopathology risk, we tested the hypothesis that some previously observed relations between white matter microstructure properties in major tracts and specific disorders are related to second-order factors of psychopathology. We examined fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). White matter correlates of all second-order factors were identified after controlling for multiple statistical tests, including the general factor (FA in the body of the corpus callosum), specific internalizing (AD in the fornix), and specific externalizing (AD in the splenium of the corpus callosum, sagittal stratum, anterior corona radiata, and internal capsule). These findings suggest that some features of white matter within specific tracts may be transdiagnostically associated multiple forms of psychopathology through second-order factors of psychopathology rather with than individual mental disorders.

AB The authors' purpose was to evaluate the multiple-gate Preschool Behavior Screening System (PBSS) for identifying children's social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) difficulties. The sample included 122 triads of preschool children between 3 and 5 years old and their parents and teachers. The teacher and parent samples were predominantly women and European American with a substantial African American representation. The design involved numerous indicators of the reliability of scores and the validity of ensuing inferences. Scores from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition were used as criterion measures for scores from the PBSS. The PBSS scores were found reliable across scales with Cronbach's alpha values ranging from .85 to .97. Agreement between teachers and parents was consistent with findings from previous research. Analyzed within a Multitrait-Multi method Matrix, correlational evidence supported inferences about externalizing difficulties, prosocial behavior, and total problems, as well as internalizing difficulties to a lesser degree. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses supported the PBSS across a range of scales and cut scores. Findings support the use of the PBSS as one method for identifying preschool children who may be at risk for SEB difficulties and underscore the importance of using multiple informants in the assessment of SEB difficulties.

   ACTIVITY
AB It is broadly accepted that children of all age groups including (preterm) neonates and young infants can perceive pain and that there is an absolute need to treat their pain safely and effectively. The approved treatment options for children, particularly (preterm) neonates and young infants, are very limited with only a few medications specifically labelled for this population. This article presents the challenges of developing pain medications for children. A short overview gives information on pain in children, including pain perception, prevalence of pain and the long-term consequences of leaving pain untreated in this vulnerable population. Current pain management practices are briefly discussed. The challenges of conducting pediatric clinical trials in general and trials involving analgesic medications in particular within the regulatory framework available to develop these medications for children are presented. Emphasis is given to the operational hurdles faced in conducting a pediatric clinical trial program. Some suggestions to overcome these hurdles are provided based on our experience during the pediatric trial program for the strong analgesic tapentadol used for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.

AB School children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) present difficulties in the interaction and social communication and cognitive rigidity and execution that make them especially vulnerable to bullying; however, research has been less profuse. The purpose of this paper is to review and consider the most recent studies on ASD and bullying. The method used has endorsed the PRISMA statement. The final sample is made up of 29 articles that reveal that these studies have been carried out with samples of fewer than 450 students with ASD. Likewise, it is pointed out that there are discrepancies in the understanding of bullying and the factors that predict it and that the prevalence of bullying is higher than the one published for normative schoolchildren. The results are discussed in comparison with previous reviews and new challenges are posed for the design of effective psycho-educational intervention programs specific for these students.

DT Article; Book Chapter
ID IDENTITY; YOUTH; AMERICANIZATION
AB Remote acculturation (RA) is a modern form of non-migrant acculturation toward distant cultures prompted by indirect/ intermittent globalization-related cultural exposure. RA theory holds that not only are global cultures now pouring into local neighborhoods, but many youth are also internalizing these remote cultures. How well do they fare? Prior studies in Jamaica and elsewhere have reported that U. S./ Western-oriented adolescents exhibit poorer health habits. However, no studies have yet investigated adolescents' behavioral or academic adjustment in the context of RA, whether in Jamaica or elsewhere. Therefore, 245 adolescents and their mothers from high schools in Kingston, Jamaica (M-adolescent_age = 13.3; M-mother_age = 40.2) completed questionnaires assessing their RA in terms of behaviors and values, as well as the adolescents' behavioral resilience and grades. SEM analyses revealed that RA was, indeed, linked to adolescent behavioral and academic adjustment in Jamaica. Overall, Jamaican orientation was associated with better adaptation whereas European American orientation was associated with worse. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   CARE; DAYTIME; QUALITY
AB Purpose: Major changes in the timing, duration, and function of sleep occur during childhood. These changes include the transition from habitual napping to infrequent napping. This transition is likely to reflect, at least in part, neurocognitive development. This study sought to identify factors that discriminate between four groups of children with different teacher-reported responses to naptime in childcare: those who nap (nappers), sometimes nap (transitioners), do not nap (resters), and neither nap, nor lie still (problem nappers).
   Methods: Standardized observations of sleep and sleep behaviors, daytime behaviors across a number of domains, and direct neurocognitive assessment of 158 preschool aged children (aged 49-72 months; 54% male) attending childcare centers in Queensland (QLD), Australia, were adopted as part of a large longitudinal study of early childhood, the Effective Early Education Experiences (E4Kids) study. Discriminant function analysis was used to examine how age, parent education, nighttime sleep duration, cognitive functioning, behavior problems, and temperament differentiated the four groups.
   Results: Three discriminant functions were identified and defined as maturation (strong loadings of nighttime sleep duration, cognitive function, and age), socioeconomic status (parental cation), and behavioral problems (externalizing behavior, temperament, and internalizing behavior). These functions accounted for 62.9%, 32.6%, and 4.5% of the between-groups variance, respectively. Children defined as nappers (n= 44) had significantly shorter duration of nighttime sleep, were younger, and had lower cognitive functioning scores than did other groups. Problem nappers, (n= 25) were more likely to have parents with lower levels of education than did transitioners (n= 41). Standard behavior and temperament measures did not significantly differentiate the groups.
   Conclusion: The findings support an interaction between cognitive development, sleep behaviors, and the individual needs and circumstances of children. Further research in this area could make a strong contribution to theory and practice in early childhood education, and a strong contribution to understanding of children's development.

AB The widespread use of virtual social networks (VSN) by adolescents makes it possible to conduct psychological assessments or health promotion using these platforms. However, psychometric properties of them should be validated. This study aimed to test the feasibility of administering the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) over a secure social network, while preserving its original psychometric properties. To do so, a sample of 703 adolescents (M= 13.86 years, SD= 0.49) completed the questionnaire either over a social network or using paper and pencil. We tested a two-way format equivalence: quantitative equivalence (comparing score distributions across versions); and qualitative or conceptual equivalence (comparing the between-factor correlations between versions and measurement invariance). As a result, no difference was found between the score distributions of the two versions and between-factor intercorrelations with similar patterns in both versions. Finally, both methods for administering the RCADS showed an adequate fit with their theoretical latent structure, thus preserving format equivalence. To sum up, VSN may, therefore, constitute appropriate contexts for conducting psychological assessment and research among adolescents.

AB IMPORTANCE More than 50% of lifetime mental health disorders develop by early adolescence, and yet it is not well understood how early childhood social-emotional functioning varies in populations or how differences in functioning may be associated with emerging mental health conditions.
   OBJECTIVES To identify profiles of social-emotional functioning at kindergarten school entry (age 5 years) and to examine to what extent profiles are related to early-onset mental health conditions (ages 6-14 years).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study followed up a population cohort of 34 552 children in British Columbia, Canada, from birth (born 1996-1998) to age 14 years (last follow-up, December 31, 2011). Data were analyzed from the Developmental Trajectories cohort that links British Columbia child development data from the Early Development Instrument (EDI) to British Columbia Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education records. Data were analyzed between May and September 2017.
   EXPOSURES Early childhood social-emotional functioning (defined as social competence, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms) rated by the children's kindergarten teachers.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Occurrences of physician-assessed mental health conditions throughout childhood and early adolescence, including depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), calculated from billing codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision recorded in provincial health insurance data.
   RESULTS Data from 34 323 children (mean [SD] age, 5.7 [0.3] years; 17 538 [51.1%] were boys) were analyzed at kindergarten and followed up to age 14 years (15 204 completed follow-up). Latent profile analysis identified 6 unique social-emotional functioning profiles at school entry, with 41.6% of children (n = 14 262) exhibiting comparative vulnerabilities in internalizing or externalizing behaviors. Prevalence of mental health conditions from ages 6 to 14 years was 4.0% for depression, 7.0% for anxiety, 5.5% for conduct disorder, 7.1% for ADHD, and 5.4% for multiple conditions. Zero-inflated Poisson analyses showed an association between social-emotional functioning profiles at kindergarten school entry and physician-assessed mental health conditions by age 14 years (range of adjusted odds ratios: depression, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.76-1.60] to 2.93 [95% CI, 1.93-4.44]; anxiety, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.74-1.36] to 1.73 [95% CI, 1.11-2.70]; conduct disorder, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.41-3.34] to 6.91 [95% CI, 4.90-9.74]; ADHD, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.11-1.93] to 8.72 [95% CI, 6.46-11.78]; and multiple conditions, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.88-1.63] to 6.81 [95% CI, 4.91-9.44]). Children with higher teacher ratings of aggression and hyperactivity had more frequent consultations for conduct disorder, ADHD, and multiple conditions.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study's findings suggest that more than 40% of children enter the school system with relative vulnerabilities in social-emotional functioning that are associated with early-onset mental health conditions. The results raise important questions for using population-level early childhood development monitoring in the context of universal and proactive mental health strategies.

AB The purpose of this study was to validate a version of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) for children and adolescents (WAI-CA). The sample included 109 children/adolescents aged between 7 and 17 years, outpatients in a Clinical Psychology Unit (Portugal), who completed the WAI-CA between psychotherapy sessions 3 and 35. A subsample of 30 children/adolescents aged between 10 and 14 years filled out both the WAI-CA and the WAI within a one-to-two week's interval. A subsample of 57 children/adolescents with ages between 7 and 17 years filled out the WAI-CA, and their accompanying parent the WAI. Results show high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ranging from .71 to .89) and good external validity. Significant differences were found in the bond subscale according to age, gender, and diagnosis, with higher values in children compared to adolescents, in girls compared to boys, and in participants with internalizing and externalizing problems compared to participants with school problems. Moderate to strong significant correlations were found between children/adolescents' WAI-CA and WAI scores and weak correlations between children/adolescents' WAI-CA scores and parent's WAI scores. Results suggest that the WAI-CA is a valid measure of working alliance to be used with children and adolescents.

AB This study investigated the role of temperamental anger in toddlerhood in the prediction of child socioemotional functioning at school entry and the moderating function of mother-child interactions in these predictive associations. The sample included 86 children. To assess child temperamental anger, mothers and fathers completed the Anger proneness scale of the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire when children were aged 2 years. The quality of mother-child interactions was also assessed when children were 2 years old with the Mutually Responsive Orientation scale. Child internalizing, externalizing and prosocial behaviors were reported by parents in kindergarten and first grade with the Child Behavior Checklist and the Socio-Affective Profile. The results indicated that anger proneness predicted higher internalizing and externalizing behavior, and lower prosocial behavior. In the case of internalizing behavior, the effect of anger was qualified by an interaction with the quality of mother-child interaction: anger proneness predicted higher internalizing behavior only among children who had higher-quality interactions with their mothers. These findings suggest that simultaneous consideration of temperament and parent-child relationships early on in development may help identify children at risk for experiencing adjustment difficulties at school entry, allowing for prompt intervention before difficulties crystallize.

AB The current study examined the association between early growth in expressive communication from 18 months (1.5 years: M=1.59 years, SD= 0.08 years) to 36 months (3 years: M=3.01 years, SD= 0.05) and internalizing and externalizing problems at 84 months (8 years: M=7.79 years, SD= 0.31) and the differences in this association by ethnicity. We hypothesized that lower rates of early expressive communication growth from 18 to 36 months would be associated with more behavior problems in childhood, and that this association would be stronger for African American than European American children. The sample included 206 full-term healthy African American and European American children from the Durham Child Health and Development Study. Parents reported family demographics and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors via questionnaires, while children completed language assessments in the laboratory. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed a significant interaction between growth in expressive communication and ethnicity for internalizing but not externalizing behavior, such that lower rates of expressive language growth were associated with increased internalizing behavior among African American children, but not among their European American peers. These findings suggest that the well-being of children from marginalized ethnic backgrounds may be disproportionately affected by reduced rates of language development, and that the provision of educational or clinical services for African American children in particular should consider the link between language skills and social and emotional well-being.

AB Teacher-child relationships (TCRs) have been found to play important roles in children's classroom experiences and learning during the elementary school years. Given the importance of TCRs, the present study examined the associations between conflictual and close TCRs, children's literacy achievement, and children's social competencies using a sample of 503 kindergarten and first grade non-struggling and struggling readers and their teachers in ten rural schools in the Southeastern United States. Moderation by struggling reader status was also explored in the associations between conflictual or close TCRs and children's literacy achievement and social competencies. After controlling for child- and teacher-level characteristics, results from multilevel model analyses indicated that conflictual TCRs were significantly related to lower literacy achievement, more internalizing behaviors, more externalizing behaviors, and fewer prosocial behaviors. Close TCRs were not related to child outcomes, and moderation by struggling reader status was not significant. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present longitudinal study examined the relative contribution of peer acceptance and individual and class-level teacher-child interactions to the development of externalizing and internalizing behaviors in kindergarten. A sample of 237 children (49% boys, M-age =5.19 years) from 36 classrooms was followed during three waves in kindergarten. Individual and class-level teacher-child interactions were observed, while peer ratings were used to assess peer acceptance, and teacher ratings to assess child behavior. Multilevel modelling showed that children's aggressive and anxious-fearful behavior was stable over time. Children who had more negative individual interactions with their teachers at the start of kindergarten displayed higher levels of externalizing behavior. Children whose teacher displayed more sensitive interactions at the class-level had lower levels of internalizing problems. Our study underscores the importance of including both individual and class-level teacher-child interactions and including several dimensions of the emotional component of teacher-child interactions in future research.

AB The link between maternal depression and negative child outcomes has been well-established; however, less is known regarding the impact of harsh parenting on child outcomes, especially for women living with depressive symptoms and whom also experienced child maltreatment. The purpose of this study was to examine harsh parenting practices as a mediator in this known association, in order to examine factors associated with negative child outcomes and to explore a reduction in future transmission of risk. Mediation analyses were conducted with 2 samples of mother-child dyads at separate time points (child age 6: n = 325; and youth age 12: n = 213) using data collected from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect. Only women who reported a history of childhood maltreatment were included in this study. Positive, significant associations were found between maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms at both ages. Further, partial mediation was established among maternal depressive symptoms, child outcomes, and harsh parenting practices. Analyses demonstrated that mothers with depressive symptoms and a history of maltreatment reported use of psychological and physical aggression with their children (age 6) and youth (age 12). Findings from this study bolstered existing research on maternal depression and child outcomes and extended current knowledge of the role of harsh parenting for children age 6 and youth age 12.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement
   Findings encourage public policy efforts to support social service agencies that offer parenting programs designed to reduce harsh parenting practices. For example, support for parenting interventions may serve as one such mechanism of change in the reduction of both parent and child mental health symptoms.

AB This study examined the assoc ration of parental-stigma with child adjustment, and whether parenting self-efficacy and parenting distress mediated the association. Cross-sectional data were collected from 186 families living with kindergarten children identified to have disabilities in Hong Kong, China (mean age = 61.62 months; 76% of them were boys). Using questionnaires, 173 mothers and 112 fathers reported their own self-stigma, parenting self-efficacy, and parenting distress, as well as their children's prosocial behaviors and externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Multieroup, path analyses revealed a group-invariant model for both mothers and fathers. Controlling for children's gender and age, parents' self-stigma was linked to fewer prosocial behaviors and more externalizing and internalizing behaviors among children. Moreover, such links were partially mediated by parenting self-efficacy, but not parenting distress. Theoretically, the findings highlighted the importance of considering family processes when examining the potential impact of parental self stigma on child adjustment. Practically, the findings pointed to the utility of helping both mothers and fathers to deal with public stigma and increase their parenting self-efficacy-in supporting the development of children with disabilities.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement
   This study demonstrated that, for both mothers and fathers of children with disabilities, parenting self-efficacy mediated the negative association between parental self-stigma and child adjustment. Therefore, it is important to involve both mothers and fathers of children with disabilities in community education and family intervention. Practitioners and policy makers should not only equip these parents smith knowledge about child development and the causes of disabilities, but also help them to reduce self-stigma and improve parenting self-efficacy.

Using a cohort sequential design, a sample of 653 adolescents (48% female, 87% Caucasian) in Grades 6-8 were assessed at 3 annual time points; data captured indices of peer victimization, likeability, popularity, and several peer-reported indices of internalizing (e.g., sadness, worry) and externalizing (e.g., anger, fighting) symptoms across Grades 6-10. Four trajectories of victimization experiences were identifiedchronic, high decreasing, low increasing, and low stablesuggesting instability in victimization experiences over time. Adolescents who experienced chronic victimization, as compared to those with low-stable, decreasing, or increasing levels of victimization, were rated by peers more often on indices of maladjustment and less often on measures of popularity and likeability. Findings highlight negative associations with chronic victimization and underscore the need for targeted interventions to prevent chronic victimization. Overall, findings further emphasize the role of chronicity in victimization and highlight the importance of identifying chronic victims for intervention and prevention efforts.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms are associated with social difficulties in children, though findings are mixed and many studies have used global measures of social impairment. The present study tested the hypothesis that SCT would be uniquely associated with aspects of social functioning characterized by withdrawal and isolation, whereas attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms would be uniquely associated with aspects of social functioning characterized by inappropriate responding in social situations and active peer exclusion. Participants were 158 children (70% boys) between 7-12years of age being evaluated for possible ADHD. Both parents and teachers completed measures of SCT, ADHD, ODD, and internalizing (anxiety/depression) symptoms. Parents also completed ratings of social engagement and self-control. Teachers also completed measures assessing asociality and exclusion, as well as peer ignoring and dislike. In regression analyses controlling for demographic characteristics and other psychopathology symptoms, parent-reported SCT symptoms were significantly associated with lower social engagement (e.g., starting conversations, joining activities). Teacher-reported SCT symptoms were significantly associated with greater asociality/withdrawal and ratings of more frequent ignoring by peers, as well as greater exclusion. ODD symptoms and ADHD hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were more consistently associated with other aspects of social behavior, including peer exclusion, being disliked by peers, and poorer self-control during social situations. Findings provide the clearest evidence to date that the social difficulties associated with SCT are primarily due to withdrawal, isolation, and low initiative in social situations. Social skills training interventions may be effective for children displaying elevated SCT symptomatology.

AB Psychopathology is posited to be transdiagnostically linked to chronic stress. Yet efforts to understand the specificity and directionality of these links have been sparse, and the ubiquitous comorbidity of psychopathology has made the seemingly nonspecific links between psychological disorders and chronic stress difficult to interpret. The current study used a latent dimensional bifactor model of psychopathology to account for comorbidity and a multiwave prospective design to disentangle temporal associations between psychopathology and chronic stress longitudinally during the critical adolescent period for psychopathology risk and stress reactivity. A community sample of 567 youth (55.5% female, age M=11.8 at baseline, M=15.1 at end of study) were followed prospectively for 3years, with chronic stress assessed with the Youth Life Stress Interview and psychopathology symptoms assessed via both self and parent report. Exposure to chronic stress predicted what is common across forms of psychopathology (the p factor), which in turn predicted generation of chronic stress over time. After accounting for comorbidity via the p factor, externalizing behaviors also had specific transactional links to chronic stress, whereas links between internalizing psychopathology and chronic stress were completely accounted for by common psychopathology. The results provide the first direct evidence that chronic stress is transdiagnostically and reciprocally linked to psychopathology, during a critical youth period for psychopathology onset and stress reactivity.

AB Anxiety typically arises early in childhood and decreases during school age. However, little is known about the earlier developmental course of anxiety in preschool, especially in at risk children, posing a clinically important problem. Given that anxiety in youth has a chronic course for some and also predicts later development of other mental health problems, it is important to identify factors early in development that may predict chronic anxiety symptoms. At-risk children (oversampled for depression) and caregivers completed 6 assessment waves beginning at preschool age (between 3-5.11years of age) up through 6.5years later. Growth mixture models revealed 4 distinct trajectories: 2 stable groups (high and moderate) and 2 decreasing groups (high and low). Important to note, the high stable anxiety group had greater baseline depression and social adversity/risk, higher average maternal depression over time, and poorer average social functioning over time compared to the high decreasing group. The high decreasing group also had greater externalizing/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder scores than the low decreasing group. Children with anxiety in early childhood who also experience high depression, social adversity/risk, maternal depression, and poor social functioning may be at risk for chronic symptoms over time.

AB Dysfunction in cortico-limbic circuitry is implicated in internalizing disorders (i.e., depressive and anxious disorders), but less is known about whether structural variations precede frank disorder and thus potentially mark risk. We therefore examined associations between white matter (WM) tract microstructure in cortico-limbic circuitry at age 7 and concurrent and longitudinal patterns of internalizing symptoms in 42 typically developing girls using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Girls' internalizing symptoms were concurrently associated with reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in segments of the cingulum bundle (CB) and the uncinate fasciculus (UF), bilaterally. Moreover, latent profile analysis showed that girls with increasing internalizing symptoms, based on assessments at ages 3, 6, 7, and 8, had reduced FA in these segments compared to girls with stably low symptoms. These results point to a putative neural mechanism underlying the course of childhood internalizing symptoms.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests brain network dysfunction in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Whether large-scale brain network connectivity patterns reflect clinical heterogeneity in ADHD remains to be fully understood. This study aimed to characterize the differential within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) changes in children with ADHD combined (ADHD-C) or inattentive (ADHD-I) subtypes and their associations with ADHD symptoms. We studied the task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 58 boys with ADHD and 28 demographically matched healthy controls. We measured within- and between-network connectivity of both low-level (sensorimotor) and high-level (cognitive) large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks and network modularity. We found that children with ADHD-C but not those with ADHD-I exhibited hyper-connectivity within the anterior default mode network (DMN) compared with controls. Additionally, children with ADHD-C had higher inter-network FC between the left executive control (ECN) and the salience (SN) networks, between subcortical and visual networks, and between the DMN and left auditory networks than controls, while children with ADHD-I did not show differences compared with controls. Similarly, children with ADHD-C but not ADHD-I showed lower network modularity compared with controls. Importantly, these observed abnormal inter-network connectivity and network modularity metrics were associated with Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems and internalizing problems in children with ADHD. This study revealed relatively greater loss of brain functional network segregation in childhood ADHD combined subtype compared to the inattentive subtype, suggesting differential large-scale functional brain network topology phenotype underlying childhood ADHD heterogeneity.

AB Research has supported the applied use of Direct Behavior Rating Single-Item Scale (DBR-SIS) targets of "academic engagement" and "disruptive behavior" for a range of purposes, including universal screening and progress monitoring. Though useful in evaluating social behavior and externalizing problems, these targets have limited utility in evaluating emotional behavior and internalizing problems. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to support the initial development and validation of a novel DBR-SIS target of "unhappy," which was intended to tap into the specific construct of depression. A particular focus of this study was on the novel target's utility within universal screening. A secondary purpose was to further validate the aforementioned existing DBR-SIS targets. Within this study, 87 teachers rated 1,227 students across two measures (i.e., DBR-SIS and the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Checklist [TOCA-C]) and time points (i.e., fall and spring). Correlational analyses supported the test-retest reliability of each DBR-SIS target, as well as its convergent and discriminant validity across concurrent and predictive comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses further supported (a) the overall diagnostic accuracy of each target (as indicated by the area under the curve [AUC] statistic), as well as (b) the selection of cut scores found to accurately differentiate at-risk and not at-risk students (as indicated by conditional probability statistics). A broader review of findings suggested that across the majority of analyses, the existing DBR-SIS targets outperformed the novel "unhappy" target.
   Impact and Implications
   Research suggests that although many students exhibit within internalizing concerns, schools struggle to identify them in a timely manner. The results of the study indicate how the Direct Behavior Rating Single-Item Scales (DBR-SIS) can be used to identify students exhibiting such concerns.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) difficulties have been identified as an important target for clinical intervention in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). However, there is limited research regarding the use of specific strategies to regulate specific emotions following exposure to traumatic events. The aim of the current study was to investigate the indirect effects of four trauma-related emotions (anger, sadness, disgust, and fear) on PTSD severity via two mediators: derealization and self-harm. In particular, we tested that if the two hypothetical mediators operate sequentially, derealization precedes self-harm and/or self-harm precedes derealization. A predominate female clinical sample (N=109) of CSA survivors completed measures of experience of emotions, ER, and post-traumatic stress. Bivariate and serial mediation analyses were conducted to test the direct and indirect effects of trauma-related emotions on PTSD severity. Serial mediation analyses indicated that there were significant total effects of all trauma-related emotions on PTSD severity. Three trauma-related emotions (sadness, disgust, and fear) were indirectly associated to PTSD severity via derealization and self-harm and via self-harm and derealization. Results indicate that difficulties in regulating the emotions of sadness, disgust, and fear may result in more severe derealization and self-harm as coping strategies, which in turn lead to greater PTSD severity. The sequence of mediators does not hold great importance in these pathways. Overall, our findings suggest that therapeutically targeting derealization and self-harm might enable the reduction of PTSD among CSA survivors.

AB The longitudinal links between symptoms of externalizing difficulties-oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD)-and symptoms of depression are unclear. Therefore, we were interested in examining the temporal relation of symptoms of ODD, CD, and depression across 7 years in a sample of 643 10-year-old children (M = 10.91, SD = 0.36) at Time 1 using cross-lagged path analysis. Although symptoms of ODD predicted depressive symptoms across most time points and CD at Time 1 negatively predicted depressive symptoms at Time 3, evidence of the inverse relation was also found for both ODD and CD. Sex differences did not emerge. These findings add to the mixed literature on the directionality of externalizing and internalizing difficulties in children and adolescents by suggesting the presence of a reciprocal relation.

AB Children require adult caregivers to survive and thrive. In the absence of committed and nurturing care, children face increased risk for a number of difficulties, including internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, cognitive and language deficits, and social difficulties. Recent changes in the U.S. immigration system have resulted in a large number of children removed from their parents, drawing increased scrutiny to the impact of parent-child separation and best practices for caring for children who have been separated. Drawing from work on children exposed to institutional care, as well as research on children separated from caregivers due to validated abuse and neglect, it is clear that children belong in families that are safe and supportive and that some forms of substitute care (i.e., institutional or group-based care) are insufficient to meet children's needs. However, it is difficult to know the specific impact of parent-child separation on child outcomes given that stressors often cluster and pre-separation experiences and post-separation placements also contribute to the experience of separation from a parent and subsequent functioning. Attempts to parse the specific contributions of each separation-related stressor, examining sensitive periods in the impact of separation, studying the mechanisms by which separations affect children, and consideration of the broader social and political context are useful future directions for moving this area of study forward. We must also more fully probe the roles that caregivers play in child development. Lastly, we must endeavor to cease practices of removing children from loving and capable caregivers and, when necessary, provide support to parents and children who have experienced separation.

AB While ineffective discipline can be attributed to authoritarian and permissive parenting styles, little research has examined the role of gender in the association between parenting style and early childhood behavioral problems. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the effects of authoritarian and permissive parenting on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors during the preschool-to-elementary-school transition according to gender in Japan. A sample of 1668 Japanese children (853 boys and 815 girls) were followed longitudinally over one-year intervals, and assessed based on parenting styles (the Parenting Scale), children's behavioral problems (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and family characteristics. Multivariate analyses revealed that, when analyzed by gender, authoritarian discipline influenced externalizing problems in boys ( = 0.048, p = 0.047) and girls ( = 0.067, p = 0.023), while permissive discipline influenced externalizing problems in boys only ( = 0.049, p = 0.038). The results document the relationship between family processes and the development of disruptive behavior disorders in children. Support for parents employing such child-rearing styles in early childhood may be effective in reducing school maladjustment.

AB Objective: To evaluate the relationship of parent-reported child behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to cognition, language, and motor skills on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - III (Bayley-III) in toddlers born extremely preterm.
   Study design: Toddlers born extremely preterm (gestational ages 22 0/7 to 26 6/7 weeks) were tested at 22-26 months corrected age with Bayley-III while parents completed the CBCL. Socio-demographic variables and medical history were recorded. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship of Bayley-III cognitive, motor, and language scores with CBCL scores, adjusting for medical and socio-demographic factors.
   Results: Internalizing, affective, and pervasive development problem behavior scores on the CBCL correlated significantly with lower Bayley-III cognitive, language, and motor scores on unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Although externalizing and anxiety problems were significantly associated with cognitive and language scores on unadjusted analysis, the relationships were not significant after adjusting for socio-economic factors. CBCL scores were similar for boys and girls, with the exception of the pervasive developmental problem scale; boys had significantly more problems than girls (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: This study showed that parent reported behavior problems were related to lower cognitive, language, and motor development in toddlers born extremely preterm. Early findings of behavioral problems in toddlers born extremely premature may help identify children at greater risk for later learning difficulties. Adding a measure of behavior to the evaluation of these children may help better understand factors that can contribute to delays, especially in cognition and language.

AB Objective: The study reports the prevalence of disruptive behaviors in a help-seeking sample of young children across a diverse range of clinical diagnoses (based on ICD-10). Method: The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), a parent rating scale of disruptive behaviors, was completed on 310 children (2-11 years) at three child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in three German states (Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony); the majority of children were outpatients. Results: Mean intensity scores of disruptive behaviors differed significantly by diagnostic group, with the lowest ratings within a community sample, and increasingly higher scores in children with a diagnosis from the internalizing spectrum, those with pervasive developmental disorders, and finally, those with externalizing disorders (e.g. hyperkinetic disorder, conduct disorders). Seventy percent of the clinical sample, compared to only 17 % of the community sample, exceeded the normative cut-off score of 111, indicating that disruptive behaviors are common in young German children seeking help for different mental health problems. Conclusions: These findings support the Research Domain Criteria approach by showing that disruptive behaviors cross our current diagnostic labels and may need to be assessed and conceptualized in treatment planning, even in children without a primary diagnosis from the externalizing spectrum.

AB Children who experience polyvictimization (i.e., exposure to multiple and varied traumatic stressors) are at heightened risk for psychopathology. While polyvictims generally have worse outcomes than those with fewer types of traumatic experiences, not all polyvictims experience significant, or similar, impairment suggesting that polyvictims are a heterogeneous group. This variation in outcomes among polyvictimized children, may be due to differences in how poly victimization is operationalized and measured. The current study examines a clinically-referred sample of adolescents (N = 3754) aged 13-18 (M = 15.3, SD = 1.4) to examine whether poly victimization in early developmental age periods predict polyvictimization in later periods and whether there are differences in severity of adolescent psychopathology based on variations in timing of polyvictimization in childhood and adolescence. Results from latent class analysis (LCA) reveal the greater the number of developmental periods in which adolescents were classified as polyvictims, the greater the severity of PTSD, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems. In addition, there was variation in the relation between developmental timing of polyvictimization and different types of adolescent psychopathology.

AB Early childhood exposure to family violence predicts increased risk for psychopathology. However, violence between partners and towards children often co-occur. This complicates efforts to determine how experiences of family violence contribute to early mental health problems. Utilizing mother-report data on harsh parenting and intimate partner violence (IPV) from two large community-based, socioeconomically and ethnically diverse samples of 3-5-year-old children, we illustrate the value of a bifactor method for characterizing a family climate in which verbal and physical violence are more chronic and pervasive among family members. In our Calibration sample (N = 1,179), we demonstrate the fit of a bifactor model with a shared violence factor reflecting violence among partners and towards children and orthogonal factors for physically harsh parenting and IPV. Examination of item distributions along quartiles on the identified factors reveals that violent behaviors are most frequent/chronic in families with high scores on the shared violence factor. Next, we apply this model in Validation (N = 1,316) and lab-visit samples (N = 369). Children's symptoms and impairment showed relatively strong and consistent associations with the shared factor. Some unique associations with IPV and harsh parenting were also observed. Overall, patterns suggest particularly negative impact when verbal and physical violence are more chronic and pervasive among family members. Finally, evidence supporting the bifactor model's validity relative to multi-method data from coded interviews about child abuse and IPV and observed parenting is presented. Findings illustrate the value of a bifactor approach for the meaningful characterization of shared and specific features of family violence.

AB This study examined the association between executive functioning (EF) and effortful control (EC), and tested whether cognitive control as the commonality of EF and EC, predicted competence and internalizing and externalizing symptomatology in children (N = 218, 6-8 years) and adolescents (N = 157, 13-14 years). Confirmatory factor analyses suggested cognitive control inhibitory control and attentional control as a significant overlap between EF and EC. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that the cognitive control latent factor was associated with competence and internalizing and externalizing symptomatology among children and externalizing symptomatology among adolescents. The results provide evidence that inhibitory control and attentional control are the commonality between EF and EC and highlight that they are linked with positive and negative adjustment outcomes.

AB Given the potential negative effects that early childhood behavioral problems have on later development, it is important to elucidate risk and protective factors. This study examined household chaos as a predictor of externalizing and internalizing problems among young children from low-income families. Additionally, self regulation was examined as a moderator of the association between chaos and behavior problems. One hundred young adult mother-toddler dyads participated. Moderation analyses indicated that self-regulation buffered the association between household chaos and child behavior problems. Specifically, greater household chaos was associated with more behavior problems, but only among children with poorer self-regulation. Notably, this pattern was observed for both externalizing and internalizing problems. These findings suggest that early interventions targeting young children's self-regulation skills could help prevent behavior problems among children living in chaotic home environments.

AB The present study examined the role of the friendship network in the levels of and change in symptoms of internalizing psychopathology among high school students. Social Network Analysis was implemented to examine self-reported anxiety and depression in the friendship network during the fall and spring in one school year for students in a rural high school (M age at T1 = 15.71, 51% female, 91% Caucasian). Depression and anxiety in the friendship network predicted changes in the individual's level of internalizing symptoms. Grade level moderated the influence of the friendship network, such that influence was greatest in 10th grade and decreased in the 11th and 12th grades. Notably, defining network internalizing scores as either mean level versus clinical cut-off scores affected the pattern of findings. Taken together, these results highlight the important and complex role the friendship network plays across adolescence. Recommendations for clinical practice and policy are discussed.

AB This paper employs a causal inference framework to explore two logically distinct forms of preventive effect heterogeneity relevant for studying variation in preventive effect as a basis for developing more personalized interventions. Following VanderWeele (2015), I begin with a discussion of causal interaction involving manipulable moderators that combine to yield more complex nonadditive effects. This is contrasted with effect heterogeneity, which involves variation in causal structure indexed by stable characteristics of populations or contexts. The paper then discusses one particularly promising approach, the baseline target moderated mediation (BTMM) design, which uses theoretically informed baseline target moderators to strengthen causal inference, suggesting methods for using BTMM designs to develop targeting strategies for personalized prevention. It presents examples of recent intervention trials that apply these different forms of moderation, and discusses causal inference and the problem of moderation confounding, reviewing methods for minimizing its impact, including recent advances in the use of propensity score matching.

AB Family-based behavioral interventions are efficacious and effective in preventing drug use and sexual risk behaviors; unfortunately, they have not been evaluated and disseminated in pediatric primary care practice, where they can have a significant impact. There is an increased focus on integrating parenting interventions into primary care to reduce health disparities among ethnic minorities such as Hispanics. Although Hispanic youth demonstrate higher levels of drug use and sexual risk behaviors than their non-Hispanic counterparts, few parenting interventions are available for Hispanic youth, and none have been delivered specifically to Hispanic adolescents in primary care. Therefore, this manuscript describes the rationale and design of an Internet-based, family-centered, Hispanic-specific, evidence-based prevention intervention, eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care. Hispanic adolescents (n = 456) and their care givers will be recruited from pediatric primary care clinics in South Florida and randomized to: eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care or prevention as usual. The intervention will be delivered by trained interns, clinic volunteers, social workers, mental health counselors, students, and nurses. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post-baseline. This study will determine whether the intervention, compared to prevention as usual, is effective in reducing drug use, unprotected sex, and STI incidence in Hispanic youth through the improvement of family functioning. Additionally, we will determine the cost effectiveness of delivering eHealth Familias Unidas within primary care settings. The effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care will further inform the need to integrate effective behavioral health interventions into primary care settings.

AB Objective: The objectives of this study were to identify executive functioning (El) phenotypes in youth with epilepsy and to examine whether phenotypes differ on psychosocial and medical outcomes (i.e., absence/presence of seizures in the past three months), health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and emotional and behavioral functioning.
   Methods: Youth 5-18 years with diagnosed epilepsy and caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires as part of a larger national validation of the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Epilepsy Module. The primary measure of interest was the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Parent Form. Medical chart reviews and demographic data were also collected. Latent class analysis was used to identify EF phenotypes. Chi-square and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted to examine EF phenotype group differences on seizure outcomes, HRQOL, and behavioral and emotional functioning.
   Results: Two-hundred and thirty-seven children with epilepsy (M-age = 11.2 years; 56% female; 60% White: Non-Hispanic; 55% experienced seizures in the past three months) and their caregivers participated. Four EF phenotypes were identified: Group 1 - No EF deficits (45% of sample), Group 2 - Global EF deficits (29% of sample), Group 3 - Behavioral Regulation + Working Memory deficits (8% of sample), and Group 4 - Metacognitive deficits (17% of sample). No significant EF phenotype group differences were found for seizure characteristics. The ANCOVAs indicated significant EF phenotype group differences on HRQOL (parent-reported Impact, Cognitive, Sleep, EF, and Mood/Behavior and child-reported Cognitive, Sleep, EF, and Mood/Behavior subscales; ps < .001) and emotional and behavioral functioning (Externalizing, Internalizing, and Behavioral Symptom Index; ps < .001), with the Global EF deficits (Group 2) and Behavioral Regulation + Working Memory deficits groups (Group 3) demonstrating the greatest level of impairment.
   Conclusion: Phenotypic variability in EF is significantly related to patient-reported outcomes.
   Interventions addressing EF deficits need to be individualized to a child's particular EF phenotype to achieve optimal outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Self-stigma is a result of internalizing negative stereotypes by the affected person. Research on self-stigma in substance use disorders (SUD) is still scarce, especially regarding the role of childhood trauma and subsequent posttraumatic disorders. Objectives: The present study investigated the progressive model of self-stigma in women with SUD and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the predictive value of PTSD severity and childhood trauma experiences on self-stigma. Method: In a cross-sectional study with 343 women with SUD and PTSD, we used the Self-Stigma in Alcohol Dependency Scale, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSS-I), and to control for SUD severity and depression, the Addiction Severity Index Lite and the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for each stage of self-stigma (aware-agree-apply-harm). Results: The interrelated successive stages of self-stigma were largely confirmed. In the regression models, no significant effects of the PSS-I- and the CTQ-scores were observed at any stage of self-stigma. Agreeing with negative stereotypes was solely predicted by younger age, applying these stereotypes to oneself was higher in women with younger age, higher depression and SUD severity, and suffering from the application (harm) was only predicted by depression. Conclusions: The progressive model of self-stigma could be confirmed in women with SUD and PTSD, but PTSD severity and childhood trauma did not directly affect this process. Self-stigma appears to be related to depression in a stronger way than PTSD is related to women with SUD and PTSD.

AB Therapeutic games represent a promising solution for addressing emotional difficulties in youths. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of the REThink game, in helping children and adolescents, to develop psychological resilience. Therefore, 165 children aged between 10 and 16years were randomly assigned in one of the three groups: 54 participants in the REThink condition, 55 participants in the Rational Emotive Behavior Education condition, and 56 participants in the waitlist condition. Results indicated that the REThink intervention had a significant impact on emotional symptoms (a moderate-effect size, d=0.46) and on depressive mood (a large-effect size, d=0.84). Furthermore, REThink had a significant impact on children's ability to regulate their emotions, with a significant effect on emotional awareness (d=0.64), and on the ability for emotional control (d=0.69). In conclusion, the implications of the REThink game are discussed in relationship with resiliency building programs designed for youths.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03308981.

AB Background: Developmental trauma disorder (DTD) has been proposed to describe the biopsychosocial sequelae of exposure to interpersonal victimization in childhood that extend beyond the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: To characterize the psychopathology comorbid with DTD and to determine whether this comorbidity is distinct from, and extends beyond, comorbidities of PTSD. Method: DTD was assessed by structured interview, and probable Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) psychiatric disorders were identified with screening modules on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present/Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), in a multi-site sample of 236 children (7-18 years old; 50% female) referred by paediatric or mental health providers. Results: DTD (N = 80, 34%) and PTSD (N = 69, 29%) were highly comorbid and shared several DSM-IV internalizing disorder and DSM, 5th Edition (DSM-5) dysregulation disorder comorbidities. However, DTD, but not PTSD, was associated with comorbid panic disorder and disruptive behaviour disorders. On a multivariate basis including all probable DSM-IV disorders and DSM-5 dysregulation disorders, DTD was associated with separation anxiety disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after controlling for PTSD, while PTSD was associated with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder after controlling for DTD. Conclusions: DTD's comorbidities overlap with but extend beyond those of PTSD to include panic, separation anxiety, and disruptive behaviour disorders. DTD warrants further investigation as a potential diagnosis or a complex variant of PTSD in children, similar to the adult symptoms of disturbances of self-organization in the proposed International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision (ICD-11) complex post-traumatic stress disorder subtype.

AB The sociocultural model of eating disorders highlights the role of internalization of the thin ideal in the development of negative body image and disordered eating. Considering the limited diversity of models in mainstream media, individuals belonging to minoritized cultural groups may resist identifying with and internalizing mainstream beauty messages. The extent of internalization may also depend on an individual's acculturation status and experiences of acculturative stress. This study applied the sociocultural model to culturally Deaf women. Data were collected from 96 deaf, female, undergraduate students. Results support the sociocultural model; higher rates of internalization were associated with negative body image and disordered eating behaviors. However, neither Deaf nor Hearing acculturation predicted internalization. Despite this finding, stronger acculturation with either Deaf or Hearing culture predicted more positive body image, and higher rates of acculturative stress predicted negative body image and disordered eating behaviors. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.

AB The Biobehavioral Family Model (BBFM) is a biopsychosocial model of health. This model proposes that biobehavioral reactivity mediates the association between the family emotional climate and disease activity. To improve the clinical relevance of the BBFM, variables that mediate the association between family emotional climate and biobehavioral reactivity need to be tested. This study examined differentiation of self as a mediator. Using data from the Midlife Development in the United States study (n = 854), results suggested that differentiation of self mediated the association between the family and intimate partner emotional climate and mental health symptoms. These findings suggest that including differentiation of self into the BBFM may help interventions based on the model target factors that could improve health outcomes.

AB It is estimated that upward of 15.5 million children live in homes where they are exposed to physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV). Research indicates that IPV can have deleterious effects on children, including a variety of psychosocial problems, although there is much variability in outcomes of children exposed to IPV. Individual characteristics of the parents involved in IPV may be an important predictor of negative psychosocial outcomes for children. The current study expanded upon prior research and examined the simultaneous associations of paternal characteristics, including paternal IPV perpetration, and child psychosocial functioning (i.e., externalizing, internalizing, and attentional problems) among 153 men arrested for domestic violence and court ordered to attend batterer intervention programs. Analyses examined the relations between paternal alcohol and drug use, antisocial personality traits, hostility, posttraumatic stress symptoms, distress tolerance, IPV perpetration, and men's ratings of their child's psychosocial functioning. Results indicated that poor overall child psychosocial functioning was positively related to paternal antisocial personality symptoms and hostility. Subscale analyses revealed that child attentional problems were positively related to paternal hostility. Child externalizing problems were positively associated with paternal antisocial personality symptoms. The implications of these findings for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB Background: The Environmental Stress Hypothesis provides a conceptual framework detailing the complex relationship between poor motor skills and internalizing problems.
   Aims: This integrative research aimed to synthesize studies that have evaluated complex pathways posited in the framework.
   Method: This study followed the four stages of an integrative research review: (i) problem formation and research aims, (ii) literature search and data collection, (iii) data evaluation and analysis, and (iv) results and discussion.
   Outcomes and Results: Twelve peer-reviewed, English language studies published within 2010-2018 were identified. These used mostly cross-sectional, correlational methods and provided varying levels of support for relationships posited in the framework in samples spanning early childhood to adulthood. Compared to intrapersonal factors (e.g., self-esteem/ perceived competence), interpersonal factors (e.g., social support, peer problems) were found to more strongly and consistently mediate the relationship between motor skills and internalizing problems.
   Conclusions and Implications: There is growing empirical support for many of the Environmental Stress Hypothesis pathways. However, research to date is limited in the ability to establish causal relationships between variables, which is integral to the Environmental Stress Hypothesis. Intervention studies provide a useful type of experimental research that could establish causality between variables, while working to improve the physical and psychosocial functioning of people with poor motor skills.

AB Previous research has focused on the prevalence of bullying of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with little attention given to its emotional effect. This mixed methods study examined levels of worry about bullying and bullying experiences reported by students and parents. To determine whether some students with ASD are differentially affected, we explored associations between students' characteristics (understanding of bullying, age and co-morbid conditions) and their bullying experiences and worries. Surveys exploring bullying experiences and levels of worry about bullying were completed by 89 students with ASD without intellectual disability aged 11-16 years and their parents. We also qualitatively explored parents' perceptions of how bullying affects their children, through semi-structured interviews of nine parents. Students with comorbid anxiety disorders were more likely to report face-to-face victimization and were more troubled by both face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying, while students with depression were more likely to report cyber victimization. Parental concerns included the impact of victimization on school attendance, self-esteem, mental health, social participation, academic performance, and behaviour. The significantly higher levels of worry about bullying and higher victimization rates reported by students with internalizing symptoms suggest that these students may be disproportionately at risk of psychological harm.

AB Early identification of children who may have a mental health problem is essential to implement preventive and treatment actions. In order to do this, it is necessary to have valid instruments adapted to the characteristics of the population and the contexts in which they are applied. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to validate the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) in Chilean first grade elementary school students. A random sample of 5177 students participating in a national school mental health program was used. The children were evaluated by their parents or caregivers and their teachers. Results of a Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed a three-factor structure composed of: internalizing, externalizing and attention difficulties. These findings are consistent with what has been reported in the literature, transforming the PSC-17 into a good screening tool for use in schools and health centers.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the construct validity and the reliability of the official international Hispanic version of the YSR/11-18 in Mexican adolescents. A sample of 790 students aged 13 to 18 years was intentionally recruited from public secondary and high schools in the metropolitan zone of Mexico City. This sample was divided in two parts or samples. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out with sample one and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with data from sample two. A structure of twelve Narrow Band factors was observed, eight original factors and four new factors. These were integrated in four Broad Band factors: Internalizing, Externalizing, and Mixed, and a new one of Positive Qualities, as reported in recent research. The factorial structure in this study presents adequate psychometric properties and seems to be useful both to evaluate mental health problems and adolescents' resources.

AB Research on pain in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in its infancy, with almost nothing known about how individual differences may predicting pain response in ASD. In the present study, 45 adults (28 male, age 22-48years) with diagnoses of autism and intellectual delay were observed during vaccination or dental cleaning and their pain behaviours coded and measures of autism symptom severity, anxiety, depression and obsessivity taken. Our findings showed that greater autism severity predicted greater pain response which was partially mediated by anxiety and depression. These data suggest that mental health symptoms are important when considering pain response in autism. Mood must therefore be considered in future research on pain in ASD as well as clinical pain management.

AB The study examined the efficacy of a school-based mindfulness intervention on mental health and emotion regulation outcomes among adolescents in a wait-list controlled trial. The study also explored mediators and moderators of intervention effects. A total of 145 predominantly ethnic minority (Asian and Latino) 9th grade students with elevated mood symptoms were randomized to receive a 12-week mindfulness intervention at the start of the academic year, or in the second semester of the year. Students completed measures of emotion regulation and mental health symptoms at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant treatment effects of the mindfulness intervention for internalizing symptoms and perceived stress at post-treatment. Pooled pre-to-post treatment analyses of the entire sample revealed a small effect size for attention problems, medium for internalizing and externalizing problems, and large for perceived stress. We also found a small effect size for cognitive reappraisal, medium for expressive suppression, emotional processing, emotional expression, and rumination and large for avoidance fusion. Mediation analyses showed that treatment effects on internalizing symptoms and perceived stress were mediated by reductions in expressive suppression and rumination. Moderation analyses revealed that treatment effects were larger among youth with more severe problems at baseline for internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and perceived stress. However, for attention problems, students with lower severity at baseline appeared to have larger treatment gains. The study provided evidence that mindfulness intervention was beneficial for low-income ethnic minority youth in reducing perceived stress and internalizing problems, and improving emotion regulation outcomes. Furthermore, mindfulness training was associated with reduced mental health symptoms via improvements in emotion regulation.

AB The failure model posits that peer rejection and poor academic performance are dual pathways in the association between early aggressive behavior and subsequent depressive symptoms. We examined this model using an accelerated longitudinal design while also incorporating proactive and reactive aggression and gender moderation. Children in 1st, 3rd, and 5th grades (n=912; ages 6-12; 48% female) were rated three times annually by their primary teachers on measures of proactive and reactive aggression, peer rejection, academic performance, and depressive symptoms. Using Bayesian cross-classified estimation to account for nested and planned-missingdata, path models were estimated to examine whether early reactive aggression predicted subsequent peer rejection and academic performance, and whether these, in turn, predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. From 1st to 3rd grade, reactive aggression predicted peer rejection (not academic performance), proactive aggression predicted academic performance (not peer rejection), and academic performance and peer rejection both predicted depressive symptoms. From 3rd to 5th grade, however, neither peer rejection nor academic performance predicted subsequent depressive symptoms. Results were not moderated by gender. Overall, these findings provide mixed and limited support for the failure model among school-age children. Early reactive aggression may be a key risk factor for social problems, whereas proactive aggression may be linked to improved academic functioning. The dual pathways of peer rejection and academic performance may operate during early but not later elementary school. Limitations and implications are discussed.

AB Maternal postnatal depression has been associated with a broad range of developmental risk among children. However, there has been less focus on disentangling the effects of pre- and postnatal depressive symptoms, as well as examining the symptoms of both parents. This study aims to investigate the separate effects of pre- and postnatal depressive symptoms in mothers and fathers, and parents' differential effects on child social-emotional, cognitive, and language development at 18months of age. Further, we investigate whether effects of depressive symptomatology on child outcomes are particularly strong when both parents evinced high symptom loads and whether parenting stress mediates associations between perinatal depressive symptoms and child developmental outcomes. The study used data from 1036 families participating in a community-based study from mid-pregnancy until 18months postpartum. Depressive symptoms were assessed at seven time points (four prenatally). Within a structural equation framework, we found that parental perinatal depressive symptoms predicted child social-emotional functioning, specifically externalizing, internalizing, and dysregulation problems, as well as language developmental delay at 18months. Controlling for postnatal symptoms we found no independent effect of prenatal depressive symptoms on any child outcomes. A differential effect was evident, linking maternal symptoms to social-emotional outcomes, and paternal symptoms to language outcomes. There was no evidence of stronger associations between depressive symptoms and child outcomes when both parents showed high symptom loads. However, parenting stress mediated most relations between parental depressive symptoms and child outcomes. Findings demonstrate the importance of including paternal depressive symptoms in both clinical and research contexts.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study investigated reciprocal longitudinal associations between media use/physical activity and adolescents' psychological health.
   METHODS: Data were collected between 2011 and 2017 in the LIFE Child study in Germany. The sample included 814 10-to 17-year-old adolescents. The participants provided information on their media use per day (hours of television/video, computer/Internet, and mobile phone use), physical activity (frequency of organized and non-organized physical activity per week), behavioral difficulties (emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems), and quality of life (physical and psychological well-being; satisfaction with parents, peers, and school) at 2 time points 12 months apart. Multiple regressions were applied to analyze reciprocal longitudinal associations between media use/physical activity and behavioral difficulties/quality of life.
   RESULTS: Frequent use of computers/Internet at baseline was associated with an increase in internalizing behavioral difficulties (emotional problems and peer relationship problems) at follow-up. Additionally, a high frequency of computer/Internet and mobile phone use was related to a decrease in psychological well-being, whereas a high frequency of organized physical activity was linked to improved physical well-being. The analyses also revealed a link between more behavioral difficulties at baseline and increased television consumption at follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: This study suggests mutual dependencies between electronic media use and psychological health over time.

AB This study investigated whether child exuberance, an aspect of temperament related to emotion regulation, moderates the well-documented association between high parenting stress and increased risk for internalizing and externalizing problems during the preschool years. At 42 months of age child exuberance was observed in 256 children (47% girls) and maternal self-reports on parenting stress were obtained. At 48 months internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed through reports from both parents. Indeed, higher maternal parenting stress increased the risk for internalizing problems, and this association was more pronounced among children with high levels of exuberance. Existent emotion regulation difficulties in highly exuberant children may further heighten the risk conveyed by an unfavorable caregiving environment for developing internalizing problems.

Participants were 245 homeless parents (M-age = 31.0, 63.6% African American) and their 4- to 6-year-old children (48.6% male). Path analyses revealed unique associations by risk domain: Higher sociodemographic risk predicted more externalizing behavior and poorer teacher-child relationships, whereas higher family adversity predicted more internalizing behavior. Parenting quality was positively associated with peer acceptance and buffered effects of family adversity on internalizing symptoms, consistent with a protective effect. Parenting quality was associated with lower externalizing behavior only when sociodemographic risk was below the sample mean. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB Depression in adults is associated with deficits in a number of cognitive domains, however it remains less clear how early in development theses deficits can be detected in early onset depression. There are several different hypotheses about the links between cognitive function and depression. For example, it has been argued that executive function deficits contribute to emotion regulation difficulties, which in turn increase risk for depression. Further, it has been suggested that some cognitive deficits, such as episodic memory, may reflect hippocampal abnormalities linked to both depression and episodic memory. We examined these questions in adolescents participating in a longitudinal study of preschool onset depression. We measured cognitive function at adolescence using the National Institutes of Health toolbox (vocabulary, processing speed, executive function, working memory and episodic memory), and examined relationships of cognitive deficits to depression, emotion regulation, life stress and adversity, as well as hippocampal volume trajectories over three imaging assessments starting at school age. Depression related deficits in episodic memory were found. Youths with either current and past depression showed episodic memory deficits even after controlling for other psychopathology and family income. Depression seventy, emotion dysregulation, and life stress/adversity all predicted episodic memory impairment, as did smaller intercepts and slopes of hippocampal growth over time. Modest relationships of depression to hippocampal volume and strong relationships between emotion regulation and both episodic memory and hippocampal volume were found. These data are consistent with prior work in adults linking depression, episodic memory, emotion regulation, life stress/adversity, and hippocampal volume in adults and suggest similar relations are evident as early as adolescence when memory systems are under development.

AB Despite its low visibility, internalizing problems are increasingly present in children, and they are often associated to inadequate parenting patterns. This paper analyses a possible existing relationship between depression and anxiety in children, reported by parents through the BASC (Behaviour Assessment System for Children), and the parenting style according to the PCRI (Parent-Child Relationship Inventory), along with different family variables. In this study 554 children (288 male and 266 female) aged 3-13 years old participated. The results show that children with higher depression scores were more likely to have parents with a low level of support, satisfaction with parenting, involvement, communication, autonomy and limit setting of both parents, along with a low role orientation by their mothers. Children with high anxiety scores were more likely to have parents who have low level of support, limit setting and autonomy, along with a low level of satisfaction with parenting and role orientation in the mother. Furthermore, the regression analysis sheds models capable of predicting 31% of the variance of depression and 16% of the variance for the anxiety model. Finally, we discuss the utility of the results for the design of guide programmes based upon concrete aspects of the daily educational practice.

AB Background Depression, anxiety, and alcohol misuse predict adverse social, academic, and emotional outcomes, and their relations to one another increase during adolescence-particularly in girls. However, evidence on the directions of these relations is mixed. Longitudinal models of internalizing problem-alcohol use links may identify promising prevention targets. Accordingly, we examined reciprocal associations between anxiety severity and alcohol use, as well as between depression severity and alcohol use, in adolescent girls. Methods Data were drawn from a population-based longitudinal study of female adolescents. The current sample comprised 2,100 participants (57.1% Black, 42.9% White) assessed annually between ages 13 and 17. Girls self-reported depression severity, anxiety severity, and frequency of alcohol use (consumption of >= 1 full drink) in the past year. Primary caregivers reported on socioeconomic and neighborhood factors; these were included with race, early puberty, and conduct problems (youth-report) as covariates. Anxiety and depression severity were included within a single cross-lagged panel model, along with alcohol use, to isolate their independent and reciprocal links to drinking behavior. Results Higher depression severity modestly predicted increased likelihood of subsequent alcohol use from ages 13 to 17. However, inconsistent relations emerged for the reverse pathway: Alcohol use modestly predicted decreased depression severity at ages 14 and 16; associations were nonsignificant in other lagged associations. Anxiety severity and alcohol use were not consistently associated. Conclusions
   Results highlight the key role of depression, relative to anxiety, in predicting later alcohol use. Future studies may examine whether depression prevention programs yield secondary reductions in alcohol use in adolescent girls.

AB A key component of delivering mental health services involves evaluating psychosocial impairments linked to mental health concerns. Youth may experience these impairments in various ways (e.g., dysfunctional family and/or peer relationships, poor school performance). Importantly, youth may display symptoms of mental illness without co-occurring psychosocial impairments, and the reverse may be true. However, all available instruments for assessing youth psychosocial impairments presume the presence of mental health concerns among those assessed. Consequently, key gaps exist in knowledge about the developmental psychopathology of psychosocial impairments; and thus how to understand impairments in the context of youth mental health. To address these issues we developed a modified version of a 5-item measure of adult psychosocial impairments (i.e., Work and Social Adjustment Scale for Youth [WSASY]) and tested its psychometric properties. A mixed clinical/community sample of adolescents and parents completed parallel versions of the WSASY, along with a multi-domain, multi-method battery of measures of adolescent internalizing and externalizing concerns, parent psychosocial functioning, adolescent-parent conflict, adolescent peer functioning, and observed social skills. On both versions of the WSASY, increased scores related to increased adolescent mental health concerns, adolescent-parent conflict, parent psychosocial dysfunction, and peer-related impairments. WSASY scores also distinguished adolescents who displayed co-occurring mental health concerns from those who did not, and related to observed social skills deficits within social interactions with unfamiliar peers. The WSASY opens doors to new areas of inquiry regarding the developmental psychopathology of impairment, including questions regarding the onset of impairments and their links to mental health.

AB Youth who suffer from psychiatric disorders are at high risk for negative outcomes, including aggression and substance abuse. Although many youth with psychiatric disorders have endured harsh parenting and/or child maltreatment (CM), differential associations between these experiential factors have yet to be fully explored. Sleep problems have also been implicated in psychiatric disorders and are consistently associated with CM. The overlap and unique contributions of CM and sleep problems to the mental health of youth remains unclear; longitudinal studies from late childhood into adolescence, when psychiatric illnesses frequently onset, are rare. The current longitudinal study examined associations of CM, harsh parenting, and sleep problems with symptoms of four psychiatric disorders: Conduct Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Anxiety, and Depression. Early adolescent youth with no history of substance use (N=529) were sampled from a working class, medium-sized city in northern Kentucky, and an extensive battery of tests were administered to youth and a parent. CM was more strongly and consistently related to psychiatric disorder symptoms at baseline than was harsh parenting. Reports of harsh parenting were more strongly associated with externalizing symptoms than internalizing symptoms. Sleep problems were also positively associated with psychiatric disorder symptoms at baseline, but did not exacerbate the effects of CM or harsh parenting on symptom counts. Longitudinally, harsh parenting was more predictive of change in psychiatric symptoms two to three years later than was CM. The potential significance of childhood adversity and sleep problems for prevention of later mental health problems are discussed.

AB Prior research on Expressed Emotion (EE) in parents' Five Minute Speech Samples (FMSS) suggests that parental attitudes that are overprotective or blur boundaries between the parent and child (i.e., the criteria for self-sacrifice/overprotection; SSOP) are related to increases in children's behavior problems. Some theorists contend that parents who demonstrate high levels of SSOP treat their children more insensitively, but others argue that SSOP does not result in insensitive parenting during the early childhood years. To date, there is no evidence that can be brought to bear upon this tension within the field regarding the developmental implications of SSOP in childhood. This longitudinal investigation of 223 child-mother dyads (47.9% female; Mage_W1=49.08 months; 56.5% Hispanic/Latina) evaluated whether maternal insensitivity at age 6 mediated the link between mothers' SSOP with respect to their 4-year-old children and children's behavior problems (i.e., internalizing, attention/hyperactivity) at age 8. A path analysis revealed significant indirect pathways from mothers' SSOP during the preschool period to children's increased internalizing and attention/hyperactivity problems at age 8 via elevated maternal insensitivity at age 6. These associations did not differ significantly across groups as a function of child gender, maternal race/ethnicity, single-mother status, or family poverty. FMSS evaluations of SSOP may offer a culturally valid and clinically valuable screening tool to detect parental attitudes that confer elevated risks for insensitive parenting practices and later child adjustment difficulties.

AB Punitive parenting style has been identified as a risk factor for the development of internalizing and externalizing problems in childhood. However, its effect might depend on child temperament and the combined use of punishment with other parenting forms such as warmth. This longitudinal study assessed whether three temperament traits (negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and effortful control), as well as parental warmth moderated the association between punishment and child internalizing and externalizing problems. Five-hundred and seventy-two children (mean age at wave 1: 8.47 years; 45% girls) and their parents participated in the two waves (8 month apart) of the study. Children completed measures of depression, somatization, rule breaking, aggressive behavior, and parenting styles. Parents completed measures assessing their children's temperament traits (negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and effortful control) and problems. Punishment predicted an increase in all problems over time. Parental warmth predicted a decrease in depression and somatization. Positive affectivity predicted an increase of aggressive behavior. Negative affectivity moderated the predictive association between punishment and externalizing symptoms, with the detrimental effect of punishment being higher among children high in negative affectivity. In addition, the damaging role of punishment on depression was higher when both warmth and effortful control were high. In boys, punishment predicted higher depression when both warmth and negative affectivity were higher. Results suggest that punishment is uniquely associated with an increase in externalizing and internalizing problems, even though some interactions between temperament, warmth and punishment can exacerbate or diminish direct associations between punishment and children's psychological symptoms.

AB The purpose of the current study was to test for a relation between emerging adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) status, how they reported being reared (i.e., perceived parenting style), and how the maternal parenting they received in childhood was linked with current adjustment. College students completed online surveys regarding their ADHD status, impairment, and maternal parenting style. Participants with ADHD reported higher levels of maternal authoritarian parenting (controlling/punitive) and lower levels of maternal authoritative parenting (structured/supportive) compared with participants without ADHD. Across the entire sample, higher reported maternal authoritative parenting was associated with lower levels of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), depression, anxiety and stress, and higher levels of maternal authoritarian and permissive parenting was associated with higher levels of IA, HI, depression, anxiety, and stress. Sex moderated the relations between maternal parenting style and psychopathology such that women who reported low levels of authoritative parenting also reported higher levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, where no differences in psychopathology were found in men across both low and high levels of authoritative parenting. These links between current adjustment and maternal parenting style suggest authoritative parenting may protect against negative adjustment in college students and may be especially important for women.

AB Objective There is evidence that children who are deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) have a higher incidence of behavioral disorders. Assessment of behavioral health in this population is often complicated by language developmental delays, which may result in unrecognized and untreated behavioral problems. The purpose of this study is to assess the association of behavioral disorders among children who are DHH and to explore behavioral interventions for children in this population. Data Sources PubMed, CINALH, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Review Methods Search terms included the following: problem behavior, child behavior disorders/diagnosis, child behavior disorders/psychology coupled with hearing loss, cochlear implants, hearing aids, or deafness. Studies from the last 30 years (1985-2016) were included. The articles were reviewed independently by 3 reviewers. Results Thirty-six articles met criteria. There was an association between internalizing behaviors and hearing loss among children, which may persist after cochlear implantation. These problems may be more pronounced for children with additional disabilities. Conduct and hyperactivity disorders as well as emotional and executive function problems among children who are DHH may be related to poor language development. There was limited evidence regarding interventions to address the behavioral disorders of DHH children. Conclusions There is a significant body of evidence demonstrating behavioral problems among DHH children but a lack of clear understanding of the mechanisms involved. There is limited evidence on interventions to address the behavioral problems of DHH children. Future research is warranted to mitigate the long-term effects of disruptive behavior among these children.

AB Links between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and threats to health and well-being later in life are well established. The current study extends those findings into younger populations of pregnant women and their children; investigating how ACEs relates to maternal postpartum well-being, coping, and parenting, as well as child outcomes. Participants included 1994 mothers and children from the All Our Families community-based cohort in Alberta, Canada, followed from pregnancy (from 2008 to 2011) until child age 3 years. The sample is representative of the pregnant population in an urban Canadian centre. Mothers completed questionnaires on ACEs, postpartum mental health, as well as parenting morale, efficacy, coping, and personality. Child outcomes included internalizing and externalizing behavior, as well as temperament. Approximately 62% of participants experienced at least one ACE; 25% experienced 3 or more ACEs. The presence of 3 or more ACEs was associated with postpartum smoking, binge drinking, depressive and anxiety symptoms, lower optimism and higher neuroticism, and lower reported parenting morale. In children, 3 or more maternal ACEs was associated with higher levels of internalizing (e.g., anxiety) and externalizing difficulties (aggression and hyperactivity), as well as temperament (surgency and negative affectivity). Cumulative maternal ACEs are associated with postpartum mental health and parenting morale, as well as maladaptive coping strategies. The demonstrated downstream consequences of maternal ACEs for child outcomes suggests that early intervention strategies and community resources to improve life course outcomes for parents and children are critical for breaking intergenerational continuities of risk.

AB The distinction between low-anxious primary versus high-anxious secondary psychopathy is well-established among incarcerated adults and adolescents. However, no studies have used a prospective longitudinal approach to explore whether primary versus secondary psychopathy variants have different rates of alcohol and marijuana use across adolescence, and what mechanisms account for these differences. The sample was 1,170 male adolescents who had interacted with the justice system, with data collected as part of the Pathways to Desistance project. We used interviewer assessments of psychopathy and self-reported anxiety at baseline to identify primary and secondary psychopathy subgroups. We explored subgroup differences via self-reported measures of psychopathic traits and anxiety. aggression. depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms at baseline and a 6-month follow-up. Finally, we tested whether groups had different trajectories of alcohol and marijuana use over 4 years, and whether poor impulse control or anxiety mediate4 these differences. Latent profile analysis identified four groups: low-anxious primary psychopathy, high-anxious secondary psychopathy. anxious only, and low risk. The secondary group had similar levels of aggression and psychopathy to the primary group. but more depression. anxiety, and postraumatic stress symptoms. The primary and secondary psychopathy variants did not differ in rates of alcohol or marijuana use across adolescence, but alcohol use among secondary variants was specifically mediated via poor impulse control. The findings establish two psychopathy groups that differ meaningfully in their internalizing psychopathology and pathways to alcohol use.

AB Peer relationships can be shaped as influential factors in the prevalence of bullying episodes. This research aims to analyze the effect of school bullying on the levels of depression of the victims and to what extent it is affected by social support and status in the group and by the profile of victimization. Several hierarchical linear regression analyses were calculated, in a sample of 1063 students aged 10 to 14 (47.8% of girls, M = 11.59 years, SD = 1.21 years), from 10 school of the Region of Madrid. The degree of influence of the studied variables was observed: lack of social support, peer rejection, withdrawal and impulsivity behaviors, and the relationship of all of them with victimization and depression. Findings revealed the influence of the lack of social support on the depression of victimized students. However, peer rejection did not show influence on the levels of depression of the victims. In addition, victimization associated with internalizing characteristics showed a greater association with depression than victimization associated with an externalizing profile.

AB Children's early emotional environment strongly influences their later behavioural development. Yet, besides maternal depression, limited knowledge exists about the effect of other emotions and the role of fathers. Using 290 triads (mother/father/child), we investigated how positive (SEEKING, CARING, PLAYFULNESS) and negative (FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS) dimensions of mothers' and fathers' affectivity relate to their offspring's externalizing and internalizing behaviours directly as well as indirectly via parenting practices. Parental variables were measured when children were 4 years old and children's behaviours were measured at 8 years of age. Latent Profile Analysis identified three parental affective profiles: low negative emotions, balanced, and high emotional. Structural equation models showed that, for boys, mothers' low negative emotions and high emotional profiles predicted later internalizing behaviours (direct effect; beta = -0.21 and beta = 0.23), while fathers' low negative emotions profile predicted externalizing behaviours indirectly (beta = -0.10). For girls, mothers' profiles (low negative emotions and high emotional) predicted both internalizing (beta = -0.04 and beta = 0.07) and externalizing (beta = -0.05 and beta = 0.09) behaviours indirectly, but no effects of fathers' profiles were found. Mothers' and fathers' affective profiles contributed to the behavioural development of their offspring in different ways, according to the type of behaviour (internalizing or externalizing) and the child's sex. These findings may help in tailoring existing parenting interventions on affective profiles, thus enhancing their efficacy.

AB This study examined longitudinal links between household income and parents' education and children's trajectories of internalizing and externalizing behaviors from age 8 to 10 reported by mothers, fathers, and children. Longitudinal data from 1,190 families in 11 cultural groups in eight countries (Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and United States) were included. Multigroup structural equation models revealed that household income, but not maternal or paternal education, was related to trajectories of mother-, father-, and child-reported internalizing and externalizing problems in each of the 11 cultural groups. Our findings highlight that in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, socioeconomic risk is related to children's internalizing and externalizing problems, extending the international focus beyond children's physical health to their emotional and behavioral development.

ID CHILDREN; ANXIETY; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background Mental disorders are among the main causes of global disability in children, with negative impacts on their quality of life. It is possible that mental disorders could be associated with how children react in the dental setting. Aim To test the association between children's psychological attributes and behaviour presented during dental care. Design A questionnaire was given to mothers of children attending a paediatric dental clinic. Psychological attributes were evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. For analysis, the Internalizing and Externalizing problems and the Prosocial behaviour subscales were considered. Children's behaviour was assessed using the Frankl Scale. For analysis, Poisson regression models were employed. A significant level of P <= 0.05 was adopted. Results Overall, 128 children aged between four and 12 years were included. Total difficulties (PR 5.36; 95%CI 2.2-12.9), Internalizing problems (PR 4.04; 95%CI 1.6-10.0), and externalizing problems (PR 3.36; 1.5-7.7) were associated with uncooperative behaviour. In relation to the strength domain, the Prosocial behaviour subscale (PR 1.21; 95%CI 0.6-2.6) was not associated with child behaviour. Conclusions This study provides evidence that children aged between four and 12 years with internalizing and externalizing problems tend to have a higher prevalence of negative behaviour during dental treatment.

AB Objective: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have consistently been associated with a range of negative psychological and physical outcomes in adulthood. Despite the strength of this association, no studies to date have investigated psychological processes that might underlie this relationship. The current study evaluated emotion regulation as a potential mediator between ACEs and three outcomes: PTSD symptoms, depression and poor physical health, all of which are frequently co-occurring among women with ACEs. Method: Mediational analyses were conducted with baseline data from a sample of 290 women enrolled in a clinical trial for PTSD. Emotion regulation was assessed with the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS), PTSD with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), depression with the Brief Symptom Inventory Depression subscale (BSI-D) and physical health with a shortened version of Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-8). Results: Emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between ACEs and all three outcomes. The estimates of the standardized indirect effects of ACEs on the health outcomes as mediated through DERS scores were as follows: PTSD beta = 0.1, p < .001; depression beta = 0.16, p < .001; physical health beta = 0.07, p = .002. Conclusion: Interventions that focus on improving emotion regulation skills might provide an efficient "transdiagnostic" treatment strategy for both psychological and physical health problems. The study successfully tested a mediational model that identified a common pathway influencing both mental and physical health symptoms.

AB Background While maternal depression is known to carry long-term negative consequences for offspring, very few studies followed children longitudinally to address markers of resilience in the context of maternal depression. We focused on oxytocin (OT) and mother-child synchrony - the biological and behavioral arms of the neurobiology of affiliation - as correlates of resilience among children of depressed mothers. Method A community birth-cohort was recruited on the second postbirth day and repeatedly assessed for maternal depression across the first year. At 6 and 10 years, mothers and children underwent psychiatric diagnosis, mother-child interactions were coded for maternal sensitivity, child social engagement, and mother-child synchrony, children's OT assayed, and externalizing and internalizing problems reported. Results Exposure to maternal depression markedly increased child propensity to develop Axis-I disorder at 6 and 10 years. Child OT showed main effects for both maternal depression and child psychiatric disorder at 6 and 10 years, with maternal or child psychopathology attenuating OT response. In contrast, maternal depression decreased synchrony at 6 years but by 10 years synchrony showed only child disorder effect, highlighting the shift from direct to indirect effects as children grow older. Path analysis linking maternal depression to child externalizing and internalizing problems at 10 years controlling for 6-year variables indicated that depression linked with decreased maternal sensitivity and child OT, which predicted reduced child engagement and synchrony, leading to higher externalizing and internalizing problems. OT and synchrony mediated the effects of maternal depression on child behavior problems and an alternative model without these resilience components provided less adequate fit. Conclusions Maternal depression continues to play a role in children's development beyond infancy. The mediating effects of OT and synchronous, mutually regulated interactions underscore the role of plasticity in resilience. Results emphasize the need to follow children of depressed mothers across middle childhood and construct interventions that bolster age-appropriate synchrony.

AB Objective: Individuals with late-onset symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are presenting to providers at increasing rates. Recent birth-cohort studies reveal evidence for late-onset ADHD, but conclusions are challenged by measurement methods as well as presence of participant impairment and psychiatric comorbidities. We examined the occurrence of late-onset ADHD in a small but thoroughly investigated group of diverse (47% white) women followed from childhood to adulthood. Method: From a larger, 16-year longitudinal study, a subsample of young women without childhood ADHD (N = 87) was assessed at four time points between childhood and adulthood via a multimethod, multiinformant approach. We used a stepped diagnostic procedure to identify those who initially met symptom criteria for ADHD after childhood and then evaluated them for remaining DSM ADHD diagnostic criteria, including impairment, cross-situational symptoms, and comorbid diagnoses. Results: Of 87 participants, 17 met ADHD symptom criteria after childhood. Fifteen showed no evidence of childhood onset, 10 showed clear evidence of impairment, and nine had cross-situational symptoms. Of these nine, all but one showed clinically significant co-occurring or preexisting psychiatric diagnoses and/or substance use that might account for ADHD symptoms. Conclusions: Although 19.5% of women from our subsample without childhood ADHD met symptom criteria for ADHD during adolescence/adulthood, only one showed the needed combination of impairment and cross-situational symptoms without significant co-occurring mental health problems. It is possible that uncomplicated cases of adult ADHD do arise, yet we find little supporting evidence herein.

AB The purpose of the present study was to explain the moderating role of rapid automatized naming (RAN) in word reading with a cusp catastrophe model. We hypothesized that increases in RAN performance speed beyond a critical point would be associated with the disruption in word reading, consistent with a "generic shutdown" hypothesis. Participants were 587 elementary schoolchildren (Grades 2-4), among whom 87 had reading comprehension difficulties per the IQ-achievement discrepancy criterion. Data were analyzed via a cusp catastrophe model derived from the nonlinear dynamics systems theory. Results indicated that for children with reading comprehension difficulties, as naming speed falls below a critical level, the association between core reading processes (word recognition and decoding) becomes chaotic and unpredictable. However, after the significant common variance attributed to motivation, emotional, and internalizing symptoms measures from RAN scores was partialed out, its role as a bifurcation variable was no longer evident. Taken together, these findings suggest that RAN represents a salient cognitive measure that may be associated with psychoemotional processes that are, at least in part, responsible for unpredictable and chaotic word reading behavior among children with reading comprehension deficits.

AB Objectives: Many pediatric cancers are diagnosed in early childhood, a time of significant growth and development that lays the foundations for overall adjustment and functioning. The objective of this article was to characterize the psychosocial functioning of young children with cancer. Method: Data from a sample of young children with cancer (N = 92) who completed a psychological evaluation that included the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children-second edition (BASC-2) parent report were abstracted from the medical record. Patients were primarily White (70.7%), male (54.3%), and 4.81 +/- 0.89 years old at evaluation. Most were treated for brain tumors (64.1%). Results: Overall group means on each of the BASC-2 subscales were within normal limits, though significantly more patients than expected had elevated scores on the Internalizing and Behavioral Symptoms indexes. Patients who were on-treatment had higher mean overall Internalizing Problems scores, as well as greater Anxiety and Somatization scores, than those who were off-treatment (Wilks's lambda = 0.75, p < .001). Patients treated for brain tumors had lower mean Activities of Daily Living scores than those with other diagnoses (F = 15.81, p < .001). Conclusions: Findings from this clinically referred sample indicate that while most young children with cancer are doing well psychosocially, approximately 20% to 30% demonstrated difficulties in at least one area. Findings support the need for monitoring of young children with cancer as well as appropriate intervention services.

AB Background Granins have been implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults. We sought to determine whether fecal granins are altered in children with IBS and associated with symptoms. Methods Children (7-12 years of age) with IBS and healthy controls (HC) kept daily pain and stool diaries for 2 weeks. Stool samples were analyzed for chromogranins A and B (CgA, CgB) and secretogranins II and III (SgII, SgIII). Children also completed psychological measures to assess anxiety, depression, somatization, and internalizing symptoms. Key Results Fecal CgB and SgIII concentrations were higher in all the boys (IBS plus HC, n = 48) than in all the girls (IBS plus HC, n = 75) (P = 0.02 and P = 0.046, respectively). CgA and SgIII were greater in children with IBS (n = 52) vs HC (n = 69) (P = 0.01, P = 0.017, respectively). CgB and SgII did not differ between groups. In children with IBS, the number of pain episodes per week and mean daily pain rating correlated positively with all four granins. The number of stools per day correlated positively with CgB and SgII, and the percent of diarrheal stools (6 or 7 on the Bristol Scale) correlated inversely with all four granins in boys but not in girls. Fecal granins did not correlate with psychological measures. Conclusions and Inferences As measured by fecal granins, there is evidence of neuroimmune activation in children with IBS. Granins are related to abdominal pain symptoms, stooling frequency, and stool form in children with IBS. Sex influences the fecal concentration of CgB and SgIII.

AB Parental conflict is a well-established predictor of child maladjustment. Most research, however, has not considered how the couple's positivity-negativity interaction ratio (i.e., the ability to compensate for negative behaviors with positive) may be linked with child adjustment. We examined interparental positivity-negativity interaction ratios reported by one partner as a predictor of child self-reported internalizing and externalizing problems using 3 waves of survey data gathered from 809 families across 5 years in the German Family Panel (pairfam) study. Latent class analysis revealed 4 distinct classes of parental positivity-negativity ratios evident at all 3 waves: (a) very high positivity-very low negativity, (b) high positivity-moderate negativity, (c) moderate positivity-low negativity, and (d) low positivity-very high negativity. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that children from parents in the low positivity-very high negativity ratio reported higher scores of internalizing problems across all waves compared with children from the other groups. This finding indicates that the impact of negative couple interactions on child internalizing problems is counterbalanced by the amount of positivity also present in parental relations. The study suggests consideration of positive and negative aspects of parental relations simultaneously is warranted in clinical practice or when studying the impact of parental couple dynamics on child development.

AB Although the assertion that marital hostility relates to higher levels of youth adjustment difficulties has been well established, few studies have examined cooperative marital conflict in relation to youth behavior problems. This study examined the main and moderating effects of cooperative marital conflict on youth behavior problems in a sample of 416 two-parent families. Gender differences also were examined. Youth were in the sixth grade (51% females), and ranged in age from 11 to 14 (X over bar = 11.86, SD = .69). Cooperative marital conflict was associated with lower levels of youth internalizing problems. Cooperative marital conflict was related to daughters' but not sons' lower levels of externalizing problems. Cooperative marital conflict also served as a protective factor in the association between marital hostility and youth internalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of examining cooperative marital conflict above and beyond marital hostility to better understand youth development during early adolescence.

AB Youth who experience peer victimization are at risk of developing mental health problems. However, little is known about the emotional causal mechanisms linking peer victimization with these negative outcomes. This study investigated whether shame mediated this relationship. At three time points (T1-T3), 396 10- to 13-year-olds completed measures of peer victimization, shame (characterological, bodily, and behavioral; shame proneness), and mental health (depression, social anxiety, and externalizing behavior). Three multiple mediation models tested the indirect effects of T1 victimization on T3 mental health through the four T2 shame-related variables. Analyses revealed indirect effects for the shame-related mediators on depression, social anxiety, and externalizing behaviors. Specifically, indirect positive effects for characterological and bodily shame on depression and social anxiety were found, with greater bodily shame linked to higher levels of social anxiety in girls but not boys. In addition, an indirect negative effect for behavioral shame on externalizing problems was found, with higher levels of externalizing problems in victimized boys but not in girls. Finally, an indirect positive effect for shame proneness and externalizing problems was found. To clarify the directionality, three additional mediation models were run with mental health symptoms as predictors of shame and subsequent victimization. Indirect effects for the shame-related mediators were found for all outcomes, specifically bodily shame and shame proneness as mediators between internalizing and externalizing symptoms and victimization. These three models were compared and contrasted with the hypothesized models. In sum, findings support the role of shame as an underlying emotional mechanism of peer victimization, and may guide intervention programs to address the mental health concerns of victimized youth.

AB Migration has affected a large number of children in many settings. Despite growing attention to these children, important gaps remain in our understanding of their psychosocial development, as well as the factors that mediate and moderate the impact of migration on children. The present study examines the influences of migration on children's psychosocial well-being in China using a new nationally representative survey. We compared different groups of children age 3-15, including migrant children, left-behind children, and rural and urban children in nonmigrant families. Results show that rural children left behind by both parents were significantly worse off in psychological and behavioral well-being than rural nonmigrant children. By contrast, rural children left behind by one parent and migrant children were no worse off. The disadvantage of left behind children was mediated by their caregivers' emotional well-being and parenting practices. Frequent contact with migrant parents, but not receipt of remittances, helped ameliorate the vulnerability of left-behind children. These results add to our understanding of how migration affects child development in general.

AB There is limited research assessing the effectiveness of Animal-Assisted Therapy in at-risk adolescent populations. In a recent study, 138 adjudicated adolescents participated in a randomized controlled trial of an animal-assisted intervention, in which participants either trained shelter dogs (Teacher's Pet group) or walked the dogs (control group), with both groups participating in classroom work related to dogs (1). Journal writing was a part of class activities for all youth in the study. Conventional assessments of youth behavior made by staff or youth themselves did not demonstrate the expected differences between the groups favoring the dog training group, as youth in both groups showed a significant increase in staff and youth rated internalizing behavior problems and empathy from the beginning to the end of the project (1). However, subsequent analysis of the journal content from 73 of the adjudicated youth reported here, did reveal significant differences between treatment and control groups, favoring the Teacher's Pet group. Youth participating in the dog training intervention showed through their journal writing greater social-cognitive growth, more attachment, and more positive attitudes toward the animal-assisted intervention compared to youth in the control group. The 73 youth whose journals were available were very similar to youth in the larger group. Their results illustrate that journaling can be a useful method of assessing effects of similar animal-assisted interventions for at-risk youth. Writing done by youth receiving therapy appeared to promote self-reflection, desirable cognitive change, and prosocial attitudes that may signify improving quality of life for such youth. The expressive writing of participants could reveal important effects of treatment beyond the behavioral changes that are often the targeted outcomes of animal-assisted interventions.

AB Introduction. Extant studies have examined the effect of psychological characteristics on clinical features that define behavior problems. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of temperament and character as both individual factors and complex profiles on behavior problems in a community sample of adolescents.
   Methods. Behavior problems and personality of 670 Korean high school students were measured with the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Junior version of the Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI). Stepwise regression analysis analyzed the effects of JTCI character and temperament traits on YSR Total, Internalizing and Externalizing subscale scores, and Profile Analysis examined differences of JTCI personality profiles among three latent YSR subscale profiles acquired from Latent Profile Analysis.
   Results. Seven subscales of the JTCI explained 38% of the YSR total degree of behavior problems, and JTCI Novelty-Seeking and Harm-Avoidance were found to account for vulnerability while JTCI Reward-Dependence and Self-Directedness explained resilience to behavior problems. There were three distinct latent YSR profile groups based on nine YSR subscales, and low behavior problem group showed a resilient personality profile characterized by low Novelty-Seeking and Harm-Avoidance and high Reward-Dependence, Persistence, Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness while high behavior problem group exhibited a vulnerable personality profile of the opposite tendency.
   Discussion. Temperament and character explained behavior problems of Korean high school students as both individual personality traits and a complex personality profile. The results and implications of this study were examined in regard to mental health of adolescents, and the importance of education in the development of mature personality are discussed.

TI Mechanisms associated with maternal adverse childhood experiences on

   model testing approach

   model; Internalizing problems; Externalizing problems; Urban poverty
ID DEPRESSION; BEHAVIOR; STRESS
AB Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is a significant public health and social welfare problem in low-and middle income countries (LMICs). However, most ACEs research is based on developed countries, and little is known about mechanisms of early ACEs on adulthood health and offspring's wellbeing for populations in LMICs. This area is needed to guide social welfare policy and intervention service planning. This study addresses these research gaps by examining patterns of ACEs and understanding the role of ACEs on adulthood health (i.e., physical, mental health, experience of underage pregnancy) and offspring's mental health in Kenya. The study was guided by an Integrated Family Stress and Adverse Childhood Experiences Mediation Framework.
   Methods: Three hundred ninety four mothers from two informal communities in Kariobangi and Kangemi in Nairobi were included in this study. The Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Overall Health and Quality of Life items, and Child Behavior Checklist were used to study research questions. Data was gathered through a one-time interview with mothers. Structural Equational Modeling (SEM) was applied for mediational mechanism testing.
   Results: Among 13 ACE areas, most mothers experienced multiple adversity during their childhood (Mean (SD) = 4.93 (2.52)), with household member treated violently (75%) as the most common ACE. SEM results showedthat all domains of ACEs were associated with some aspects of maternal health, and all three domains of maternal health (maternal mental health, physical health, and adolescent pregnancy) were significantly associated with development of offspring's mental health problems.
   Conclusion: ACEs are highly prevalent in Kenyan informal settlements. Consistent with cross cultural literature on family stress model, maternal ACEs are robust predictors for poor child mental health. Preventive interventions for child mental health need to address maternal adverse childhood traumatic experiences as well as their current health in order to effectively promote child mental health.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether gender would moderate the association between teacher-child relationship and children's social skills in a sample of preschool children. Classroom teachers (N = 32) rated the quality of the teacher-child relationship (Student-Teacher Relationship Scale; STRS) and children's social skills (Social Skills Rating System; SSRS) in a sample of 160 preschool children in Oman. Children's ages ranged from 46 to 70 months with an average of 58 months (SD = 6 months). The hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis showed that the subscales (STRS) and the total score explained 21% of the variance in social skills. Gender was also a significant predictor of children's social skills. Females' close relationship with teachers predicted social skills better than males. Positive correlations were found between teacher-child conflict and both internalizing and externalizing behaviours, and between closeness and SSRS cooperation and self-control. Teacher-child dependence correlated negatively with both cooperation and SSRS total score. An independent-samples t-test showed that girls displayed higher scores than males in SSRS cooperation assertion, SSRS total score, and STRS closeness. Results inform policy-makers and practitioners about the gender disparity issue and the importance of developing positive and healthy teacher-child relationships in preschool.

AB Background: The quality of peer relations is linked to mental health in childhood and adolescence, but few studies have investigated its clinical relevance. In particular, the potential mediating role of peer functioning in the associations between different dimensions of symptoms and quality of life (QoL) has not been sufficiently examined.
   Objective: In a clinical sample of adolescents, we examined peer relations in light of psychiatric diagnoses, as well as QoL and symptoms of mental health problems, with particular focus on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and ADHD. We also examined the potential mediating role of peer problems in the relationship between such symptoms and QoL.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 603 adolescents (ages 13-18) referred to clinical assessment. Psychiatric diagnoses according to the criteria of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, were collected from participants' clinical charts. Symptoms of disorders, QoL, and quality of peer relations were measured by self-report questionnaires.
   Results: Adolescents diagnosed with anxiety/depressive disorder reported more peer problems and lower QoL than adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These findings were supported with symptom ratings. A path model with bootstrapping was used to assess the potential mediating role of peer problems in the association between symptoms and QoL, showing that peer problems partly mediated the relationship between emotional symptoms and QoL, but not the relationship between ADHD-symptoms and QoL.
   Conclusion: Improvement of peer relations may be a fruitful path for enhancing QoL among adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression.

AB Objective: Exposure to maternal depression during early childhood is a well-documented risk factor for offspring's internalizing problems, but the long-term risk and the psychosocial mechanisms underlying the association remain largely unknown. We examined whether maternal depression during early childhood was associated with offspring internalizing problems in adolescence, and the extent to which negative parenting, peer victimization, and poor friendship quality during middle childhood mediated this association.
   Method: We report on a population-based sample of children (n = 1,443) followed-up from 5 months to 15 years. We use yearly assessments of the exposure variable, that is, maternal depression (5 months to 5 years); the putative mediators, that is, peer victimization, friendship quality, and parenting practices (6-12 years); and assessment of the outcome variables at 15 years: self-reported major depressive (MD), generalized anxiety (GA), and social phobia (SP) symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to test mediation by peer and family relationships.
   Results: Exposure to maternal depression during early childhood was associated with higher levels of adolescent MD, GA, and SP. Peer victimization was the only significant mediator and explained 35.9% of the association with adolescent MD, 22.1% of that with GA, and 22.1% of that with SP.
   Conclusion: Exposure to maternal depression prior to age 5 years was associated with depression, anxiety, and social phobia extending to adolescence via its impact on peer victimization during middle childhood. Particular attention should be paid to victimization as one potential psychosocial factor via which maternal depression is associated with adolescent internalizing problems.

AB Objective: To examine whether mental health problems predict incident use of 12 different tobacco products in a nationally representative sample of youth and young adults.
   Method: This study analyzed Wave (W) 1 and W2 data from 10,533 12- to 24-year-old W1 never tobacco users in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Self-reported lifetime internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed at WI. Past 12-month use of cigarettes, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe, hookah, snus pouches, other smokeless tobacco, bidis and kreteks (youth only), and dissolvable tobacco was assessed at W2.
   Results: In multivariable regression analyses, high-severity WI internalizing (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3-1.8) and externalizing (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1-1.5) problems predicted W2 onset of any tobacco use compared to no/low/moderate severity. High-severity WI internalizing problems predicted W2 use onset across most tobacco products. High-severity W1 externalizing problems predicted onset of any tobacco (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3-1.8), cigarettes (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-2.0), ENDS (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5-2.1), and cigarillos (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.1) among youth only.
   Conclusion: Internalizing and externalizing problems predicted onset of any tobacco use. However, findings differed for internalizing and externalizing problems across tobacco products, and by age, gender, and race/ethnicity. In addition to screening for tobacco product use, health care providers should screen for a range of mental health problems as a predictor of tobacco use. Interventions addressing mental health problems may prevent youth _ itorainitiaring,tobacco use.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN; FOOD; DIET; CONSUMPTION; CHILDHOOD
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Although a lot of effort has been put into increasing fruit and vegetable intakes in preschool children, vegetable intake in this group is still low. This study investigated whether nutrition education focusing on fruit and vegetable intakes can affect preschoolers' fruit and vegetable intakes as well as their behavioral outcomes.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: Thirty-five preschoolers (54.3% boys, n = 19) aged 4-6 years residing in Seoul underwent weekly nutrition education intervention (8 sessions) between May and July 2016. Intakes of fruits and vegetables were measured during pre and post-intervention. At snack time, fresh fruit (150 g) and vegetable (120 g) snacks were distributed to each child by teachers. The remaining portions of the snacks were weighed and recorded for each child. Behavioral outcomes were measured by applying Child behavior checklist 1.5-5 and the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders.
   RESULTS: During post intervention, vegetable intake increased from 36.15 +/- 30.64 g to 48.01 +/- 31.23 g (P=0.010). Among the emotional and behavioral problems measured by parents, levels of total problems (P=0.001), internalizing (P=0.004), externalizing (P=0.003), anxiety and depression (P=0.001), and aggressive behavior (P=0.005) decreased. Anxiety (P=0.026) score, as measured by teachers, also decreased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition education of preschoolers regarding the intakes of fruits and vegetables had a positive effect on preschoolers' vegetable intake as well as on their emotional and behavioral outcomes. A long-term, large-scale study with a broader study design is warranted to further investigate the role of fruit and vegetable intake in cognitive development and behavior of preschoolers.

DE Depression; Anxiety; Dating violence perpetration; Adolescence
ID HEALTH
AB Background: Increasing evidence suggests an association between internalizing symptoms and violence against others. It remains unknown whether this link exists in the context of romantic relationships. In the current study, we tested whether anxiety and depression were associated over time with adolescent dating violence perpetration.
   Methods: The sample included 238 Canadian adolescents (42% boys). Using a longitudinal design, their anxiety, depressive symptoms, and dating violence perpetration were annually assessed from age 14 to 15 years.
   Results: Cross-lagged analyses revealed effects from anxiety and depressive symptoms to dating violence one year later (beta = 0.27, p <.001; and beta = 0.14, p =.04, respectively). No reversed cross-lagged paths were found from dating violence to subsequent anxiety or depression.
   Conclusions: Our findings underscore the predictive value of internalizing symptoms on dating violence perpetration. Reducing internalizing symptoms and improving coping strategies are important targets for the prevention of dating violence.

AB Maternal history of childhood abuse has consistently been linked to increased risk for poor emotional adjustment and parenting as an adult. The aim of this study was to examine a model that may explain the link between maternal history of childhood abuse and mothers' tendencies to respond negatively to their adolescent children's negative emotions. A community sample of 66 mothers with adolescent children participated. Path analysis supported associations between mothers with a history of high betrayal trauma revictimization (i.e., trauma perpetrated by someone close to the mother during childhood and again as a young adult) and increased difficulty regulating their emotions. In turn, mothers who struggled to regulate their own emotions were also more likely to respond negatively to their adolescent's negative emotions. Findings highlight effects of childhood trauma may be particularly problematic for mothers who are revictimized as young adults. These results provide the foundation for future research evaluating clinical interventions targeted at increasing maternal emotion regulation skills.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to many negative outcomes for adults, but scant research has examined their intergenerational effects. This study's purpose is (1) to identify whether an association exists between maternal ACEs and children's psychosocial functioning, and, if so, (2) to delineate whether such an association is linked to age in a sample of families involved with the child welfare system (N = 259). The relationship between maternal ACEs and child behavior was assessed using OLS regressions, and significant, positive associations were found linking the number of maternal ACEs and children's standardized Child Behavior Checklist scores, on both internalizing (B = 0.10, p < .001) and externalizing (B = 0.09, p < .001) subscales. Age was not significantly associated with CBCL scores. Findings suggest the need for deeper understanding of the pathways for intergenerational transmission of risk, improved identification of parental risk and its symptoms, use of interventions accounting for parental ACES, and greater attention to the environmental and societal contexts placing families in risk.

AB Based on process model and the organism-environment interaction model, the present study examined a possible pathway to better understand the relationships between parental conflict and their children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems through parenting stress and child emotionality. Mothers (N = 2925) of preschool children in China completed questionnaires regarding parental conflict, children's behavior problems, parenting stress, and child emotionality. Results indicated that parenting stress partially mediated the association between parental conflict and both of children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The mediating effects of parenting stress in the relationship between parental conflict and children's behavior problems were moderated by child emotionality. Specifically, the relationship between parental conflict and children's behavior problems via parenting stress was stronger for children with high (vs. low) negative emotionality. Limitations and implications of this study were discussed.

AB Background: In this study, we examined the associations of parents' and adolescents' exposure to community violence (CV) with externalizing and internalizing symptoms among adolescents aged 14-18, and the mediating role of some parental factors in these relationships. The study was based on the secondary trauma perspective in explaining parents' exposure to CV and its implications on their offspring.
   Method. Self-administered questionnaires were filled out by a semi-systematic random sample of 760 Palestinian parent-adolescent dyads from Israel.
   Results: The findings revealed that most of the Palestinian adolescents had witnessed CV, and more than one-third of them directly experienced such violence during their lifetime. Most of the parents had also witnessed such violence, and almost half of them directly experienced such violence during their lifetime. For parents and adolescents, greater exposure to CV was associated with more internalizing and externalizing symptoms among adolescents. Additionally, results of path analysis indicate that parental stress mediated the correlation between the adolescents' direct experience with CV and internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and it mediated the correlation of the parents' direct experience with CV and internalizing and externalizing symptoms among their adolescent offspring.
   Conclusions: The strengths and limitations of the study and their implications for future research are discussed. The implications of the results for prevention and intervention are also discussed.

AB Social cognition deficits and emotion dysregulation (ED) are frequently separately studied in relation to ADHD. This study aimed to examine the link between theory of mind (ToM) abilities and ED in children with ADHD. Participants were 200 children aged 11-17 years (study group, n = 100; healthy controls, n = 100). Emotion regulation skills were quantified by using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). ToM was quantified by three different tasks. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale parents form was used for determination of ADHD symptom severity (ADHD-SS). Children in the study group had more overall difficulties regulating their emotions than healthy controls. Within the study group, a significant correlation was found between the scores of DERS-total and ADHD-SS; and between the scores of DERS-total and gender. The linear regression showed that the predictor variables accounted for 56% of the variation in DERS-total. Unexpected Outcomes Test (UOT) scores significantly improved the accountability of the total variance when added to the linear regression. Our findings show that theory of mind deficits may partly explain ED in children with ADHD.

AB Introduction: The transition to adulthood can be stressful for minority adolescents, and many may cope through unhealthy behaviors, including substance use and obesity-related behaviors. This study tested substance use and obesity trajectories over time in African American youth, longitudinal associations of trajectories with mental and physical health in adulthood, and whether self-control and sex predict trajectories.
   Methods: Two longitudinal studies of 516 and 992 African American adolescents. In Study 1, substance use and obesity trajectories were assessed from ages 19 to 25 years. At age 25 years, internalizing and externalizing problems, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory biomarkers were measured. In Study 2, substance use and obesity trajectories were assessed from ages 17 to 29 years. Depression, delinquency, diabetes, blood pressure, and inflammatory biomarkers were measured at age 29 years. Data analyses were conducted in 2017.
   Results: Across both studies, the majority of African American adolescents evinced poor health behavior trajectories (latent class growth analyses), with 23%-27% showing increasing substance use over time, 18%-27% showing increasing obesity over time, and 9%-11% showing increases in both. ANCOVAs for trajectory analyses revealed that males were more likely to evince increasing substance use, with females more likely to show increasing obesity. Substance use trajectories were associated with poorer mental health in adulthood; obesity trajectories with poorer physical health in adulthood. Those with good health behavior trajectories had higher self-control in early adolescence.
   Conclusions: The transition to adulthood is a vulnerable period for many African Americans. Given the commonalities of substance use and obesity in their rewarding/stress-relieving properties, similar prevention efforts may help stem the rise of both in these youth.

AB This study examined the relations between parental harsh discipline (psychological aggression and corporal punishment) and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors and the moderating effects of adolescents' perceived normativeness of harsh discipline in Chinese society. Using a sample of 1158 Chinese middle-school students, our findings revealed that parental harsh discipline was associated with high levels of adolescent externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Adolescents' perceived normativeness of psychological aggression buffered the association between parental psychological aggression and adolescents' internalizing problem behaviors, whereas their perceived normativeness of corporal punishment buffered the association between parental corporal punishment and adolescents' externalizing problem behaviors. The findings from the current study highlight the importance of considering how adolescents' perceptions may influence the effects of parental harsh discipline on adolescent adjustment.

AB Youth in foster care with maltreatment experiences often demonstrate higher rates of mental and behavioral health problems compared to youth in the general population as well as maltreated youth who remain at home. Previous research has demonstrated that dimensions of maltreatment (type, frequency, and severity) and placement instability are two prominent factors that account for high rates of psychopathology (e.g., depression, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders). The present study sought to clarify the relation between maltreatment and mental health among youth in foster care by studying both the isolated dimensions of maltreatment and cumulative maltreatment, and to determine whether the effects of maltreatment on mental health operated indirectly through placement instability. Information on youth in foster care's (N = 496, M-age = 13.14) mental and behavioral health, maltreatment history, and placement changes were obtained from state records and primary caregivers. Using a SEM framework, the results suggest that maltreatment and placement instability each independently relate to mental and behavioral health problems. Further, none of the maltreatment types predicted greater placement instability in the current models. These findings suggest that placement stability is critical for mental health for youth in foster care, regardless of the type, severity, or frequency of their maltreatment experiences. Results also indicated that, although cumulative maltreatment predicted both internalizing and externalizing symptoms, maltreatment frequency and severity had direct relations to externalizing symptoms only. These findings underscore the utility of comprehensive maltreatment assessment, encouraging researchers and clinicians to assess and carefully consider the relation between maltreatment dimensions and outcomes.

AB Being the victim or perpetrator of peer teasing threatens children's immediate and long-term well-being. Given that many individual and contextual risk factors for peer victimization are transmitted within families, we tested whether fathers' childhood victimization experiences were directly or indirectly (via poor parenting and poor child adjustment) associated with their children's increased risk for similar experiences. Generation two (G2) fathers (n = 130) who had been assessed since age 9 years participated in an intergenerational study with their 268 G3 children and the 163 G2 mothers of these children. Peer teasing ratings were collected annually from G1 mothers, fathers, and teachers across G2 ages 9-16 years, and from the same three informant types across the same ages for G3 children. Also assessed was G2 fathers' poor parenting of G3 at ages 3-7 years and G3 poor adjustment (externalizing and internalizing behaviors, deviant peer association, low social competence) and body mass index (BMI) at ages 7-16 years. Models supported intergenerational stability in being teased that was partially mediated through G2 fathers' poor parenting and G3 poor adjustment. A direct intergenerational path in being teased remained significant, and G3 BMI uniquely predicted being teased. Childhood peer victimization is perpetuated across generations. Prevention aimed at poor parenting, child poor adjustment, and peer victimization itself may disrupt intergenerational stability in these adverse experiences.

AB Based on the family stress model and the stress-buffering model, the present study examines the relationship between caregivers' financial stress and child internalizing problem behaviors, the mediating role of caregiver maltreating behaviors, and whether social services for caregivers buffer this relationship. The current study is based on data from wave two of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being dataset (N = 2670). Results indicated increased high familial financial stress was associated with child internalizing problems. Caregivers' psychological aggression, physical assault, child neglect, and sexual maltreatment emerged as mechanisms mediating this relationship. Tangible service and social network service were found to mitigate the deleterious effect of financial stress on child internalizing behaviors, but primarily for those whom financial stress was high. These findings highlight the role perceived financial stress has on potential maltreatment and child outcomes, rather than relying on objective measures of economic status. Implications for social services focused interventions for children and caregivers coping with high levels of perceived financial stress are discussed.

AB The trauma symptoms of child sexual abuse (CSA) survivors don't end with the abuse, or even with the advent of adulthood. Instead, these symptoms can persist into all the realms of a survivor's life, including education, which sets the foundation for career advancement. This retrospective study of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (n = 260) examined the relationships between trauma symptoms, dissociation, dissociative amnesia, anxiety, depression, sleep problems and higher education attainment. The purpose of this study was to determine if these factors are associated with higher education completion for childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors. Linear regressions and ANOVAs suggest that many of these variables are significantly associated with survivors' educational trajectory, and multiple linear regressions show that trauma symptoms (as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40), caregivers' education levels, and age at onset of abuse are significant predictors of decreased education levels. This information can provide insight into additional risk and protective factors for CSA survivors in order to enhance acute and long-term management of trauma symptoms to increase levels of attainment of higher education.

AB Background: Mental health issues becoming the global public health challenge, especially among the youth (12-24 years of age), although they are often detected later in life. In India, the adolescent population constitutes a quarter of the country's population and burden of disease varies from 9.5 to 102/1000 population. Most of the mental health disorders remain unidentified due to negligence and ignorance of multiple factors. Keeping this in mind and lack of population-based studies with good quality for guiding the mental health policies, this study aims to document the prevalence of emotional and behavioral difficulties among adolescents in Sabarkantha district of Gujarat, India. Methods: This is a school-based cross-sectional study conducted among 11-19 years of school-going adolescents during August-September 2016. About 477 adolescents who gave consent to participate were selected from 20 randomly primary and secondary schools. A prevalidated questionnaire for sociodemographic information including global validated standard questionnaire for mental health scoring known as Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were administered and self-reported responses were documented. Statistical analysis was conducted through SPSS version 20. Results: Mean age of the study population was 14.2 +/- 1.4 years. About 14.6% boys and 12.6% of girls had abnormal total SDQ score, while 15.3% boys and 21.9% of girls had borderline SDQ score. Thus, 70.1% of boys compared to 65.6% girls had normal SDQ score. The difference between mean (higher mean score among girls) of total SDQ score of boys and girls was statically significant at the level of P < 0.05. Major risk factors for self-reported mental health issues were illiterate mother, occupation of parents, which make them away from family during daytime, nuclear family, severe addiction to alcohol in the family, financial problem in the family, and adolescent getting daily physical punishment. One-seventh adolescents are vulnerable for mental health problems found in this study. About one-fifth adolescents have internalizing (emotional) and about one-sixth have externalizing (conduct) manifestations. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to address the emotional and conduct manifestation among school-going adolescents. Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram framework needs to address these issues on priority.

AB Background: Mental disorders may show inherent cross-national variability in their prevalence. A considerable number of meta-analyses attribute this heterogeneity to the methodological diversity in published epidemiological studies. Cultural values are characteristically not assessed in meta-regression models as potential covariates. Aim: Our aim was to conduct a meta-regression analysis to explore to what extent certain cultural values and immigration rates (as indicator of cultural diversity) might be associated with the cross-national heterogeneity of prevalence rates. Method: To minimize methodological differences that may exert a confounding effect, prevalence rates were obtained from the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Mental Health Survey Initiative. Cultural indices (overall emancipative values; overall secular values) were collected from the World Value Survey, while immigration rates were registered by utilizing the data of the United Nations' World Population Policies 2005 report. Results: Meta-regression analysis indicated that overall emancipative values (i.e. promoting self-expression, non-violent protest) showed significant connection with lifetime and last year prevalence of any mood disorders (Z = 4.71, p = .001; Z = 2.35, p = .02) and any internalizing disorders (a merged category that combined mood and anxiety disorders; Z = 2.82, p = .004; Z = 2.34, p = .02). Overall secular values (i.e. rejecting authority and obedience) were negatively associated with last year prevalence of depression (Z = -2.75, p = .06). Multistep regression analysis indicated that immigration rate moderated the connection between cultural values and mental disorders. Countries with higher immigration rates showed higher emancipative and secular values. Conclusion: Our findings might function as potential foundation for formulating hypotheses regarding the cultural context's influence on the population's mental health.

AB Objective: To determine how transitions into and out of varying degrees of food insecurity impact children's academic competencies, executive functioning, and social skills (i.e., self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing behaviors, and internalizing behaviors). Method: Data come from the nationally representative kindergarten and first-grade waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (2010-2011); 11,958 children attending 1289 schools are included. Statistical analyses involve using a novel framework for measuring the transitional dynamics and depth of food insecurity to predict children's developmental outcomes using hierarchal linear models, which adjust for child- and school-level confounders. Results: Deepening food insecurity (DeepenFIS) was detrimental to children's self-control (-0.208, p < 0.01), math (-0.153, p < 0.01), and working memory (-5.202, p < 0.05) scores. Remitting marginal food insecurity was associated with negative effects on children's self-control (-0.082, p < 0.05) and interpersonal skills (-0.098, p < 0.01) but not on math or working memory. Persisting marginal food insecurity (PersistMFIS) negatively impacted children's self-control (-0.106, p < 0.05) and interpersonal skills (-0.115, p < 0.05). Emerging food insecurity (0.146, p < 0.01) and persisting food insecurity (0.071, p < 0.05) had detrimental effects on children's externalizing behaviors. Conclusion: Based on a novel food insecurity transitions framework and examination of multiple developmental outcomes, this study highlights the importance of examining both depth and transitional dynamics of food insecurity. Findings indicate that DeepenFIS and PersistMFIS may have potentially the most harmful effects on children's developmental outcomes. Clinically, findings support the need for addressing food insecurity in early childhood, even if the food insecurity challenges are marginal and just emerging.

AB Menstrual problems and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are common in adolescent girls. This study examined whether onset of menstruation and menstrual problems were related to NSSI in Chinese female adolescents. A total of 5696 adolescent girls participated in the baseline survey of Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort (SABHC) study in Shandong, China. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participants' lifetime and last-year NSSI, age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, menstrual irregularity, period pain, body weight and height, and demographics. Impulsivity was assessed by the Eysenck I7 impulsiveness scale. Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured by the Youth Self-Report of Child Behavior Checklist. The mean age of the sample was 15.0 years (SD = 1.4). The prevalence of lifetime and last year NSSI were 28.1% and 21.4% in Chinese adolescent girls. After adjusting for adolescent and family covariates (age, body mass index, impulsivity, internalizing and externalizing problems, paternal education, and family economic status), onset of menstruation was significantly associated with increased risk of lifetime NSSI (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.20-2.20) and last year NSSI (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.37-2.67). Among adolescent girls who had menarche, often irregular menstruation and period pain were significantly and independently associated with lifetime NSSI (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.03-1.79; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.58) and last year NSSI (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.07-1.98; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.03-1.61). Our findings suggest that onset of menarche, irregular periods, and period pain appear to be associated with increased risk of NSSI. These findings highlight the importance of menstruation hygiene education and treatment of menstrual problems to reduce the risk of NSSI among adolescent girls.

AB Asian American (AA) students in academically high-performing schools are thought to represent a high-risk but underidentified group for mental health need and potential suicide risk. Previous data indicate that internalizing mental health needs among AA students are more likely to go unmet compared with other racial/ethnic groups. This is the first study to examine disparities in rates of follow-up mental health services (MHS) for AA students assessed for suicide risk in schools. We examined rates of parental consent for MHS and ultimate linkage to care following risk assessments for students in an ethnically diverse, high-performing school district. Findings indicated that AA students were underrepresented among suicide risk assessments compared with their district enrollment. Although female students were more often referred for suicide risk assessments, AA boys appeared at heightened risk compared with boys from other racial/ethnic groups at the elementary and middle school levels. In terms of rates of MHS receipt, 43.4% of AA students and 57.1% of Latino students received new or ongoing MHS following risk assessment. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed racial/ethnic disparities in parental consent and linkage to care, such that AA students were at significantly higher risk of having parents decline MHS (relative risk ratio = .26, p < .001) and having no initiation of MHS following risk assessment (relative risk ratio = .55, p < .01) compared with Latino students. Potential barriers to parental consent and aftercare for AA families are discussed, highlighting the need for implementation strategies to reduce racial/ethnic disparities for youth at risk of suicide.

AB This study categorized school aged children by their bullying-related experiences and examined how such experiences impact their health outcomes and risk behaviors. Participants included 8955 children aged 11-to-16-year-old (50.3% males) from the Health Behavior of School-Aged Children (HBSC) 2009-2010 dataset, a nationally representative U.S. sample. Experiences of bullying and being bullied, health outcomes of minor symptoms, risk behaviors, and number of bullying types were measured. The associations were examined using logistic regression analysis with Bully Only, Victim Only, and Bully/Victim groups across gender. The Bully/Victim group had the worst health and behavioral outcomes among the groups. A clear gradient indicated that participants who experienced more types of bullying had higher possibilities of leading to risk behaviors and poor health, and the phenomenon persists through these studied symptoms. Girls tended to have more internalizing problems while boys tended to have more externalizing problems. The timely identification of minor psychosomatic symptoms may be used in the early detection on whether children are encountering bullying. Preventive interventions for reduce the harm are warranted.

AB Previous literature has not examined the processes underlying the relations among parent-child relationship quality, parental psychopathology, and child psychopathology in the context of gender. Further, research examining these variables in emerging adulthood is lacking. The current study examined whether parent-child relationship quality would mediate the relation between parental and child psychopathology, and whether gender moderated these associations. Participants were emerging adults (N=665) who reported on perceptions of their parents' and their own psychological problems as well as their parent-child relationship quality. Results indicated that the relation between parental internalizing problems and parent-child relationship quality was positive for males, and that mother-child relationship quality was related positively to psychological problems in males. This suggests that sons may grow closer to their parents (particularly their mother) who are exhibiting internalizing problems; in turn, this enmeshed relationship may facilitate transmission of psychopathology. Mediational paths were conditional upon gender, suggesting moderated mediation. Overall, the current study emphasizes that the complexities of parenting must be understood in the context of gender. Further, the mother-son dyad may particularly warrant further attention.

AB This study examined the effects of comorbid ADHD symptoms, internalizing psychopathology, Callous-Unemotional (CU) Traits, and conduct problem severity on children's response to an evidence-based psychosocial intervention. Clinic-referred children with DBD ages 8-12years (N=76) participated in a 15-week multi-component intervention. Parents provided weekly ratings of children's oppositionality-defiance, peer problems, and impairment. Oppositionality-defiance, peer problems, and impairment decreased significantly over the course of the intervention; however, there was considerable variability in weekly ratings. Baseline ADHD symptoms, internalizing psychopathology, CU traits, and conduct problem severity were unrelated to rate of change across treatment. However, ADHD symptoms uniquely predicted more oppositionality-defiance, peer problems, and impairment averaged across the 15 weeks of treatment. Follow-up analyses suggested this was driven by hyperactivity-impulsivity rather than inattention. Children with DBD and comorbid symptoms appear to benefit from a multi-component intervention, but those with ADHD symptoms may require additional support to address social and behavioral challenges.

AB Childhood trauma exposure is a significant public health problem. While adult mental health consequences of such experiences are well documented, sex differences in both prevalence and severity are less understood. Sex based differences in biological circuitry and physiological trauma responses are proposed to potentiate the differential risk for pathogenesis of mental health disorders among adults. This paper will provide a contextualized summary of neuroendocrine, neuroimaging, and behavioral epigenetic studies on biological sex differences contributing to internalizing psychopathology, specifically posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, among adults with a history of childhood abuse. This review concludes with a discussion of implications for trauma interventions and sex-based biopsychological research in violence prevention.

AB The present investigation examined the underlying role of anxiety sensitivity and its facets in the association between emotion dysregulation and three of the most prevalent and debilitating symptom classes among trauma-exposed psychiatric inpatient youth: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression symptoms. Participants (N= 50; 52.0% female; M-age =15.1 years, SD = .51, range 12-17 years) completed an assessment battery that included measures of emotion dysregulation anxiety sensitivity, PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Consistent with hypotheses, the global construct of anxiety sensitivity, as well as its mental incapacitation concerns and disease concerns facets, explained, in part, associations between emotion dysregulation and the three symptom classes. The study results provide novel and clinically meaningful findings regarding the potential mechanistic role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation of emotion dysregulation to PTSD and internalizing symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient adolescents. As such, findings underscore the potential value of targeting anxiety sensitivity in general, and mental incapacitation and disease concerns specifically, as a means of reducing risk for internalizing psychopathology among trauma-exposed inpatient youth.

AB Background Exposure to maternal depression bears long-term negative consequences for children's well-being. Yet, no study has tested the joint contribution of maternal and child's hypothalamic pituitary axis and immune systems in mediating the effects of maternal depression on child psychopathology. Methods We followed a birth cohort over-represented for maternal depression from birth to 10 years (N = 125). At 10 years, mother and child's cortisol (CT) and secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA), biomarkers of the stress and immune systems, were assayed, mother-child interaction observed, mothers and children underwent psychiatric diagnosis, and children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms reported. Results Depressed mothers had higher CT and s-IgA levels and displayed more negative parenting, characterized by negative affect, intrusion, and criticism. Children of depressed mothers exhibited more Axis-I disorders, higher s-IgA levels, and greater social withdrawal. Structural equation modeling charted four paths by which maternal depression impacted child externalizing and internalizing symptoms: (a) increasing maternal CT, which linked with higher child CT and behavior problems; (b) augmenting maternal and child's immune response, which were associated with child symptoms; (c) enhancing negative parenting that predicted child social withdrawal and symptoms; and (d), via a combined endocrine-immune pathway suppressing symptom formation. Conclusions Our findings, the first to test stress and immune biomarkers in depressed mothers and their children in relation to social behavior, describe mechanisms of endocrine synchrony in shaping children's stress response and immunity, advocate the need to follow the long-term effects of maternal depression on children's health throughout life, and highlight maternal depression as an important public health concern.

   CONTEXT
AB Ethnic-racial and socioeconomic residential segregation are endemic in the United States, representing societal-level sociocultural processes that likely shape development. Considered alongside communities' abilities to respond to external forces, like stratification, in ways that promote youth adaptive functioning and mitigate maladaptive functioning, it is likely that residence in segregated neighborhoods during adolescence has both costs and benefits. We examined the influences that early adolescents' neighborhood structural characteristics, including Latino concentration and concentrated poverty, had on a range of developmentally salient downstream outcomes (i.e., internalizing, externalizing, prosocial behaviors, and ethnic-racial identity resolution) via implications for intermediate aspects of adolescents' community participation and engagement (i.e., ethnic-racial identity exploration, ethnic-racial discrimination from peers, and school attachment). These mediational mechanisms were tested prospectively across three waves (Magew1-w3 = 12.79, 15.83, 17.37 years, respectively) in a sample of 733 Mexican-origin adolescents (48.8% female). We found higher neighborhood Latino concentration during early adolescence predicted greater school attachment and ethnic-racial identity exploration and lower discrimination from peers in middle adolescence. These benefits, in turn, were associated with lower externalizing and internalizing and higher ethnic-racial identity resolution and prosocial behaviors in late adolescence. Findings are discussed relative to major guidelines for integrating culture into development and psychopathology.

AB Development involves synergistic interplay among genotypes and the physical and cultural environments, and integrating genetics into experimental designs that manipulate the environment can improve understanding of developmental psychopathology and intervention efficacy. Consistent with differential susceptibility theory, individuals can vary in their sensitivity to environmental conditions including intervention for reasons including their genotype. As a consequence, understanding genetic influences on intervention response is critical. Empirically, we tested an interaction between a genetic index representing sensitivity to the environment and the Family Check-Up intervention. Participants were drawn from the Early Steps Multisite randomized prevention trial that included a low-income and racially/ethnically diverse sample of children and their families followed longitudinally (n = 515). As hypothesized, polygenic sensitivity to the environment moderated the effects of the intervention on 10-year-old children's symptoms of internalizing psychopathology, such that children who were genetically sensitive and were randomly assigned to the intervention had fewer symptoms of child psychopathology than genetically sensitive children assigned to the control condition. A significant difference in internalizing symptoms assessed with a clinical interview emerged between the intervention and control groups for those 0.493 SD above the mean on polygenic sensitivity, or 25% of the sample. Similar to personalized medicine, it is time to understand individual and sociocultural differences in treatment response and individualize psychosocial interventions to reduce the burden of child psychopathology and maximize well-being for children growing up in a wide range of physical environments and cultures.

AB A great deal of research has focused on acculturation and enculturation, which represent the processes of adapting to a new culture. Despite this growing literature, results have produced inconsistent findings that may be attributable to differences in terms of the instruments used to assess acculturation and enculturation. Utilizing a 3-year longitudinal data set (with 1-year lags between assessments), the present study explored the psychometric properties of the Bicultural Involvement Questionnaire-Short Version (BIQ-S) and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II (ARSMA-II) and examined the overlap between changes in these measures as they relate to internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. The present sample consisted of 216 immigrant Latino youth (43% boys; mean age 13.6 years at baseline; SD = 1.44 years, range 10 to 17). Exploratory structural equation modeling identified factor structures for the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II that diverged from their hypothesized structure. Growth curve models also indicate divergence between the BIQ-S and ARSMA-II in terms of change in acculturation and enculturation processes. Finally, the present findings emphasized that measures of acculturation and enculturation are not equivalent in terms of their effects on internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate associations between use of cigarettes, cannabis, and alcohol (CCA) and psychosocial problems among adolescents with different cultural backgrounds living in Nordic countries. Data from six questionnaire-based surveys conducted in Denmark, Norway, and Greenland, with participants from different cultural and religious backgrounds, were compared. A total of 2212 adolescents between 15 and 18years of age participated in the study. The surveys were carried out nationally and in school settings. All adolescents answered a 12-item questionnaire (YouthMap12) with six questions identifying externalizing behavior problems and six questions identifying internalizing behavior problems, as well as four questions regarding childhood neglect and physical or sexual abuse, and questions about last month use of CCA. Externalizing behavior problems were strongly associated with all types of CCA use, while childhood history of abuse and neglect was associated with cigarette and cannabis use. The associations did not differ by sample. Despite differences between samples in use of CCA, national, cultural, and socioeconomic background, very similar associations were found between psychosocial problems and use of CCA. Our findings highlight the need to pay special attention to adolescents with externalizing behavior problems and experiences of neglect and assault in CCA prevention programs, across different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.

AB Objective To analyze associations among child dependence, perceived parental acceptance, and children's psychological adjustment.
   Background Extreme levels of both perceived parental acceptance and rejection are postulated to be associated with dependence in such a way that may lead to psychological maladjustment. However, this influence has not been empirically tested to date.
   Method A convenience sample of 989 children (9-16 years of age, 45.7% boys) in Spain completed the Personality Assessment Questionnaire, the Youth Self Report (YSR), and the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire for children. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple regressions.
   Results Child dependence and parental acceptance had a curvilinear relationship and were both associated with children's psychological maladjustment. Children's dependence, family structure, and children's age moderated the relationship between parental rejection and children's maladjustment.
   Conclusion Results provide empirical support for the postulated relationships between perceived parental acceptance and child dependence and show the relevance of considering children's age and family structure as potential moderators. Furthermore, child dependence tends to buffer the impact of parental rejection in certain individuals.
   Implications Child dependence and parental rejection should be considered together in parenting intervention programs. Moreover, promoting dependence could be part of this intervention in certain family settings.

AB Purpose: To compare risk behaviors between youths living with a chronic condition (CC) and their healthy peers, controlling for condition severity.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the baseline wave of the GenerationFRee study (students aged 15-24 years in postmandatory education) during the 2014-2015 school year. The sample (N = 5,179) was divided into youths with CC without limitations (N = 536; 10.4%), youths with limitations (N = 114; 2.2%), and a control group (CG; N = 4,529; 87.4%). Groups were compared on internalizing (perceived health status, vision of their future, emotional wellbeing) and externalizing behaviors (substance use, gambling, excessive internet use, disordered eating, violent and antisocial acts) controlling for potential confounders. Statistical analyses were carried out through structural equation modeling. Results are given as unstandardized coefficients.
   Results: Overall, CC youths showed an association with internalizing behaviors (coefficient: .78) but not with externalizing behaviors. In fact, the connection with externalizing behaviors was indirect via the internalizing behaviors (.32). CC Youths reporting psychological issues were more likely to adopt every externalizing behavior. Analyzing separately youths with CC limiting daily life activities and those without limitations, the results did not change substantially. However, the association with internalizing behaviors was much higher for those reporting limitations (2.18 vs. .42).
   Conclusions: Our results show that the link between suffering from a CC and adopting risk behaviors is indirect through internalizing behaviors. Health professionals should address emotional wellbeing and perception of the future rather than focus exclusively on the effects of risk behaviors on specific diseases.

AB The present study tested the mediating role of adolescents' emotional intelligence for the effects of family risks on adolescent adjustment in two Chinese settings, namely Hong Kong and Macau. A total of 804 Chinese adolescents (36.3% female) in Hong Kong (n=441) and Macau (n=363) completed a set of self-reported questionnaires. Findings based on path analysis suggested that economic stress was positively associated with family conflict. In addition, family risks including economic stress and family conflict were inversely associated with adolescents' emotional intelligence and prosocial behaviors, and positively associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems. Bootstrapping supported emotional intelligence as a mediating mechanism between family risks and adolescent adjustment, as indexed by their prosocial behaviors, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Multi-group path analysis further demonstrated gender similarities in the risk and protective processes underlying adolescent adjustment. Extending the findings based on studies conducted in Western contexts, the present research indicated the detrimental effects of family stressors, including economic stress and family conflict, on adolescent functioning in Hong Kong and Macau. Findings contributed to the growing literature that delineates risk and protective processes underlying adjustment outcomes in Chinese adolescents.

AB Our objective was to expand understanding of the associations between fathers' and mothers' anxiety symptoms, their perceptions of marital quality, and their children's maladjustment behaviors. Sixty Israeli families with a child aged 3-5 participated. Mothers and fathers completed self-report questionnaires assessing parents' anxiety symptoms, marital dissatisfaction, and marital overt conflict, and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The actor-partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM) design with distinguishable dyads within a path analysis framework was used. Findings showed that marital dissatisfaction of both mothers and fathers partially mediated the links between mothers' anxiety and child behaviors. For externalizing behaviors, actor and partner effects were found, so that mothers' anxiety symptoms predicted mothers' own marital dissatisfaction (actor effect) and fathers' marital dissatisfaction (partner effect), which, in turn were linked with children's externalizing behaviors. As for internalizing behaviors, only actor effect was found, so that mothers' anxiety symptoms were linked with maternal dissatisfaction, which, in turn, was linked with child internalizing behaviors. For fathers' anxiety symptoms, the APIMeM indicated only direct effects on both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. These findings highlight the risk associated with parental anxiety and the contribution of the marital relations to children's adjustment and are discussed in light of Bronfenbrenner's ecological model and Emotional Security Theory.

AB A large body of literature provides support for the role of empathy as a prominent factor in socio-emotional development and functioning. Although deficits in empathy are known to associate with maladaptive behaviors, less literature documents the effects of excessive empathy, which has been found to relate to various internalizing problems such as depression. There are two types of empathy, cognitive and affective, which manifest themselves in different ways and thus, have differential effects on outcomes. Therefore, in a sample of 724 Belgian adolescents (M-age=13.83 +/-.96), the present study sought to elucidate the effects of cognitive and affective empathy on depressive symptoms and self-esteem. We also explored the interactive effects of empathy and adolescent perceived mother-child relationship quality in the prediction of our outcomes. Results revealed affective and cognitive empathy predicted outcomes concurrently, with affective empathy predicting more maladaptive outcomes and cognitive empathy predicting more positive outcomes. Interaction effects emerged between affective empathy and the relationship quality indicators. However, no interactions occurred with cognitive empathy. Further, longitudinal data revealed only cognitive empathy had long-term effects (predicting positive outcomes such as lower levels of depression and higher levels of self-esteem) suggesting that cognitive empathy may be a protective factor. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Grounded in a conceptual model of family processes underlying socioemotional development and a contextual model of parenting style, the present study addresses the associations between parenting practices, mothers' emotion socialization, and child adjustment in middle childhood. A total of 217 families involving mothers, fathers, and 8-year-old children (101 boys, 116 girls) were recruited to participate in this study. Findings suggested that fathers' inconsistent discipline and positive parenting practices predicted greater and fewer children's adjustment problems, respectively, over and above the effect of mothers' parenting practices. Mothers' emotion discussion with children predicted children's lower externalizing problems. Mothers' emotion discussion further buffered the association between mothers' inconsistent discipline and children's internalizing problems, such that children exhibited fewer internalizing problems when mothers engaged in moderate to high levels of emotion discussion with children. Supporting family systems theory, both mothers' and fathers' parenting processes contributed to child development. These findings add to the literature by providing evidence for cumulative family asset and risk underlying child adjustment. Based on the findings, scholars and practitioners may consider adding more emotion-based components of parenting to existing interventions that focus on parenting discipline.

AB Although teachers are in a key position to identify and support students with emotional and behavioral challenges, their provision of these supports is often inconsistent. The current study investigated patterns in teacher identification of student emotional and behavioral challenges, as well as their provision of supports. Participants were 172 elementary, middle, and high school teachers from a Northeastern school district who responded to two vignettes-one describing a female student with internalizing and one describing a male student with externalizing symptoms. Vignettes were randomized to be moderate or severe. Teachers rated concern for students and their likelihood of providing a series of responses and supports. Results indicated that teachers were more concerned about severe than moderate vignettes, and were more concerned about females with internalizing than males with externalizing symptoms. Middle school teachers rated vignettes as more concerning than elementary teachers, particularly the male externalizing vignette. Elementary teachers indicated that they would provide more classroom-based emotional/behavioral supports and specialty supports than middle and high school teachers; however, high school teachers more often indicated that they would reduce expectations and provide a referral for students. Implications and future research directions for work with teachers on identifying and supporting students are discussed.

AB The current study aimed to investigate the intergenerational transmission of parenting and internalizing problems in children. Serial mediation models were used to assess parental psychological control and child emotion regulation as mediators in linking grandparents' parenting (care or overprotection) and children's internalizing problems. The sample consisted of 150 Chinese children (M-age = 8.54, SD = 1.67) and their parents. The parents reported the grandparents' parenting and children's internalizing problems, and the children reported on their emotion regulation. Both the children's ratings and behavioral observations were used to assess the parents' psychological control. The results showed that grandmothers' parenting was significantly associated with children's internalizing problems, and this relationship was mediated by perceived (but not observed) parental psychological control and children's emotion regulation. These results highlighted the differential role of children's perceptions of parental control and the observed parental psychological control on internalizing symptoms in children.

AB Stepfamilies experience unique dynamics, with implications for family functioning and youth well-being. Emerging research is incorporating a holistic perspective whereby stepfamily dynamics are viewed more comprehensively, and constellations of stepfamily relationship quality are identified. In the current study, we examined short-term and long-term associations between latent patterns of stepfamily relationships (including the quality of mother-child, stepfather-child, nonresident father-child, and stepcouple dyads) and youth adjustment (i.e., depression, delinquency, self-esteem) across three stages of youth development: adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood. Using a representative sample of adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Harris et al., 2009), results from longitudinal structural equation models and latent-growth curve models indicated that youth adjustment over time is optimized among youth in a residence-centered (i.e., high-quality relationships among mother-child, stepfather-child, and stepcouple dyads) or inclusive (i.e., high-quality relationships across all dyads, including the nonresident father) pattern, as compared with youth in an unhappy-couple (i.e., low-quality stepcouple relationship) or parent-child disconnection (i.e., low-quality relationships between youth and each parental figure) pattern. The results point to many similarities between male and female youth in terms of adjustment responses to patterns of stepfamily relationships, although some differences became apparent. In the context of stepfamily relationships marked by low-quality relationships, male youth might exhibit greater initial levels of externalizing problems than female youth, whereas female youth might exhibit greater initial levels of internalizing problems than male youth. Implications for future research and intervention and prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Background
   Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is a broad term describing the full spectrum of disorders in any of the stages of bladder function-storage or voiding LUTD is a clinical condition associated with emotional and behavioral disorders in children. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association of emotional andbehavioral symptoms and their impact on the quality of life (QoL) in children and adolescents with LUTD.
   Methods
   Eighty-eight patients and their parents enrolled in an interdisciplinary program for children and adolescents with LUTD were included in the analysis. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to estimate the prevalence of behavioral and emotional problems through the assessment of 14 items. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (versions for parents and children) was applied in the versions for parents and children to evaluate the QoL. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory-PedsQL, version 4.0-was applied separately for parents and patients. The association of clinical variables and aspects related to QoL of patients were evaluated through non-parametric correlations (Spearman) and multiple linear regression analysis.
   Results
   According to CBCL's clinical scores, 56% of the patients showed total behavioral problems, 55% internalizing, and 38% externalizing. When comparing the conditions of LUTD and the CBCL scores, patients with voiding postponement had the lowest rates of total problems (P=0.036). Children and adolescents with LUTD who also had enuresis showed a higher frequency of externalizing problems (P=0.001), especially aggressive behavior (P=0.013). Scores of patients with LUTD were significantly lower in all domains of QoL than normative data. Presence of behavioral problems was associated with worse QoL in all evaluated aspects. The total QoL was most influenced by the CBCL school competence scale according to the regression model analysis.
   Conclusions
   The study findings suggest the relevance of evaluation of behavioral and social repercussions of LUTD to improve the multidisciplinary approach for this condition in pediatric population.

AB We proposed that having mutually hostile interactions with others is a strong environmental stress factor that, together with diverse psychosocial problems, characterizes adolescents who self-harm. Using cluster analysis, this study examined the naturally occurring patterns of hostility conditions and psychosocial difficulties in a normative sample of 2,029 adolescents (50% boys; M-age = 13.89). Results showed that self-harming behavior was significantly higher among the subgroup of adolescents with mutually hostile interactions who exhibited both internalizing and externalizing problems than among adolescents with other interpersonal-psychosocial configurations. Also, this subgroup of adolescents reported high impulsivity, anger dysregulation, and low self-esteem. These findings support recent research that indicates that adolescents who self-harm also tend to expose others to hostility and display externalizing symptoms.

AB Introduction: Peer relationships play a vital role in adolescents' lives and are considered to be especially critical for youth who experience elevated depressive symptoms. Unfortunately, depressed youth tend to have difficulties with existing friendships (e.g., fewer and lower quality friendships), which may exacerbate their symptoms. Little is known, however, about how depressed youth approach the initial stages of friendship formation, which may have implications for the types of social support they can access. Method: Using a conversation task designed to build intimacy, older adolescents (N = 228, M age = 19.54 years) with and without elevated depressive symptoms interacted with a previously unknown, same-gender partner. Results: Results suggested that adolescents with elevated symptoms experienced interactions differently (e.g., speculated more about their conversation partner and thought their partner was speculating more about them, experienced more negative affect) than nondepressed peers. The depression status of the potential friend also mattered, as participants paired with partners of similar emotional adjustment status wanted to talk more and felt closer to one another than did mismatched partners. Discussion: Findings underscore that depressive symptoms impact even the earliest stages of friendship formation. From the perspective of interpersonal theories of depression, implications for bolstering depressed adolescents' relationships are discussed.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine whether online family problem-solving treatment (OFPST) is more effective in improving behavioral outcomes after pediatric traumatic brain injury with increasing time since injury.
   METHODS: This was an individual participant data meta-analysis of outcome data from 5 randomized controlled trials of OFPST conducted between 2003 and 2016. We included 359 children ages 5 to 18 years who were hospitalized for moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury 1 to 24 months earlier. Outcomes, assessed pre-and posttreatment, included parentreported measures of externalizing, internalizing, and executive function behaviors and social competence.
   RESULTS: Participants included 231 boys and 128 girls with an average age at injury of 13.6 years. Time since injury and age at injury moderated OFPST efficacy. For earlier ages and short time since injury, control participants demonstrated better externalizing problem scores than those receiving OFPST (Cohen's d = 0.44; P =.008; n = 295), whereas at older ages and longer time since injury, children receiving OFPST had better scores (Cohen's d = -0.60; P =.002). Children receiving OFPST were rated as having better executive functioning relative to control participants at a later age at injury, with greater effects seen at longer (Cohen's d = -0.66; P =.009; n = 298) than shorter (Cohen's d = -0. 28; P =.028) time since injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: OFPST may be more beneficial for older children and when begun after the initial months postinjury. With these findings, we shed light on the optimal application of family problem-solving treatments within the first 2 years after injury.

AB Cybervictimization and cyberbullying is an important risk factor for the mental health of individuals, for example, suffering cybervictimization can lead to suicide in victims. However, few studies have been conducted in Argentina to determine their psychological correlates in college students. Therefore, an intentional sample of 410 university students who studied regular first to fifth year in private universities of Parana, Entre Rios, Argentina was constituted; 75% were women. The ages ranged from 17 years to 36, with an average of 21.8 years. The participants completed Calvete et al. Cyberbullying Questionnaire, Lovibond and Lovibond Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and Labrador et al. Problematic Use of New Technology Questionnaire. A 27% was cybervictim and a 31% was cyberaggressor, more women than men were cybervictims, and no differences were detected regarding cyberaggression. The results showed that cybervictims presented more depression, anxiety-stress and problematic use of new technology, whereas cyberaggressor only showed more problematic use of new technology. In the discussion we analyze the implications of these findings and we provide limitations and suggestions for future studies.

This study aims to analyze the relationship between ADHD symptoms, social abilities and internalizing problems. Children aged between 7 and 10 years and their teachers were presented with some self-report questionnaires. The results show an agreement between teacher and child assessments on classmates' social skills. It also emerges that relational difficulties mediate between ADHD symptoms and internalizing disorders. Suggestions for the clinical intervention with children with ADHD symptoms that also show social and/or internalizing disorders are discussed.

AB Exposure to bullying victimization is associated with a wide-range of short and long-term adverse outcomes. However, the extent to which these associations reflect a causal influence of bullying victimization remains disputed. Here, we aimed to provide the most stringent evidence regarding the consequences of bullying victimization by meta-analyzing all relevant quasi-experimental (QE) studies. Multilevel random effects models and metaregression were employed to (a) estimate the pooled QE-adjusted effect size (Cohen d) for bullying victimization on outcomes and to (b) evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity. A total of 16 studies were included. We derived 101 QE-estimates from three different methods (twin design, fixed effects analysis, and propensity score matching) for three pools of outcomes (internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, academic difficulties). QE-adjusted effects were small for internalizing symptoms (d(adjusted) = 0.27, 95% CI [0.05, 0.49]), and smaller for externalizing symptoms (d(adjusted) = 0.15, 95% CI [0.10, 0.21]) and academic difficulties (d(adjusted) = 0.10, 95% CI [0.06, 0.13]). Accounting for a shared rater effect between the exposure and the outcome further reduced the effect for internalizing (d(nonshared rater) = 0.14, 95% CI [0.05, 0.23]) and externalizing symptoms (d(nonshared rater) = 0.06, 95% CI [0.01, 0.11]). Finally, the adverse effects declined in the long-term, most markedly for internalizing symptoms (d(long-term) = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.13]). Based on the most stringent evidence available to date, findings indicate that bullying victimization may causally impact children's wellbeing in the short-term, especially anxiety and depression levels. The reduction of adverse effects over time highlights the potential for resilience in individuals who have experienced bullying. Secondary preventive interventions in bullied children should therefore focus on resilience and address children's preexisting vulnerabilities.

AB Attunement, or synchrony, of behavior and physiology has been well documented in family, mother-child, and romantic relationships. This study aimed to determine whether attunement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs in women's close friendships, and the role of a common social style, co-rumination in that attunement. Saliva samples (later assayed for cortisol) were collected from 37 dyads (74 individuals) during a laboratory task in which they were either asked to work together toward a common goal (control task) or discuss interpersonal problems, providing opportunity for co-rumination. Findings suggest that friends demonstrated adrenocortical attunement prior to engaging in either task, and that the level of attunement prior to the task predicted co-rumination and its components for both groups. Co-rumination, in turn, predicted adrenocortical attunement after the task. These findings suggest that bidirectional attunement of HPA activity may serve a bonding function within women's close friendships. Implications for how these findings fit with the tend-and-befriend hypothesis are discussed.

AB There is accumulating evidence that both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and cortisol play an important role in regulating physical maturation and brain development. High DHEA levels tend to be associated with neuroprotective and indirect anabolic effects, while high cortisol levels tend to be associated with catabolic and neurotoxic properties. Previous literature has linked the ratio between DHEA and cortisol levels (DC ratio) to disorders of attention, emotional regulation and conduct, but little is known as to the relationship between this ratio and brain development. Due to the extensive links between the amygdala and the cortex as well as the known amygdalar involvement in emotional regulation, we examined associations between DC ratio, structural covariance of the amygdala with whole-brain cortical thickness, and validated report-based measures of attention, working memory, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, in a longitudinal sample of typically developing children and adolescents 6-22 years of age. We found that DC ratio predicted covariance between amygdalar volume and the medial anterior cingulate cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere. DC ratio had a significant indirect effect on working memory through its impact on prefrontal-amygdalar covariance, with higher DC ratios associated with a prefrontal-amygdalar covariance pattern predictive of higher scores on a measure of working memory. Taken together, these findings support the notion, as suggested by animal and in vitro studies, that there are opposing effects of DHEA and cortisol on brain development in humans, and that these effects may especially target prefrontal-amygdalar development and working memory, in a lateralized fashion.

AB Modular therapies are systematic approaches to mental health treatment based on therapeutic elements common to multiple evidence-based practices. Given the flexibility and efficacy demonstrated in outpatient settings, modular therapies may be a feasible and effective approach to mental health treatment in schools. We conducted a systematic literature review to summarize the current evidence regarding modular school mental health programs, which consisted of seven studies investigating four distinct school-based modular treatment packages for internalizing concerns. In our review, no studies specifically examined modular therapy for disruptive behavior disordersa common referral question for school mental health practitioners. Overall, the modular approach appears to be acceptable to stakeholders, but it is unclear whether school-based clinicians can implement proposed modules with adequate integrity, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding real-world effectiveness. We believe implementation studies are needed to draw firm conclusions regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of modular school mental health, but the research to date appears promising.

AB Children in contact with the child welfare system (CWS) represent a vulnerable population that is at an increased risk of poor mental health and academic outcomes. Although the majority of research has focused on the academic benefits of school engagement, studies have also found a negative association between school engagement and youth mental health outcomes. Surprisingly limited research, however, has considered the possibility of a bidirectional relationship between school engagement and youth mental health, and even fewer studies have examined this relationship in high-risk populations, such as children in contact with the CWS. The present study addresses this issue by utilizing longitudinal data from a national sample of 2633 children in contact with the CWS, the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW I), to examine the possible bidirectional relationship between school engagement and mental health symptoms. Data were collected from this sample (mean age=10.04; 52.3% female) over three time points (18months apart). Structural equation modeling results indicated that students' mental health (externalizing/internalizing symptoms) predicted subsequent school engagement levels. School engagement, on the other hand, was not a predictor of mental health symptoms at later time points. Findings point to the existence of a unidirectional relationship from mental health symptoms to school engagement for children in contact with the CWS. Directions for future mental health interventions for this population are discussed.

AB Although school climate has been identified as a protective factor for youth development in the United States, few longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between school climate and student outcomes in China. This study explored the relationship between school climate, victimization, covitality, internalizing symptoms, and academic achievement, and whether school climate moderated the relationship between victimization and mental health outcomes using longitudinal data. Survey data were collected from 1150 Chinese 3rd to 6th grade students (M-age = 10.27 years, SD = 1.03 years, 55% boys) from five elementary schools at two time points. Regression results showed that school climate factors, including student-teacher relationships, clear expectations, respect for diversity and fairness of rules, predicted victimization, mental health (both internalizing symptoms and covitality), and academic grades six months later. School climate did not moderate the relationship between victimization and mental health. Our results suggest that it is important to foster positive school climate in order to prevent bullying and promote positive youth development among elementary students in China.

AB Epidemiological data are crucial to plan adequate prevention strategies. Thus, this study aims at obtaining the prevalence of mental health problems (MHP) and subthreshold psychiatric disorders based on a representative sample of Austrian adolescents.
   Adolescents aged 10-18 were recruited from Austrian schools. Emotional and behavioral problems were determined using the Youth Self-Report (YSR); the point prevalence of subthreshold psychiatric disorders was assessed using structured diagnostic interviews. Sociodemographic variables including socioeconomic background, migration status, family structure, and place of residence were obtained. In addition, a non-school sample (unemployed adolescents, and child and adolescent psychiatry patients) was included to enhance representativeness and generalizability.
   3446 students, 37 unemployed adolescents, and 125 child and adolescent psychiatric patients provided analyzable YSR data sets. In the school sample, 16.5% scored in the clinically relevant range, while internalizing problems were more prevalent (17.8%) than externalizing problems (7.4%). These prevalences increased by 0.7-2.0% when the non-school sample was taken into account. A low socioeconomic status (SES) and living in single parent families were associated with higher problem scores. Regarding the interviewed sample (377 students and 407 parents), subthreshold psychiatric disorders were observed in 12.7% of students. 92.5% of them have not yet received any kind of help.
   A significant proportion of Austrian adolescents are at risk for MHP. A non-responder analysis indicates that the observed prevalence may be even underestimated. These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted prevention, especially for reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms and for adolescents in disadvantaged families.

AB The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) has previously been shown to be a psychometrically sound instrument used to assess disruptive behaviors in children in the United States and in other cultures/countries but not in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure and to establish the discriminative validity of the ECBI with two groups of Taiwanese children: 70 clinic-referred children with clinically elevated externalizing behavior problems and 70 community-based matched comparison children. Exploratory factor analyses resulted in a six-factor model for the clinic-referred sample and a five-factStrengths and Difficultieor model for the matched comparison sample, indicating that the ECBI is not unidimensional. Adequate convergent and divergent validity also were established between the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales and another measure of child externalizing (for assessing convergent validity) and internalizing (for determining divergent validity) behavior. The results of the present study suggest that the ECBI is a valid measure of assessing externalizing behavior problems in Taiwanese children. Future research may seek to refine the factor structure of the ECBI in a Taiwanese sample. Future studies are also needed to examine other psychometrics of the ECBI, replicate this study with a larger sample, and establish its normative data in Taiwan.

AB Objectives Children's and adolescents' coping styles are associated with distress and adjustment. Despite the significance and implications of children's coping responses, no accepted standard exists to measure children's coping behavior. The purpose of the present study was standardization and study of the psychometric properties of Children's Coping Behavior Questionnaire (CCBQ) in Northern Iran (Guilan).
   Methods This was a correlation study and was implemented among 10- to 16-year-old students of Guilan. Among statistical population, 300 students (139 girls and 161 boys with an average age of 13.23) were selected using multistage sampling, and they responded to the items in CCBQ. To assess reliability and validity we used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and convergent validity. The reliability was assessed by using two methods; Cronbach's alpha and test-retest. The face validity and construct validity of the questionnaire were approved by a professors of psychology.
   Results Based on factor analysis using principal components and varimax rotation, final analyses revealed a 41-item coping measure with a 3-factor solution of "diversion", "ameliorative coping", and "destructive coping", which explained more than 60.9% of the total variance. Convergence validity of the questionnaire showed a satisfactory correlation in the total score of CCBQ. To determine concurrent validity with the CCBQ we used State-Trait Anxiety Children Inventory correlations that were satisfactory (P<0.05). Cronbach's alpha and test-retest for the total scale were between 0.74 and 0.91. The measurement showed strong reliability and good preliminary validity data.
   Conclusion Our results established that the Children's Coping Behavior Questionnaire is a reliable and valid method and is capable to be used in Iranian society to investigate emotional problems. Future studies need to be undertaken in a clinical population.

AB Growth mixture modeling with a sample of 749 Mexican heritage families identified parallel trajectories of adolescents' and their mothers' heritage cultural values and parallel trajectories of adolescents' and their fathers' heritage cultural values from Grades 5 to 10. Parallel trajectory profiles were then used to test cultural gap-distress theory that predicts increased parent-adolescent conflict and adolescent psychopathology over time when adolescents become less aligned with Mexican heritage values compared to their parents. Six similar parallel profiles were identified for the mother-youth and father-youth dyads, but only one of the six was consistent with the hypothesized problem gap pattern in which adolescents' values were declining over time to become more discrepant from their parents. When compared to families in the other trajectory groups as a whole, mothers in the mother-adolescent problem gap trajectory group reported higher levels of mother-adolescent conflict in the 10th grade that accounted for subsequent increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms assessed in 12th grade. Although the findings provided some support for cultural gap-distress predictions, they were not replicated with adolescent report of conflict nor with the father-adolescent trajectory group analyses. Exploratory pairwise comparisons between all six mother-adolescent trajectory groups revealed additional differences that qualified and extended these findings.

AB Substantial evidence links socioeconomic status to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. However, it is unclear how these two categories of behavior problems relate to specific components of socioeconomic status (e.g., income, educational attainment, and occupational prestige) or overall social status. In this study, we conducted a second-order meta-analysis to estimate the average associations of income, education, occupation, and overall socioeconomic status with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and to examine if age, sex, and race/ethnicity moderated these associations. Our systematic search in PsycINFO, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global identified 12 meta-analyses (17% unpublished), including approximately 474 primary studies and 327,617 participants. In relation to internalizing, we found small average associations with income, r(+) = -.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-.31, -.04], and education, r(+) = -.12, 95% CI [-.15, -.09]. In relation to externalizing, we found smaller associations with income, r(+) = -.02, 95% CI [-.15, .10], education, r(+) = -.03, 95% CI [-.16, .10], and overall socioeconomic status, r(+) = -.05, 95% CI [-.11, .01], but these CIs included zero. Only sex composition of the samples moderated the latter association. We provide recommendations for best practices and future research directions.

AB Mapuche represents the largest indigenous group in Chile amounting to nearly 10% of the total population. In a longitudinal cohort of 12,398 children, we analyzed the role of ethnicity in physical and psychosocial development of Mapuche and nonindigenous Chilean toddlers (age 2.5 years), taking into account sociodemographic and caregiver characteristics. As indicated by our univariate analysis, the Mapuche developmental niche was characterized by lower income, lower maternal education, poorer quality of the home environment, longer breastfeeding, and higher parental stress. Physical development showed higher body mass index. Mapuche children showed less externalizing problems. We then analyzed the incremental contribution of ethnicity in a series of hierarchical regressions with the second wave of developmental measurements (age 4.5 years) as outcome variables, showing a significant but modest incremental contribution of ethnicity to the prediction of children's development between 2.5 and 4.5 years of age. Controlling for environmental variables, Mapuche showed less externalizing and internalizing, behavior problems. Socioeconomic status, quality of the home environment, and parenting stress were stronger predictors of socioemotional development than ethnicity per se.

AB PurposeBinge eating is predicted by emotion dysregulation and poor emotional awareness. Dysfunctional metacognition is also implied in several eating disorders, but research has not yet investigated the interactions among emotional and metacognitive processes involved in binge eating. The present study investigated the relation between metacognition and binge eating in a sample of adolescents, testing the interaction effect between the need to control thoughts and thelack of emotional awareness on binge eating.MethodsParticipants were 804 adolescents (age range 15-20; 49.7% female), who completed self-report instruments assessing binge eating, emotion regulation, and metacognition.ResultsBinge eating was predicted by gender, BMI, emotion dysregulation, lack of emotional awareness, and dysfunctional metacognition dimensions (cognitive confidence and need to control thoughts). An important moderating effect was found, whereby the relationship between binge eating and lack of emotional awareness was only significant for individuals with a high need to control thoughts.ConclusionsResults described emotional and metacognitive functioning in binge eating adolescents, suggesting that the need to control thoughts is a risk factor, whereas good metacognitive competencies are protective from binge eating, even in presence of poor emotional awareness.Level of evidenceLevel V, cross-sectional descriptive study.

AB General cognitive ability (IQ) and problem behavior (externalizing and internalizing problems) are variable and inter-related in children. However, it is unknown how they co-develop in the general child population and how their patterns of co-development may be related to later outcomes. We carried out this study to explore this. Using data from 16,844 Millennium Cohort Study children, we fitted three-parallel-process growth mixture models to identify joint developmental trajectories of internalizing, externalizing and IQ scores at ages 3-11 years. We then examined their associations with age 11 outcomes. We identified a typically developing group (83%) and three atypical groups, all with worse behavior and ability: children with improving behavior and low (but improving in males) ability (6%); children with persistently high levels of problems and low ability (5%); and children with worsening behavior and low ability (6%). Compared to typically developing children, the latter two groups were more likely to show poor decision-making, be bullies or bully victims, engage in antisocial behaviors, skip and dislike school, be unhappy and have low self-esteem. By contrast, children (especially males) in the improver group had outcomes that were similar to, or even better than, those of their typically developing peers. These findings encourage the development of interventions to target children with both cognitive and behavioral difficulties.

AB Two longitudinal studies conducted with early adolescents (ages 10-13) examined the hypothesis that self-continuity, or the degree to which individuals feel that they remain the same person over time regardless of how their specific characteristics may change, would moderate the association between victimization and depressed affect. Both Study 1 (N = 141) and Study 2 (N = 100) provided evidence of the moderating role of self-continuity as a buffer on the effect of peer victimization. Study 2 confirmed that self-continuity had a moderating effect after controlling for academic performance, number of friends, self-esteem, self-concept clarity, hopelessness, and self-blame. Findings support self-continuity as being protective with regard to negative peer environments.

AB ObjectivesAmong children, poor socio-emotional functioning leads to poor health and well-being during childhood and later in life, and so understanding its social determinants is important. This study's objective is to examine how maternal employment influences children's socio-emotional outcomes in an Australian sample of families with two biological parents, testing the mediating role of maternal mental health, parenting practices, and parental income.MethodsWe analyze six waves of panel data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n=7524 children, 29,701 observations) using random-effect models.ResultsChildren of employed mothers display better socio-emotional outcomes than children of non-employed mothers, though the effect magnitude is only moderate. Associations are stronger for internalizing than externalizing problems, and not mediated by parental mental health, parenting practices, or household income.ConclusionsOur findings can inform sociopolitical debates on the social value of maternal labor force participation and its impacts on children. They suggest that incentivizing maternal employment should bear no detrimental consequences on their children's socio-emotional functioning. The different associations found for children's internalizing and externalizing problems stress the value of distinguishing these constructs.

AB Background: Metal exposure alters neurodevelopmental outcomes; little is known about critical windows of susceptibility when exposure exerts the strongest effect.
   Objective: To examine associations between dentine biomarkers of manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) and later childhood behaviors.
   Methods: Subjects enrolled in a longitudinal birth cohort study in Mexico City provided naturally shed deciduous teeth. We estimated weekly prenatal and postnatal dentine Mn, Zn and Pb concentrations in teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and measured behavior at ages 8-11 years of age using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2). We used distributed lag models and lagged weighted quantile sum regression to identify the role of individual and combined dentine biomarkers of Mn, Zn and Pb on behavioral outcomes controlling for maternal education and gestational age.
   Results: Among the 133 subjects included in this study, prenatal and early postnatal dentine Mn appeared protective against childhood behavioral problems, specifically hyperactivity and attention. Postnatal dentine Mn was associated with increased reporting of internalizing problems, specifically anxiety. At 6 months, a 1-unit increase (unit = 1 SD of log concentration) in Mn was associated with a 0.18-unit (unit = 1 SD of BASC-2 score) increase in internalizing symptoms score and a 0.25-unit increase in anxiety. Postnatal Pb was associated with increasing anxiety symptoms; at 12 months, a 1-unit increase in Pb was associated with a 0.4 unit increase in anxiety symptoms. When examined as a metal mixture, we observed two potential windows of susceptibility to increased anxiety symptoms: the first window (0-8 months) appeared driven by Mn, the second window (8-12 months) was driven by the metal mixture and dominated by Pb. A 1-unit increase in the mixture index was associated with a 0.7-unit increase in SD of anxiety symptoms.
   Conclusions: Childhood behaviors may demonstrate postnatal windows of susceptibility to individual and mixed metal concentrations measured in deciduous teeth. Prenatal dentine Mn may be protective, while excessive early postnatal Mn may increase risk for adverse behaviors. In combination, higher concentrations of Mn, Zn and Pb may have an adverse impact on behavior.

   Melancholic Selves, and the Search for Transformational Objects
SO PASTORAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Melancholia; Transformational objects; Psychoanalysis; Faith; Martin
   Luther King Jr; Malcolm X; James Baldwin; Ta-Nehisi Coates
AB This article examines the texts of four African American menMalcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coatesarguing that each text reflects, in part, the emergence of a melancholic self. This melancholic self arises as a result of internalizing the ubiquitous negative projections that come from social, political, economic, and cultural institutions or disciplinary regimes and the attending narratives that support, foster, and enforce racist beliefs (e.g., White superiority, Black inferiority). The internalization of negative projections, I contend, means that some Black children struggle to discover a positive sense of self in the public realm, and it is this ongoing encounter that gives rise to a melancholic faith wherein the child can expect not fidelity, trust, and hope vis-a-vis the public realm but rather betrayal, distrust, and futility vis-a-vis the possibility of the world ever presenting to him a positive self. In these texts, each man also identifies a moment in his early life when he became conscious of racist projections and the accompanying humiliations, as well as of the presence and power of his melancholic self. At the same time, this awareness, which is the first step in redemptive resistance, initiates a search for a transformational object that will liberate him from being in bondage to the melancholic self and its accompanying racial logic and faith, which, in turn, transforms his agency.

AB The study compares parent and child reports of child mental health to determine the relationship between parent-child disagreement and parental psychological and attitudinal factors, and to determine how parent-child disagreement is associated with the use of specialized services. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1268 children aged 6-11years using the Dominic Interactive and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Psychological distress and negative parental attitudes were associated with greater reporting of mental health problems, leading to greater parent-child agreement on symptom presence, and to parental over-reporting of symptoms. Parent/child agreement was associated with 43.83% of contact with a mental health provider for externalizing and 33.73% for internalizing problems. The contribution of key parental psychological and attitudinal factors in parent-child disagreement on child mental health status may prove helpful in improving the identification of children in need of specialized services.

   RISK-FACTORS; DSM-IV; PREVENTION; DEPRESSION; VALIDATION
AB Background and objectives: Environmental factors explain substantial variance in youth's obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) and much of this research has focused upon overt parenting behaviors (e.g., accommodation). No work, however, has examined how parents' internal processes (e.g., perception of children's intrusions) influence youth's OCS. Based upon the cognitive theory of obsessions, we propose that parents' misappraisal of children's intrusions as threatening will be positively associated with (a) the number of maladaptive intrusion management strategies recommended by the parent, as well as (b) children's obsessive beliefs, (c) interpretation biases, and (d) OCS severity.
   Methods: Twenty-seven children (M = 12.81; SD = 3.43) and the parent most involved in childcare completed diagnostic interviews and self-report questionnaires. In the laboratory, we induced obsessional anxiety in youth through a standardized in vivo paradigm (e.g., think about a personalized harm-related negative event occurring). Parents rated how they interpreted their children's unwanted thought and the intrusion management strategies they would recommend.
   Results: Parents who interpreted their children's intrusions as threatening recommended more maladaptive intrusion management strategies and their misappraisal positively and significantly correlated with the severity of children's obsessive beliefs, interpretation biases, and OCS, even after controlling for co-occurring internalizing symptoms.
   Limitations: Small sample and cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions.
   Conclusions: Parents' misinterpretation of children's intrusions may operate as a mechanism by which OCS are generationally transmitted. Results can inform OC prevention programs that target parents' cognitive biases in their own psychotherapy.

ID TRAUMATIC BIRTH; MATERNITY CARE; EXPERIENCES; POSTPARTUM; DELIVERY;
   WOMEN
AB In a qualitative study, 119 women completed an online, open-ended survey about their childbirth experiences. In response to the question, "What ways, if any, did you experience failure?," 65% of women identified feelings of failure. Overwhelmingly attributing the failures to themselves, participants reported that they experienced failures of mind, body, action/inaction, representing "what I feel;' "who I am," and "what I did or didn't do" and leading some participants to conclude that they were "less of woman," "less of a mother," or ultimately failed the baby. Such perceived failures can be unintentionally perpetuated by a system that neglects to address the complex experiences and interpretations of birthing women. Helping women anticipate and process the psychosocial and emotional aspects of the birth experience may serve as a protective factor against women internalizing perceived failures as their own, and preventing long term consequences of such feelings. The findings of this study highlight the importance of assessing women's personal experiences and interpretations of childbirth during the prenatal phase to address expectations and increase preparedness.

AB Current neurocircuitry models of PTSD do not account for developmental effects, despite that early life assaultive violence is a potent risk factor for PTSD. Here, we preliminarily evaluated developmental stage as a moderator of the effect of early life assaultive violence on resting-state connectivity amongst regions associated with emotion generation and regulation using fMRI. Participants were adult women (n = 25) and adolescent girls (n = 36) who had or had not experienced early life assaultive violence. We found significant interactions between developmental stage and trauma exposure on resting-state functional connectivity (FC). Left amygdala connectivity with the left ventral anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) was reduced among trauma-exposed compared to control adolescents, but increased among trauma-exposed compared to control adults. A corresponding pattern of results was identified for FC between rostral anterior cingulate gyrus seed region and a similar right ventral anterior superior frontal gyrus cluster. Increased FC in both regions for assaulted adult women scaled positively with self-reported emotion regulation difficulties. Our results should be viewed tentatively due to sample limitations, but provide impetus to examine whether neurocircuitry models of PTSD may be strengthened by accounting for developmental stage.

AB IMPORTANCE Child maltreatment, also referred to as child abuse and neglect, can result in lifelong negative consequences.
   OBJECTIVE To update the evidence on interventions provided in or referable from primary care to prevent child maltreatment for the US Preventive Services Task Force.
   DATA SOURCES PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through December 18, 2017; references; experts; literature surveillance through July 17, 2018.
   STUDY SELECTION English-language fair-and good-quality randomized clinical trials that (1) included children with no known exposure to maltreatment and no signs or symptoms of current or past maltreatment, (2) evaluated interventions feasible in a primary care setting or that could result from a referral from primary care, and (3) reported abuse or neglect outcomes or proxies for abuse or neglect (eg, injury with a specificity for abuse, visits to the emergency department, hospitalization).
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; a third resolved conflicts when needed. When at least 3 similar trials were available, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Direct measures (including reports to child protective services and removal of the child from the home) or proxy measures of abuse or neglect; behavioral, emotional, mental, or physical well-being; and harms. RESULTS Twenty-two trials (33 publications) were included (N = 11 132). No significant association was found between interventions and reports to child protective services within 1 year of intervention completion (10.6% vs 11.9%; pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.72-1.23]; 10 trials [n = 2444]) or removal of the child from the home within 1 to 3 years of follow-up (3.5% vs 3.7%; pooled OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.16-7.28]; 4 trials [n = 609]). No statistically significant associations were observed between interventions and outcomes for emergency department visits in the short term (< 2 years), hospitalizations, child development, school performance, and prevention of death. Nonsignificant results from single trials led to a conclusion of insufficient evidence for injuries, failure to thrive, failure to immunize, school attendance, and other measures of abuse or neglect. Inconsistent results led to a conclusion of insufficient evidence for long-term (< 2 years) outcomes for reports to child protective services (ORs range from 0.48 to 1.13; 3 trials [n = 1690]), emergency department visits (1 of 2 trials reported significant differences) and internalizing and externalizing behavior symptoms (3 of 6 trials reported reductions in behavior difficulties). No eligible trials on harms of interventions were identified.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Interventions provided in or referable from primary care did not consistently prevent child maltreatment. No evidence on harms is available.

AB BackgroundTo investigate the outcome of an integrated individual and family therapy (Intensive Contextual Treatment: ICT) in terms of reducing suffering and increasing functional adjustment among self-harming and/or suicidal adolescents with high symptom loads and their families.MethodsForty-nine self-harming and/or suicidal adolescents, M-age=14.6, of predominantly Swedish origin and female gender (85.7%) participated with their parents. The study had a within group design with repeated measures at pre- and post-treatment, as well as six- and twelve-months follow-ups. Self-reports were used for the main outcomes; self-harm rates, suicide attempts, parent-reported days of inpatient/institutional care, internalized and externalized symptoms, perceived stress, emotion regulation, school hours and adjustment. Secondary outcomes were levels of reported expressed emotions within family dyads, as well as parental anxiety, depression and stress.ResultsFrom pre- to post-assessment, the adolescents reported significant reductions of self-harm (p=.001, d=0.54) and suicide attempts (p<.0001, d=1.38). Parent-reported days of inpatient/institutional care were reduced, as well as parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, school attendance and adjustment were improved, and the adolescents reported experiencing less criticism while parents reported less emotional over-involvement. The results were maintained at follow-ups.ConclusionsThe adolescents and the parents reported improvements for the main outcomes. This treatment appears promising in keeping the families in treatment and out of hospital, suggesting that an integrative approach may be beneficial and feasible for this group.Trial registrationThis study has been approved 19/12 2011, by the regional review board in Stockholm (Dnr 2011/1593-31/5).

AB A series of five randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) conducted between 2002 and 2015 support the potential efficacy of online family problem-solving treatment (OFPST) in improving both child and parent/family outcomes after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, small sample sizes and heterogeneity across individual studies have precluded examination of potentially important moderators. We jointly analyzed individual participant data (IPD) from these five RCTs, involving 359 children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 18 years, to confirm the role of previously identified moderators (child's age and pre-treatment symptom levels, parental education) and to examine other potential moderators (race, sex, IQ), using IPD meta-analysis. This reanalysis revealed statistically strong evidence that parental education, child age at baseline, IQ, sex, and parental depression level pre-treatment moderated the effect of OFPST on various outcomes. In particular, children of parents with a less than high school education exhibited fewer internalizing problems and better social competence. Children injured at an older age exhibited fewer externalizing behaviors and less executive dysfunction following OFPST. Child IQ moderated the effect of OFPST on social competence, with significantly better competence for children with lower IQ who received OFPST. Lower levels of parental depression followed OFPST among subgroups with lower IQ, boys, and higher parental depression scores at baseline. Our findings indicate that the optimal application of OFPST is likely to involve older children, those with lower IQ scores, or those from families with lower socioeconomic status (SES).

AB Although the effects of insecure attachment on vulnerability, incidence, and developing mental disorders have been confirmed by many studies, the mechanism of this effect is still unknown. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the mediating and moderating role of the three-dimensional model of personality self-regulation in the relationship between insecure attachment and subclinical depression, anxiety, and stress. Four hundred Iranian students at Shiraz University were recruited and completed the following scales: the Revised Adult Attachment, Depression Anxiety Stress, Integrative Self-Knowledge, Mindful Attention Awareness, Self-Control, and Self-Compassion. Results showed that there was a moderate correlation among all the variables under study in the expected directions. Multiple mediating models analyses indicated that regarding the relationship between insecure attachment and depression, the components of integrative self-knowledge, self-control, and self-compassion functioned as mediators. However, regarding the relationship between insecure attachment and anxiety and stress, the components of integrative self-knowledge, mindfulness, and self-compassion relatively functioned as mediators. Further, our results showed that only mindfulness and self-compassion were identified as moderators in the relationship between insecure attachment and depression. It is concluded that insecure attachment may cause psychological damage due to deficiency in the components of the three-dimensional model of personality self-regulation, and that mindfulness and self-compassion may play a protective role in the relationship between insecure attachment and depression.

AB The present study aimed at investigating the mediating role of social conduct in the relation between theory of mind (ToM) and sociometric peer status. One hundred and seventy-seven 8- to 11-year-olds filled out a battery encompassing advanced ToM skill, verbal ability and sociometric peer status, expressed in terms of social preference and social impact. A questionnaire on students' externalizing, internalizing and prosocial behaviors was administered to teachers. Only externalizing behavior mediated the link between ToM and social impact, controlling for age, gender, and verbal ability. Implications and suggestions for future research were discussed.

AB Background: The association between low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and children's health remains unclear because of the difficulty in ruling out residual genetic and environmental confounding factors. In this study, using a within-family sibling fixed effects design, we sought to examine the association between low prenatal alcohol exposures (PAE) and children's overall psychosocial behavior in a Japanese cohort.
   Methods: We used maternal and sibling data from the Japanese Study of Stratification, Health, Income and Neighborhood 2012-2013. Households were recruited from the Tokyo metropolitan area through clustered random sampling. Children under 18 years old who have siblings (n = 1,600) and their mothers were selected. PAE status was retrospectively measured, and classified by binominal and continuous measurements. Outcome measures of children's psychosocial behavior were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist T-score.
   Results: Low PAE was significantly associated with the offspring's anxiety problems (beta = 1.54, 95%CI = 0.26, 2.82) and internalizing problems (beta = 2.73, 95%CI = 0.87, 4.60), and marginally significant with the offspring's total problem scores (beta = 2.34, 95%CI = -0.24, 4.92). There was no significant difference in PAE between boys and girls when it comes to behavioral problems.
   Conclusions: Low PAE was associated with children's anxiety, internalizing problems and overall problems, taking into account possible unobserved genetic and environmental confounding influences.

AB IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether early institutional rearing is associated with more problematic trajectories of psychopathology from childhood to adolescence and whether assignment to foster care mitigates this risk.
   OBJECTIVES To examine trajectories of latent psychopathology factors-general (P), internalizing (INT), and externalizing (EXT)-among children reared in institutions and to evaluate whether randomization to foster care is associated with reductions in psychopathology from middle childhood through adolescence.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal, intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial was conducted in Bucharest, Romania, where children residing in 6 institutions underwent baseline testing and were then randomly assigned to a care as usual group (CAUG) or a foster care group (FCG). A matched sample of a never-institutionalized group (NIG) was recruited to serve as a comparison group. The study commenced in April 2001, and the most recent (age 16 years) follow-up started in January 2015 and is ongoing.
   INTERVENTION Institutionally reared children randomized to high-quality foster homes.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Psychopathology was measured using the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire. Teachers and/or caregivers reported on symptoms of psychopathology in several domains.
   RESULTS A total of 220 children (50.0% female; 119 ever institutionalized) were included in the analysis at the mean ages of 8, 12, and 16 years. A latent bifactor model with general (P) and specific internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) factors offered a good fit to the data. At age 8 years, CAUG (mean, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.67) and FCG (mean, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.04-0.53) had higher P than NIG (mean, -0.40; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.18). By age 16 years, FCG (mean, 0.07; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.29) had lower P than CAUG (mean, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.13-0.60). This effect was likely driven by modest declines in P from age 8 years to age 16 years among FCG (slope, -0.12; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.04) compared with CAUG, who remained stably high over this period (slope, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.19 to 0.14). Moreover, CAUG and FCG showed increasing divergence in EXT over time, such that FCG (mean, -0.30; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.02) had fewer problems than CAUG (mean, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.36) by age 16 years. No INT differences were observed.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Institutionalization increases transdiagnostic vulnerability to psychopathology from childhood to adolescence, a period of significant social and biological change. Early assignment to foster care partially mitigates this risk, thus highlighting the importance of social enrichment in buffering the effects of severe early neglect on trajectories of psychopathology.

AB Triple-X syndrome is a common sex chromosome aneuploidy, which appears in 1 out of 1,000 females. The aim of our study was to describe the behavioral features of a large group of girls and women with triple-X in comparison to a control group. A total of 72 subjects with triple-X and 69 subjects of an age-matched control group were included. Psychological and behavioral questionnaires were allocated to three age groups, representing a range of ages from young childhood to adulthood. Regarding the females between 4 and 7 years of age, we found significant differences for social problems, attention problems, and school performance. For the age group 8-17 years, we found larger significant differences for the majority of the scales listed in the child behavior checklist. The most significant differences (p < .001) were from total behavior problems, internalizing problems, and four other scales. Young females with triple-X have significantly lower general self-esteem, especially concerning school and family. In the adults, there were significant differences concerning psychological symptoms and distress, with higher scores in the triple-X subjects. Regardless, their mean scores were still in the normal range. We did not find clinical evidence for more than 50% of the triple-X females in any age group, indicating that approximately half of them do not have behavioral problems, and that more than 60% do not differ in their competence from the control group. However, our findings suggest that triple-X influences mental health and the overall well-being of the individuals across their whole life spans.

AB Objective Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a lifelong condition characterized by pain, which is associated with reduced health-related quality of life (HRQL). Data suggest that patients with SCD vary in how they cope and their neurocognitive abilities. This study aimed to characterize executive functioning and pain coping styles in children with SCD experiencing a range of pain frequency (i.e., chronic, episodic, and asymptomatic) and to examine whether executive functioning mediates the relationship between pain coping and HRQL. Method Participants included 100 children and adolescents with SCD between the ages of 8 and 18 years (M = 13.53, SD = 2.8) and their parents who were recruited during outpatient SCD clinic visits in a children's hospital. Children completed questionnaires related to pain experience and pain coping. Parents completed questionnaires about demographic information, their child's executive functioning, and HRQL. Results Pain intensity, executive dysfunction, and engagement in emotion-focused coping (i.e., internalizing/catastrophizing and externalizing) predicted poor HRQL. In addition, engagement in emotion-focused coping predicted executive dysfunction. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed executive functioning did not differ based on pain frequency; however, executive functioning was a significant mediator that helped explain the relationships between distraction and emotion-focused coping techniques on HRQL. Conclusion Findings support that executive functioning is an important factor in understanding the relationship between pain coping and HRQL in youth with SCD. Future research is warranted to examine the potential impact of executive functioning on the utility of interventions targeting adaptive pain coping in youth with SCD.

AB There is a growing literature focusing on the emerging idea that behavioral flexibility, rather than particular emotion regulation strategies per se, provides greater promise in predicting and influencing anxiety-related psychopathology. Yet this line of research and theoretical analysis appear to be plagued by its own challenges. For example, middle-level constructs, such as behavioral flexibility, are difficult to define, difficult to measure, and difficult to interpret in relation to clinical interventions. A key point that some researchers have made is that previous studies examining flexible use of emotion regulation strategies (or, more broadly, coping) have failed due to a lack of focus on context. That is, examining strategies in isolation of the context in which they are used provides limited information on the suitability, rigid adherence, or effectiveness of a given strategy in that situation. Several of these researchers have proposed the development of new models to define and measure various types of behavioral flexibility. We would like to suggest that an explanation of the phenomenon already exists and that we can go back to our behavioral roots to understand this phenomenon rather than focusing on defining and capturing a new process. Indeed, thorough contextual behavioral analyses already yield a useful account of what has been observed. We will articulate a model explaining behavioral flexibility using a functional, contextual framework, with anxiety-related disorders as an example.

AB Objective: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neuro-developmental disorder related to internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as somatic complaints and disorders. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of headache subtypes, epilepsy, atopic disorders, motion sickness and recurrent abdominal pain among children and adolescents with ADHD and their parents.
   Methods: In a multi-center, cross-sectional, familial association study using case-control design, treatment na ve children and adolescents between 6 and 18 years of age diagnosed with ADHD according to the DSM-5 criteria as well as age- and gender matched healthy controls and their parents were evaluated by a neurologist and analyzed accordingly.
   Results: 117 children and adolescents with ADHD and 111 controls were included. Headache disorder diagnosis was common for both patients and healthy controls (59.0% vs. 37.8%), with a significantly elevated rate in the ADHD group (p = 0.002). Migraine was found in 26.0% of ADHD patients and 9.9% of healthy controls. Tension headache was found in 32.4% of ADHD patients and 27.9% of healthy controls. Headache diagnosis was also found to be significantly more common in mothers of children with ADHD than control group mothers (90.5% vs. 36.6%, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Headache diagnoses and specifically migraines were significantly more common among children with ADHD and their mothers, while recurrent abdominal pain was elevated in both parents and ADHD patients. Migraine is an important part of ADHD comorbidity, not only for children but also for mothers. Motion sickness may be reduced among families of ADHD probands.

AB Background: The mental health outcomes among youth in foster care with disabilities are under studied. Increasing our understanding of mental health risk and protective factors is essential for improving the mental health and quality of life of this population. This study tests the associations of risk and protective factors on mental health outcome variables of youth in foster care with disabilities.
   Methods: All Oregon youth in foster care who were ages 16.6-18.5 and attending study school districts were invited to participate in a federally-funded longitudinal RCT evaluation, which sought to assess the effectiveness of self-determination enhancement on outcomes of youth transitioning from foster care to adult life. Only baseline data was used with a final sample of 305. Receipt of special education services was used as the proxy for disability status. The risk factors included trauma exposure, hopelessness, placement type, perceived placement restrictiveness. The protective factors included social support and self-determination. The outcome variables included internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms, quality of life. Preliminary analyses organized by special education (SPED) involvement vs. study variables were conducted, and stepwise regressions were followed.
   Results: Findings revealed SPED was associated with being in a restrictive foster placement. Youth involved in SPED reported higher perceived placement restrictiveness and hopelessness, but lower quality of life (QoL). Self-determination was a consistent protective factor. Post-traumatic symptomology was a consistent and strongest risk factor for all outcome variables.
   Conclusions: Although it is not possible to change previous adverse childhood experiences that result in currently experienced trauma, well-designed self-determination enhancement interventions and the support of caring adults may reduce negative mental health outcomes and improve QoL

AB This study investigates whether centre based childcare has a positive influence on behavioral outcomes of 1- to 2-year-old Australian children born to teenage mothers (M = 17.6 years). The sample included 317 children of young mothers in receipt of income support payments (M = 19.9 months; 49.5% female, 24.0% indigenous). Results from the propensity score weighting methods indicated that children's attendance at centre based care is associated with lower externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems. Guided by family stress model, we conducted multi-group path analysis to examine the associations between economic strain, maternal mental health, harsh parenting and behavioral outcomes. Results revealed that economic strain was associated with greater children's behavioral problems through maternal mental health problems and harsh parenting. Evidence of moderation by centre based childcare was found for children's internalizing, but not externalizing behavioral problems. The results suggested that policy interventions that consider encouraging children born to teenage mothers to attend centre based childcare might reduce internalizing problems behaviors in those children, especially in families experiencing economic strain.

AB Negative urgency predicts both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Although it is hypothesized that urgency is characterized by reflexive responses to negative emotion that focus on immediate relief from distress, little research has addressed this hypothesis. Using data from four independent samples of adolescents and college students (n = 1,268), we estimated the association between trait negative urgency and emotion regulation strategies that reflect either reflexive responses or disengagement. We verified these effects in two ecological momentary assessment samples (EMA; n = 198). In retrospective data, negative urgency was correlated with using more disengagement or reflexive emotion regulation strategies relative to engagement strategies, r = .39, .38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.30, 0.49], [0.18, 0.57]. This finding replicated in EMA data, r = .24, 95% CI = [0.11, 0.38]. Emotion regulation may be a key mechanism of the effects of urgency on psychopathology. Interventions targeting emotion regulation among those high on urgency may be warranted.

AB Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of antibullying interventions show that average effects tend to be significant but small. Informed by the vantage sensitivity framework, the current study aimed to test in a large randomized controlled trial whether individual differences in environmental sensitivity predict treatment response to an antibullying intervention. A total of 2,042 pupils (Grades 4 and 6) were randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition. Significant intervention effects on victimization and internalizing symptoms were moderated by both environmental sensitivity and gender: Boys who scored high on sensitivity benefited significantly more than did less sensitive boys from the effects of the intervention regarding reduced victimization and internalizing symptoms. The findings are consistent with the notion of vantage sensitivity, suggesting that some individuals are disproportionately likely to respond to treatment and others are more resistant as a function of individual differences in environmental sensitivity.

AB Objective: We examine the relationship between individual differences in temperament (cognitive control, fear, and shyness) and the error-related negativity (i.e., the ERN) in a large sample of young children. Furthermore, we explore to what extent variation in temperament may underlie the associations between the ERN and anxiety disorders versus externalizing disorders.
   Method: Using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), we focus on scales related to cognitive control (attentional focusing, attentional shifting, and inhibitory control) and a fearful/anxious temperament (fearfulness and shyness). We use diagnostic interviews to assess anxiety (specific phobia, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and agoraphobia) and externalizing disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ADHD, and oppositional defiant disorder; ODD). A go/no-go task was used to measure the ERN.
   Results: Results suggest that while shyness was related to an increased ERN, fearfulness was associated with a decreased ERN. Moreover, increased cognitive control was related to an increased ERN, and an exploratory model suggested that while shyness displayed an independent relationship with the ERN, the relationship between fear and the ERN was accounted for by deficits in cognitive control. Additionally, we found that the ERN was increased in children with anxiety disorders, and that this association was explained by shyness, but not fear or cognitive control. In contrast, the ERN was blunted in children with externalizing disorders (ADHD or ODD), and this association was accounted for by lower levels of both shyness and cognitive control.
   Conclusions: Overall, these results are novel insofar as they suggest that the temperamental factors of shyness and cognitive control may underlie the associations between the ERN and internalizing versus externalizing disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   SYMPTOMS; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; MATERNAL CORTISOL;
   ANXIETY DISORDERS
AB Background: Past work suggests that individual differences in stress reactivity have implications for the development of psychopathology; in particular, females' stress reactivity appears more closely tied to internalizing symptoms than males' reactivity. Conversely, males who are under-reactive to threat may be at risk for externalizing problems. However, little is known about when such differences may emerge, although this knowledge could have implications for early prevention.
   Methods: Cortisol reactivity to a laboratory stressor was assessed in 409 three-year-old children (201 boys), along with parent-reported children's internalizing (anxiety and depression) and externalizing (oppositional-defiant and attention problems and hyperactivity) symptoms. Parent-reported symptoms were re-collected at child ages 5 (N = 379) and 8 (N = 364). Multilevel modelling was used to investigate whether the relationship between cortisol reactivity and symptoms differed between boys and girls over time.
   Results: Girls with lower cortisol reactivity showed a negative association between depressive symptoms and time, while girls with higher reactivity showed no such association. No interaction between sex and cortisol reactivity was found for anxious symptoms. Boys with higher cortisol reactivity showed a negative association between symptoms and time, while boys with lower cortisol reactivity showed no such association. Time and ADHD symptoms were unrelated for boys, regardless of their cortisol reactivity.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that the implications of stress reactivity indexed via cortisol vary for boys and girls, as well as for different symptom manifestations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Shared vulnerability in offspring of individuals with schizophrenia (SzO) and bipolar disorder (BpO) might manifest early during development through common temperament traits. Temperament dimensions in child and adolescent BpO (N = 80), SzO (N = 34) and the offspring of community controls (CcO) (N = 101) were assessed using the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey. The association between temperament dimensions and lifetime psychopathology (including threshold and subthreshold DSM-IV-TR diagnoses) and current socio-academic adjustment was assessed using logistic regression. Fully adjusted models showed that both BpO and SzO scored significantly lower in the positive mood dimension and in the adaptability factor than CcO, with small-medium effect sizes (Cohen's d similar to 0.3-0.5). BpO also scored lower in the activity factor and the activity dimensions than CcO (Cohen's d similar to 0.3). Lower scores in the positive mood dimension were associated with increased risk of impaired adjustment both in BpO [OR 2.30, 95% CI (1.18-4.46)] and in SzO [OR 2.87, 95% CI (1.07-7.66)]. In BpO, lower scores in positive mood were also associated with increased likelihood of internalizing [OR 1.84, 95% CI (1.28-2.64)] and externalizing disorders [OR 1.48, 95% CI (1.01-2.18)]; in SzO, higher scores in activity and flexibility were associated with increased likelihood of internalizing [OR 2.31, 95% CI (1.22-4.38)] and externalizing disorders [OR 3.28, 95% CI (1.2-9)], respectively. Early difficulties in emotion regulation might represent a shared vulnerability phenotype in BpO and SzO. The identification of extreme temperament traits could help to characterize subgroups at greater risk of psychopathology and impaired adjustment, in which targeted interventions are warranted.

AB There is a need to identify children with potential mental health issues early in order to provide "an ounce of prevention." Unfortunately, there are few instruments available to identify emotional and behavioral issues in infants and many never receive intervention. We developed the Brief Child and Family Intake and Outcomes System for Infants, which is a standardized online parent questionnaire including one externalizing scale (Cooperating), two internalizing scales (Expressing Emotion; Responding to Change), and two regulatory scales (Eating; Sleeping). We conducted a normative study of 542 Canadian children aged 8-17 months, stratified by sex, age, geographic region, and parents' marital status, income, and education. Results of confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated good model fit and the relationship between items and subscales did not vary significantly between boys and girls or between younger and older infants. Reliability estimates indicated high internal consistency and adequate to high test-retest reliability. Providing preliminary evidence of validity, scale scores had moderate to strong positive relations with measures of family distress, caregiver mood, and demographic variables. Analyses of latent variables revealed good evidence of discriminant validity of the scales. We extend earlier work by addressing a very young age range, including subscales particularly relevant to infant emotional and behavioral regulation while at the same time minimizing respondent burden, and providing norms for Canadian infants. The questionnaire could be used in children's mental health settings, primary care, child welfare, and daycare facilities, for intake, triage, and describing infants.

AB Background: Depressive symptoms are common in children with developmental language disorder (DLD). However, risk and protective factors contributing to these problems are currently underspecified.
   Aims: The current longitudinal study examined the role of emotion-regulation (ER) strategies in the severity of depressive symptoms in children with and without DLD, taking into account the severity of communication problems of children with DLD.
   Methods & Procedures: We followed clinically referred children with DLD (n = 114, 49% girls) and without DLD (n = 214, 58% girls) between the ages of 8 and 16 years across an 18-month period. Participants completed self-report questionnaires at three time points. Parents of children with DLD reported on their child's communication problems.
   Outcomes & Results: Multilevel analyses confirmed higher levels of depressive symptoms in youngsters with DLD compared with peers without DLD, with a decrease across time in the DLD group. In both groups, higher levels of approach and increasing avoidant strategies aimed at distraction or trivializing a problem explained lower depressive symptoms, whereas more worry and externalizing strategies contributed to more depressive symptoms. Within the DLD group, semantic language problems were associated with higher depressive symptoms. However, this relation was mediated by the tendency to worry or use externalizing strategies.
   Conclusions & Implications: Results suggest that interventions for children with DLD should focus on enhancing their adaptive ER strategies to help them cope with daily stressors just as in the general population.

TI Association of Childhood Adversity With Differential Susceptibility of

   RISK
AB IMPORTANCE Multivariable comorbidity research indicates that childhood adversity increases the risk for the development of common mental disorders. This risk is explained by underlying internalizing and externalizing transdiagnostic constructs that are amplified by environmental stressors. The differential susceptibility model suggests that this interaction of risk and environment is bidirectional: at-risk individuals will have worse outcomes in high-stress environments but better outcomes in in low-stress environments.
   OBJECTIVE To test the differential susceptibility model by examining how a history of adverse childhood experiences moderates the association between life stress and transdiagnostic psychopathology.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data came from the US National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a population-based observational longitudinal survey administered to adults (>= 18 years of age). Participants completed the survey at wave 1 (from 2001 through 2002) and wave 2 (from 2004 through 2005). Responses from 34 458 participants were used for the analyses from March 3, 2017, through October 8, 2018.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Latent variables for internalizing-fear, internalizing-distress. externalizing, and general psychopathology were created to represent continuous levels of psychopathology in each wave. Latent variables were also created to represent continuous levels of life stress at each wave. Level of childhood adversity was characterized based on the number of types of childhood adversity experienced (no [0 types], low [1-2 types], and high [ >= 3 types] exposure). Analyses examined how the interaction between level of childhood adversity and adult life stress was associated with change in adult transdiagnostic psychopathology factors.
   RESULTS Of the 34 458 participants included in the analysis (58.0% women and 42.0% men; mean [SD] age. 46.0 [17.4] years at wave land 49.0 [17.3] years at wave 2), 40.5% had no adverse childhood experiences, 34.6% had 1to 2, and 24.9% had 3 or more. At wave 1. 61.5% of the sample endorsed at least 1 stressful life event and 27.2% met criteria for at least 1 mental disorder; at wave 2, these figures were 64.7% and 29.7%, respectively. Childhood adversity moderated the association between changes in adult life stress and changes in all transdiagnostic psychopathology factors. Specifically, higher levels of childhood adversity had a stronger association between adult life stress and adult transdiagnostic psychopathology factors. Further, significant differences between childhood adversity groups occurred in the mean scores of all transdiagnostic psychopathology factors for both increases and decreases in life stress, providing preliminary evidence of differential susceptibility.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results provide empirical support for childhood adversity as a differential susceptibility factor engendering heightened functional and dysfunctional reactivity to later stress.

AB IMPORTANCE The onset of adult psychopathologic disorders can be traced to behavioral or emotional symptoms observed in childhood, which could be targeted in early interventions to prevent future mental disorders. The network perspective is a novel conceptualization of psychopathologic disorders that could help to identify target symptoms with a distinct role in the emergence of mental illness.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether the network structure of emotional and behavioral symptoms among elementary school girls is associated with anxiety disorders or major depression in early adulthood.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children is an ongoing, prospective, population-based study of kindergarten children attending French-speaking state schools in the Canadian province of Quebec in 1986-1988. This study included 932 girls whose parents completed the Social Behavior Questionnaire when the girls were ages 6 (baseline), 8, and 10 years; 780 participants were interviewed to assess the presence of mental disorders at age 15 and/or 22 years. Data analysis was conducted from December 2016 to April 2018.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Gaussian graphical modelswere estimated for 33 symptoms (eg, internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors) assessed using the Social Behavior Questionnaire to evaluate the temporal stability of the symptom network through childhood. At follow-up time points, mental disorders were assessed using the DSM-III-R, and symptom networks were reestimated at ages 6 to 10 years, this time including a variable indicative of future diagnosis.
   RESULTS At baseline, the mean (SD) age of the 932 girls was 6.0 (0.3) years. Among the 780 women assessed at follow-up, 270 (34.6%) and 128 (16.4%) had developed anxiety disorders and major depression, respectively. Symptoms clustered in internalizing and externalizing communities. Five symptoms-irritable, blames others, not liked by others, often cries, and solitary-emerged as bridge symptoms between the disruptive and internalizing communities. These symptoms were those that were connected with the highest regularized edge weights (from 0.015 to 0.076) to future anxiety disorders once added to the network. Bootstrapped 95% CIs ranged from (95% CI, -0.063 to 0.068) to (95% CI, 0.561 to 0.701) for positive edges and from (95% CI, -0.156 to 0.027) to (95% CI, -0.081 to 0.078) for negative edges included in the regularized network.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bridge symptoms between disruptive and internalizing communities are identified for the first time in childhood, and these findings suggest that these symptoms could be central in indicating probable later anxiety disorders. The study suggests that bridge symptoms should be investigated further as potential early targets in disease-prevention interventions.

AB Parental monitoring can reduce adolescents' engagement in risky behaviors; however, adolescents' internalizing symptoms may alter the effectiveness of parental monitoring. The current study examines independent and interactive effects of maternal and paternal monitoring, adolescent's internalizing symptoms, and adolescent gender on sexual behaviors and substance use with data from 659 of the 15-year-olds enrolled in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Results suggest girls who experienced less maternal monitoring and more internalizing symptomsboth independently and interactivelyengaged in more risky sexual behaviors. Greater substance use was associated with less maternal and paternal monitoring for girls and boys, more internalizing symptoms for girls, and interactively with less maternal and paternal monitoring depending on girls' levels of internalizing symptoms. The current study highlights the unique influences of mothers' and fathers' monitoring efforts on adolescent risky behavior based on the adolescent's level of internalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Mental health problems are common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and difficulties with emotion regulation processes may underlie these issues. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is considered an efficacious treatment for anxiety in children with ASD. Additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of a transdiagnostic treatment approach, whereby the same treatment can be applied to multiple emotional problems, beyond solely anxiety. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a manualized and individually delivered 10-session, transdiagnostic CBT intervention, aimed at improving emotion regulation and mental health difficulties in children with ASD. Methods: Sixty-eight children (M age = 9.75, SD = 1.27) and their parents participated in the study, randomly allocated to either a treatment immediate (n = 35) or waitlist control condition (n = 33) (ISRCTN #67079741). Parent-, child-, and clinician-reported measures of emotion regulation and mental health were administered at baseline, postintervention/postwaitlist, and at 10-week follow-up. Results: Children in the treatment immediate condition demonstrated significant improvements on measures of emotion regulation (i.e., emotionality, emotion regulation abilities with social skills) and aspects of psychopathology (i.e., a composite measure of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, adaptive behaviors) compared to those in the waitlist control condition. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up. Conclusions: This study is the first transdiagnostic CBT efficacy trial for children with ASD. Additional investigations are needed to further establish its relative efficacy compared to more traditional models of CBT for children with ASD and other neurodevelopmental conditions.

AB This study aims to examine how family social capital mediates the relationship between poverty and children's anxiety and depression in mainland China. Data were collected with multistage cluster random sampling method in Xiushui City in mainland China. The sample comprised 1,314 school-aged children (Grades 4-9). Data included children's basic demographics, internalizing symptoms, and parenting process. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. The results demonstrated a good fit for the sample. The overall model explained 12.7% and 16.1% of the variance for children's anxiety and depression, respectively. Poverty had a significantly direct effect on children's anxiety and depression, and family social capital could partially mediate the influence of poverty on children's internalizing symptoms. Family social capital plays an important mediating role between poverty and children's mental health. Our findings provide strong evidence for social work intervention. Family social capital is essential for parent-child interactions, especially in underprivileged families.

AB The possibility of differential remote acculturation to a distant culture is yet another chasm that divorced coparents must bridge as they raise their children in globalizing urban settings. This study explored the association between parental remote acculturation and perceived parental remote acculturation gaps in two acculturation domains (behavior, identity), in relation to children's adjustment in Turkish divorced families. Altogether, 177 urban divorced mothers in Turkey reported their own and their ex-partners' remote acculturation to U.S. and Turkish cultures, and their joint children's internalizing (social withdrawal, anxiety) and externalizing (aggression) behaviors. Perceived remote acculturation gaps were operationalized with match:mismatch and interaction methods. Sequential regression analyses accounting for parental conflict resolution revealed that mothers' perceptions of fathers' American identity was positively associated with children's social withdrawal. Regarding perceived acculturation gaps, one particular cross-dimension pairingstrongly U.S.-identified AmeriTurk mothers paired with strongly Turkish-identified fatherspredicted lower internalizing problems. Although having an Americanized father might confer some risk for children in divorced families in Turkey, having an AmeriTurk mother and traditional Turkish father may be protective, suggesting the benefit of integration as a family-level remote acculturation strategy. Taken together, parental remote acculturation and perceived remote acculturation gaps in identity (not behavior) predicted the socioemotional (not behavioral) adjustment of children above and beyond parental discord. Findings highlight the family repercussions of remote acculturation in Eurasia, underscore the importance of multidomain acculturation measurement, confirm the superior sensitivity of the interaction method, and extend its application to assessing cross-dimension pairings as a new type of acculturation gap.

AB Behavioral genetics studies and new empirical evidence suggest that depression cannot simply be explained by the influence of single genes but that gene-gene-environment interactions are important to better understanding the etiology of depression. The present study investigated the main and interactive effects of COMT gene Val158Met polymorphism, DAT1 gene rs27072 polymorphism, and peer relationships (i.e., peer acceptance and rejection) on adolescent depressive symptoms. In a sample of 1045 Chinese Han adolescents (M-age=12.34 +/- 0.47 years, 50.1% girls), saliva samples, self-reported depressive symptoms and within-classroom peer nominations were collected. After controlling for gender, age, and SES, the three-way interaction of COMT, DAT1, and peer acceptance significantly concurrently predicted adolescent depressive symptoms. Adolescents with ValVal genotype of COMT and CC genotype of DAT1 were more sensitive to acceptance, compared to their counterparts carrying other combined genotypes. However, a similar three-way interaction was not significant in the case of peer rejection. Additionally, the split-half validation generally replicated these findings. More importantly, this study underscores complex polygenic underpinnings of depression and lends support for the gene-gene-environment interactions implicated in the etiology of depressive symptoms.

AB In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project, we examined the role of emotion dysregulation as a mediator between childhood abuse and borderline personality disorder (BPD) feature severity among a sample of 964 adults presenting for treatment at an outpatient clinic. A structural equation model suggested that emotional abuse relates to BPD features both directly and through difficulties with emotion regulation, whereas physical abuse showed only a weak indirect relation with BPD features. There was no link between sexual abuse and BPD feature severity in the model. Results add specificity to etiological theories of BPD and suggest that future research in treatment should focus on developing and strengthening emotion regulation strategies in clinical populations with a history of emotional abuse. Clinicians should be sure to assess the presence of childhood emotional abuse in addition to sexual and physical abuse.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe typologies of service utilization among traumaexposed, treatment-seeking adolescents and to examine associations between trauma history, trauma-related symptoms, demographics, and service utilization. Method: Latent class analysis was used to derive a service utilization typologies based on 10 service variables using a sample of 3,081 traumaexposed adolescents ages 12 to 16 from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Dataset. Services used 30 days prior to the initial assessment from 5 sectors were examined (health care, mental health, school, social services, and juvenile justice). Results: A 5-class model was selected based on statistical fit indices and substantive evaluation of classes: (a) High intensity/multisystem, 9.5%; (b) Justice-involved, 7.2%; (c) Low intensity/multisystem, 19.9%; (d) Social service and mental health, 19.9%; and (e) Low service usage/reference, 43.5%. The classes could be differentiated based on cumulative trauma, maltreatment history, PTSD, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and age, gender, race/ethnicity and place of residence. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence about patterns of service utilization by trauma exposed, treatment seeking adolescents. Most of these adolescents appear to be involved with at least 2 service systems prior to seeking trauma treatment. Higher cumulative exposure to multiple types of trauma was associated with greater service utilization intensity and complexity, but trauma symptomatology was not.

AB Background: In the last years, several studies focused on the role of Gene-Environment interactions (GxE) in influencing psychopathological outcomes among maltreated children and adolescents. These studies analysed the effect of different genetic variations.
   Aims: The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of studies investigating GxE effects among maltreated children and adolescents.
   Methods and Procedures: A systematic literature review was performed by using the following keywords: "Child maltreatment" and "GxE", "Child maltreatment" and "Psychopathology", "Gene-Environment interaction", "Gene-environment correlation", "GxE and psychopathology", "Childhood trauma" and "Psychiatric symptoms", "Early adverse life events", "Early life stress", "Antisocial behaviour", "Depression", "Internalizing symptoms", through the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO, from 2006 to 2017, finding a total of 31 papers.
   Outcomes and Results: The present review confirm that maltreatment produces worse psychopathological outcomes (antisocial behaviour, depression, and other psychiatric traits) in subjects with a specific genetic vulnerability.
   Conclusions and Implications: Comprehending the pathways from child maltreatment to psychopathology in their full complexity will be essential to build efficacious preventive and therapeutic protocols.

AB Objective: This study examined nighttime media use in relation to sleep problems and anxiety/depression symptoms in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Methods: Participants were 81 adolescents (69% male) ages 13-17 with ADHD. Adolescents completed measures assessing pubertal development, nighttime media use, circadian preference, and daytime sleepiness. Both adolescents and parents completed measures of sleep duration, sleep problems, and internalizing symptoms.
   Results: When summing across media uses (eg, social networking, playing video games, watching television), the average nighttime media use (after 9:00PM) was 5.31 h. Overall, 63% of adolescents reported obtaining less than 8 h of sleep on school nights, and this percentage rose to 77% for parent-reported sleep duration. Moreover, adolescents obtaining less sleep than recommended had more nighttime media use than those obtaining >= 8 h of nightly sleep. Controlling for age, sex, pubertal development, stimulant medication use, and ADHD symptom severity; nighttime media use was associated with shorter sleep duration and increased sleep problems across both adolescent and parent report. Media use was also associated with greater adolescent-reported anxiety and depression, and marginally associated with eveningness circadian preference and greater daytime sleepiness. In considering specific anxiety dimensions, media use was associated with greater adolescent-reported panic symptoms and parent-reported generalized anxiety disorder symptoms.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nighttime media use may contribute to sleep problems and co-morbid internalizing symptoms in adolescents with ADHD, although additional studies are needed to determine causality, potential bidirectional associations, and underlying mechanisms such as using media to (mis)manage negative emotions. Media use is important to assess and monitor and may be a significant intervention target when addressing sleep and internalizing problems, and possible underlying cognitive-emotional processes in adolescents with ADHD.

AB Attachment Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC; Dozier et al., 2006) is a 10-week, in-home intervention primarily for early childhood aged children (ages 6 months-2 years). The ABC intervention seeks to teach parents how to provide nurturing care and engage in appropriate interactions with their children. ABC has been identified as a Level 1 evidence-based practice by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare. However, to date, there has been no systematic review presenting the overall evidence behind ABC available in a peer-reviewed journal. The objective of this review is to address this gap by synthesizing prior literature and evidence, specifically evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs), regarding the effectiveness of the ABC intervention and to determine the contexts in which the intervention has been implemented. To complete this review, literature was searched across three bibliographic databases and relevant Web sites. Only RCTs examining child outcomes were included in the review. Using identified search procedures, 10 articles discussing RCTs which tested the efficacy of ABC were identified. Findings indicate that ABC is effective, when implemented with child-welfare-involved children, at improving emotion regulation, improving externalizing and internalizing behaviors, increasing normative developmental functioning, and attachment quality. Sample information from the 10 RCTs identified is presented as well as additional study characteristics.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine dual food and energy hardship and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in 9-year-old children.
   METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a prospective national urban birth cohort, when the children were 9 years old. Maternal-reported "food hardship" (ever hungry and/or ever received free food) and "energy hardship" (ever unable to pay utility bill and/or utility shutoff) within the past year, and child behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 were assessed. Multiple logistic regression analyses estimated associations between individual and dual food and energy hardship and child behavior problems, adjusting for a priori covariates (ie, child sex, health insurance, maternal sociodemographic characteristics, poverty, reported health, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressive symptoms, smoking, and substance and alcohol abuse).
   RESULTS: Approximately 10% of households reported dual food and energy hardship. Children experiencing dual food and energy hardship had 3 times greater odds of withdrawn/depressed behaviors (adjusted odds ratio [A012], 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.5), threefold greater odds of somatic complaints (AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5-6.9), and 4 times greater odds of rule-breaking behavior (AOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-9.2) in the borderline/clinical range than children with no hardship, and had fourfold greater odds of borderline/clinical range somatic complaints (AOR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.7-10.3) than children with only energy hardship.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children experiencing dual food and energy hardship have greater odds of coexisting internalizing and externalizing behaviors after controlling for possible confounders. Providers can consider screening and resource referrals for these addressable hardships alongside behavior assessments in the clinical setting.

AB Emotional disorders, encompassing a range of anxiety and depressive disorders, are the most prevalent and comorbid psychiatric disorders in adolescence. Unfortunately, evidence-based psychosocial therapies typically focus on single disorders, are rarely adopted by community mental health center clinicians, and effect sizes are modest. This article describes the protocol for a comparative effectiveness study of two novel interventions designed to address these challenges. The first intervention is a transdiagnostic treatment (the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents, UP-A), a promising new approach that uses a small number of common strategies to treat a broad range of emotional disorders, and their underlying shared emotional vulnerabilities. The second intervention is a standardized measurement feedback system, the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire (YOQ), designed to improve clinical decision making using weekly symptom and relational data. The three study arms are treatment as usual (TAU), TAU plus the YOQ (TAU+), and UP-A (used in combination with the YOQ). The primary aims of the study are to [1] compare the effects of the UP-A and TAU + to TAU in community mental health clinics, [2] to isolate the effects of measurement and feedback by comparing the UP-A and TAU+ condition, and [3] to examine the mechanisms of action of both interventions. Design considerations and study methods are provided to inform future effectiveness research.

AB This study (a) determined whether clinical elevations of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom distributions in a large community sample of children would allow for identifying SCT-only, ADI ID-only, and SCT + ADHD clinical groups; (b) examined co-occurrence of clinically elevated SC1 and ADHD; (c) evaluated whether these clinical groups differed in their gender distribution, co-occurring. mental health symptoms, or impairment in academic and social functioning; and (d) explored patterns of independence and overlap when clinically elevated depressive symptoms were considered in tandem with SCT and ADHD. Participants were mothers, fathers, and teachers of 2,142 children (50.51% boys, ages 8-13 years) from 32 schools in Spain. All three groups of informants completed measures of SCT, ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety, depression, shyness, social impairment, and academic impairment. Cut-off scores for the top 5% of the sample were used to create SCT-only, ADHD-only, SCT + ADHD, and comparison groups. Across informants, 4.97%-5.53% met criteria for clinically elevated ADHD-only, and 2.30%-2.80% met criteria for clinically elevated SCT-only; 27%-35% of the ADHD group also met the criteria for the SCT group, whereas 44%-54% of the SCT group met the criteria for the ADIID group (primarily based on inattentive symptoms). The ADIID-only group had higher ODD scores than the SCT-only group, whereas the SCT-only group generally had higher shyness and internalizing scores (particularly depression) than the ADHD-only group. Additional analyses that also included clinically elevated depression revealed that 28-46% of the children with elevated SCT had elevations in neither ADHD nor depression. This study moves the field toward examining both the empirical and clinical differentiation of SCT and ADHD. Findings are discussed regarding how SCT may fit in diagnostic nosologies and models of psychopathology.

AB Treatment effectiveness has been shown to vary across subgroups of youth based on characteristics such as comorbidity, problem severity, gender, and age. The current study aims to explore if subgroups of youth, identified by applying latent profile analysis to parent-reported symptoms, age, and gender, are better served by specific usual care services. Archival data from a community mental health center were utilized, including parent-reports of symptoms for 953 youth (44.4% female; ages 4-18) across multiple time-points, and services received. Latent profile analysis identified five subgroups including Low Risk, High Risk, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Delinquent/Depressed. The relationship between the intensity level of services and symptoms varied across subgroups. Specifically, high intensity services were related to a greater reduction in symptoms for the Internalizing, Externalizing, and High Risk subgroups. Implications for future developmental research and clinical applications are discussed.

AB Research demonstrates that parents' emotion-related discourse during reminiscing shapes children's psychosocial outcomes, yet little is known about how different forms of parental emotion-related discourse work in combination. The present study takes a person-centered approach to better understand the relation of multiple forms of parental emotion discourse during reminiscing with problem behaviors in early childhood, as well as child influences on parents' emotion discourse during reminiscing. Specifically, we simultaneously examine three forms of parents' emotion-related discourse (emotion coaching and dismissing, emotion explanations, and elaboration) using cluster analysis to determine parents' patterns of these three discourse forms during discussion about past events. Parents and their preschool-aged children (n = 154) completed a parent-child reminiscing task. Transcripts were coded for emotion coaching and dismissing, emotion explanations, and elaboration. Parents reported on children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors, temperament, and gender. and children completed a language assessment. ('luster analyses revealed three parental discourse patterns: elaboration/negative emotion emphasis. positive and negative emotion emphasis. and low emotion discourse. Children's receptive language was associated with parents' membership in the low emotion discourse cluster. Children's temperament and gender were unrelated to parental emotion-related discourse patterns. Parents in the positive and negative emotion emphasis cluster had children with fewer internalizing behaviors compared to both other clusters, and parents in the elaboration/negative emotion emphasis cluster had children with more internalizing behaviors compared to both other clusters. Findings support the utility of a person-centered approach in providing a holistic view of parents' use of multiple emotion socialization strategies during reminiscing.

AB Anger is a central characteristic of negative affect and is relatively stable from infancy onward. Absolute levels of anger typically peak in early childhood and diminish as children become socialized and better able to regulate emotions. From infancy to school age, however, there are also individual differences in rank-order levels of anger. For example, although decreasing in absolute levels, some children may stay the same and others may increase in rank order relative to their peers. Although change in rank order of anger over time may provide unique insight into children's social development, little is known concerning variations in developmental patterns of anger from a rank-order perspective and how these patterns are related to children's behavioral adjustment. The current study (N = 361) used group-based trajectory analysis and identified 6 distinct patterns of parent-reported child anger by rank across 9 months to 7 years: low-stable rank, average-stable rank, average-decreasing rank, average-increasing rank, high-decreasing rank, and high-stable rank. Most children (65.1%) were in low- to average-rank groups. However, 28.2% and 6.7% of the children were in average-increasing and high-stable groups, respectively. Children in the high-stable group showed elevated levels of externalizing and internalizing problems at age 8 compared to children in the average-stable, average-decreasing, and high-decreasing groups. These findings help to clarify different patterns of anger development across childhood and how they may relate to later problem behaviors.

AB Community violence exposure is a common stressor, known to compromise youth cognitive and emotional development. In a diverse, urban sample of 22 adolescents, participants reported on community violence exposure (witnessing a beating or illegal drug use, hearing gun shots, or other forms of community violence) in early adolescence (average age 12.99), and underwent a neuroimaging scan 3-5 years later (average age 16.92). Community violence exposure in early adolescence predicted smaller manually traced left and right hippocampal and amygdala volumes in a model controlling for age, gender, and concurrent community violence exposure, measured in late adolescence. Community violence continued to predict hippocampus (but not amygdala) volumes after we also controlled for family aggression exposure in early adolescence. Community violence exposure was also associated with stronger resting state connectivity between the right hippocampus (using the manually traced structure as a seed region) and bilateral frontotemporal regions including the superior temporal gyrus and insula. These resting state connectivity results held after controlling for concurrent community violence exposure, SES, and family aggression. Although this is the first study focusing on community violence in conjunction with brain structure and function, these results dovetail with other research linking childhood adversity with smaller subcortical volumes in adolescence and adulthood, and with altered frontolimbic resting state connectivity. Our findings suggest that even community-level exposure to neighborhood violence can have detectable neural correlates in adolescents.

AB Decreasing sleep duration and increasing cigarette smoking of adolescents are major public health concerns. However, research examining connections between the developmental trajectories of the outcomes that are evolving contemporaneously and their relation to long-term outcomes is still lacking. This study examined distinct trajectories of sleep duration and cigarette smoking during adolescence, associations between these trajectories, and links with internalizing problems during young adulthood. Data were collected from 2510 adolescents who participated in a longitudinal study spanning from 2006 through 2014 in northern Taiwan. Group-based dual trajectory modeling was used to examine the dynamic relationships between sleep duration and cigarette smoking trajectories during adolescence. Multiple linear regression was used to understand the association between the distinct trajectories and subsequent internalizing problems. Three sleep duration trajectories (short decreasing, typical sleep, and long sleep) and three cigarette smoking trajectories (nonsmokers, late increasing, and escalating smokers) were identified. We found significant inter-relationships for sleep duration and cigarette smoking trajectories during adolescence; all atypical sleep duration trajectories conferred increased risks of increased cigarette smoking and vice versa. In addition, the effects of sleep duration and cigarette smoking on later internalizing problems were found to vary by sex and trajectory patterns. These results provide insight regarding the co-development of sleep duration and cigarette smoking trajectories during adolescence. We also highlight the different roles of sleep duration and cigarette smoking trajectories and their relation to internalizing problems of young adulthood.

AB Many, but not all, young children with high levels of fearful inhibition will develop internalizing problems. Individual studies have examined either child regulatory or environmental factors that might influence the level of risk. We focused on the interaction of regulation and environment by assessing how early fearful inhibition at age 2, along with inhibitory control and maternal negative behaviors at age 3, interactively predicted internalizing problems at age 6. A total of 218 children (105 boys, 113 girls) and their mothers participated in the study. Results indicated a three-way interaction among fearful inhibition, inhibitory control, and maternal negative behaviors. The correlation between fearful inhibition and internalizing was significant only when children had low inhibitory control and experienced high levels of maternal negative behaviors. Either having high inhibitory control or experiencing low maternal negative behaviors buffered against the adverse effect caused by the absence of the other. These findings highlight the importance of considering associations among both within-child factors and environmental factors in studying children's socioemotional outcomes.

AB Background: Individuals born extremely preterm are exposed to significant perinatal stresses that are associated with an increased risk of psychopathology. However, a paucity of longitudinal studies has prevented the empirical examination of long-term, dynamic effects of perinatal adversity on mental health. Here, internalizing and externalizing problems from adolescence through adulthood were compared in individuals born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1,000 g) and normal birth weight (NBW; >2,500 g). Methods: Internalizing and externalizing data were collected over 20 years in three waves, during adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood. Growth models were used to compare longitudinal trajectories in a geographically based sample of 151 ELBW survivors and 137 NBW control participants born between 1977 and 1982 matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status at age 8. Results: After adjusting for sex, socioeconomic and immigrant status, and family functioning, ELBW survivors failed to show the normative, age-related decline in internalizing problems over time relative to their NBW peers (beta = .21; p < .01). Both groups exhibited small declines in externalizing problems over the same period. Self-esteem (but not physical health, IQ, or maternal mood) partially mediated the association between ELBW status and internalizing problems. Conclusions: Extremely low birth weight survivors experienced a blunting of the expected improvement in depression and anxiety from adolescence to adulthood. These findings suggest that altered physiological regulatory systems supporting emotional and cognitive processing may contribute to the maintenance of internalizing problems in this population.

AB BackgroundMethodsThis study aimed to test the effectiveness of life skills education (LSE) and psychoeducation in the reduction of Youth Self Report (YSR) scores on institutionalized children using structured activities supported by trained facilitators. LSE involved participation of children in life skills activities to support development of key psychosocial competencies and interpersonal skills.
   The study included 630 children from three institutions. Of these, 171 were in the Intervention Group 1 (life skills education and psychoeducation), 162 were in the Intervention Group 2 (psychoeducation only), and 297 children were in the control group. A researcher-developed socio-demographic questionnaire and the YSR were used. Baseline assessments were conducted before the interventions and again at 3, 6, and 9months. Differences between the two intervention groups and the control group were investigated using least squares linear regression.
   ResultsConclusionsThere was a statistically significant reduction in scores in internalizing, externalizing, and total problem scores in both intervention arms (p<.05) compared with the control arm at 3months. At 6months, no significant differences were found between the intervention Group 1 and control group for internalizing score (p=.594); however, there were significant differences in both intervention groups for both externalizing and total problem scores (p<.05). At 9months, significant differences were observed between control and both intervention groups for externalizing scores; total problems for Intervention Group 1.
   A combination of Life Skills Education and psychoeducation is effective in reducing emotional and behavioral problems in institutionalized children.

AB Anxiety and depression are often co-occurring disorders, reflecting both homotypic and heterotypic continuity as possible developmental pathways. The present study aimed to examine homotypic and heterotypic continuities of anxiety and depression across 3years in adolescence and young adulthood. Participants included patients presenting to psychiatric care with diagnoses of anxiety and/or depressive disorders aged 13-18 at T1 (N=717, 44% initial participation rate) and aged 16-21 at T2 (N=549, 80% follow-up participation rate). McNemar's mid-p test and ordinal proportional odds logistic regression analyses were used to assess changes in prevalence within and across diagnostic categories, respectively. More adolescents had an anxiety disorder (+11%), whereas fewer had a depressive disorder (-11%), at T2 compared to T1. Of adolescents with anxiety and/or depression at T1, only 25% recovered or were non-symptomatic 3years after referral to a psychiatric clinic. Homotypic continuity was observed for anxiety disorders in general (OR=2.33), for phobic anxiety disorders (OR=7.45), and for depressive disorders (OR=2.15). For heterotypic continuity, depression predicted later anxiety (OR=1.92), more specifically social anxiety (OR=2.14) and phobic anxiety disorders (OR=1.83). In addition, social anxiety predicted later generalized anxiety disorder (OR=3.11). Heterotypic continuity was thus more common than homotypic continuity. For adolescents presenting with anxiety or depression, treatment should, therefore, target broad internalizing symptom clusters, rather than individual diagnoses.

AB The network approach suggests that psychopathology arises from complex associations between symptoms and may offer insight into the mechanisms that underpin psychiatric comorbidities. The transition from childhood to adolescence is a key period in the development of psychopathology, yet has rarely been considered from a network perspective. As such, the present study examined the network structure of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology from middle childhood through adolescence using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n=4405). Eight DSM-IV disorders were assessed using maternal reports when children were aged 7.5, 10.5 and 14years. Weighted, undirected networks were estimated and the relative importance of each node was assessed using three common measures of node centrality; strength, betweenness, and closeness. A consistent network structure emerged at all three time points; nodes clustered together in two regions of space broadly reflecting the internalizing and externalizing spectra. Permutation tests supported structural invariance across this developmental period. These spectra were bridged by numerous disorder-level interactions, the most consistent of which was between depression and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Furthermore, inspection of the centrality indices indicated that generalised anxiety disorder and ODD were the most central disorders in the networks. These findings demonstrate that symptom/disorder-level interplay and reciprocal influence are plausible mechanisms for the association between internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in childhood/adolescence.

AB Although most research with youth exposed to violent manmade disasters has focused on internalizing problems, recent work suggests conduct problems (CPs) may also manifest in exposed youth. However, the extent to which youth postevent CPs present independently, versus co-present in conjunction with PTSD symptoms, remains unclear. The present study examined PTS and CP symptom profiles among affected Boston-area youth following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. This study used latent profile analysis to identify distinct PTS and CP symptom profiles among Boston-area youth ages 4-19 years (N=344) affected by the Boston Marathon bombing events. PTS and CPs were measured using the UCLA-PTSD-RI and the SDQ parent reports, respectively. Analyses identified 3 distinct profiles: presentations characterized by (a) low PTS, low CPs, (b) moderate PTS, low CPs, and (c) high PTS, elevated CPs. The profile characterized by the highest PTS was the only profile with elevated CPs; hyperarousal and emotional numbing/avoidance symptoms showed the greatest distinguishing properties among profiles with and without elevated CP. Types of traumatic exposure experienced by youth were differentially associated with profiles. Specifically, direct (but not relational) exposure distinguished youth classified in the profile showing elevated CPs. Findings suggest interventions following violent manmade disasters may do well to incorporate CP modules when working with youth showing the greatest hyperarousal and emotional numbing, and/or who have directly witnessed the most violence.

AB Research suggests that corporal punishment and growing up in socially disorganized neighborhoods may have differential effects on children of color compared to White children. We test this idea by employing multilevel models with interaction terms to examine whether the associations of perceived neighborhood collective efficacy and maternal corporal punishment with behavior problems at age 5 differed by race/ethnicity. The analytic sample consisted of 2388 White, Black, or Hispanic families in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Covariates at the individual child, parent, and neighborhood levels were included to account for the racial/ethnic differences in structural and socioeconomic factors. Results demonstrate that race/ethnicity does not moderate the associations of maternal corporal punishment with internalizing or externalizing behavior problems in early childhood, nor does race/ethnicity moderate the association between neighborhood collective efficacy and externalizing behavior. However, the significant interaction between neighborhood collective efficacy and Hispanic ethnicity suggests that the protective role of collective efficacy on internalizing behavior is more pronounced in Hispanic children than White children. Overall, these findings underline the importance of multilevel interventions that strengthen neighborhood collective efficacy, particularly for Hispanic children, and of interventions that discourage physical discipline practices for young children.

AB Little research has examined how parenting practices may differ in various regions of the United States, specifically the South. The current study used a Southern United States sample to replicate prior research done in Central Florida, a proximal yet distinct region. Participants included 4900 emerging adults attending a Southern United States university who were aged 18 to 25 years (M = 18.87; SD = 1.22) and identified themselves as female (66.6%), male (33.4%), Caucasian (74.8%), African American (20.2%), Asian (1.9%), Latino (1.2%), or Other (1.9%). Participants answered questionnaires regarding their perceptions of maternal and paternal parenting styles and their own internalizing and externalizing problems using an online survey. Results indicated that perceptions of parenting style across region varied as a function of parent gender, such that parents, particularly mothers, were more authoritarian in the Southern sample. Moreover, latent profile analysis produced two perceived mother-father dyad parenting profiles: (1) congruent maternal and paternal parenting style and (2) a high authoritative and authoritarian mother coupled with an extremely high authoritarian and authoritative father. Emerging adults, especially males, reported higher externalizing problems in profile 1 and internalizing problems showed the same non-significant trend. The combination of high perceived authoritative and authoritarian styles found in profile 2 along with lower associated externalizing problems strongly suggests that context plays a significant role in how parenting is associated with outcomes.

AB It has been suggested that atypical hormone environments during early development may contribute to subsequent development of psychopathology. Also, it has been suggested that individuals with the autosomal recessive genetic variant, classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), might be at increased risk of psychopathology. The present study examined emotional and behavioral adjustment in young children with CAH and their unaffected siblings in the United Kingdom. The parent-reported version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was employed to assess adjustment in children aged 4 to 11 years. There were 38 boys with CAH, 43 girls with CAH, 23 unaffected brothers, and 31 unaffected sisters. No differences in emotional or behavioral problems were found between boys or girls with CAH and unaffected same-sex siblings. In addition, affected and unaffected boys in the current sample generally did not differ from boys in the general population. However, compared with girls in the general population, girls with CHN had more difficulties related to conduct problems, hyperactivity/ inattention, and prosocial behavior, and unaffected sisters had more difficulties related to peer problems, conduct problems, and prosocial behavior. These findings suggest that both girls with CAH and unaffected sisters of girls or boys with CAH may be at increased risk of developing behavioral problems. Potential influences related to the early hormone environment, familial process, and social stigma are considered.

AB Background: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. When untreated, PKU leads to a significant intellectual deficiency. Although early initiation of dietary therapy allows normal cognitive development, low adherence to treatment may result in neuropsychological deficits, including attention problems. This study was performed to evaluate emotional and behavioral problems in early-treated children and adolescents with PKU using the Child Behavior Checklist - CBCL/6-18 answered by parents.
   Material/Methods: The study included 36 PKU patients. The mean scores of internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, syndrome scales, and DSM-IV-oriented scales of patients were compared with those of controls. An analysis to evaluate the importance of adherence to treatment and presence of intellectual disability was also performed.
   Results: There were no significant differences between patients and controls for almost all CBCL/6-18 scales, with the exception of the Attention Problem Scale - CBCL-APS. The mean (+/- SD) of the CBCL-APS scores of patients (7.86+5.33) was considerably higher than the mean of the controls (6.07 +/- 4.37; p=0.016), but not different from the mean of a matched control subsample (6.69 +/- 4.46; p=0.316). The difference between the mean of the scores of DSM-IV/ADHD scale of patients (6.72 +/- 4.07) and controls (5.73 +/- 3.56; p=0.102) was not significant. Non-adherence to treatment and intellectual disability had a negative impact on both CBCL-APS and DSM-IV/ADHD scale scores.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate a significant prevalence of parents' complaints of attention problems and hyperactivity in non-adherent to treatment and intellectually low performing patients with PKU.

AB Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at heightened risk of psychiatric comorbidities across the lifespan, including elevated rates of internalizing, externalizing, and self-injurious behaviors. Identification of medical comorbidities that contribute to these concerns may elucidate mechanisms through which psychiatric concerns arise, as well as offer additional avenues for intervention. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions are of particular interest, as they are prevalent among those with ASD, may share genetic or neurobiological etiologies with the core features of ASD, and are linked with psychiatric difficulties in the general population. In this paper, we draw on data from nearly 2,800 children and adolescents with ASD within the Simons Simplex Collection to characterize the unique contributions of (1) autism symptoms, (2) psychosocial factors (child's age, sex, verbal and nonverbal IQ, adaptive behavior, race, and household income), and (3) GI concerns with respect to multiple psychiatric outcomes. Multiple regression models revealed unique contributions of ASD symptoms and multiple psychosocial factors such as verbal IQ, adaptive behavior, and family income to internalizing, externalizing, and self-injurious behavior. In general, higher levels of psychiatric symptoms were associated with more ASD symptoms, higher verbal IQ, lower adaptive behavior skills, and lower family income. Furthermore, levels of GI symptoms accounted for unique variance in psychiatric outcomes over and above these other factors, linking increased GI problems with increased psychiatric symptoms in children with ASD. Taken together, results indicate that the presence and quantity of GI symptoms should be considered when evaluating psychiatric and behavioral concerns among children with ASD, and that treatment of GI conditions may be an important component in alleviating a broad array of mental health concerns in this group.

AB Although parent-child discrepant perception of the family has been increasingly noted in the west, pertinent research is limited in Chinese societies. In addition, prior pertinent studies predominantly treated parent-child discrepant effects as independent of the general and aggregate family context, which are in fact inseparable. Furthermore, these studies tended to either look at the positive side of child outcomes or those negative ones. The present study, based on a community sample of 223 Chinese parent-child dyads, attempted to examine effects of parent-child discrepancy in effective parenting practices on both children's positive, i.e. self-control and other perspective taking behavior, and negative outcomes, i.e. internalizing and externalizing problems, directly or indirectly through the mediator of children's self-concept at the aggregate effective parenting context. Results largely support harmful effects of parent-child discrepancy in effective parenting on the child outcomes directly or indirectly through children's self-concept. Besides, aggregate effective parenting practices are found to robustly contribute to the child outcomes directly and indirectly through children's self-concept, even taking parent-child discrepant effects into account. What's more important, the former is significantly moderated by the latter for its effects on the child outcomes, explicating the conditional nature of parent-child discrepant effects on child development. Contributions and implications of the current study applied in Chinese culture as well as future study directions are also discussed.

AB Background: Intimate partner sexual violence (IPSV) is a common but often overlooked form of intimate partner violence (IPV) that may have unique consequences for those who experience it. We aimed to explore how outcomes associated with IPSV differ from outcomes associated with other forms of intimate partner and sexual violence. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of the English-language literature, including original research studies and reports that focused on outcomes associated with IPSV. We aimed to quantify the risk for health outcomes associated with exposure to IPSV in comparison with exposure to other forms of interpersonal violence or nonexposure to interpersonal violence. Results: Twenty-eight publications were reviewed, most were small observational studies focused on women exposed to IPSV. Reported outcomes were related to mental health (n=20 studies), physical and sexual health (n=19 studies), and health of children with a parent exposed to IPSV (n=1 study). Compared with other forms of interpersonal violence, exposure to IPSV was associated with greater risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms, problematic substance use, suicidality, pain and other somatic symptoms, adverse sexual health problems, specific physical injuries including strangulation, and death by homicide. Children with an exposed parent were at higher risk for internalizing symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and somatization. Conclusions: Sexual violence in intimate partner relationships is common and has distinct consequences compared with other forms of interpersonal violence including elevated risks for suicidality and death by homicide. It should be given special consideration within the assessment and management of interpersonal violence.

AB Objective: To develop a theoretically grounded measure of self-perceived ability to cope with stress in a flexible (i.e. non-rigid) manner and test associations with well-being. Method: Participants in Study 1 (N = 395, 17-56 years) completed surveys to report flexible coping with stress and well-being. In Studies 2 (N = 645, 17-27 years) and 3 (N = 558, 12-19 years), youth completed surveys with the 18-item Self-Perception of Flexible Coping with Stress (SFCS), and coping and well-being measures. Results: Three SFCS factors were supported, which aligned to the conceptualization including multiple coping strategy use (multiple CSU), coping rigidity, and situational coping. The SFCS subscales had good reliability and were modestly correlated with each other. Also, multiple CSU and situational coping were linked to better mental health, emotion regulation, greater use of adaptive coping strategies, and better self-worth. Coping rigidity was linked with more symptoms of anxiety and depression, more emotion dysregulation, greater use of problem-coping behaviors, and lower self-worth. Older participants reported they were higher in flexible coping and sex differences in multiple CSU and situational coping were found. Conclusions. The SFCS, a measure of the deployment of a coping "toolbox" that could allow individuals to respond adroitly to stressors, is reliable, valid, and associated with well-being.

AB Emotion regulation difficulties have been involved in multiple forms of psychopathology and may represent an important focus for current efforts to understand the biological mechanisms underlying transdiagnostic symptoms. The present study investigated a gene-environment interaction (G x E) in reappraisal, a form of emotion regulation that has been extensively linked to psychopathology. In light of recent meta-analytic evidence of its consistent role in depression and anxiety disorders, this study focused on the Val66Met (rs6265) single-nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene and examined its moderator role in the relation between childhood trauma and reappraisal. A sample of N = 266 participants were genotyped for BDNF Val66Met, filled in a self-report measure of childhood trauma, and underwent a cognitive task designed to assess reappraisal ability. The results indicated that, as expected, BDNF Val66Met was a significant moderator in the relation between childhood trauma and reappraisal. There was a negative relation between the number of childhood traumatic events and reappraisal ability in BDNF Met carriers, but not Val homozygotes. This finding suggests that BDNF Val66Met contributes to susceptibility to childhood stress, with long term impact on emotion regulation.

AB Executive functioning (EF) deficits are well-documented in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet little is known about the longitudinal trajectory of "everyday" EF and links to social, emotional and behavioral outcomes in ASD. This study examined the profile of everyday EF utilizing parent-reported measures over 2 years, and explored whether prior estimates of EF were related to later co-morbid psychopathology and social functioning in 39 children with ASD and 34 typically developing (TD) children (ages 7-14 years). According to parent reports, children with ASD had impaired scores of EF in all domains at both time points, and showed no significant improvement across 2 years, compared to controls. Regression analyses showed that prior estimates of behavior regulation difficulties at time 1 uniquely predicted later emotional (i.e., symptoms of anxiety/depression) and behavioral (i.e., oppositionality/aggressiveness) problems in children with ASD 2 years later. Furthermore, an improvement of metacognitive skills predicted a reduction of social difficulties over 2 years in ASD. These results imply that EF may be a potential target of intervention for preventing and reducing co-morbid psychopathology and promoting social competence in youth with ASD. Furthermore, the findings that EF related to behavior is more critical for later emotional and behavioral functioning, whereas EF related to cognition is more critical for social functioning, indicates that it may be beneficial to tailor treatment. Future studies investigating the effectiveness of EF-based interventions in improving the cognitive, psychological and social outcomes in ASD are of high priority.

AB Child victims' reports of psychological and physical abuse by caregivers are a fundamental source of information beyond official records and caregiver reports. However, few or no sensitive and age-appropriate child-report instruments exist that have undergone in-depth validity and reliability testing across a broad age-range. Our study addresses this gap by examining psychometric properties of a picture-based, modularized version of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTSPC-R), encompassing the maltreatment subtypes of psychological and physical abuse. A sample of 904 children and adolescents aged 4-16 years from the community (n = 568), child psychiatric services (n = 159), and from Child Protective Services (CPS; n = 177) completed the CTSPC-R. Measures to test convergent (maltreatment in parent interviews and CPS records) and concurrent validity (psychiatric symptoms) were collected. The CTSPC-R comprises 22 items, arranged in three severity modules by increasing level of psychological and physical abuse by caregivers. Companion picture cards were provided for children aged 4 and 8 years. The best fit to the data was attained with a second-order factor model, assuming three inter-correlated factors corresponding to the three severity modules, and a latent second-order factor representing combined physical and psychological abuse. The three factors showed good internal consistencies. Supporting convergent validity at the global and subtype-level of maltreatment, the CTSPC-R severity scale was associated with lifetime CPS-contact, presence of caregiver-reported emotional maltreatment and physical abuse, and dimensions of chronicity and severity. Discriminant validity was supported by non-significant correlations with caregiver-reported lack of supervision, failure to provide, and sexual abuse. Bolstering concurrent validity, moderate and severe physical abuse predicted caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These effects were independent of child age, gender or community vs. non-community samples. Our study supports the CTSPC-R as a scientifically and clinically sound tool for ascertaining the child's own perspective on psychological and physical abuse from an early age onwards.

AB BackgroundOver the last decade, several studies investigated the outcomes in children born very preterm. Only recently there has been an increasing interest in the late preterm infants (born between 34+0 and 36+6weeks). This population is at high risk of morbidity and mortality in the first years of life. Other studies reported that they are also at risk of long-term developmental problem. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the neurodevelopmental and emotional-behavioral outcome in a sample of late preterm patients.MethodsThe study included late preterm children and adolescents who had neuropsychiatric and/or neurological symptoms. They underwent a general, neurocognitive and an emotional-behavioral assessment. Exclusion criteria included: patients affected by Central Nervous System congenital abnormalities, neurodegenerative diseases, genetic disorders, epilepsy, or in pharmacological treatment, or adopted children. A descriptive statistics analysis was performed to describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients. Risk factors related to late preterm birth, prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, and cognitive functioning were recorded and analyzed.ResultsThe sample included 68 LPI (45 males and 23 females) aged from 2 to 16.3years (mean age 7,5years), who were affected by one or more neurodevelopmental disorder, including Language Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Specific Learning Disorder, Developmental Coordination Disorder, Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Moreover, in 30.8% of patients, internalizing problems (affective and social skills problem) were detected.ConclusionsOur results support the importance of a long-term surveillance of late preterm and the great need for more longitudinal large population studies in order to collect data on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of this population.

AB Serious games aimed at promoting well-being in youth have promising effects and potential for far-reaching impact. Considering that most mental health disorders remain untreated in youth, therapeutic games may be most valuable when they are aimed at untreated youth with internalizing symptoms. However, when targeting youth outside of a clinical setting, the first impression of therapeutic video games may determine whether and how a game is played. Thus, understanding the influence of messaging used in the promotion of therapeutic games on game choice and experience is critical. The current study examined two alternatives in promoting mental health games: one included explicit mental health messaging (e.g., learn to manage stress) and the other was a stealth promotion that did not mention mental health but highlighted the entertainment value. Young adults with mild to severe internalizing mental health symptoms (i.e., depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) were shown two distinct trailer designs, with random assignment determining which design held which message. Participants (n = 129, M-age = 21.33, SDage = 3.20), unaware that both trailers promoted the same commercial video game, were 3.71 times more likely to choose what they believed was the mental health game. Additionally, an unforeseen difference in the attractiveness of the two trailer designs resulted in participants being 5.65 times more likely to select the mental health game promoted in one trailer design over the other. Messaging did not influence game experience (i.e., gameplay duration, autonomy, competence, intrinsic motivation and affect). Exploratory analyses indicated that game experience, but not game choice, was influenced by symptom severity, symptom type and the interaction between symptom severity and messaging. The present study suggests that explicit mental health messages attract youth with mental health symptoms. Ultimately, youth may be empowered to seek out mental health games if they are promoted properly, allowing for far-reaching positive influences on well-being. Toward this aim, future research is needed on the game selection process, addressing underlying motivations, the balance between explicit health and entertainment messaging, and multiple interacting influences on game selection (e.g., promotion and peers).

AB Individuals in a major depressive episode often display impairment in cognitive control, and this impairment exists outside of the acute phase of illness. Impairment in cognitive control also has been associated with exposure to childhood adversity (CA). The current study examined whether exposure to CA can explain variance in a component of cognitive control-inhibitory control-independent of diagnostic status in young adults with and without a history of depression. Healthy control individuals (n = 40) and individuals with remitted major depressive disorder (n = 53) completed a task measuring inhibitory control, reported level of CA and completed a scanning session to assess gray matter volume and resting state connectivity in regions associated with cognitive control. The results demonstrate that higher levels of CA were associated with poorer inhibitory control, reduced right middle frontal gyrus gray matter, decreased connectivity of salience and emotion networks and increased connectivity in cognitive control networks, even after controlling for diagnostic status, residual depression symptoms and current stressors. Together, the results suggest that inhibitory control impairment and intrinsic connectivity changes may be characterized as developmental sequelae of early stress exposure.

AB Objective To examine individual differences in pediatric cancer survivors' psychosocial adjustment and test the psychosocial predictors, assessed 2-3 years earlier, of those differences. Method Pediatric cancer survivors (n = 209, aged 8-17 years at baseline) and their parents were followed for 4 years. They provided reports of survivors' psychosocial adjustment at 3 years postbaseline, and latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify subgroups of survivors who differed on those reports. Multinomial logistic regression was used to predict group membership from selfand parent-reported psychosocial factors at baseline (child adjustment, disposition, and parental functioning) and at 1 year post-baseline (child social relations). Results The LPA revealed a 3-class model as the best fit: a "Resilient" group (65%), characterized by good psychosocial adjustment; a "Self-Reported At-Risk" group (23%), characterized by subclinical elevations in selfreported internalizing and attention problems; and a "Parent-Reported At-Risk" group (12%), characterized by subclinical elevations in parent-reported internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems and in self-reported attention problems. Several psychosocial predictors, including child posttraumatic stress, affectivity, and connectedness to school, as well as parental distress and overprotection, differentiated the Resilient group from the other groups, in expected directions. Conclusions The majority of pediatric cancer survivors exhibit enduring resilience. The protective factors identified for them-including positive affectivity and strong connectedness to school-may inform targeted prevention strategies for the minority of survivors who are at risk for maladjustment.

AB We examine whether behavioral, mental health, and physical health characteristics of children with autism are associated with baseline and change in health-related quality of life. We measured health-related quality of life with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 total scores from children enrolled in the Autism Treatment Network. We used linear mixed model regressions with random slopes. Predictors of lower health-related quality of life at baseline included demographic and insurance characteristics, diagnosis, higher Child Behavior Checklist internalizing and externalizing scores, sleep problems by Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, and mental health problems. Several characteristics had different associations over time. This study demonstrates that in addition to behavioral and autism-related characteristics, physical and mental health conditions are associated with health-related quality of life in children with autism.

AB This study investigated how supportive relationships with peers and parents protect children against ongoing victimization, internalizing problems and depression. The longitudinal data set tracked progress of 111 children recruited for the trial of Resilience Triple P, and previously bullied by peers. Informants included children, parents and teachers. Higher levels of facilitative parenting (warm parenting that supports peer relationships) and peer acceptance predicted lower later levels of both depression and victimization over time. Higher levels of child friendedness predicted lower levels of child reports of internalizing problems. Children's friendships, acceptance by same sex peers and facilitative parenting all played moderating roles in protecting againstongoing victimization and internalizing problems. Peer acceptance mediated the relationships between facilitative parenting and victimization. Facilitative parenting mediated the relationship between peer acceptance and depression. It was concluded that supportive relationships with parents and peers play important and complementary roles in protecting children against ongoing victimization and depression.

AB Role confusion is a deviation in the parent-child relationship such that a parent looks to a child to meet the parent's emotional needs and abdicates, in part, the parental role in exchange for care, intimacy, or peer support from the child. In addition, a child may initiate role-confused behavior in order to gain closeness to a parent who is otherwise preoccupied by his or her own needs. The current study examined associations between mother-child role confusion at age 5 (we coded role confusion from filmed free-play mother-child interactions) and teacher reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and peer problems, at Grade 1. The sample (N = 557) is from a longitudinal study of families in rural communities, the Family Life Project. Mother-child role confusion predicted internalizing symptoms and peer problems (but not externalizing symptoms) above and beyond other dimensions of maternal parenting (sensitivity and harsh intrusiveness), demographic factors, and prior levels of outcome variables. However, some effect sizes were small, making replication desirable. Temperament and child sex were important moderators: girls with difficult temperaments and boys with easy temperaments were more vulnerable to internalizing symptoms (but not externalizing symptoms or peer problems) in the context of role confusion. We discuss the singular importance of role confusion, a construct that has been largely unrecognized by developmental psychologists until recently, for behavioral outcomes of children as they transition into middle childhood.

AB Forty Italian gay father families formed by surrogacy were compared with 40 Italian lesbian mother families formed by donor insemination, all with a child aged 3 to 9 years. Standardized interview, observational, and questionnaire measures of parenting quality, parent-child relationships, stigmatization, and children's adjustment were administered to parents, children, teachers, and a child psychiatrist. The only differences across family types indicated higher levels of stigmatization as reported by gay fathers. Externalizing and internalizing problems in both groups scored within the normal range. When family structure and processes were entered together as predictors of child adjustment, a hierarchical linear model analysis showed that factors associated with children's externalizing problems were the child's male gender, high stigmatization, and negative parenting; children's internalizing problems were higher in lesbian mother families and were predicted by stigmatization. Of note, neither gay fathers nor lesbian mothers tended to underestimate their children's adjustment problems relative to teachers. Finally, for children of gay fathers, comparison between teacher SDQ ratings and teacher SDQ normative data on Italian children in a similar age range showed that teachers reported children of gay fathers to show significantly fewer internalizing problems than the normative sample. No differences in children's externalizing problems emerged. A bootstrapping simulation confirmed all results, except the effect of stigmatization on child internalizing problems. Findings suggest that the practice of surrogacy by gay men has no adverse effects on child health outcomes. Implications for our theoretical understanding of child socialization and development, and law and social policy, are discussed.

AB Background: Prenatal exposure to maternal metabolic complications has been linked to offspring neurodevelopmental problems. However, no studies investigating these links have examined the role of maternal prenatal diet.
   Aims: To determine if prenatal exposure to maternal adiposity or hyperglycemia is associated with neurodevelopmental problems in 3-4 year old children, and if links persist following adjustment for confounding variables, including prenatal diet.
   Method: 808 mother-child pairs from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals-Child Development Plus cohort were used to examine associations between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), hyperglycemia and offspring verbal, performance and full-scale IQ scores, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems. Associations were examined before and after adjustment for prenatal diet along with home environment, maternal depression, education and prenatal smoking. Semi-partial correlations were examined post-hoc to assess the impact of each confounder in the adjusted models.
   Results: In the unadjusted models, BMI and hyperglycemia predicted lower verbal and full-scale IQ. BMI was also linked to externalizing problems. However, associations were not significant after adjustment. In adjusted models, post-hoc analysis revealed that prenatal diet and home environment accounted for significant variance in verbal and full-scale IQ. The home environment and maternal depression accounted for significant variance in externalizing problems.
   Conclusion: In the adjusted models, maternal metabolic complications were not associated with offspring neurodevelopment. Even while adjusting for well-known risk factors for adverse offspring cognition (home environment, maternal depression), we show for the first time that maternal prenatal diet is an important confounder of the links between maternal metabolic complications and offspring cognition.

AB Depression and anxiety are prevalent and impairing forms of psychopathology in children and adolescents. Deficits in early executive control (EC) may contribute to the development of these problems, but longitudinal studies with rigorous measurement across key developmental periods are limited. The current study examines EC in preschool as a predictor of subsequent depression and anxiety symptoms in elementary school in a community sample (N=280). Child participants completed a battery of nine developmentally-appropriate tasks designed to measure major aspects of EC at age 5years, 3months. Children later participated in an elementary school follow-up phase, during which they completed validated norm-referenced self-report questionnaires of depression and anxiety symptoms in fourth grade. Results indicate that poorer preschool EC was significantly associated with both greater depression and anxiety symptoms in elementary school, controlling for baseline depression and anxiety symptoms in preschool and other relevant variables. These findings suggest that poor EC may be an important risk factor for the development of internalizing psychopathology in childhood. Given emerging evidence for the modifiability of EC, particularly in preschool, EC promotion interventions may hold promise as a potential target in psychopathology prevention.

AB Purpose: To date, little is known about underlying psychophysiological contributions to the impact of media content and overall screen time on adolescent psychological functioning. In the present study we examine respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as a moderator of the link between specific types of media content use, overall media exposure, and the development of internalizing and aggressive symptoms in youth.
   Methods: A sample of 374 adolescents (mean age =15) reported on their media use, internalizing behavior, and aggressive behavior at time 1 (2011) and 1-year follow-up (2012). RSA reactivity was gathered during a challenging laboratory task. Path analyses were conducted to test the hypothesized three-way interaction model between media use, media content, and RSA reactivity, separately for internalizing and aggressive problems.
   Results: Significant interactions were found for aggressive, but not prosocial, media content. For aggressive content, youth exhibiting RSA withdrawal reported significantly greater internalizing and aggressive symptoms when exposed to higher amounts of screen time and aggressive content.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that profiles of heightened RSA withdrawal may place adolescents at greater risk to the negative impact of violent media, whereas prosocial media content may not significantly impact youth development of psychopathology. Implications for the role of psychophysiology in our understanding of media effects are discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Few studies have examined the relation of perceived group discrimination and psychological well-being. Yet, there are theoretical reasons to expect such a relation, and members of ethnic minorities usually perceive higher levels of group discrimination than personal discrimination. In this research, we investigated the associations between perceived group discrimination and several indicators of psychological well-being among 354 Moroccan-Dutch adolescents controlling for perceived personal discrimination and testing the extent to which ethnic group identification moderated these associations. Our results showed that higher perceived group discrimination was associated with higher parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing (e.g., fear, worries) and externalizing problems (e.g., anger, aggression) but not with lower personal self-esteem. For personal self-esteem a negative association with perceived personal discrimination was found. Moreover, for adolescents with a strong ethnic group identification, there was no relationship between perceived group discrimination and parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing problems, while for those with a weak ethnic group identification, perceived group discrimination was associated with more parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing problems. Conversely, perceived group discrimination was unrelated to personal self-esteem among low identifiers, but positively related to it among high identifiers. Results indicate that minority group members can be negatively affected by discrimination, even if they do not experience it at first hand. Thus, future research on the psychological effects of discrimination should include group perceptions.

AB Background: We examined whether increased risk for adolescent tobacco and marijuana problems associated with childhood ADHD is explained by key intermediary influences during adolescence and differs by gender. Methods: Longitudinal structural equation models examined mediating effects on problems with both substances (or each substance separately) through age-14 peer impairment, internalizing, and adolescent ADHD symptoms in two twin samples, prospectively assessed since age 11 (N = 2,164). Whether these mediators contributed beyond mediating effects of early-adolescent substance use was also considered. Twin difference analyses further illuminated which mediators might be potentially causal. Results: Direct effects of childhood ADHD on age-17 tobacco and marijuana problems (i.e., independent of included mediators) as well as effects of adolescent ADHD symptoms were significant only for females. By contrast, mediation by peer impairment, evident particularly for marijuana, was relatively stronger for males than females. Depression and anxiety were not prospectively associated with age-17 substance problems when earlier substance problems were considered. Consistent with causal influence of early substance use on later problems, monozygotic twins with more severe tobacco or marijuana problems at age 14 than their co-twins were also more likely to have substance problems later in adolescence. Conclusions: Mediation through peer impairment, continued presence of ADHD symptoms, and early substance use may alter development so that childhood ADHD indirectly contributes to problems with tobacco and marijuana. Targeting gender-sensitive interventions prior to mid-adolescence, before these patterns become established, is essential.

AB Objective
   Although much empirical attention has been devoted to emotion regulation (ER) in individuals with eating disorders, little is known about ER across a wide age range and among different ED subtypes. The current study sought to examine ER in a sample of eating disorder patients.
   MethodResultsA total of 364 adults and adolescents with anorexia nervosa restricting subtype (AN-R), anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype (AN-BP), or bulimia nervosa (BN) were assessed with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
   Older ages were associated with higher DERS total, nonacceptance, goals, and impulsivity scores. When controlling for age, patients with BN and AN-BP had higher overall DERS scores than those with AN, and there were some differences among diagnostic subtypes on specific facets of ER.
   ConclusionsThese results indicate that treatments for emotion dysregulation may be applied across eating disorder diagnoses and ages, and inform how these strategies apply to different diagnostic groups.

AB Objectives: Stressful life events (SLEs) have been associated with adjustment problems in adolescence (APA) in cross-sectional studies. Using a longitudinal cohort, we examined the influence of these events and predefined covariates on APA and compared internalizing and externalizing trajectories among children with many versus few SLEs. Methods: Data were obtained from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. One thousand three hundred sixty-four children and their families were followed from child's birth until age 15 years. Adjustment problems at age 15 years were defined as high (> 60 T-score) internalizing and/or externalizing problems on the Youth Self-Report and Child Behavior Checklist. Stressful life events were evaluated at 54 months, and third and fifth grade. Categories created by mixture model analyses for covariates were used in logistic regressions to predict adjustment problems. Results: Mothers reported higher rates of adjustment problems than adolescents (21.1% vs 16.3%; p < 0.0001). Adjustment problems were associated with more SLEs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7; p = 0.0042), male sex (OR = 1.9; p = 0.001), child's high emotional reactivity (OR = 1.6; p = 0.01), and paternal depression (OR = 2.1; p = 0.0165). Analysis using the mother's report of adjustment problems showed the same predictors, as well as lower maternal education level (OR 5 3.5; p = 0.0003), and child's friendship quality (OR = 0.4; p = 0.005). Higher internalizing and externalizing T-scores were apparent in children with more SLEs from 2 years of age onward (ps < 0.0001). Conclusion: After adjusting for multiple covariates, SLEs during childhood predicted adjustment problems. Our results suggest that emotional reactivity and paternal depression play a role in the development of APA.

AB Support for mothers may improve children's socioemotional adjustment, yet few studies have considered the benefits of formal support (from health and social work professionals) in addition to social support (from family and friends) or explored the mechanisms. These issues were addressed using a birth cohort (n = 2,649) to explore how mothers' perceptions of social and formal support when children were ages 10-22 months predicted trajectories of children's externalizing and internalizing problems from 58 to 122 months. We tested mediating pathways from support to child adjustment via 3 family stressors measured at 46-58 months (maternal distress, economic strain, and dysfunctional parenting) and examined whether support buffered effects of stressors on child adjustment. Social and formal support were simultaneously associated with lower child externalizing and internalizing problem trajectory intercepts at 90 months but did not predict trajectory slopes. Social support effects were mediated mainly via lower maternal distress, which then reduced children's problems via lower dysfunctional parenting, or more directly. Additional indirect effects involved lower economic strain. Formal support effects were mediated to a lesser extent by reduced dysfunctional parenting. Two buffering effects were found: social support reduced effects of economic strain on internalizing problems, and formal support reduced effects of dysfunctional parenting on internalizing problems. Findings suggest measures promoting families' social integration should benefit children's socioemotional adjustment via improved parental psychological and economic resources and by buffering impacts of economic strain. Enhancing access to health and welfare services through greater awareness and trust should benefit children's adjustment, via improved parenting and by buffeting impacts of dysfunctional parenting.

AB Discrepancies often exist between self-reported and parent-reported symptoms when assessing youth psychosocial functioning. Parent-child discrepancies in ratings may be important for understanding psychopathology and patterns of family functioning, particularly during adolescence and for youth with chronic illness. This study examined patterns of multirater reporting discrepancies in a pediatric asthma population. Adolescents (n = 707; 11-17 years old) and their primary caregivers completed ratings of adolescents' psychological symptoms. Latent profile analysis identified five profiles of parent-adolescent discrepancies, including one group with highly discordant ratings, two groups in agreement, and two groups with slightly discordant ratings. Adolescents who agreed with their parents on the presence of elevated symptoms and those who had significant discrepancies in ratings, such that parents reported elevated symptoms compared to youth self-report, had poor pulmonary functioning and elevated reports of parent-rated family conflict. Results suggest the need to assess internalizing and externalizing symptoms in adolescents with asthma using a multirater approach while also highlighting the complexity in interpreting patterns of discrepancies.

TI Behavioral Outcomes of Infant Colic in Toddlerhood: A Longitudinal Study
SO JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTNATAL DEPRESSION
AB Objective To assess whether infants with colic that resolved before 6 months of age have poorer medium-term outcomes than infants without colic.
   Study design Comparative study of 2 prospective, community-based cohorts of children aged 2-3 years in Melbourne, Australia: children from the Baby Biotics study, with previously diagnosed Wessel criteria of colic without problem crying at 6 months (True Colic Cohort), vs children from the Baby Business trial, without problem crying at 1, 4. and 6 months (No Colic Cohort). Caregiver report of child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (primary outcome). temperament. regulatory (crying/sleeping/feeding) problems. and family functioning at child age 2-3 years was collected. We conducted regression analyses of mean differences/ORs adjusted for child sex, age, social disadvantage, parental education, and maternal mental health.
   Results In total, 74% of the original Baby Biotics (n = 124) sample and 75% of the Baby Business (n = 503) sample completed questionnaires. In adjusted analyses, there were no significant differences between the True Colic Cohort (n = 99) and No Colic Cohort (n = 182) in internalizing behavior problems (adjusted mean difference 0.73; 95% CI -3.96 to 5.43, P= .76) or externalizing behavior problems (adjusted mean difference -1.53; 95% CI -6.02 to 2.97. P= .51). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in temperament, parental perception of regulatory problems, or family functioning.
   Conclusions Infants with colic whose crying self-resolves do not experience adverse effects regarding child behavior, regulatory abilities, temperament, or family functioning in the medium term. Parents and clinicians can be reassured that infant crying as the result of colic, and related stress, is short-lived and will likely resolve.

AB Parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition: Parent Rating Scale (BASC2 PRS) while their children (94 boys, 61 girls; M = 11 years 11 months) were given tests. Evidence-based profiles of multiple test scores and history (emergence and persistence) were used to assign to groups without specific learning disabilities in written language (SLDs-WL; n = 42 control) or with SLDs-WL (n = 29 dysgraphia, n = 65 dyslexia, or n = 19 oral and written language learning disability [OWL LD]). Parent ratings fell in the clinical or at-risk ranges for some individuals in all groups, but mean BASC2 PRS ratings showed nine significant main effects for group (n = 4): Behavioral Symptoms Index, Internalizing Problems Composite, Adaptive Skills Composite, two Clinical Scales (Atypicality and Attention Problems), and four Adaptive Scales (Adaptability, Activities of Daily Living, Leadership, and Functional Communication). Each SLDs-WL group differed significantly from the control group on these nine ratings, except dysgraphia on Atypicality and dyslexia on Adaptive Composite, Adaptability, and Leadership; and each correlated with one or more hallmark impairments associated with a specific SLD-WL. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (without OWL LD), the dysgraphia and dyslexia groups, but not control group, showed connectivity with amygdala; BASC2 PRS Internalizing Problems Composite (internal stress) correlated with amygdala connectivity from two cortical regions involved in written word processing and production for total sample (N = 40). Applications to assessing emotional and behavioral correlates of SLDs-WL for educational services and future research are discussed.

AB BACKGROUNDWe examined factors associated with active commuting to school and the relationships of active commuting and physical activity to child- and teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in a sample of third graders.
   METHODSThe study sample consisted of 13,166 third graders enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999. Active commuters were children who walked to school and passive commuters were those who took the bus or were driven. Linear analyses evaluated differences in behavior problems by school commute, physical activity, and sports team participation after adjusting for sociodemographic, regional, and neighborhood factors.
   RESULTSOverall, 11% of children actively commuted. Type of commute differed by sociodemographics, region, urbanicity, school type, and neighborhood safety. Active commuters had less general physical activity participation and sports team participation. Commuting type and general physical activity were not associated with behavior problems, but sports team participation was associated with fewer child-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors as well as fewer teacher-reported internalizing behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONSOur findings demonstrate the ongoing need for creating and maintaining physical activity programs (such as sports teams) among school-aged children to optimize children's overall health and well-being.

AB In this study, cross-lagged longitudinal modeling was used to examine associations between teacher child relationship quality and children's behavioral adjustment in a sample of sixth grade ethnic minority children. In comparison to previous cross-lagged studies, children were older and cross informant models were used. Both teachers (N = 12) and children (N = 226) reported on the relationship quality (Closeness, Conflict, and Dependency or Negative Expectations), and children's behavioral adjustment (Externalizing Problems, Internalizing Problems, and Prosocial Behavior) at the beginning and the end of the school year. Children's externalizing behavior at the beginning of the school year was consistently and positively associated with conflict at the end of the school year. Interestingly, dependency at time 1 was associated with children's behavioral adjustment at time 2, whereas for closeness and conflict associations were the other way around (i.e., children's behavior at time 1 was associated with teacher-child closeness and conflict at time 2). Taken together, our results seem to indicate that bidirectional associations between teacher-child relationships and behavioral adjustment apply to older, ethnic minority children as well.

AB With many of today's youth utilizing technology to bully their peers, there is a need to better understand both predictors and consequences of cybervictimization. However, few researchers have employed a multi-level approach to jointly identify potential individual (e.g., gender) and school-level (e.g., urbanicity) predictors of cybervictimization, or examined a range of psycho social and adjustment outcomes. The current study used survey data from 28,583 students from 58 high schools to explore the risk factors associated with cybervictimization. We also examined the association between cybervictimization and adjustment outcomes (e.g., psychological, academic), as well as a possible moderators (e.g., student connectedness) that may buffer youth from these negative outcomes. Self-report measures assessed experiences with cybervictimization, adjustment problems, and student connectedness using previously validated measures. A series of two-level hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that females, underclassman, and those who are traditionally victimized or were perpetrators of cyberbullying were at significantly increased risk of cybervictimization. Cybervictimization was also associated with an increased risk of psychological (internalizing problems, sleep problems, stress problems) and academic (truancy, poor grades) adjustment problems. However, student connectedness buffered the internalizing problems experienced by victims of cyberbullying. These findings extend prior research on cybervictimization predictors, outcomes, and buffers, and in turn inform the potential use of school-based efforts aimed at preventing cyberbullying.

AB The current study aimed to investigate the moderation effects of coping strategies on the association between perceived peer victimization and psychological distress including loneliness and depression. Applying the person-context fit developmental model, this research hypothesized that adaptive coping strategies, which are normative in Taiwan's culture (i.e., social support seeking), would buffer the link between peer victimization and psychological distress (i.e., depression and loneliness) in comparison with the culturally non-normative coping (i.e., problem solving strategies). We also expected maladaptive coping strategies (i.e., internalizing strategies) would exacerbate the link between peer victimization and psychological distress. A latent interaction model was conducted with a sample of 730 Taiwanese adolescents attending one middle school. The results indicated that both support seeking strategies and problem-solving strategies buffered Taiwanese adolescents from loneliness and depression. Internalizing coping strategies placed Taiwanese adolescents at great risk of depression and loneliness. Support seeking strategies that are aligned with interdependent cultural contexts appeared to have greater protective effects than the culturally non-normative problem-solving strategies for adolescents who perceived high levels of victimization. The implications for prevention and intervention were discussed.

AB Purpose: To investigate the associations of physical activity intensity and modified organized sport with cognitive (i.e., executive functions) and psychosocial development in preschoolers.
   Methods: Preschool children (n = 247; 4.2 +/- 0.6 years) had their physical activity intensity (light: LPA; moderate: MPA; vigorous: VPA; moderate-to-vigorous: MVPA) and total physical activity (TPA) objectively measured using accelerometery, and parents reported children's participation in sport. Direct assessment of children's executive functions (working memory, inhibition and shifting) and educator-reported psychosocial difficulties were also collected. Associations were examined using linear regression adjusting for covariates and preschool clustering.
   Results: LPA was negatively associated with children's visual-spatial working memory (b = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01, p = 0.02) while a positive association with VPA approached significance (b = 0.04; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.09, p = 0.08) but was relatively weak. Higher VPA (b = -0.17; CI: -0.28, -0.06, p = 0.01) was associated with fewer internalizing behavior problems. However, more externalizing behavior problems was associated with MPA (b = 0.30; CI: 0.02, 0.58, p = 0.03), weakly associated with VPA (b = 0.31; CI: -0.05, 0.68, p = 0.09), and moderately associated with MVPA (b = 0.18; CI: 0.00, 0.36, p = 0.05). Participation in modified organized sport was associated with higher shifting performance (M-diff = 2.17; CI: 0.91, 144, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Decreasing LPA, increasing VPA and supporting participation in organized sport may be viable targets for cognitive and psychosocial development in preschool children. Longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AB Over half of all youth are exposed to violence, which a growing body of literature suggests is associated with a broad range of negative developmental outcomes over the life course. However, best practices for supportingparenting are not widely applied to parents with children exposed to violence-related trauma. This meta-analyses seeks to synthesize the literature base of trauma-informed parenting interventions to better understand their potential impact on parenting and child outcomes. Specifically, 21 trauma-informed parenting interventions were identified that quantitatively assessed intervention effects on parenting and child outcomes. Six meta-analyses were conducted to assess intervention effects on (1) positive parenting practices, (2) negative parenting practices, (3) parenting stress, (4) children's internalizing problems, (5) children's externalizing problems, and (6) trauma symptoms, respectively. Moderate to large effect sizes were found for positive parenting practices (d=0.62) as well as child internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and trauma symptoms (d=0.48-0.59). Validity tests indicated robust findings for positive parenting and for all child outcomes. Additional moderator analyses support the importance of informed intervention design, showing differential findings by trauma type as well as by duration of the intervention. These findings indicate the value of evidence-based parenting interventions for violence-related trauma and support models of trauma-informed care that situate treatment in the broader social context, particularly the family. Results are discussed with respect to which parenting practices hold the most promise for supporting children exposed to violence-related trauma.

AB Purpose: The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act requires child welfare agencies to have provisions in place to refer young children to early intervention services, yet the socioemotional health needs of children are often challenging to recognize and treat effectively. This study reviews the substantive and psychometric properties of screening instruments designed for children ages 10 and younger.
   Methods: Major social science databases, websites of national organizations, and the Mental Measurements Yearbook were used to identify instruments for review.
   Results: Twenty-four instruments met review criteria, and eight show above-average measurement properties and testing, tap children's strengths and concerns, and have evidence of validity with families similar to child welfare-involved families.
   Discussion: It is important to effectively screen for children showing concerns in early childhood, so that treatment and prevention can be prioritized. This study indicated several tools with adequate testing and with emerging evidence and applicability to child welfare.

AB Study Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine the association of abnormal periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) with neurocognitive and behavioral outcomes in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from the general population.
   Methods: Four hundred twenty-one adolescents (17.0 +/- 2.3 years, 53.9% male) from the Penn State Child Cohort, a random general population sample, underwent 9 hr polysomnography, clinical history, physical examination, neurocognitive evaluation, and completed the Child or Adult Behavioral Checklist (C/ABCL). The presence of ADHD was ascertained by parent-or self-report of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD. PLMS were defined as a PLM index (PLMI) of >= 5 events per hour of sleep.
   Results: Adolescents with ADHD (n = 98) had a significantly higher PLMI (5.4 +/- 7.3) and prevalence of PLMS (35%) when compared with controls (3.4 +/- 5.6, p = 0.006 and 21%, p = 0.004). Significant interactions between ADHD and PLMS showed that adolescents with both disorders (n = 35) were characterized by deficits in control interference, as measured by Stroop test, and elevated internalizing behaviors, as measured by C/ABCL. ADHD severity and externalizing behaviors were elevated in a dose-response manner across ADHD-alone (n = 63) and ADHD + PLMS groups. The association of ADHD with other neurocognitive functions did not vary as a function of PLMS.
   Conclusions: PLMS are significantly more frequent in adolescents with ADHD. Importantly, adolescents with both disorders not only have worse neurobehavioral functioning than adolescents with ADHD-alone but specifically presented with executive deficits and anxiety symptoms. These data suggest that PLMS may be a marker of more severe underlying neurobiological deficits in adolescents with ADHD and comorbid internalizing problems.

DT Article
ID MODIFIED SCALE; VALIDITY; YOUTH; RISK; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; ATTEMPTERS
AB The present study examined a conceptual model in which the association between aggressive behaviors and suicide ideation is moderated by internalizing symptoms and ongoing stress. Participants were 304 psychiatric inpatient adolescents (65.8% girls) ranging in age from 12 to 17 years (Mean age = 14.69). The association between aggressive behaviors and suicide ideation was significantly moderated by internalizing symptoms and ongoing stress; the association was positive in adolescents low in internalizing symptoms or high in ongoing stress, but negative in adolescents high in internalizing symptoms or low in ongoing stress. The three-way interaction between aggressive behaviors, internalizing symptoms, and ongoing stress was not statistically significant. The current findings indicate that in adolescents who display high levels of aggressive behaviors, the presence of high ongoing stress provides a more useful indicator of levels of suicide ideation than the presence of high internalizing symptoms. Implications for case identification and prevention are discussed.

AB The current study examined the relationship between college students' perception of cohesive-flexible family functioning and anxiety and depression and whether positive family communication and self-compassion mediated this relationship. Gender differences among these relationships were also explored. Five hundred college students from a southeastern public university completed an online survey (78% females, 46% Caucasian, 55% 18-19 years old). Multiple-sample latent structural equation modeling analyses revealed that cohesive-flexible family functioning was related to higher levels of positive communication, positive communication was related to higher levels of self-compassion, and that higher levels of self-compassion were related to lower levels of depression and anxiety. Positive communication and self-compassion mediated the relationship between cohesive-flexible family functioning and anxiety and depression. Moderation analyses revealed no significant differences between males and females. Implications for practitioners who work with college students are discussed.

AB Background: Impulsivity is widely assessed with a 30 item self-report measure known as the Barrratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Further development involved creation of an abbreviated version, called Barratt Impulsiveness Scale- short form (BIS-15; Spinella, 2007) from the original BIS-11. Unlike the original BIS-11, BIS-15 has not undergone sufficient cross cultural validation especially among the adolescent population.
   Aim: To evaluate the factor structure and psychometric properties of BIS-15 among school and college attending Indian adolescents.
   Method: A total of 1806 adolescents (females = 48%, mean age = 17.14 years) completed BIS-15 questionnaire, strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) and a risk taking questionnaire that assessed adolescents level of involvement in two protypical risky behaviours- substance use and unsafe sexual behaviours.
   Results: The results of the principal component analysis of BIS-15 items revealed a three factor structure: attentional, motor and non-planning impulsivity. The internal consistency of BIS-15 was 0.79. The total score on BIS-15 was significantly associated with the externalizing, internalizing and total difficulty score on SDQ. Significant associations were observed between BIS-15 total impulsivity score and the level of risk taking among adolescents. Further, the results also revealed gender variance in impulsivity scores where male adolescents scored higher on attentional and non-planning impulsivity as compared to female adolescents.
   Conclusion: BIS-15 is a reliable measure of impulsivity that can be used with Indian adolescent population. It would be particularly more suitable for use in settings that require comprehensive assessment of trait impulsivity in shorter time duration and without burdening the participants.

AB This study explored the unique contributions of students' self-reported internalizing behaviors (shyness, anxiety, and emotional problems) to teachers' perceptions of the quality of student-teacher relationships (closeness, conflict, and dependency). In total, 269 third-to-sixth grade students (50.9% girls) and 35 teachers (74.7% females) from 8 Dutch regular elementary schools participated in this study. Teachers filled out questionnaires about their background characteristics and the affective quality of their relationship with individual students, and students answered questions about their demographics and internalizing behaviors. Multilevel models revealed significant negative associations of student-perceived shyness with teacher-perceived closeness and conflict in the student-teacher relationship. Additionally, students' anxiety was positively associated with conflict and dependency in the relationship. Students' emotional problems, however, were not associated with student-teacher relationship quality. These findings suggest that different types of internalizing student behavior may play a differential role in the quality of the student-teacher relationship.

AB Repetitive cognition, including rumination such as that seen in depression, has been shown to correlate with depression symptoms in both typically developing individuals and individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Repetitive cognition is more common in autism spectrum disorder than in typically developing peers, as is depression; thus, this study evaluated the role of repetitive cognition in relation between autism spectrum symptomatology and depressive symptomatology. In all, 200 typically developing adults completed self-report questionnaires measuring autism spectrum symptomatology, different forms of repetitive cognition (general perseveration and depressive rumination), depression, and rejection sensitivity. Perseveration was found to mediate the relation between autism spectrum symptoms and depression, and to partially mediate the relation between autism spectrum symptoms and rejection sensitivity. We conclude that it is of vital importance to consider cognition when considering depression in autism spectrum disorder.

AB Young people with autism spectrum disorder experience high levels of emotional problems, including anxiety and depression. Adapted cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended for such difficulties. However, no evidence suggests whether emotion awareness is important in treatment outcome for young people on the autism spectrum. This study aimed to investigate the potential differences in emotion awareness between (1) young people on the autism spectrum and typically developing youth and (2) young people on the autism spectrum with and without experience of cognitive behavioural therapy. Three groups (aged 11-20years) participated: (1) typically developing young people (n = 56); (2) young people on the autism spectrum with no experience of cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 23); and (3) young people on the autism spectrum who had attended cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 33). All participants completed the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire-30 item version. Young people on the autism spectrum differed significantly from typically developing young people on the emotional awareness measure. Young people on the autism spectrum who had attended cognitive behavioural therapy scored significantly lower on the Differentiating Emotions subscale, and significantly higher on the Attending to Others' Emotions subscale, compared to young people on the autism spectrum who had not attended cognitive behavioural therapy. This study highlights the importance of psycho-educational components of cognitive behavioural therapy when adapting for young people on the autism spectrum.

AB The purpose was to examine the cross-sectional associations of stress-related reports and stress biomarkers with metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk in children while also testing the interaction between stress biomarkers and stress reports. In 353 children (5-10years old, 7.9% overweight/obese), MetS risk was measured by blood pressure, waist circumference, glucose homeostasis, triglycerides, and high-density cholesterol. Stress was measured by stress-related reports (events, emotions, and internalizing/externalizing problems) and two biomarkers: salivary cortisol (total-day and morning output) and heart rate variability (percentage of consecutive normal RR intervals differing more than 50ms and low-to-high-frequency ratio). Cross-sectional regression analyses with z scored total MetS risk as outcome were adjusted for age, sex, and socio-economic status. Only internalizing problems were directly related to a higher MetS risk score (=0.236). Cortisol and heart rate variability were significant moderators: High cortisol morning output resulted in a positive (unfavourable) report-MetS relationship (=0.259-0.552), whereas low percentage of consecutive normal RR intervals differing more than 50ms resulted in a negative (favourable) report-MetS relationship (=-0.298) and low low-to-high-frequency ratio in a positive (unfavourable) report-MetS relationship (=0.478). In conclusion, stress can sometimes be a disadvantageous factor in metabolic health of otherwise healthy children. The cortisol biomarker seems relevant because metabolic risk was highest when stress-related reports were accompanied by high morning cortisol output.

AB Children of substance abusing parents are at heightened risk to develop problem behaviors, yet little is known about the co-occurring patterns of internalizing and externalizing behaviors among this population. With 183 children (M age = 11.54 years, SD = 2.55, range 8-16) whose mothers were diagnosed with a substance use disorder, the current study identified subgroups/classes of children that were clinically distinct in their co-occurring patterns of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and examined how children in different clinical subgroups responded to a family systems intervention. Latent class analyses identified four classes of internalizing and externalizing behaviors: internalizing only, externalizing only, comorbid, and normative. Latent transition analyses showed that participation in family systems therapy resulted in an increased likelihood of transitioning from the externalizing class at baseline to the normative class at 18 months post-baseline, and from the comorbid class at baseline to the internalizing class at 18 months post-baseline as well. The findings support the effectiveness of family systems therapy in interrupting the stability of children's problem behaviors and improving children's behavioral outcomes.

AB This meta-analytic study systematically investigates the relations between perceived racial/ethnic discrimination and socioemotional distress, academics, and risky health behaviors during adolescence, and potential variation in these relations. The study included 214 peer-reviewed articles, theses, and dissertations, with 489 unique effect sizes on 91,338 unique adolescents. Random-effects meta-analyses across 11 separate indicators of wellbeing identified significant detrimental effects. Greater perceptions of racial/ethnic discrimination were linked to more depressive and internalizing symptoms; greater psychological distress; poorer self-esteem; lower academic achievement and engagement; less academic motivation; greater engagement in externalizing behaviors, risky sexual behaviors, and substance use; and more associations with deviant peers. Metaregression and subgroup analyses indicated differences by race/ethnicity, Gender X Race/Ethnicity interactions, developmental stage, timing of retrospective measurement of discrimination, and country. Overall, this study highlights the pernicious effects of racial/ethnic discrimination for adolescents across developmental domains and suggests who is potentially at greater risk.

AB Peer victimization leads to a number of negative developmental outcomes. Although many studies have explored cyber victimization impacts in adolescent samples, few have analyzed unique negative consequences in relation to younger children. To that end, the purpose of the present study is to examine the associations between cyber victimization and internalizing problems, alone and in combination with traditional victimization. Using a sample of 3rd through 5th grade students, structural equation modeling results reveal that traditional victimization was significantly related to depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and lower self-esteem; however, cyber victimization was not related to any of these outcomes of interest. Several gender and grade level differences were also found. Although a notable portion of the sample reported exposure to cyber victimization, traditional forms of victimization were more common. Implications for school-based prevention and intervention efforts are discussed.

AB The present study aims to explore the clustered nature in problem behaviors of victims of school bullying and how the problem behavior patterns are associated with intrapersonal and interpersonal resources. Using a wave of cross-sectional data from rural China, 262 victims (aged 12 to 16) were identified through the Olweus Bully/ Victim Questionnaire. Based on the nomination of twelve local experienced teachers and social workers, a list containing ten problem behaviors was compiled. Latent class modeling was applied to examine the latent structure of victims' problem behaviors. Three latent groups were identified according to the list, namely the externalizing and internalizing behaviors group (Class 1), the internalizing behaviors group (Class 2), and the less-affected group (Class 3). The associations between problem behavior patterns and intrapersonal and interpersonal resources were tested using multinomial regression modeling. We found that higher depressive symptoms, lower self-efficacy, not living with parents, and fewer helpful friends were associated with more likelihood of falling into the Class 1 and/or the Class 2, while perceived supports from teachers did not predict the problem behavior patterns of victims of school bullying. Results of the present study shed lights on the patterns of problem behaviors of victims in the developing world, providing a useful baseline from which future studies can further explore interventions for victims of school bullying with different patterns of problem behaviors.

AB Objective: To review the literature regarding the effects of caregiver depression on childhood asthma and integrate the findings into a multilevel model of pathways by which these effects occur to further the understanding of the complex biopsychosocial nature of childhood asthma and the key role that is played by caregiver depression.
   Data Sources: PubMed was searched for articles published from 2007 to the present (10-year search), and Google Scholar was searched for articles published in 2017 and 2018 to identify the most recent publications.
   Study Selections: Studies selected were recent, empirical, or meta-analytic, conducted in humans, and had specific relevance to one or more of the identified pathways. Articles published before 2007 were included if deemed essential because they addressed key pathways, for which there were no more recent articles.
   Results: Review of the literature substantiates that caregiver depression plays a key role in the socioeconomic, familial, psychological, and biological cascade of effects on childhood asthma. Childhood asthma outcomes are affected indirectly by socioeconomic status and family stress mediated by caregiver depression, which affects disease management, and/or stress and depression in the child, which, in turn, affect asthma through alterations in immune modulation and autonomic regulation.
   Conclusion: Findings indicate that future research should concentrate on mediators and moderators to further clarify the complex interplay of these factors that affect childhood asthma. The findings also have substantial translational implications. Given that child stress and depression contribute to asthma disease activity and that treating caregiver depression improves child stress and depression, there is strong rationale for treating depressed caregivers of children with asthma as a component means of improving childhood asthma control.

AB This study examined how having a relationship with God served as a protective factor between racial stigma beliefs and psychological well-being. A church sample of African American adolescent girls (N = 117, M (age)= 15) completed measures on racial stigma, psychological well-being, and reports on having a relationship with God. After controlling for adolescent age, family income, and church attendance, positive racial beliefs and having a relationship with God were associated with a healthier psychological well-being. Findings also revealed that having a relationship with God and internalizing healthier racial beliefs were associated with a healthier psychological well-being, whereas reporting higher levels of having a relationship with God served as a protective factor for African American girls when internalizing moderate levels of racial stigma. Overall, results suggest that having a relationship with God can serve as a coping mechanism and promote a healthier psychological well-being for African American adolescent girls.

AB Background: Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is distinct from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder inattention (ADHD-IN) and concurrently associated with a range of impairment domains. However, few longitudinal studies have examined SCT as a longitudinal predictor of adjustment. Studies to date have all used a relatively short longitudinal time span (6 months to 2 years) and only rating scale measures of adjustment. Using a prospective, multi-method design, this study examined whether SCT and ADHD-IN were differentially associated with functioning over a 10-year period between preschool and the end of ninth grade. Methods: Latent state-trait modeling determined the trait variance (i.e. consistency across occasions) of SCT and ADHD-IN across four measurement points (preschool and the end of kindergarten, first grade, and second grade) in a large population-based longitudinal sample (N = 976). Regression analyses were used to examine trait SCT and ADHD-IN factors in early childhood as predictors of functioning at the end of ninth grade (i.e. parent ratings of psychopathology and social/academic functioning, reading and mathematics academic achievement scores, processing speed and working memory). Results: Both SCT and ADHD-IN contained more trait variance (Ms = 65% and 61%, respectively) than occasion-specific variance (Ms = 35% and 39%) in early childhood, with trait variance increasing as children progressed from preschool through early elementary school. In regression analyses: (a) SCT significantly predicted greater withdrawal and anxiety/depression whereas ADHD-IN did not uniquely predict these internalizing domains; (b) ADHD-IN uniquely predicted more externalizing behaviors whereas SCT uniquely predicted fewer externalizing behaviors; (c) SCT uniquely predicted shyness whereas both SCT and ADHD-IN uniquely predicted global social difficulties; and (d) ADHD-IN uniquely predicted poorer math achievement and slower processing speed whereas SCT more consistently predicted poorer reading achievement. Conclusions: Findings of this study - from the longest prospective sample to date - provide the clearest evidence yet that SCT and ADHD-IN often differ when it comes to the functional outcomes they predict.

AB Purpose Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) has been shown to potentially affect psychological adjustment. However, most research has focused on females, and knowledge about psychological challenges in males remains sparse. The aim of this systematic review was therefore to assess these in males with CAH.
   Methods We systematically searched the OVID Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases, for articles published up to April 20, 2018, investigating psychological adjustment in males with CAH.
   Results Eleven studies were included in the review. Three main health domains were identified: psychological and psychiatric health, quality of life (QoL), and self-perceptions of reproductive health. Some studies covered more than one health domain. Seven studies explored psychological adjustment and/or the presence of psychiatric symptoms or disorders. Results indicated that males with CAH had more problems related to internalizing behaviors (negative behaviors directed toward the self) and more negative emotionality compared to reference groups. Six studies examined QoL, five of them reporting reduced QoL compared to reference groups. Three studies explored the impact of fertility and sexual health issues on psychological health with varying results from impaired to normal sexual well-being.
   Conclusions CAH seems to have an impact on males' psychological health. However, the number of identified studies was limited, included few participants, and revealed divergent findings, demonstrating the need for larger studies and highlighting a number of methodological challenges that should be addressed by future research.

AB Objective: Effects are reported of the Family Bereavement Program (FBP) on the mental health of bereaved youth and their surviving parent 15 years following the program. Method: On-hundred and 56 families (244 children ages 8-16; 54% male; 67% Non-Hispanic White) were randomly assigned to receive either the FBP (N = 90) or a literature control condition (N = 66). At the 15-year follow-up 80% of the youth and 76% of the bereaved parents were reinterviewed. Mental health problems and service use were self-reported by young adults and their parents. Key informants reported on mental health problems of young adults. Results: Young adults in the FBP reported significantly less use of mental health services and of psychiatric medication than controls. Key informants reported significantly lower mental health problems for young adults who were in FBP as compared with controls and for those who were younger lower internalizing and externalizing problems for those in the FBP as compared with controls. Bereaved parents reported a significantly lower rate of alcoholism and less use of support groups than controls. Conclusions: The results provided evidence that FBP led to lower mental health problems and less service use by bereaved young adults and their parents as compared with controls.

AB AimThe aims of this study were to evaluate user characteristics and the perceived usefulness of a set of online parenting guidelines to prevent adolescent depression and anxiety.
   MethodsUpon downloading the online guidelines, users were invited to complete a brief demographic survey assessing user characteristics (Survey 1). Consenting respondents were emailed an evaluation survey 1 month later, which assessed perceived usefulness of the guidelines (Survey 2).
   ResultsOver 22 months, 2631 users completed Survey 1 and 233 completed Survey 2. Most users endorsed the usefulness of the guidelines, and most parent users reported at least a little improvement on their parenting. Users were favourable towards a web-based parenting program as one way to improve the guidelines.
   ConclusionsFindings suggest that the online guidelines may be a useful and sustainable universal prevention strategy for parents of adolescents.

AB This study examined in a cross-cultural context the prospective relation between children's emotion knowledge and internalizing problems. European American (N=33) and immigrant Chinese children (N=22) and their mothers participated. Children's emotion knowledge was assessed at three-and-a-half years of age using a task to elicit their understanding of situational antecedents of discrete emotions. Mothers reported on children's internalizing problems using the Behavior Assessment System Children (BASC) when children were seven years of age. The relation of children's emotion knowledge to internalizing problems was moderated by culture. Whereas early emotion knowledge was associated with decreased internalizing problems later on for European American children, it was associated with increased internalizing problems for immigrant Chinese children. The findings shed critical light on the different functional meanings of emotion knowledge across cultures.

AB Objective: Treatment of maternal depression with psychotherapy has been shown to confer indirect benefits to school-age offspring with psychiatric disorders. The current study sought to understand mechanisms by which improvement in depressed mothers, with and without histories of trauma and treated with psychotherapy, produce changes in children who struggle with psychiatric illnesses themselves. We hypothesized that maternal history of childhood trauma would moderate the relationship between maternal and child outcomes and that increased positive and decreased negative parenting behaviors would mediate the relationship between maternal and child outcomes. We also examined whether maternal history of trauma would moderate the mediational effects of parenting behaviors.
   Methods: Participants were dyads (n = 62) of mothers with major depressive disorder and their children, ages 718, with at least one internalizing disorder. Mothers were treated with nine sessions of psychotherapy and children were treated openly in the community. Dyads were evaluated every three months over one year.
   Results: Maternal improvement in depressive symptoms was associated, in a lagged fashion, with child improvement in functioning six months later. There was a significant interaction of time and change in maternal symptoms [F(1, 45) = 5.84, p = 0.02], where change in maternal depressive symptoms from baseline to six months was robustly associated with change in child functioning from baseline to 12 months (beta = 0.49,p = 0.0002). Maternal history of childhood sexual abuse moderated the association between change in maternal and child depressive symptoms [F(1,87) = 5.8, p = 0.02], and maternal history of physical neglect moderated the relationship between improvement in maternal depression and improvement in child functioning [F(136) = 4.34, p = 0.04], where significant associations between maternal and child outcomes were only found in mothers without histories of sexual abuse or physical neglect. Increase in positive parenting strategies (acceptance) by mothers mediated 6-month lagged associations between maternal and child outcomes, but reduction in negative parenting strategies (psychological control) did not. Maternal history of childhood emotional neglect moderated the mediational model, such that improved positive parenting did not explain lagged improvement in child depression among the subset of mothers with childhood histories of emotional neglect.
   Conclusions: In dyads comprised of depressed mothers and school-age children with internalizing disorders, children improved when mothers improved, but not among those whose mothers who had histories of sexual abuse or physical neglect. Increased use of positive parenting strategies among mothers accounted for lagged relationships between improvement in maternal depressive symptoms and improvement in child functioning. This pattern was not, however, observed among mothers with childhood histories of emotional neglect. Interventions that directly enhance positive parenting and more rapidly change these behaviors may hasten improvement in offspring. Offspring of depressed mothers with histories of early trauma are at high risk for poor outcomes, even when their mothers receive depression treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Symptoms of anxiety and depression are commonly comorbid and partially share a genetic etiology. Mean levels of anxiety and depression increase over the transition to adolescence, particularly in girls, suggesting a possible role of pubertal development in the activation of underlying genetic risks. The current study examined how genetic and environmental influences on anxiety and depression differed by chronological age and pubertal status. We analyzed composite scores from child self-reports and parent informant-reports of internalizing symptomology in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of 1,913 individual twins from 1,006 pairs (ages 8-20 years) from the Texas Twin Project. Biometric models tested age and pubertal status as moderators of genetic and environmental influences shared between and specific to anxiety and depression to determine whether etiology of internalizing symptomology differs across development as a function of age or puberty. Genetic influences did not increase as a function of age or puberty, but instead shared environmental effects decreased with age. In an exploratory model that considered the moderators simultaneously, developmental differences in etiology were reflected in genetic and environmental effects unique to depression. Results suggest that genetic variance in internalizing problems is relatively constant during adolescence, with environmental influences more varied across development.

AB This study examines the relationships between temperament traits (negative affectivity, extraversion and effortful control) and children's externalized and internalized behavioral problems. The sample was composed of 424 children from the ages of 3-6 years old (60% male). Use of a hierarchical regression analysis revealed direct and interactive effects. Specifically, reactive temperamental traits were found to predict behavioral problems in children: negative affect tended to increase externalizing problems, and extraversion tended to decrease internalizing problems. The regulative temperament trait ("effortful control") negatively predicted both internalizing and externalizing problems. To explore moderating effects, postaEurohoc analyses were conducted using the Johnson-Neyman technique with Hayes's PROCESS. Our analyses revealed that high levels of negative affect (characterized in our study by a higher load of anger or frustration than of fear or sadness) makes a significant and strong contribution to internalizing problems when effortful control reaches its highest levels. Thus, our results endure the protective role of extraversion as preventing the emergence of internalizing problems, and the protective role of effortful control as preventing the emergence of both, internalizing and externalizing, problems. The results also alert to the potential risk of a combination between high levels of effortful control and high levels of negative affect. Overall findings are discussed with regard to previous and future research.

AB Although the preventive role of self-efficacy for school bully has been well established, less is known as with the association between self-efficacy and problem behaviors adoption among children who are already school bully victims. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the clustered nature of problem behaviors among school bully victims and tested problem behavior clusters' association with self-efficacy using latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression. Participants included 262 Chinese rural students who were recognized as being regularly bullied while without bullying behaviors in school in the past 3 months (60.1% male, age range 12-16). We found that the victims could be categorized into three different groups according to their problem behaviors pattern, namely the "externalizing and internalizing behaviors" group, the "internalizing behaviors" group, and the "less-affected" group. After controlling for the covariates (i.e., gender, age, living arrangement, and relationship quality with father and mother), we found that higher self-efficacy indicated higher probability of falling into the group with relatively less negative influence from school bullying. We also found that gender, living arrangement, and relationship quality with mother were associated with bully victims' problem behaviors pattern. The comorbidity between and within childhood externalizing and internalizing behaviors and self-efficacy's association with different problem behavior patterns were discussed. The future research should test the causality between self-efficacy and problem behaviors of bully victims, as well as the effectiveness of self-efficacy enhancement intervention for victims adopting different problem behavior patterns.

AB The current study examined maternal support and maternal involvement as moderators of the association between exposure to community violence (ECV) and both violence-related and non-violence related stressors in adolescent males of color. The current study included 250 African American (61%) and Latino (39%) male adolescents from the Chicago Youth Development Study to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between community violence exposure, maternal support and involvement, and youth coping strategies. Neither maternal support nor maternal involvement were moderators of the association between ECV and coping, cross-sectionally or longitudinally. However, higher levels of both maternal support and involvement predicted lower levels of maladaptive coping with non-violence related stressors both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Maternal support and involvement were unrelated to coping with violence-related stressors. It was expected that these parenting variables would show a protective effect on the relationship with violence exposure and coping, but the results suggest that these parenting attributes have direct ameliorative effect on coping with non-violence-related stressors. However, this finding did not extend to coping with violence-related stressors, underscoring the traumatic nature of violence exposure and importance of specificity frameworks for conducting research on the impact of violence exposure.

AB Nationwide, there is a pressing need to develop more efficacious treatment regimens for reactively aggressive youth receiving inpatient psychiatric services. Identifying the relevant clinical characteristics of youth with reactive aggression is an important first step in this process. Past research findings and theoretical formulations have suggested that deficits in both social skills and emotional regulation abilities are significantly associated with the development of reactive aggression in children. Utilizing a highly aggressive child inpatient sample (65 males and 36 females) receiving crisis-stabilization services, we tested the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation statistically mediated the relationship between theory of mind deficits and reactive aggression. As hypothesized, results of bootstrapped mediational analyses indicated that theory of mind deficits were associated with higher levels of reactive aggression via the indirect influence of dysregulated affect. These findings suggest that intervention programs for reactively aggressive children should promote both theory of mind skills and emotion regulation abilities. Children that develop more thoughtful styles of perspective taking coupled with an enhanced ability to modulate their emotions may develop a greater ability to employ the rational conflict resolution skills that underlie peaceful social relationships.

AB Internalizing symptoms, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms are prevalent in adolescence. We examined the mediational role of two self-esteem dimensions, that is, level and contingency, in comprehensive models linking parenting to adolescent internalizing symptoms. Using a cross-sectional design, a large sample of secondary school students (N = 1958; 56.28% female; mean age = 15.31 years) completed questionnaires on maternal responsiveness, psychological control, conditional regard, as well as on their own self-esteem, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Analyses yielded both direct and indirect effects of adolescent-reported parenting on internalizing symptoms. More perceived responsiveness was uniquely associated with higher self-esteem level which, in turn, predicted less depressive and anxiety symptoms. Perceived conditional negative and positive regard and psychological control were uniquely related to self-esteem level (negative relations) and contingency (positive relations) which, in turn, predicted more internalizing symptoms. In general, our study supported the mediational role of self-esteem level and contingency in the link between parenting and internalizing symptoms. Whereas low self-esteem increased adolescents' vulnerability for both depressive and anxiety symptoms, high self-esteem contingency appeared as a unique vulnerability factor for anxiety symptoms.

AB We tested the accuracy of 2 parent-report tools, the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-35) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), to identify attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and distinguish complex (highly comorbid) cases in an urban, largely Latino pediatric practice. Spanish- and English-speaking parents of children aged 6 to 10 years completed a PSC-35 and CBCL at well visits. Those with CBCL Attention Problems Subscale (CBCL-APS) T scores 60 plus controls completed the diagnostic MINI-KID (Miniature International Neuropsychiatric Interview) for Children. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves quantified accuracy of both scales to distinguish ADHD from non-ADHD, and complex from simple ADHD. Two hundred and nine children were screened, and 41 completed diagnostic interviews. Both the CBCL-APS and PSC Attention Scale (PSC-AS) accurately identified ADHD; the CBCL-APS performed best (AUROC(CBCL_APS) = 0.837; AUROC(PSC_AS) = 0.728). The PSC Total and Internalizing Scores and the number of CBCL subscale elevations accurately distinguished complex from simple ADHD; the PSC Internalizing Score performed best (AUROC(PSC_TOTAL) = 0.700; AUROC(PSC_INT) = 0.817; AUROC(CBCL_SUBS) = 0.762).

AB The study examined family and teacher support as factors that can protect adolescents from internalized and externalized problems after exposure to community violence (ECV). Self-administered questionnaires were filled out by a sample of 1,832 Arab and Jewish Israeli high school students. The Arab adolescents reported significantly higher levels of community violence victimization, internalized problems, externalized problems, family support, and teacher support than the Jewish adolescents. The girls reported higher levels of internalized problems, and the boys reported higher levels of externalized problems. ECV predicted high levels of internalized and externalized problems, family support predicted low levels of internalized and externalized problems, and teacher support had no predictive role. Path analysis confirmed the significance of the relationships between ECV effects, support variables, and gender. The limitations of the study and implications of the findings for future research and for the development of family care and family intervention programs are discussed.

AB Building from the developmental and life course literature and the feminist pathways literature, we aim to detail when and how exposure to abuse in childhood shapes female offending trajectories. Using data from 470 female offenders in Australia, our analyses assess whether internalizing symptoms and drug use help explain the link between early abuse and later offending among females. We then examine whether these links are most acute for females who onset early and evidence chronic involvement in offending. In support of the feminist pathways model, we find evidence for a pathway from early abuse to internalizing symptoms to drug use and then offending. In addition, and in line with the life course literature, we also find important differences in how these risks unfold across women, depending particularly on age of onset and offending chronicity. We reflect on the implications of our findings for theory and intervention with respect to female offending.

AB Research suggests that neighborhood risks are associated with internalizing symptoms for adolescents high on temperament characteristics related to the behavioral inhibition system (BIS). However, it is unclear whether newer conceptualizations of theBIS distinguishing fear from anxiety operate similarly. Furthermore, it is unclear whether theBIS attenuates community violence exposure effects on externalizing problems. The current study examined whetherthe BIS or thefight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) moderated associations between community violence exposure and internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants were 367 urban African American adolescents who reported on temperament characteristics in grade 9, and community violence exposure and adjustment problems in grades 9 and 10. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that theFFFS, but not theBIS, moderated the association between community violence exposure and aggressive behavior. Grade 9 community violence exposure was positively associated with grade 10 aggression for adolescents low on FFFS, suggesting that theFFFS may partly differentiate community violence-exposed adolescents' aggressive behavior.

AB Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children under 8years of age, referred to as early-onset OCD, has similar features to OCD in older children, including moderate to severe symptoms, impairment, and significant comorbidity. Family-based cognitive behavioral therapy (FB-CBT) has been found efficacious in reducing OCD symptoms and functional impairment in children ages 5-8years with OCD; however, its effectiveness on reducing comorbid psychiatric symptoms in this same population has yet to be demonstrated. This study examined the acute effects of FB-CBT vs. family-based relaxation treatment over 14 weeks on measures of secondary treatment outcomes (non-OCD) in children with early-onset OCD. Children in the FB-CBT condition showed significant improvements from pre- to post-treatment on secondary outcomes, with a decrease in overall behavioral and emotional problems, internalizing symptoms, as well as overall anxiety symptom severity. Neither condition yielded significant change in externalizing symptoms. Clinical implications of these findings are considered.

AB Since after the second world war there has been an increasing number of studies investigating secular changes in adolescent mental health. Although no general trends could be outlined, the majority of studies show at least partial deterioration of psychological wellbeing from year 2000 on. Our study adds to this knowledge by exploring changes in self-declared emotional and behavioral problems in Poland, which is a part of post-communist Europe. In this paper, we compared responses on the Youth Self-Report by Polish 16-year-olds from 2000 and those from 2011. Two independent samples consisted of 259 (year 2000) and 185 (year 2011) 16-year-olds of both genders, drawn from randomized, normative, school-based groups. We analyzed linear, ordinal and binary logistic regression models. The results revealed that teenagers from 2011 reported more self-rated internalizing and total problems. Social and thought problems also rose significantly. Gender related time trends hint at a male increase in externalizing, aggressive behaviors and anxiety/depression. Caseness rose significantly in most scales with female gender being an additional risk factor for internalizing and total problems. No reduction in self-reported emotional and behavioral problems was detected.

AB We examined relations between objectively and subjectively assessed sleep and self-reported psychological distress from internalizing symptoms. Consistent with a health disparities perspective, ethnicity and subjective social status (SSS) were examined as moderators of these associations. Participants were 219 individuals (18-29 years old; 51% female) from diverse ethnic (55% non-Latino White, 27% Latino, and 18% other) and socioeconomic backgrounds. Individuals self-reported on their daytime sleepiness and actigraphs measured sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and variability in sleep onset time. Path models revealed that greater daytime sleepiness and variability in sleep onset time were more robustly related to distress from internalizing symptoms for Latinos and those with lower SSS. Other interactions emerged; longer sleep duration in conjunction with higher SSS related to less distress from internalizing symptoms. The results are novel and indicate that the consideration of ethnicity and socioeconomic position holds promise for better understanding sleep during emerging adulthood.

AB Intolerance of uncertainty (IU), the tendency to react negatively to uncertain situations, has been identified as an important cognitive component of anxiety disorders, yet little is known about its etiology. Links to temperament, particularly behavioral inhibition (BI), and insecure attachment have been proposed in the development of IU, but no prospective empirical investigation has been performed thus far. In the current study, attachment to caregiver and BI of 60 children were assessed at age 6, using observational measures. Mother's anxiety symptoms were assessed when participants were 14 years old. IU was reported by participants when they were 21 years old, as was neuroticism. Two types of insecure attachment (ambivalent and disorganized-controlling) and BI were positively related to IU over a 15-year span, even after controlling for participants' neuroticism and maternal anxiety. Attachment and BI had no significant interacting effect on the development of IU. Maternal anxiety was positively related to child BI and insecure attachment, but not IU. This study is the first to provide empirical support for a link between ambivalent and disorganized-controlling attachment and BI in preschool children to the development of IU in adulthood. Results have etiological and preventative implications not only for anxiety disorders but also for all disorders related to IU.

AB Studies have shown that early language difficulties are associated with later internalizing problems. Less is known about the nature of the association: the bidirectional relationship over time, the role of different types of language difficulties, and gender differences. The present study examined bidirectional longitudinal associations between parent-rated language difficulties and internalizing problems in a four-wave cross-lagged model from 18 months to 8 years. Data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study were used (N = 114,000). Gender-specific dichotomized language variables were created, and associations were investigated uniquely for boys and girls. Logistic regression analyses showed that all cross-lagged associations from 18 months to 5 years were significant for girls (odds ratios [ORs] = 1.48-1.94). For boys, only internalizing problems at 3 years predicted change in language difficulties (OR = 2.33). From 5 to 8 years, the cross-lagged associations between semantic language difficulties and internalizing problems were significant and strong for girls (ORs = 1.92-2.97) and nonsignificant for boys. The results suggest that the associations between language difficulties and internalizing problems are bidirectional from an early age, and that girls are especially vulnerable for developing co-occurring language difficulties and internalizing problems during the years of transition to school.

AB This study examined whether executive functions (EFs) might be common features of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems across development. We examined relations between three EF latent variables (a common EF factor and factors specific to updating working memory and shifting sets), constructed from nine laboratory tasks administered at age 17, to latent growth intercept (capturing stability) and slope (capturing change) factors of teacher- and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors in 885 individual twins aged 7 to 16 years. We then estimated the proportion of intercept-intercept and slope-slope correlations predicted by EF as well as the association between EFs and a common psychopathology factor (P factor) estimated from all 9 years of internalizing and externalizing measures. Common EF was negatively associated with the intercepts of teacher-rated internalizing and externalizing behavior in males, and explained 32% of their covariance; in the P factor model, common EF was associated with the P factor in males. Shifting-specific was positively associated with the externalizing slope across sex. EFs did not explain covariation between parent-rated behaviors. These results suggest that EFs are associated with stable problem behavior variation, explain small proportions of covariance, and are a risk factor that that may depend on gender.

   SAMPLE
AB Recent research has described the structure of psychopathology as including one general and multiple specific factors, and this structure has been found in samples across development. However, little work has examined whether this structure is consistent across time, particularly in young children, within the same sample. Further, few studies have examined factors that influence the magnitude of the stability of latent dimensions of psychopathology. In the present study, we examine these issues in a community sample of 545 children assessed at ages 3 and 6. In addition, we explored child temperament, parental history of psychopathology, and parenting behaviors as potential moderators of the longitudinal stability of latent dimensions of psychopathology. We found that the same bifactor model structure identified at age 3 provided an adequate fit to the data at age 6. Further, our model revealed significant homotypic stability of the general, internalizing, and externalizing specific factors. We also found evidence of differentiation of psychopathology over time with the general factor at age 3 predicting the externalizing factor at age 6. However, we failed to identify moderators of the longitudinal associations between psychopathology latent factors. Overall, our results bolster support for the bifactor structure of psychopathology, particularly in early childhood.

AB This study investigated the cross-lagged associations between teacher-student relationships and problem behaviors in a sample of 440 Finnish students (half of them identified as being at risk of reading difficulties). The degree to which these associations were moderated by a child's gender, academic performance, risk for reading difficulties, parental education, and having the same teacher over 2 years was examined. The teachers evaluated the students' problem behaviors and reported closeness and conflict with a particular student. The results showed that the higher the students scored on externalizing problems in Grade 4, the more conflict teachers reported 2 years later. Moderator analyses revealed that internalizing problems predicted higher levels of closeness for boys only. Conflict predicted internalizing problems among students who had the same teacher across the 2 years. The results emphasize the importance of investigating the transactional links in different subgroups.

AB This case study outlines the treatment of a 5-year-old Caucasian male who presented with symptoms of selective mutism (SM) along with significant impairment related to comorbid anxiety and speech difficulties. To address these symptoms, Integrated Behavior Therapy for Selective Mutism (IBTSM) was utilized for the treatment of this young boy's SM and comorbid anxiety. An attachment focus was incorporated as a framework for conceptualizing his SM symptoms. As the treatment of this young boy's symptoms proceeded, it became clear that his underlying speech difficulties needed to be addressed as well, as these difficulties were preventing expected progress to occur. Thus, this young boy's treatment was individualized to fit his unique difficulties. In shifting the treatment focus to "being brave like a superhero," significant decreases were achieved in this young boy's overall internalizing and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-related anxiety symptoms, facilitating a successful transition to speech and language therapy. This case study is distinctive in its description of the complexities that may come along with treating symptoms that appear consistent with SM along with other comorbid conditions and nuanced circumstances.

AB Various meta-analyses found that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral treatments (TF-CBT) are effective for children and adolescents with posttraumatic stress disorders. A TF-CBT-oriented treatment program for children (up to 10 years of age) and their relatives was developed including educational and play-orientated components using a narrative, which is named "Seafarers' Camp." The program comprised children's individual therapy (15 sessions, 50 min), children's group therapy (15 sessions, 100 min), relatives' training in a group format (10 sessions, 100 min), family counseling sessions at home, and children's physician examinations in a quarterly period. To examine the effectiveness of this treatment in comparison with effects of published German health-care studies and meta-analyses, we examined data from 47 children with posttraumatic disorders, who were between 5 and 13 years old (61.7% males), at pre- and posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up assessments. Main outcome measures were the self-rated posttraumatic and caregiver-rated phobic symptoms; secondary outcome measures were self-rated depressive complaints and quality of life as well as caregiver- and teacher-rated general behavioral problems. Children experienced various traumatic events, mostly severe forms of neglect (n = 9), sexual or physical abuse (n = 13), as well as the witnessing of violence (n = 15). The majority met the criteria of posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 25) and adjustment disorder (n = 8). Significant pre-to-posttreatment improvements were found in self-rated posttraumatic and caregiver-rated phobic symptoms, caregiver-and teacher-rated externalizing behavior, and caregiver-rated internalizing behavior. No significant improvements were found regarding other measures when adjusting the p-value cut-off for multiple testing. The effect sizes were moderate to high for the posttraumatic and phobic symptoms, with g* = 2.47 and 0.29 at posttreatment and g* = 1.53 and 0.56 at follow-up assessments. Response rates for both symptom groups were 70.4% and 19.2%; all individuals showed a remission of the posttraumatic symptoms in the posttreatment period. In addition, we found moderate effect sizes on caregiver-and teacher-rated general behavioral problems. Hence, the results are in agreement with findings in existing meta-analyses and German health-care studies, although younger children were included in the present study. The major limitation of the present study is the lack of a control condition and the participation of the program developers during the treatment run. The TF-CBT-orientated treatment program should be examined independently from the program developers in a randomized controlled trial, and the incremental effect of group therapy should be studied.

AB Background: Insecure attachment representations have been established as a vulnerability factor for postpartum depressive symptoms. However, there is a lack of studies on the effects of attachment (in) security on postpartum anxiety symptoms, and on the mechanisms through which attachment representations may affect women's postpartum adjustment, namely, emotion regulation difficulties.
   Methods: The sample included 450 women in the postpartum period (up to 12 months postpartum), who were recruited both online (advertisements on social media) and in person (study was presented by the researchers during the women's postpartum hospitalization).
   Results: Approximately one third of the women with clinically significant symptoms (33.3%) presented comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression, and these women presented more insecure attachment representations and more emotion regulation difficulties (p<.001) than did women without comorbid symptoms (p<.001). The relationship between more insecure attachment representations and depressive and anxiety symptoms occurred both directly and indirectly through emotional regulation difficulties.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study, the use of self-report questionnaires that do not allow the establishment of clinical diagnosis and the self-selected bias in recruitment were study limitations.
   Conclusions: The results underline the need for attention to anxiety symptomatology, which is a condition that co-occurs frequently in this period. Interventions that focus on promoting adaptive strategies of emotional regulation are relevant rather than more intensive interventions to change attachment representations.

AB Background: Since children and adolescents are frequently experiencing emotional and behavioral consequences due to pain, their parents should be aware of this emotional and behavioral status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze and describe the parents' reports of the emotional and behavioral status of children and adolescents with different types of temporomandibular disorders using the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Methods: This Cross-sectional study comprises of 386 randomly selected children and adolescents that ages between 10 and 18 years in Jeddah. One day prior the clinical examination according to Research Diagnostic Criteria for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) Axis I and II, Arabic version of the Child Behavior Checklist scale was distributed to the parents of participant. According to the diagnosis, the participants were divided into three groups; non-TMD group, TMD-pain group, and TMD-painfree group.
   Results: In regard to internalizing problems, the parents to the children and adolescents in the TMD-pain group rated a higher frequency of anxiety, depression and somatic complaints in their children than the parents of children in the non-TMD group (p < 0.05). Only one significant association regarding the externalizing problems was found for the aggressive behavior in the TMD-pain group.
   Conclusion: The parents rated that their children with TMD-pain suffer from emotional, somatic and aggressive behavior to a higher degree than healthy control subjects. Also, the parents believed that TMD-pain influenced their children's physical activities but not social activities.

AB School-aged children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are at greater risk for physical inactivity, lower global self-worth, and internalizing problems, such as depression and anxiety. Based on the environmental stress hypothesis (ESH), recent research has shown that physical inactivity and lower global self-worth sequentially mediate the relationship between DCD and internalizing problems, suggesting that DCD leads to lower levels of physical activity, which in turn leads to lower levels of global self-worth, and ultimately, a greater amount of internalizing problems. However, physical activity and global self-worth may also buffer (i.e., moderate) the adverse effect of DCD on internalizing problems. To date, this has yet to be tested. Participants were 1206 children aged 12-14 years [611 boys, 79 with probable DCD (pDCD)]. All children received assessments of motor coordination, physical activity, global self-worth, and internalizing problems. Children with pDCD were less physically active, had lower self-worth, and experienced more internalizing problems compared to typically developing (TD) children (p's < 0.05). Furthermore, the moderated moderating effect (three-way interaction) of physical activity and global self-worth was also evident (p < 0.05), indicating that internalizing problems in both TD and pDCD groups decreased with concurrent increases in physical activity and global self-worth. Importantly, when compared to TD children, increases in physical activity and global self-worth were associated with a greater reduction in internalizing problems among children with pDCD. The findings support several pathways in the ESH and highlight that, in addition to improving motor skills, interventions should also target both physical activity and global self-worth to mitigate potential mental health issues for children with motor difficulties.

AB Background: Studies reported adverse behavioral development including internalizing and externalizing problems in association with prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates; however, findings were not sufficient due to using different assessment tools and child ages among studies. This study aimed to examine associations between maternal serum levels of BPA and phthalate metabolites and behavioral problems at preschool age.
   Methods: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess behavioral problems at 5 years of age. BPA and phthalate metabolite levels in the first trimester maternal serum was determined by LC-MS/MS for 458 children. Variables used for adjustment were parental ages, maternal cotinine levels, family income during pregnancy, child sex, birth order, and age at SDQ completed.
   Results: The median concentrations of BPA, MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MECPP, primary and secondary metabolites of phthalates, were 0.062, 26.0, 7.0, 1.40, and 0.20 ng/ml, respectively. MECPP level was associated with increase conduct problem risk (OR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.36-5.68) overall and the association remained after child sex stratification, and odds ratios were increased with wider confidence interval (OR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.07-7.57 for boys, OR = 4.04, 95% CI 1.31-12.5 for girls, respectively). BPA, Sigma DBPm (MnBP + MiBP), and Sigma DEHPm (MEHP+MECPP) levels were not associated with any of the child behavioral problems.
   Conclusions: Our analyses found no significant association between BPA or summation of phthalate metabolite levels and any of the behavioral problems at 5 years of age but suggested possible association between MECPP levels and increased risk of conduct problems.

AB Background: Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a worldwide problem affecting children of all ages and socioeconomic backgrounds. A knowledge gap exists regarding the psychological outcomes for children, boys in particular, who are abused during their early lives.
   Objective: To provide a descriptive psychological profile of children who experienced sexual abuse as infants or toddlers from a male daycare worker and babysitter, and to assess the psychopathological impact on their parents.
   Method: Parents of children involved in the Amsterdam Sexual Abuse Case (41 parents; 44 children, age range 3-11 years, 30 boys, 14 girls) completed measures on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dissociation, sexual and non-sexual behaviour problems, and attachment insecurity in their children, as well as on parental psychological well-being, 3 years after disclosure. Sexual abuse characteristics were obtained from police records.
   Results: We found that 3% of confirmed child victims had PTSD, 30% sexual behaviour problems, 24% internalizing problems, 27% attachment insecurity, and 18% any psychiatric disorder (including PTSD); 39% were asymptomatic. In parents, we found feelings of guilt, shame, and anger about the abuse of their child; 19% showed PTSD symptoms and 3% showed avoidant and 8% anxious attachment problems in their intimate relationship. Parental symptomatology was related to child symptomatology, except for child sexual behaviour problems. One-quarter of confirmed child victims and 45% of parents had received psychological treatment.
   Conclusions: Three years after disclosure, extrafamilial CSA in very young children was associated with sexual and non-sexual behaviour problems and attachment insecurity, but rarely with PTSD or dissociation. For parents it was associated with PTSD symptoms and emotional reactions. Assessments and interventions should focus on the wide spectrum of problems that follow CSA, as well as on parental psychopathology and the parent-child relationship. Future follow-up assessments in our longitudinal study should provide insights into longer-term outcomes.

AB Background: This study aimed to examine the environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure at home and associated problem behaviors in Korean children and adolescents.
   Methods: Approximately 2,167 children aged 3-18 years were included in the study after excluding 163 active smokers from the Korean Environmental Health Survey in Children and Adolescents (2012-2014). ETS data were obtained using a questionnaire; problem behaviors were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist administered to parents. The relationship between ETS exposure and problem behavior was evaluated using a survey regression model adjusted for region, age, sex, income, and father's education. The population-attributable fraction (PAF%) was calculated based on problem behaviors related to ETS exposure at home.
   Results: The rates of ETS exposure at home were 20%, 28%, and 39 0 /o in children aged 3-5, 6-11, and 12-18 years, respectively; ETS exposure at home was associated with behavioral problems: the exposed group having higher total behavioral problem score (95% confidence interval [CI]) than the non-exposed by 2.46 (0.60-4.32) and 2.74 (0.74-4.74) in children aged 6-11 and 12-18 years, respectively, with no significant association in those aged 3-5 years. The PAF% (95% CI) of total problem behaviors for ETS exposure at home were 2.68 (-10.11-17.78), 10.66 (3.25-17.55), and 11.62 (3.03-18.96) in children aged 3-5, 6-11, and 12-18 years, respectively. Children with externalizing problems had higher PAF% than those with internalizing problems.
   Conclusion: In Korea, ETS exposure at home is associated with problem behaviors in children and adolescents with about more than 10% population attributable fraction.

AB Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), patients have an increased risk of psychiatric morbidity compared to their healthy counterparts. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the demographic and laboratory data and psychological characteristics of children with T1DM from two geographical regions of Turkey.
   The study included 98 pediatric T1DM patients followed in pediatric endocrinology clinics from Diyarbakir (n=50), an eastern city and Antalya (n=48) a western city, and 43 healthy subjects from Diyarbakir (n=20) and Antalya (n=23). The sociodemographic data, duration of diabetes and the glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) were also noted. For the evaluation of emotional and behavioral problems in children, Turkish version of The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 6-18, and for depression, Child depression inventory (CDI) was used.
   Patients from the Diyarbakir Diabetes Mellitus (DDM) group had a longer duration of diabetes compared to those of the Antalya Diabetes Mellitus (ADM) group, while HbA1c levels were not statistically different. Children with T1DM from Diyarbakir reported higher problem scores in CBCL in majority of domains and both internalizing and externalizing subscores compared to the controls and in all domains compared to the patients from Antalya. The CDI scores of the DDM group were also significantly higher than those of the ADM group.
   In conclusion, diabetic children from Diyarbakir had more problems in emotional, social and behavioral domains compared to the healthy peers and patients from Antalya, indicating that T1DM brought more psychosocial burden to these patients independently from the metabolic control. Pediatric specialists working in the eastern region should be more precautious with diabetic patients in terms of comorbid psychiatric conditions and psychiatric referral when needed.

AB Objective Executive functioning deficits have been documented among congenital heart disease (CHD) survivors and may contribute to emotional distress. Little research has investigated the role of coping in this association. This study examined the role of coping in accounting for the association between self-reported executive function problems and internalizing symptoms among adolescents and emerging adults (AEAs), as well as young adults (YAs) with CHD. Methods Participants included 74 AEA (M-age = 19.32 +/- 3.47 years, range 15-25 years) and 98 YA CHD survivors (M-age = 32.00 +/- 3.69 years, range 26-39 years), recruited from pediatric and adult outpatient cardiology clinics. Participants completed self-report measures of executive function problems, coping (primary control, secondary control, and disengagement coping), and internalizing symptoms. Lesion severity classification and functional impairment due to symptoms of heart failure were determined from medical chart review. Results Significant problems in executive function were reported by 5% of AEA and 13% of YA. Coping was not associated with executive function problems or internalizing symptoms for AEA. However, among YA, less use of adaptive coping strategies and more maladaptive coping responses was associated with both more executive function problems and internalizing symptoms. An indirect effect of executive function problems on internalizing symptoms via secondary control coping emerged for YA. Conclusions Executive function problems may disrupt the ability to use important adaptive coping skills, such as cognitive reappraisal, positive thinking, and acceptance, thereby resulting in greater emotional distress among YA CHD survivors.

AB Objective: To determine whether an internet-based and telephone-assisted parent training intervention, which used whole population screening and which comprehensively targeted symptomatic 4-year-old children, was effective 24 months after the start of treatment. No long-term follow-up studies using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) existed on this subject.
   Method: Of the 4,656 children 4 years old who were screened in Southwest Finland, 730 met the criteria for high-level disruptive behavioral problems, and 464 parents agreed to be randomized to the 11-week Strongest Families Smart Website (SFSW) intervention (n = 232) or an educational control (EC) (n = 232). After 24 months, 163 SFSW parents (70%) and 165 EC parents (71%) were still participating.
   Results: When we compared the results at baseline and 24 months, the primary outcome of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) externalizing score showed significantly higher improvements in the SFSW group (effect size 0.22; p < 0.001). This group also showed greater improvements in the secondary outcomes: the CBCL total and internalizing scales, 5 of the 7 CBCL symptom domains, 3 of the 5 DSM subscores, and self-reported parenting skills. Fewer SFSW children (17.5%) than EC children (28.0%) had been referred to child mental health services between baseline and 24 months (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-3.1).
   Conclusion: The SFSW internet-based and telephone-assisted parental training program was effective 24 months after initiation, underlining the value of identifying children at risk in the community early and providing evidence-based parent training for a large number of families.

AB Objective: Parental psychiatric symptoms can negatively affect the outcome of children's psychopathology. Studies thus far have mainly shown a negative effect of maternal depression. This study examined the associations between a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in mothers and fathers and the child's outcome.
   Method: Internalizing and externalizing psychiatric symptoms were assessed in 742 mothers, 440 fathers, and their 811 children at the first evaluation in 3 child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics and at follow-up (on average 1.7 years later). Predictions of child's symptoms scores were tested at follow-up by parental symptom scores at baseline, parental scores at follow-up, and offspring scores at baseline.
   Results: Children whose mother or father scored above the (sub)clinical threshold for psychiatric symptoms at baseline had higher symptom scores at baseline and at follow-up. Offspring follow-up scores were most strongly predicted by offspring baseline scores, in addition to parental psychiatric symptoms at follow-up. Offspring symptom scores at follow-up generally were not predicted by parental scores at baseline. Maternal and paternal associations were of similar magnitude.
   Conclusion: Higher symptom scores at follow-up in children of parents with psychopathology were mainly explained by higher symptom scores at baseline. Continuing parent offspring associations could be a result of reciprocal effects, ie, parental symptoms influencing offspring symptoms and offspring symptoms influencing parental symptoms. Nevertheless, the results show chat these children are at risk for persisting symptoms, possibly indicating the need to treat maternal and paternal psychopathology.

AB Objective: Parenting and pubertal timing have consistently been associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms in childhood and adolescence, and there is some evidence that the interaction between these factors may be important in conferring risk. However, few studies have investigated whether neurobiological factors mediate these relationships. The current study examined whether interactions between adrenarcheal timing and parenting styles were associated with affective brain function and, in turn, mental health difficulties.
   Method: Participants were 88 healthy children (46 female and 42 male, mean age 9.42 years, SD = 1.08 years), with 45 classified as relatively early and 43 as relatively late in adrenarcheal development based upon adrenal hormone levels. Participants completed an affective face functional magnetic resonance imaging task, and parents reported on 5 parenting styles and on child internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Results: Negative parenting styles (corporal punishment and poor monitoring) were associated with brain hemodynamic response while viewing affective faces in several subcortical and lateral prefrontal regions, and adrenarcheal timing and/or sex moderated most of these relationships. Sex differences in associations between corporal punishment and brain activation to affective faces indicated that late females might show less adaptive affective neural function when more exposed to this parenting style.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that the interaction between parenting styles and adrenarcheal timing is associated with affective brain function in late childhood, with marked sex differences. Further longitudinal research with larger samples is needed to corroborate and expand upon these findings.

AB In both child and adult psychiatry, empirical evidence has now accrued to suggest that a single dimension is able to measure a person's liability to mental disorder, comorbidity among disorders, persistence of disorders over time, and severity of symptoms. This single dimension of general psychopathology has been termed "p," because it conceptually parallels a dimension already familiar to behavioral scientists and clinicians: the "g" factor of general intelligence. As the g dimension reflects low to highmental ability, the p dimension represents low to high psychopathology severity, with thought disorder at the extreme. The dimension of p unites all disorders. It influences present/absent status on hundreds of psychiatric symptoms, which modern nosological systems typically aggregate into dozens of distinct diagnoses, which in turn aggregate into three overarching domains, namely, the externalizing, internalizing, and psychotic experience domains, which finally aggregate into one dimension of psychopathology from low to high: p. Studies show that the higher a person scores on p, the worse that person fares on measures of family history of psychiatric illness, brain function, childhood developmental history, and adult life impairment. A dimension of p may help account for ubiquitous nonspecificity in psychiatry: multiple disorders share the same risk factors and biomarkers and often respond to the sametherapies. Here, the authors summarizethehistory of the unidimensional idea, review modern research into p, demystify statistical models, articulate some implications of p for prevention and clinical practice, and outline a transdiagnostic research agenda.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate the preliminary structural, convergent, and incremental classification validity of responses to the Subjective Academic Problems Scale (SAPS), which is a seven-item self-report behavior rating scale intended for use as a triaging tool within secondary-level school mental health screening contexts. Findings from psychometric analyses carried out with Sample 1 (N = 177) indicated that responses to the SAPS were characterized by a unidimensional measurement model and that scores derived from the scale had convergent validity with scores from several other self-reported measures of student wellbeing and mental health problems. Results from analyses conducted with Sample 2 (N = 219) confirmed the unidimensionality of responses to the SAPS measurement model and demonstrated that SAPS scores had incremental validity, when used in conjunction with scores from a self-report internalizing problems screener, for identifying students with greater levels of mental health risk. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB The present population study aimed at identifying the prevalence of mental health problems (MHP) and describing health services use in a sample of children attending Primary Healthcare Units (PHU) in the city of Sao Paulo. Caregivers of 825 6-11 years old children were assessed. MHP were assessed with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and health services use with an adapted version of the Client Receipt Inventory Children's version. Prevalence of internalizing and externalizing MHP was 30.7% and 18.3%, respectively. Pediatricians were the most consulted health professional (56.7%) and psychologists the most consulted mental health professional (7.9%). Only 3 children were under medication treatment for MHP. The high prevalence of MHP among children in the primary care setting and the low rate of treatment constitute a public health problem. Training programs for health professionals are relevant to help identify and refer MHP cases.

AB Childhood aggression and its resulting consequences inflict a huge burden on affected children, their relatives, teachers, peers and society as a whole. Aggression during childhood rarely occurs in isolation and is correlated with other symptoms of childhood psychopathology. In this paper, we aim to describe and improve the understanding of the co-occurrence of aggression with other forms of childhood psychopathology. We focus on the co-occurrence of aggression and other childhood behavioural and emotional problems, including other externalising problems, attention problems and anxiety-depression. The data were brought together within the EU-ACTION (Aggression in Children: unravelling gene-environment interplay to inform Treatment and InterventiON strategies) project. We analysed the co-occurrence of aggression and other childhood behavioural and emotional problems as a function of the child's age (ages 3 through 16years), gender, the person rating the behaviour (father, mother or self) and assessment instrument. The data came from six large population-based European cohort studies from the Netherlands (2x), the UK, Finland and Sweden (2x). Multiple assessment instruments, including the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory (MPNI), were used. There was a good representation of boys and girls in each age category, with data for 30,523 3- to 4-year-olds (49.5% boys), 20,958 5- to 6-year-olds (49.6% boys), 18,291 7- to 8-year-olds (49.0% boys), 27,218 9- to 10-year-olds (49.4% boys), 18,543 12- to 13-year-olds (48.9% boys) and 10,088 15- to 16-year-olds (46.6% boys). We replicated the well-established gender differences in average aggression scores at most ages for parental ratings. The gender differences decreased with age and were not present for self-reports. Aggression co-occurred with the majority of other behavioural and social problems, from both externalising and internalising domains. At each age, the co-occurrence was particularly prevalent for aggression and oppositional and ADHD-related problems, with correlations of around 0.5 in general. Aggression also showed substantial associations with anxiety-depression and other internalizing symptoms (correlations around 0.4). Co-occurrence for self-reported problems was somewhat higher than for parental reports, but we found neither rater differences, nor differences across assessment instruments in co-occurrence patterns. There were large similarities in co-occurrence patterns across the different European countries. Finally, co-occurrence was generally stable across age and sex, and if any change was observed, it indicated stronger correlations when children grew older. We present an online tool to visualise these associations as a function of rater, gender, instrument and cohort. In addition, we present a description of the full EU-ACTION projects, its first results and the future perspectives.

AB Recognizing child sexual abuse (CSA) in children is difficult, as there can be many hurdles in the assessment of alleged CSA. With this paper, we try to improve the recognition of CSA by discussing: (1) the difficulties regarding this matter and (2) the diagnostic evaluation of alleged CSA, combining both practical clinical recommendations based on recent research. Children are restrained to disclose CSA due to various reasons, such as fears, shame, and linguistic or verbal limitations. Associations between CSA and urogenital or gastrointestinal symptoms, internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and atypical sexual behavior in children have been reported. However, these symptoms are non-specific for CSA. The majority of sexually abused children do not display signs of penetrative trauma at anogenital examination. Diagnosing a STI in a child can indicate CSA. However, other transmission routes (e.g., vertical transmission, auto-inoculation) need to be considered as well.
   Conclusion: The assessment consists of medical interview and child interview (parents and child separate and together) with special attention to the child's development and behavior (problems), psychosocial situation and physical complaints, the child's mental health, and the child's trauma history; anogenital examination should be done in all cases of alleged CSA. The examination should be documented by photo or video graphically. Recent research suggests that videography may be the preferred method, and testing on STIs. The assessment should be done multidisciplinary by experienced professionals. Health-care professionals who care for children need to know how child protective agencies and law enforcement are organized. In case there are concerns about a child's safety, the appropriate authorities should be alarmed.

AB Children with conduct problems are at greater risk for internalizing problems. The objectives of this study were to (1) examine trajectories of internalizing problems among children with and without clinically significant conduct problems during the transition to adolescence; and (2) identify how academic achievement, peer rejection, parent socioeconomic status, maternal distress, parental warmth, child temperament, and receptive verbal functioning explained differences between the two groups. Children with conduct problems (N = 388, 45% girls) and a comparison sample without conduct problems (N = 299, 52% girls) were recruited from Quebec, Canada, when they were between the ages of 7 and 10 years, and were followed across 4 years. Mothers and teachers provided information on internalizing problems each year. Having clinically significant conduct problems was associated with higher initial levels of internalizing problems according to mothers and teachers, but not with changes in internalizing problems over time. With regards to teacher ratings, academic achievement, peer rejection, and negative emotionality partially explained differences in internalizing problems for youth with and without conduct problems. For mother ratings, maternal distress, negative emotionality, and peer rejection completely explained the association for girls, and partially explained the association for boys. Findings supported a multi-rater approach for understanding risk for internalizing problems among children with and without conduct problems. In particular, they highlight the importance of differences across context for understanding factors associated with vulnerability to internalizing problems.

AB Objective: To evaluate the association of intimate partner violence during the gestational period and the development of externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems in children and adolescents.
   Source of data: A meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies was performed, using studies selected from electronic databases. Eligible studies included women who experienced intimate partner violence during pregnancy and their children's behavioral problems. These problems encompass two groups: externalizing problems (expressed by hyperactivity, aggressive and challenging behavior, and delinquency) and internalizing problems (represented by depressive moods, anxiety, and somatic symptoms). The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and the quality of evidence by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RevMan 5.3 software was used for the meta-analysis.
   Data synthesis: Of the 687 eligible articles, only seven met all inclusion criteria and consisted of 12,250 mother/child pairs. The age range of the assessed children varied from 10 months to 16 years. The odds of internalizing problems in children exposed to prenatal violence were two-fold higher (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.17-3.76) and that of externalizing problems were 1.9-fold higher (95% CI: 1.28-2.83), when compared to children of unexposed mothers.
   Conclusion: The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that women's exposure to intimate partner violence during pregnancy may be associated with behavioral problems of their children, emphasizing the need for greater understanding about the vulnerability ofchildren to adversity in early ages.

AB Objective: Somatic complaints, often associated with concurrent and future internalizing symptoms and disorders in adult samples, were examined longitudinally from preschool to school age in a sample of children at an increased familial risk for psychopathology. The behavioral correlates and sex differences of somatic complaints and the persistence of these complaints across early childhood were examined. Method: A longitudinal sample of 185 mothers completed a laboratory visit when children were preschool aged and an online follow-up when children were school aged. Mothers were assessed for psychopathology, and mothers and secondary caregivers reported on children's somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression at both time points. Results: A high rate of child's somatic complaints was noted in this sample, with similar rates in males and females. Regression analyses revealed that somatic complaints at preschool predicted somatic complaints, anxiety, and depression at school age, and sex did not moderate these relationships. Overall, maternal psychopathology predicted somatic complaints, but findings were inconsistent across reporters, time points, and types of maternal psychopathology. Evidence for maternal reporting bias was mixed. Conclusion: The association between preschool-age somatic complaints and school-age internalizing symptoms suggests the potential utility of early detection and treatment of somatic complaints, particularly for young children at an increased familial risk for developing internalizing disorders. Pediatric primary care is an ideal setting for these early intervention efforts.

AB This study used data from 12 cultural groups in nine countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States; N=1,298) to understand the cross-cultural generalizability of how parental warmth and control are bidirectionally related to externalizing and internalizing behaviors from childhood to early adolescence. Mothers, fathers, and children completed measures when children were ages 8-13. Multiple-group autoregressive, cross-lagged structural equationmodels revealed that child effects rather than parent effects may better characterize how warmth and control are related to child externalizing and internalizing behaviors over time, and that parent effects may be more characteristic of relations between parental warmth and control and child externalizing and internalizing behavior during childhood than early adolescence.

AB Objective: Tobacco and alcohol use among South Korean youths who are victims of bullying behavior is not well understood. This study examines the link between bullying victimization and alcohol and tobacco use through the mediating roles of internalizing behavior, school disengagement, and low academic performance in South Korean adolescents (ages 11-13 years). Method: Data are from the Korea Children and Youth Panel Study, a nationally representative sample of South Korean adolescents. Participants in the current analyses included 2,028 students from 78 randomly selected middle schools. Sociodemographic variables, bullying victimization, social withdrawal behavior, depression, school activity, school rules, academic achievement, and alcohol and tobacco use were measured. We used structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among bullying victimization, specified mediators, and alcohol and tobacco use. Results: Bullying victimization was associated with an increased risk of using alcohol and tobacco and was mediated by social withdrawal, depression, school disengagement, and low academic performance. Conclusions: Bullying victimization may be a risk factor for alcohol and tobacco use, particularly among youth who experience internalizing problems and low levels of school engagement. School-based preventive interventions aimed at reducing victimization and substance use should address these social and school factors.

AB Introduction: Noise and noise sensitivity have negative effects on mental health and are not well-studied in children and adolescents. In this study, we investigated these effects in the aforementioned population with respect to sociodemographic variables and environmental factors. Materials and Methods: In this population-based study conducted in two large cities in South Korea, 918 elementary and middle-school students were included. After direct measurements at the selected sites, a noise map was created using an interpolation method. The road traffic noise of the participants' residential areas was calculated based on this noise map. Noise sensitivity was assessed on an 11-point Likert scale. Using multivariate logistic regression, we investigated the relationship among noise, noise sensitivity, and the Child Behavior Checklist. Further analyses were performed subdividing the data according to household income levels. Results: Noise sensitivity was significantly associated with internalizing, externalizing, and total behavioral problems. Noise was positively associated with total behavioral problems. In the low-income group, the degree of association with problem behaviors was higher, whereas the relationship between noise sensitivity and externalization problems disappeared in the high-income group. Conclusion: Noise and noise sensitivity are negatively associated with the mental health of children and adolescents, particularly in low-income groups. The findings of this study suggest that noise sensitivity and socioeconomic status should be considered in coping with negative effects of noise in children and adolescents.

AB Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a new diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). We compared juvenile justice involved youths with DMDD to those with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) and other mood disorders, to clarify the differences and to investigate differential correlates to DMDD relative to DBDs or mood disorders. Diagnostic and demographic data were available for 9,819 youths served by 57 juvenile justice sites. A subsample of 2,498 youths had data relevant to our study. The youths self-assessed mental health status on the Voice Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (V-DISC), and we retrofitted the V-DISC data to derive an approximate DMDD diagnosis. The retrofitted criteria for DMDD were met by 3.3 percent of justice-involved youths. Results from multinomial regression showed that, after adjustment for covariates, those with DMDD had fewer differences compared with those with other mood disorders than did those meeting criteria for DBDs. Consistent with the DSM-5 classification of DMDD as a depressive disorder, those with DMDD shared more characteristics with youths with mood disorders than with those reporting DBDs. Externalizing behaviors leading to justice involvement may overshadow internalizing symptoms of DMDD, but mood-related conditions should be identified and treated in this population.

AB The present study aimed to demonstrate that Sideral (R) RM (SRM, Sucrosomial (R) Raw Material Iron) is transported across the excised intestine via a biological mechanism, and to investigate the effect that this transport route may produce on oral iron absorption, which is expected to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects caused by the bioavailability of non-absorbed iron. Excised rat intestine was exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled SRM in Ussing chambers followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy to look for the presence of fluorescein-tagged vesicles of the FITC-labeled SRM. To identify FITC-labeled SRM internalizing cells, an immunofluorescence analysis for macrophages and M cells was performed using specific antibodies. Microscopy analysis revealed the presence of fluorescein positive particulate structures in tissues treated with FITC-labeled SRM. These structures do not disintegrate during transit, and concentrate in macrophage cells. Iron bioavailability was assessed by determining the time-course of Fe3+ plasma levels. As references, iron contents in liver, spleen, and bone marrow were determined in healthy rats treated by gavage with SRM or ferric pyrophosphate salt (FP). SRM significantly increased both area under the curve (AUC) and clearance maxima (C-max) compared to FP, thus increasing iron bioavailability (AUC(rel) = 1.8). This led to increased iron availability in the bone marrow at 5 h after single dose gavage.

AB Objective: The role of developmental issues and the constitutional factors are crucial for the conceptualization of psychopathology. The main aim of this research was to investigate the impact of early losses, attachment styles, affect regulation, and temperament-character traits on psychopathology. Furthermore, we also wanted to examine affect regulation and attachment styles as mediators of harm avoidance temperament trait and psychopathology.
   Method: The patient cohort was composed of two groups: a clinical group (n = 224) and a healthy control group (n = 61). The clinical group included major depressive disorder (n = 78), anxiety disorder (n = 74), and somatization disorder (n = 72). Data collection tools involved Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and The Experiences in Close Relationships-II, Temperament Character Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Early Losses Search Form.
   Results: The losses that the clinical group experienced during their childhood period were higher than the control group. The clinical group had more anxious and avoidant attachment styles; had more difficulties in emotion regulation; used the adaptational cognitive emotion regulation strategies less and the non-adaptational strategies more; and had higher harm avoidance scores than the healthy group. Moreover, it was found that both the emotion regulation difficulties and attachment styles had a partial mediating effect on harm avoidance and depression and anxiety.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, early relationships and experiences have an impact on further development of psychopathology and are important in understanding the etiology of depression and anxiety.

AB Recent data highlight maladaptive emotion regulation strategies as a transdiagnostic risk factor. Executive functioning (EF) is also conceptualized as a transdiagnostic mechanism. Drawing these two areas together, data supports the intervening role of rumination, a form of emotion regulation, in the EF clinical symptomatology link. However, research has yet to fully examine various emotion regulation strategies as transdiagnostic mechanisms in youth. The relationship between EF components, emotion regulation strategies, and transdiagnostic negative affect was examined. Set-shifting was associated with general emotion regulation difficulties as well as rumination, worry, and thought suppression. Inhibition was only related to general emotion regulation difficulties and the brooding subtype of rumination. Finally, various forms of emotion regulation were observed to mediate the relationship between set-shifting and negative affect.

AB Animal abuse is an under-reported yet prevalent form of both passive and active forms of aggressive behavior. Its severe and upsetting consequences are not only experienced by the victims themselves, but also others in proximity (e.g., pet owners). Despite this, research and theory focusing on the motivations for such behavior appear to be sparse and limited in development when compared to other types of offending behavior, such as interpersonal violence. This article examines the motivations that underlie animal abuse and the maladaptive emotion regulation techniques that facilitate this type of behavior. We focus on two specific emotion regulation styles that have been implicated in existing literature; that is, the mis-regulation and under-regulation of emotions. Based on existing research and theories, we posit that the facilitative role emotion regulation plays in the perpetration of animal abuse is vital in our understanding of how and why this abuse occurs. In this article, we present a preliminary conceptualization of animal abuse behavior that depicts emotion regulation as a pivotal factor in key explanatory pathways.

AB Sudden gains (SGs), referring to large, stable symptom improvement occurring between consecutive treatment sessions, have been associated with improved outcomes among adults with various psychological disorders. Little research exists on SGs or sudden symptom worsening (i.e., sudden regressions [SRs]) during treatment for youth disorders. The current study examined predictors and outcomes of SGs/SRs via multiple informants in youth anxiety treatment. Participants were 118 youth (age M = 11.6, SD = 2.5; 53.8% female) and their caregivers receiving a cognitive-behavioral therapy protocol for a principal anxiety disorder. Anxiety symptom severity was assessed weekly via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-Trait-Child/Parent versions. SGs and SRs occurred in 45.8 and 31.3% of youth, respectively. SRs were more common among youth with comorbid mood or externalizing disorders, while SGs occurred more often among youth with greater pretreatment anxiety symptom severity. SGs were not associated with posttreatment outcomes, but SRs predicted significantly higher posttreatment internalizing symptoms based on child report (beta = .23, p = .03) and externalizing symptoms based on child (beta = .15, p = .04) and parent report (beta = .16, p = .03), controlling for overall magnitude of symptom change. SRs among youth receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety are associated with pretreatment clinical complexity and poorer posttreatment outcomes and may serve as a warning sign to clinicians of possible treatment failure.

AB AimsThe Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence (PQ-EnU) is widely-used in clinical assessment of nocturnal enuresis (NE) and daytime urinary incontinence (DUI). It includes 18 items regarding daytime (DW) and nighttime wetting (NW), 24 items concerning toilet habits (TH), and 14 items regarding behavioral problems (BP). The aim of the study was to evaluate reliability and validity of the PQ-EnU.
   MethodsParents of 490 children (M=8.7 years [SD=2.9], 68.2% male) presented in an outpatient incontinence clinic completed the PQ-EnU and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Internal consistencies, factorial structure, and convergent validity regarding incontinence diagnoses and psychopathology were examined.
   Results84.1% had NE, 38.8% DUI, and 20.8% fecal incontinence (FI). Internal consistencies were good for TH and BP. A factor analysis of the TH scale revealed three subscales (Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), Bowel symptoms, and Voiding dysfunctions). The LUTS and Bowel symptoms subscales were significantly correlated to clinical diagnoses of DUI and FI, respectively. A factor analysis of the BP scale revealed also three subscales (attention/school deficits, impulsive-aggressive behavior and internalizing problems, which were all significantly correlated with the CBCL. The questionnaire discriminated significantly between children with and without DUI or FI, and children with and without a clinical CBCL score.
   ConclusionsThe PQ-EnU is a valid and reliable parental questionnaire to measure incontinence, bladder/bowel symptoms, and behavioral problems in children. Due to its shortness, the PQ-EnU is an efficient measurement, which can be used in clinical settings and also as a screening tool for psychological symptoms.

AB The child's ADHD symptoms influence the psychosocial functioning of the whole family. Studies show an increased burden and functional deficits in parents of children with ADHD symptoms in comparison to the control group. Parents of children with ADHD (n = 26) were compared with the control group (n = 80) in terms of stress factors (EBI). Comorbid disorders such as aggressive behaviour and internalizing problems were controlled for (SDQ). Taking into account the aggressive behaviour and internalizing problems, parents of children with ADHD and parents of the control group differ significantly only in one factor: "attachment" (eta(2)(p) =.04). Parental stress of children with ADHD described in the literature may be mainly attributed to the aggressive behaviour of ADHD symptoms.

AB Whilst it is widely recognised that attachment is a fundamental aspect of psychological wellbeing, there is little research on attachment in specific psychopathological conditions, in middle childhood and early adolescence. This study seeks to evaluate the role of attachment in patients (8-15 years) with somatic symptom disorders (SSDs) and with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs). A battery of assessments was completed: Child Attachment Interview, Separation Anxiety Test, and Kerns Security Scale. Findings on "attachment models" showed an over-representation of insecure attachment patterns with a preponderance of disorganized attachment in both clinical groups. On "perceived security," SSD participants viewed their parents as safer than DBD participants, but, regarding "separation anxiety," they did not show higher separation anxiety. Therefore, a multi-assessment approach is likely to yield a more accurate picture of attachment organization at this age, and to capture attachment processes in SSDs and DBDs.

AB Cognitive and socioemotional functioning at 41/2years of age were examined in children born to mothers with substance-abuse problems (n = 22) recruited from residential treatment institutions while pregnant, and then compared to children born to mothers with mental health problems (n = 18) and children from a low-risk group (n = 26). No significant group differences in cognitive functioning were found, but the children born to mothers with substance-abuse problems showed more caregiver-reported socioemotional problems than did the low-risk children, like the children born to mothers with mental health problems. Birth weight had an effect on internalizing problems at 41/2years and mediated the relation between group and socioemotional problems, although not when controlling for caregiver education, single parenthood, and anxiety and depression. At 41/2years, 7 children born to mothers with substance-abuse problems were placed in foster care. These children had lower birth weight and higher caregiver-rated internalizing problems. In addition to emphasizing the importance of the quality of the prenatal environment, this study suggests that families with previous substance abuse are in need of long-term follow-up to address socioemotional problems and enhance further positive child cognitive development. The foster-placed children may be in particular need of long-term follow-up.

I use this change in schooling policy to identify the effect of increased schooling intensity on students' internalizing mental health problems and perceived stress. Using data on 2306 students from the Additional Study Baden-Wurttemberg of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), estimates show strong negative effects on internalizing mental health problems for girls and an increase in stress for both genders.

AB Heterogeneity in parenting was examined in 883 Arab refugee adolescents in Jordan (M-age=15.01years, SD=1.60). Latent profile analyses of five parenting dimensions rated separately for mothers and fathers yielded authoritative, authoritarian, indifferent, punitive, and for mothers, permissive profiles, with most mothers (60%) and fathers (66%) classified as authoritative. Parenting was more often authoritative for women than men and punitive (for fathers) or permissive (for mothers) of boys than girls. Authoritative fathers and authoritarian mothers were better educated than punitive parents, whose offspring reported more norm breaking and internalizing symptoms and lower academic achievement than other youth. Adjustment was better when adolescents had at least one authoritative parent than when parents were either consistent or discrepant but nonauthoritative.

AB Despite the rising cultural phenomenon of grandparents parenting grandchildren on a full-time basis due to problems within the birth parent generation. intervention studies with these families have been scarce. methodologically flawed, and without conceptual underpinnings. We conducted a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 343 custodial grandmothers recruited from across 4 states to compare the effectiveness of behavioral parent training (BPT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and information-only control (IOC) conditions at lowering grandmothers' psychological distress, improving their parenting practices, and reducing the internalizing and externalizing difficulties of target grandchildren between ages 4 and 12. These outcomes were derived conceptually from the family stress model and modeled as latent constructs with multiple indicators. Each RCT condition was fully manualized and delivered across 10 sessions within groups led jointly by trained professionals and peer facilitators in community settings. Multidomain second-order latent difference score models were performed on a full intent-to-treat basis to compare the 3 RCT conditions on changes in the above outcomes from baseline to postintervention and from baseline to 6 months postintervention. In general, while CBT and BPT interventions were both superior to IOC at both times of measurement on most outcomes, they differed little from each other. Effect sizes were generally in the moderate to large range and similar to those found in prior studies of BPT and CBT with traditional birth parents. We conclude from this research that evidence-based interventions focusing on appropriate skill development and behavioral change can yield positive outcomes within custodial grandfamilies.

AB BackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders have been proposed as precursors of bipolar disorder, but their joint and relative roles in the development of bipolar disorder are unknown.AimsTo test the prospective relationship of ADHD and anxiety with onset of bipolar disorder.MethodWe examined the relationship between ADHD, anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder in a birth cohort of 2 409 236 individuals born in Denmark between 1955 and 1991. Individuals were followed from their sixteenth birthday or from January 1995 to their first clinical contact for bipolar disorder or until December 2012. We calculated incidence rates per 10 000 person-years and tested the effects of prior diagnoses on the risk of bipolar disorder in survival models.ResultsOver 37 394 865 person-years follow-up, 9250 onsets of bipolar disorder occurred. The incidence rate of bipolar disorder was 2.17 (95% CI 2.12-2.19) in individuals with no prior diagnosis of ADHD or anxiety, 23.86 (95% CI 19.98-27.75) in individuals with a prior diagnosis of ADHD only, 26.05 (95% CI 24.47-27.62) in individuals with a prior diagnosis of anxiety only and 66.16 (95% CI 44.83-87.47) in those with prior diagnoses of both ADHD and anxiety. The combination of ADHD and anxiety increased the risk of bipolar disorder 30-fold (95% CI 21.66-41.40) compared with those with no prior ADHD or anxiety.ConclusionsEarly manifestations of both internalising and externalising psychopathology indicate liability to bipolar disorder. The combination of ADHD and anxiety is associated with a very high risk of bipolar disorder.Declaration of interestNone.

AB Inclusive education has become one of the key policy objectives for the education for children with disabilities in recent decades. However, its effectiveness in promoting happy school life among those children has been questioned. In this study, we aimed to provide a detailed profile of the associations between disabilities and child victimization, and to examine the effects of school environments on those associations. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a sample of 4114 school-aged children (6-18 years), who were receiving primary or secondary education in Hong Kong in 2016-2017. Children's experiences of 7 types of victimization in the past year, status of disabilities, type of school attending, and other demographic factors were captured with questionnaire completed by the children or their parents. Apart from descriptive statistics, we conducted logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between disabilities, types of school, and child victimization. Children with ADHD, internalizing disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and restrictions in body movement were at higher risks of victimization while other types of disabilities were not. Children attending special schools were at lower risks of victimization, while children with disabilities who had been placed in ordinary schools for inclusive education were at higher risks of most types of victimization when compared to children without disabilities. Our findings suggested an important role of the school environments on the associations between disabilities and victimization. When placed in a protective environment, children with disabilities could even be less vulnerable to victimization than those without disabilities.

AB Temperament refers to the totality of individual characteristics present from birth that determine a child's unique style of behavior. Maternal personality and attitudes, one of the factors affecting temperament traits in children, is a frequently investigated subject. However, paternal variables have remained insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study is to investigate the associations between the fathers' temperament, character, attitudes, psychopathology and temperament of the 3-6 years-old children. The parents of 36-60 months-old children in the preschool settings in Samsun were included in the study (n:200). Their mothers completed "Maternal Sociodemographic Form" prepared by the researcher, and the temperament of children "Children Behaviour Questionnare" were scored by the mothers. Their fathers completed "Paternal Sociodemographic Form", and to assess father psychopathology "Brief Symptom Inventory", to determine father temperament and character "Temperament and Character Inventory" and to determine attitudes "Parenting Attitudes Scale" were scored by the fathers. In this study, we found several significant associations between children's temperament and fathers temperament and character, attitudes styles and psychopathology. The scores of paternal harm avoidance increase and self directedness decrease were found to be significantly positivily correlated with negative temperamental charecteristics of the children. The democratic attitudes of fathers were significantly correlated with positive temperamental scores of the children. All domains of paternal psychopathology were found to be in significant association with negative temperamental characteristics of the children. Our findings showed the complex interplay between determinants of parenting. Specifically, this study is one of the first to investigate paternal personality, psychopathology and attitudes, alone and in interaction with preschool child temperament.

AB BackgroundChildren undergoing adenotonsillectomy are at risk of severe postoperative pain and sleep problems. Little is known about the specific child risk factors for these problems.
   AimsThe aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of postoperative pain, sleep problems, and medication adherence, and assess the influence of internalizing and externalizing problems on postoperative pain.
   MethodsThis prospective cohort study included 160 children, aged 1.5-5 years undergoing day-care adenotonsillectomy. Parents rated their child's pain with the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure and their child's sleep problems with Vernon's Post Hospital Behavioral Questionnaire during the first 3 days and at day 10 postoperatively. Emotional/behavioral problems (ie, internalizing and externalizing behaviors) during the past 2 months were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist. Regression analysis was used to assess whether children's pain intensity at home was associated with internalizing/externalizing problems, after controlling for age, preoperative child state anxiety, parental state anxiety, parental need for information, and socioeconomic status.
   ResultsApplying a threshold of 6 on the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure, the incidence of moderate to severe pain was 57.6% at day 1, 53.5% at day 2, 35.4% at day 3, and 4.8% at day 10. During the first three postoperative nights, 37.1% of the children woke up. Internalizing problems ( = 0.343; P = 0.001) and parental need for information ( = 0.207; P = 0.011) were independently associated with higher pain scores at home during the first 3 days (R-2 = 0.225).
   ConclusionFollowing adenotonsillectomy, children often experienced moderate to severe pain and sleep problems during the first 3 days at home. Preoperative internalizing problems and parental need for information were independently associated with increased pain at home. Screening for these problems can help to identify vulnerable children and adapt the perioperative analgesic strategy accordingly (which includes preparation, information, and prescription of pain analgesics).

AB Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience deficits in emotion regulation that can be measured physiologically under environmental stress conditions by examining respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a marker of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) withdrawal. The current pilot study examined the impact of comorbid internalizing disorders and comorbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) on emotion regulation in children with ADHD by measuring RSA as an indicator of dysregulated emotional reactivity. Twenty-four 7-10 year old children with ADHD participated in the current study. Children completed a 5-min resting attending baseline while electrocardiogram data (ECG) were recorded to examine baseline RSA. Children then completed a stress inducing, blocked goal, Card Sorting Task to measure RSA reactivity to stress. Results revealed a significant effect of internalizing disorder status on RSA difference score, F (1, 18) = 5.83, p = .03, eta (2) = .25. Children in the comorbid internalizing disorder group had a significantly greater decrease in RSA from the baseline time period to the card sorting task. There was no significant effect of ODD diagnostic status on RSA difference score, p > .05. The results of this preliminary study suggest that among children with ADHD, the presence of a comorbid internalizing disorder predicts greater withdrawal of the PNS. These findings represent an important step in understanding autonomic functioning of children with ADHD and comorbid disorders.

AB The present study investigates how coordination between stress responsivity of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) moderates the prospective effects of marital conflict on internalizing and externalizing symptoms across adolescence. Although an important avenue for psychophysiological research concerns how PNS and SNS responses jointly influence adjustment in the context of stress, these processes have rarely been studied in adolescence or longitudinally. Participants were 252 youth (53% female, 66% European American, 34% African American) who participated in laboratory assessments when they were 16, 17, and 18 years old. PNS activity (measured via respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) and SNS activity (measured via skin conductance level [SCL]) were assessed during a resting baseline and in response to a laboratory-based challenge (star tracing). Parents and adolescents both reported on marital conflict and adolescents reported on their internalizing and externalizing symptoms. At higher levels of marital conflict, coactivation of PNS and SNS activity, characterized by increased RSA and increased SCL from baseline to challenge, predicted elevated internalizing symptoms and an increase in externalizing behavior across adolescence. Coinhibition, or decreased activity across both systems, also predicted an increase in internalizing symptoms over time. At lower levels of marital conflict, internalizing and externalizing symptoms were relatively low. Findings extend primarily cross-sectional work with younger children by demonstrating that coordination between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) moderates the longitudinal effects of marital conflict on psychological and behavioral maladjustment among adolescents.

AB Although negative interparental conflict predicts elevated externalizing problems for children, there are individual differences in this association. Theoretically, children's abilities to coordinate physiological stress across response systems moderate the effects of interparental conflict on developmental outcomes. Past cross-sectional research has demonstrated that poor coordination of sympathetic (SNS) and para-sympathetic (PNS) nervous systems puts children at a greater risk for externalizing behaviors in the context of interparental conflict. Our goal was to examine whether this same pattern is evident in adolescents and provide the first longitudinal test of this theoretical pathway. Participants were families with adolescents (10-17 years) from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Parents reported conflict, were observed during a conflict discussion, and reported adolescent externalizing behaviors; parents again reported externalizing behaviors 1 year later. Adolescents experienced a stressor while skin conductance level (SCL; SNS) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; PNS) were measured. Similar to past research with children, there were 3-way interactions between negative interparental conflict, SCL reactivity, and RSA reactivity in relation to adolescent externalizing behaviors, concurrently and prospectively. The overall pattern suggested that adolescents who displayed poorly coordinated responding displayed a positive association between interparental conflict and externalizing behaviors, whereas adolescents who showed well-coordinated responding displayed a nonsignificant or negative association. Coinhibition of the SNS and PNS may put adolescents particularly at risk for prospective externalizing behaviors. Autonomic nervous system coordination-particularly activation of the SNS and inhibition of the PNS during stress-may protect adolescents from experiencing adjustment problems in the context of interparental conflict.

AB The current study examined developmentally informed pathways from peer victimization and exclusion to adolescent alcohol use. Using multiple informants (target and peer report of negative peer experiences) and a longitudinal sample of 387 adolescents, we examined 2 developmental pathways from these negative peer experiences to alcohol use, 1 through externalizing symptoms and the other through internalizing symptoms. When analyzed in separate models, results suggested that self-reported chronic peer victimization and exclusion were positively related to alcohol use through internalizing symptoms and coping motivated drinking. The risk pathway replicated for exclusion when using peer report of negative peer experiences. When victimization and exclusion were tested simultaneously in the same model, the risk pathway through internalizing symptoms and coping drinking motives was only supported for chronic exclusion and this finding replicated across reporters. No support was found for negative peer experiences operating through externalizing symptoms. Findings from the present study help clarify developmental pathways linking negative peer experiences to alcohol use and suggest that experiencing chronic exclusion may have a particularly deleterious impact on alcohol use during adolescence.

AB BackgroundBehavioural and emotional problems are a salient concern for parents of children with neurodisability, but little is known about the nature of such concerns in this population, nor about the distribution of concern types across ostensibly different subpopulations.
   MethodsInformation about behavioural and emotional concerns was extracted from clinical reports of developmental paediatricians (N=12) who had assessed children aged 3 to 8years (N=129) through three clinics at a major developmental and rehabilitation service centre. All concerns were captured at a granular level. A two-stage, consensus-based interdisciplinary concept-sorting technique was used to identify and group thematically related behavioural and emotional concerns into First Stage Groupings, intended to preserve detail and specificity, and a reduced number of Second Stage Clusters.
   ResultsA total of 669 discrete concerns were encountered, aggregated to 58 First Stage Concern Groupings and 28 Second Stage Concern Clusters. Findings of the salience of Groupings related to Attention, Concentration and Distractibility, and Anxiousness, Shyness, and Emotional Sensitivity reflect existing literature for children with neurodevelopmental concerns. Social Isolation/Peer Engagement, Tantrums/Outbursts/Meltdowns and Volatility/Self-regulation Difficulties, and Sensory Issues emerged as areas of significant concern and salience as well. Across clinics, three Clusters recurred among the top five observed for each clinic: Tantrums/Outbursts/Meltdowns, Inflexibility/Gets Stuck or Fixated, and Social Behaviours.
   ConclusionsThis rich descriptive dataset affords insight into the phenomenology of behaviour and emotional concerns in the daily lives of parents whose children have known or suspected neurodisability. Study findings can inform and sensitize clinicians working with this population. Usefulness is enhanced by inclusion of behavioural material that is subthreshold for a formal psychopathologic diagnosis. Certain concern types are encountered commonly across different clinical subpopulations, supporting a noncategorical view of behavioural and emotional problems as functional attributes that cross neurodisability diagnostic categories.

AB The current study examines effects of changes in intra-family relationships after parental incarceration on internalizing behaviors of the children of incarcerated parents. Using data from a sample of 249 incarcerated parents with minor children in South Korea, the present study found that perceived degradation of family relationships among inmate parents, their non-incarcerated spouses, and children was a significant risk factor of internalizing behaviors of children of incarcerated parents. The current study also found that inmate parents who had more frequent family contact were more likely to perceive improvements of all forms of intra-family relationships during incarceration. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The School Refusal Assessment Scale-Revised (SRAS-R) is a widely used measure of the functional conditions leading to school absenteeism. In the present study, we developed a German version of the SRAS-R and investigated its psychometric properties in a clinical sample (N = 62) of referred school absentees aged 11 to 17 years. Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution for the self-rated version and a three-factor solution for the parent-rated version. All four subscales of the final 22-item German SRAS-R were internally consistent. Convergent and discriminant validity were shown by significant correlations with other scales assessing internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Overall, the German SRAS-R is a valuable instrument for assessing school absenting behavior. The results should be interpreted conservatively due to the limited sample size.

AB Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) has often been studied in the context of internalizing disorders, but no studies to our knowledge have explored the relation between IU and externalizing disorders. Given the proposed link between IU and emotion regulation, the current study sought to examine levels of IU in an externalizing clinical population with known emotion regulation difficulties-attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IU levels in this population were compared to a clinical population known to experience elevated levels of IU. Participants in present study were ninety-three children (36 anxiety disorder, 28 ADHD, 29 unaffected children) ages 7-13, who completed the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Short Version (IUS). Responses on the IUS were converted to total IU, prospective IU, and inhibitory IU. A linear mixed model analysis of covariance was conducted while controlling for age, sex, and ADHD medications. A significant interaction was observed between diagnostic status and IU scale. Planned contrasts indicated that children with anxiety disorders and ADHD reported significantly higher levels of IU relative to unaffected children, and children with ADHD reported comparable levels of inhibitory IU relative to children with anxiety disorders. The current results contribute to a growing literature on the link between IU and psychopathology. IU appears to be a transdiagnostic construct present among children with internalizing and externalizing disorders, and may be broadly associated with emotion regulation deficits rather than specific disorder symptoms.

AB The current study explored the concurrent and longitudinal association between internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and peer victimization among children with and without ADHD. Eighty children (42 ADHD, 38 non-ADHD) ages 8-12 participated in the present study conducted over a 6-month period. During the baseline session, parents completed a structured diagnostic interview and the Vanderbilt ADHD Parent Rating Scale to determine whether their child met criteria for ADHD, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess their child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors; children completed the Perception of Peer Support Scale (PPSS) to assess experiences of peer victimization. At the 6-month follow-up session, parents completed the CBCL and children completed the PPSS. Concurrently, internalizing behaviors were associated with peer victimization among children with and without ADHD; ADHD moderated this relation, such that internalizing behaviors were more strongly related to peer victimization among children with ADHD. Longitudinally, internalizing behaviors at baseline predicted peer victimization at 6-month follow-up; however, further analyses demonstrated there was a covarying change in internalizing behaviors and peer victimization. These findings suggest internalizing behaviors are related to peer victimization concurrently, and over time, and are associated with increased risk for peer victimization in the presence of ADHD. Additionally, internalizing behaviors and peer victimization appear to share a dynamic relationship; that is, decreases in internalizing behaviors predict similar decreases in peer victimization. No significant relations were observed between externalizing behaviors and peer victimization. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB Preschoolers with elevated anxiety symptoms are at high risk not only of developing more severe mental health disorders in later life but are also apt to respond more poorly to intervention if they present with comorbid disruptive behavior. Because early signs of anxiety disorders may not be recognized as such in preschool settings, many children selected for Tier 2 interventions that target externalizing problem behaviors may also have co-occurring anxiety symptoms and disorders. The First Step to Success intervention has recently been adapted for preschoolers with externalizing behaviors and was found to be efficacious in a randomized controlled trial. The current report examines effects of the First Step intervention on a subsample of 38 preschoolers with comorbid anxiety symptoms. Compared to usual-care controls, preschoolers who were assigned to the First Step intervention demonstrated medium-to-large effects in reducing externalizing behavior and improving social functioning outcomes, but had small effects for reductions in internalizing behaviors. Implications for intervening with preschoolers at risk of comorbid disruptive and anxiety behaviors are discussed.

AB The present study aimed to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI), social anxiety, and eating disorder risk as well as the effects of several demographic variables on social anxiety and eating disorder risk among adolescents in China. Seven hundred eighty-four senior high school students in China were sampled to participate in the survey, completing the measures of body mass index, Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and hierarchical regression with bootstrapping approach were used to examine the relationships between the studied variables. Adolescents' EI negatively influenced their social anxiety and eating disorder risk; meanwhile, their social anxiety acted as a partial mediator between their EI and eating disorder risk. In addition, gender, grade, and body size all had main effects on social anxiety and eating disorder risk, and there were interaction effects both between gender and grade, and between gender and body size. These findings advance our comprehending of the formation mechanism of EDs and should be helpful to conduct effective, targeted intervention on EDs among adolescents.

AB Studies suggest that girls with externalizing problems (ExtP) who receive school-based mental health services may have more severe impairments than boys. In addition, girls with ExtP who receive mental health treatments have been found do so for shorter durations, but this remains to be confirmed among children receiving school-based mental health services. This study sought to (1) examine gender differences in students' characteristics and problem severity at study inception and in mental health service use at school at 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-up and (2) investigate longitudinal child, family and school determinants of service use among girls and boys. Participants were 370 elementary school students (149 girls) receiving school-based mental health services for ExtP. Child, family and school determinants of mental health services at school were examined ecologically from parent and teacher reports at study inception and follow-up points. Proportionally more girls than boys presented clinical ExtP and fewer retained services at each follow-up point. Multilevel generalized estimating equations models indicated that, among girls, conflict with teacher, affiliation with deviant peers and poor academic functioning significantly increased the likelihood of mental health service use over time but that ExtP severity was the most robust independent predictor. A broader set of determinants emerged for boys, including ExtP severity, internalizing problems and affiliation with deviant peers. These results suggest that adults may be more sensitive to boys' difficulties than to girls' and that girls who receive school mental health services typically present more severe impairments.

AB BackgroundThe elaborated environmental stress hypothesis (EESH) provides a framework that describes how motor skills may indirectly cause internalizing problems through various mediating psychosocial factors. While there is evidence to support this framework, little is known about how the proposed relationships may vary across different stages of development.
   AimsThis study aimed to investigate whether peer problems and perceived self-competence mediated the relationship between motor skills and internalizing problems in pre-primary children, and at 18-month follow up.
   SampleA community sample of 197 pre-primary school children (M=5.40years, SD=0.30years; 102 males, 95 females) participated at Time 1, with 107 completing the Time 2 follow-up.
   MethodsStandardized instruments were used to measure motor skills and verbal IQ. Perceived self-competence was measured using a self-report measure. Participant peer problems and internalizing problems were measured using teacher report. Age, gender, and verbal IQ were included as covariates.
   ResultsMediation analysis using PROCESS showed that the relationship between motor skills and internalizing problems was mediated by peer problems at Time 1. At Time 2, the relationship was mediated by peer problems and perceived physical competence.
   ConclusionsThe current results indicate the EESH may function differently across different periods of development. The transition from pre-primary to Grade 1 represents a time of important cognitive and psychosocial development, which has implications for how the relationship between motor skills and internalizing problems can be understood. These findings highlight potential age-appropriate targets for psychomotor interventions aiming to improve the emotional well-being of young children.

AB Little is known about how internalizing symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect family outcomes, despite the high rates of internalizing disorders in ASD and the dynamic relationships among child, parent, and family variables. We evaluated the predictive value of internalizing symptoms in 69 adolescents with ASD and average-range cognitive abilities on family impact. In addition, we examined the correspondence between parent and child symptom ratings. Results indicated that internalizing symptoms predict family impact above IQ and externalizing symptoms. Depression (but not anxiety) predicted more positive family functioning, and parents rated more internalizing symptoms than adolescents. The results are contrary to our initial predictions, and we offer several explanations for this difference. Differences between parent and child ratings of internalizing symptoms are also explored.

AB Background: It is known that children with disabilities, especially adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are at increased risk for victimization. However, little is known about the impact of victimization over time.
   Aims: Primary aims included identifying to what extent risk factors (Le., internalizing behavior problems and conflict in friendship) related to bullying victimization over time.
   Methods and procedures: In-depth interviews conducted separately with 15-year-olds with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), or typical development (TD) and their mothers investigated the experiences of victimization in a two-year follow up to an earlier study at adolescent age 13.
   Outcomes and results: Findings at age 15 demonstrated that the highest rates of bullying continued to be endorsed by youth with ASD. However, youth with ID were found to experience and report the most severe bullying. Longitudinal examination revealed that internalizing behaviors at age 13 predicted victimization experiences at age 15.
   Conclusions and implications: During middle adolescence, youth with ASD continue to experience more frequent victimization. Thus, shifting the focus of interventions that not only target the salient social deficits of ASD, but also address comorbid conditions such as internalizing symptoms, may further contribute to reduction of social isolation and peer difficulties.

AB ObjectivesHealth care guidelines recommend psychological interventions for childhood unusual experiences that are associated with distress or adverse functional impact (UEDs), based on adult, rather than child-specific, evidence. We report the first randomized controlled evaluation of the acceptability and potential clinical utility of cognitive behavioural therapy for childhood UEDs (CBT-UED).
   DesignPilot randomized controlled trial.
   MethodsParticipants aged 8-14years were recruited from referrals to community services for children with emotional/behavioural problems and screened for self-reported UEDs.
   ResultsOf around 1,000 referrals over 36months, 304 (30%) were identified to the research team, 174 (57%) were successfully contacted, 110 (63%) consented to screening, 96 (87%) attended a screening assessment, and 51 (53%) reported UEDs. Forty-nine (96%) consented to randomization to either CBT-UED (9-12 weekly sessions of 40-50min, adjunctive to usual care, n=24) or treatment-as-usual/waitlist control (TAU/WL, n=25). Childhood internalizing emotional symptoms (e.g., feeling nervous'/'scared'/'tearful'/'worried'/'sick'; proposed primary outcome), UEDs, depression, anxiety, and childhood psychopathology (secondary outcomes) were measured at baseline, at 12weeks, and, where therapy was ongoing but incomplete (<12 sessions) at 12weeks, at end-of-treatment (EOT). Twenty-two CBT-UED participants (92%) attended 5 sessions. Forty-four participants (90%) completed 12-week assessments (CBT-UED, n=21/24, 88%; TAU/WL, n=23/25, 92%). Preliminary findings were encouraging for emotional symptoms and UEDs, but otherwise mixed.
   ConclusionsRetention, screening, and consent rates were as anticipated; recruitment took longer than planned. Trial procedures were acceptable to young people, their families, and clinicians. Therapy exceeded 12weeks, but was well-received, with no serious adverse events attributed to participation. Further evaluation is needed.
   Practitioner points
   Around half of 8- to 14-year-olds in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services reported distressing unusual experiences. An age-adapted cognitive behavioural intervention appears feasible, and safe to deliver, with the potential to augment standard care. This is a pilot study, and further evaluation is needed. Longer term outcomes should be a focus of future evaluation.

AB Frontal resting electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry is an important physiological indicator of emotion regulation, positive/negative emotion, and approach/withdrawal tendencies. The present study examined the relationship of parent-child frontal resting EEG asymmetry patterns and explored the potential moderating role of emotional parenting on such a relationship. We recorded the frontal resting EEG asymmetry of thirty-nine children (M age = 8.87 years) and their primary caregivers (M age = 39.41 years) and coded their emotional parenting behaviors (psychological control and psychological unavailability) based on behavioral observations. The results indicated that there was not a direct association between parent-child frontal resting EEG asymmetry but that the relationship was moderated by parental psychological control. Specifically, the resting frontal EEG asymmetry of the parents was negatively associated with the EEG asymmetry of their children only under higher levels of parental psychological control. However, psychological unavailability did not exhibit a moderating effect. Accordingly, our findings highlight the critical but differential role of emotional parenting behaviors with respect to the association between the frontal resting EEG asymmetry of parents and their children.

AB This study examines clinical and family predictors of perceived need for treatment and engagement in mental health treatment services among community-referred racial/ethnic minority adolescents and their primary caregivers. Findings indicated that the majority of families perceived a need for treatment, but that perceived need was not associated with treatment engagement. Family factors (i.e., low cohesion and high conflict within the family) predicted perceived need for treatment among adolescents, whereas clinical factors (i.e., adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptomatology) predicted caregiver perceived need for adolescent treatment. Neither clinical nor family factors predicted treatment engagement.

AB Anxiety and depression are often comorbid with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). There is empirical support to suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for comorbid anxiety disorders in youth with ASD. Modifications to CBT for youths with ASD have been made with emphasis on exposure being a critical component. Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of CBT on symptoms of depression in youths with ASD. Modifications to CBT will be outlined in this review, as will implementation suggestions for the clinician practicing CBT with ASD youth. Limitations of the studies investigating this intervention include small sample sizes, clinician- and parent-report of symptom change but not consistent self-identified change, limited validated tools for assessing change, and lack of long-term follow-up.

AB Both child temperament and parenting have been extensively researched as predictors of child outcomes. However, theoretical models suggest that specific combinations of temperament styles and parenting behaviors are better predictors of certain child outcomes such as internalizing and externalizing symptoms than either temperament or parenting alone. The current qualitative review examines the interaction between one childhood temperamental characteristic (child behavioral inhibition) and parenting behaviors, and their subsequent impact on child psychopathology. Specifically, the moderating role of parenting on the relationship between child behavioral inhibition and both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology is examined, and the methodological variations which may contribute to inconsistent findings are explored. Additionally, support for the bidirectional relations between behavioral inhibition and parenting behaviors, as well as for the moderating role of temperament on the relationships between parenting and child outcomes, is briefly discussed. Finally, the clinical applicability of this overall conceptual model, specifically in regard to future research directions and potential clinical interventions, is considered.

AB Objectives: This study sought to understand (1) whether parents and teachers reports of childhood behavioral problems could predict smoking and alcohol consumption 35 years later, and (2) whether propensity for smoking and alcohol consumption differed on the basis of informant agreement in their classification of behavioral syndromes.
   Methods: Participants included those from the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s study (ACONF) with full childhood information as well as self-reports in adulthood (n = 1342). Latent Class Analysis was conducted to identify patterns of childhood problem behaviors as rated by teachers and parents. Regression models were then conducted predicting adulthood smoking and alcohol consumption. Informant agreement categories were constructed and differences across categories in both smoking and alcohol consumption were tested.
   Results: Three subtypes of childhood behavior problems were identified by both teachers and parents: "Normative," "Externalizing," and "Internalizing,". Parents also identified a distinct fourth group "Mixed". Teacher's classification of the child as externalizing significantly predicted greater likelihood of being a current smoker, and parents' classification as internalizing predicted lower likelihood of being an ex-smoker. Parents' ratings as externalizing and mixed also predicted lower levels of alcohol consumption, which was opposite to the predicted effect. Additionally, informant agreement of externalizing indicated a greater propensity of smoking in adulthood, but did not indicate differences in alcohol consumption.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that it is important to consider additive information from multiple informants when examining the life-course effects of childhood behavioral problems on risky health behaviors in adulthood.

AB Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is the extreme fear and avoidance of one or more social situations. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether heart rate variability (HRV) during resting state and a social performance task (SPT) is a candidate endophenotype of SAD.
   Methods: In this two-generation family study, patients with SAD with their partner and children, and their siblings with partner and children took part in a SPT (total n=121, 9 families, 3-30 persons per family, age range: 8-61 years, 17 patients with SAD). In this task, participants had to watch and evaluate the speech of a female peer, and had to give a similar speech. HRV was measured during two resting state phases, and during anticipation, speech and recovery phases of the SPT. We tested two criteria for endophenotypes: co-segregation with SAD within families and heritability.
   Results: HRV did not co-segregate with SAD within families. Root mean square of successive differences during the first resting phase and recovery, and high frequency power during all phases of the task were heritable.
   Limitations: It should be noted that few participants were diagnosed with SAD. Results during the speech should be interpreted with caution, because the duration was short and there was a lot of movement.
   Conclusions: HRV during resting state and the SPT is a possible endophenotype, but not of SAD. As other studies have shown that HRV is related to different internalizing disorders, HRV might reflect a transdiagnostic genetic vulnerability for internalizing disorders. Future research should investigate which factors influence the development of psychopathology in persons with decreased HRV.

AB Aim: To evaluate different types and degrees of malnutrition over time in a sample of children diagnosed with Infantile Anorexia (IA), based on the DC:O-3R criteria, and recently defined by DSM-5 as the first subtype of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), and to investigate the relationship between children's severity of malnutrition and emotional/behavioral development, and mothers' long-term psychopathological symptoms.
   Methods: A total of 113 children (58 boys, 55 girls), originally diagnosed with IA, and their mothers, were evaluated at four assessment points at the children's mean age of 2, 5, 7, and 11 years. Several measures were used to assess the children's growth and level of malnutrition, mothers' psychopathological symptoms and eating attitudes, as well as their children's emotional/behavioral functioning.
   Results: A steady improvement in the severity of malnutrition over time emerged, but 73% of children still had ongoing mild to moderate to severe malnutrition at 11 years of age. Moreover, the children showed increasing internalizing and externalizing emotional/behavioral problems, and their mothers' psychopathological symptoms and eating problems worsened as well over time. At 11 years of age, the girls' emotional/behavioral problems and their mothers' psychopathology and disturbed eating attitudes were more severe than that of the boys and their mothers. Finally, during the last assessment, significant associations between the mothers' psychopathology and disturbed eating attitudes, the severity of the children's malnutrition, and their emotional/behavioral problems emerged.
   Discussion: Our longitudinal study points out that the developmental course of children, originally diagnosed with IA and who received limited psychosocial treatment, is characterized by an enduring risk of malnutrition and increasing psychopathological symptoms in both, the children and their mothers, up to the sensitive period of pre-puberty.

AB Background: Obesity is a widespread problem that not only leads to medical and psychological diseases in adults, but also in children and adolescents at an early stage in life. Because of its global burden on both the individual and society, it is necessary to develop effective evidence-based treatments. Current " Multidisciplinary Obesity Treatments" (MOT) already provide significant weight loss, but still leave room for more long-lasting improvements. In this protocol paper, we outline the research goals of the WELCOME trial, based on a substantial proof of concept.
   Methods: In this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) - conducted in both an inpatient and two outpatient treatment settings -existing MOT will be supplemented with an Executive Function (EF) training and compare effects on various parameters in an experimental versus an active control group of obese youngsters (8-18 years old). WELCOME aims to (a) train youngsters' executive functions to facilitate effects on weight loss, psychological and medical comorbidities, (b) to enhance the long-term effects by continuing the training in the daily home context with booster sessions, and (c) to investigate its effects until a 6-month follow-up. In comparison to the active control group, better progress is expected in the experimental group on following variables: weight, psychological comorbidities (unhealthy eating behavior, internalizing symptoms, impaired self-esteem) and medical comorbidities (metabolic syndromes, endothelia dysfunction, tonsillar hypertrophy and sleep obstruction).
   Discussion: It is stated that this EF-training for enhancing self-control abilities is necessary for a long-lasting effect of childhood obesity treatment interventions.

AB Parental bonding and emotional regulation, while important to explain difficulties that may arise in child development, have mainly been studied at an individual level. The present study aims to examine alexithymia and parental bonding in families of adolescents with psychiatric disorders through different generations. The sample included a total of 102 adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders and their parents. In order to take a family level approach, a Latent Class Analysis was used to identify the latent relationships among alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale), perceived parental bonding (Parental Bonding Instrument) and the presence of adolescent internalizing or externalizing psychiatric symptoms (Youth Self-Report). Families of internalizing and externalizing adolescents present different and specific patterns of emotional regulation and parenting. High levels of adolescent alexithymia, along with a neglectful parenting style perceived by the adolescent and the father as well, characterized the families of patients with internalizing symptoms. On the other hand, in the families with externalizing adolescents, it was mainly the mother to remember an affectionless control parental style. These results suggest the existence of an intergenerational transmission of specific parental bonding, which may influence the emotional regulation and therefore the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms.

Here, we test the hypothesis that aberrant functional connectivity among three brain networks (salience network [SN], default mode network [DMN], and frontoparietal network [FPN]) plays a role in the pathophysiology of internalizing in ASD.
   METHODS: We examined the association between resting-state functional connectivity and internalizing in 102 adolescents and young adults with ASD (n = 49) or typical development (n = 53). Seed-to-target functional connectivity was contrasted between adolescents and young adults with ASD and typically developing subjects using a recent parcellation of the human cerebral cortex, and connections that were aberrant in ASD were analyzed dimensionally as a function of parent-reported internalizing symptoms.
   RESULTS: Three connections demonstrated robust overconnectivity in ASD: 1) the anterior insula to the retrosplenial cortex (i.e., SN-DMN), 2) the anterior insula to the frontal pole (i.e., SN-FPN), and 3) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the retrosplenial cortex (i.e., FPN-DMN). These differences remained significant after controlling for age, and no age-related effects survived correction. The SN-DMN connection was associated with greater internalizing in ASD, mediated by a bigger difference between self-and parent-reported internalizing. Control analyses found that the other two connections were not associated with internalizing, and SN-DMN connectivity was not associated with a well-matched control measure (externalizing symptoms).
   CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide novel evidence for a specific link between SN-DMN overconnectivity and internalizing in ASD. Further, the mediation results suggest that intact anterior insula-retrosplenial connectivity may play a role in an individual's generating insight into his or her own psychopathology.

AB Background: Attachment theory has long argued that insecure and disorganized attachment representations are associated with vulnerability to psychopathology in general, and depressive symptoms in particular. However, studies assessing the link between insecure and disorganized attachment and depressive symptoms report inconsistent results. The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the extent to which adult attachment representations are associated with depressive symptoms.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search for published studies using PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ProQuest in March 2017, identifying 55 samples (N = 4,386). Eligible studies assessed depression using a well-validated selfreport or clinical diagnostic measure of depression and attachment using the Adult Attachment Interview.
   Results: Results demonstrated that insecure individuals had higher levels of depression than secure-autonomous individuals (d = 0.21, 95% CI [0.08-0.33]). Specifically, insecure-preoccupied individuals (d = 0.48, 95% CI [0.30-0.65]), but not insecure-dismissing individuals (d = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.03-0.22]), exhibited significantly more depressive symptoms than the secure-autonomous individuals. Additionally, unresolved adults had higher levels of depression than adults with organized attachment classifications (d = 0.29, 95% CI [0.13-0.44]).
   Limitations: Due to the nature of the studies reviewed, causal inferences regarding the links found between adult attachment representations and depressive symptoms may not be drawn. Further, the aggregate effect sizes do not solely reflect the magnitude of the association between attachment representations and clinically-diagnosed major depressive disorder.
   Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis have important conceptual and practical implications for attachment-based prevention and intervention efforts, as they suggest that attachment representations, specifically insecure-preoccupied and unresolved, are associated with depressive symptoms in adulthood. Future research using longitudinal and intervention-based designs should examine the extent to which insecure-preoccupied and unresolved attachment lead to increased depressive symptoms, as well as the mechanisms by which these attachment patterns across the life span may increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms in adulthood.

AB A brain-computer-interface (BCI)-based attention training game system has shown promise for treating attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children with inattentive symptoms. However, little is known about brain network organizational changes underlying behavior improvement following BCI-based training. To cover this gap, we aimed to examine the topological alterations of large-scale brain functional networks induced by the 8-week BCI-based attention intervention in ADHD boys using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging method. Compared to the non-intervention (ADHD-NI) group, the intervention group (ADHD-I) showed greater reduction of inattention symptoms accompanied with differential brain network reorganizations after training. Specifically, the ADHD-NI group had increased functional connectivity (FC) within the salience/ventral attention network (SVN) and increased FC between task-positive networks (including the SVN, dorsal attention (DAN), somatomotor, and executive control network) and subcortical regions; in contrast ADHD-I group did not have this pattern. In parallel, ADHD-I group had reduced degree centrality and clustering coefficient as well as increased closeness in task-positive and the default mode networks (prefrontal regions) after the training. More importantly, these reduced local functional processing mainly in the SVN were associated with less inattentive/internalizing problems after 8-week BCI-based intervention across ADHD patients. Our findings suggest that the BCI-based attention training facilitates behavioral improvement in ADHD children by reorganizing brain functional network from more regular to more random configurations, particularly renormalizing salience network processing. Future long-term longitudinal neuroimaging studies are needed to develop the BCI-based intervention approach to promote brain maturation in ADHD.

AB Whilst associations between polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia and various phenotypic outcomes have been reported, an understanding of developmental pathways can only be gained by modelling comorbidity across psychopathology. We examine how genetic risk for schizophrenia relates to adolescent psychosis-related and internalizing psychopathology using a latent modelling approach, and compare this to genetic risk for other psychiatric disorders, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the developmental pathways at this age. PRSs for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, neuroticism and bipolar disorder were generated for individuals in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the relationships of these PRSs with psychopathology factors modelled within (i) a correlated factors structure and (ii) a bifactor structure. The schizophrenia PRS was associated with an increase in factors describing psychotic experiences, negative dimension, depression and anxiety, but, when modelling a general psychopathology factor based on these measures, specific effects above this persisted only for the negative dimension. Similar factor relationships were observed for the neuroticism PRS, with a (weak) specific effect only for anxiety once modelling general psychopathology. Psychopathology during adolescence can be described by a general psychopathology construct that captures common variance as well as by specific constructs capturing remaining non-shared variance. Schizophrenia risk genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies mainly index negative rather than positive symptom psychopathology during adolescence. This has potentially important implications both for research and risk prediction in high-risk samples.

AB Background
   Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by repetitive thinking and high rates of depression. Understanding the extent to which repetitive negative thinking in ASD reflects autistic stereotypy versus general depressive thinking patterns (e.g., rumination) could help guide treatment research to improve emotional health in ASD. We compared associations between rumination, depressive symptoms, and pupil response to social-emotional material in adults with ASD and typically developing (TD) adults with and without depression.
   Methods
   N = 53 verbally fluent young adults were recruited to three cohorts: ASD, n = 21; TD-depressed, n = 13; never-depressed TD-controls, n = 19. Participants completed Ruminative Response Scale and Beck Depression Inventory self-reports and a passive-viewing task employing emotionally-expressive faces, during which pupillary motility was assessed to quantify cognitive-affective load. Main and interactive effects of cohort, emotion condition, and time on pupil amplitude were tested via a linear mixed effects analysis of variance using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Similar procedures were used to test for effects of rumination and depressive symptoms on pupil amplitude over time within ASD.
   Results
   Responsive pupil dilation in the ASD cohort tended to be significantly lower than TD-depressed initially but increased to comparable levels by trial end. When viewing sad faces, individuals with ASD who had higher depression scores resembled TD-depressed participants' faster, larger, and sustained pupil response. Within ASD, depressive symptoms uniquely predicted early pupil response to sad faces, while rumination and depression scores each independently predicted sustained pupil response.
   Conclusions
   People with elevated depressive symptoms appear to have faster and greater increases in pupil-indexed neural activation following sad stimuli, regardless of ASD status, suggesting the utility of conceptualizing rumination as depression-like in treatment. Ruminative processes may increase more slowly in ASD, suggesting the potential utility of interventions that decrease reactions before they are uncontrollable. Findings also reinforce the importance of testing for effects of internalizing variables in broader ASD research.

AB Background: Basic parenting research reveals that child mental health is associated with optimal parenting, which is composed of three key dimensions (structure, affiliation and autonomy support). The present study aims to test the efficacy of the parenting program "How to talk so kids will listen & listen so kids will talk" (French version), thought to address all of these dimensions, in promoting children's mental health. We predict that the How-to Parenting Program will promote child mental health by fostering optimal parenting.
   Methods: In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), the seven-week parenting group was offered to parents of 5-to 12-year-old children, in their local grade school. Children's mental health assessments were questionnaire-based (parent, child and teacher reports) and took place at pre-(T1) and post-(T2) intervention as well as at 6-month (T3) and 1-year (T4) follow-ups. We compared children whose parents took part in the program with children whose parents did not take part in it until the completion of the trial (i.e., 1 year wait-list control groups). The primary outcome is children's psychological problems (externalizing and internalizing). Secondary outcomes include parenting, the putative mediator of the expected benefits of the program on child mental health, as well as positive indicators of child mental health (strengths and subjective well-being) and parents' own mental health.
   Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to test the efficacy of the "How to talk so kids will listen & listen so kids will talk" program in promoting child mental health. In addition to the close correspondence between basic parenting research and the selected program, strengths of this study include its feasibility, monitoring of potentially confounding variables, ecological validity and inclusion of positive indicators of mental health.

AB Parents' supportive emotion socialization behaviors promote children's socioemotional competence in early childhood, but the nature of parents' supportiveness may change over time, as children continue to develop their emotion-related abilities and enter contexts that require more complex and nuanced social skills and greater autonomy. To test whether associations between parents' supportiveness of children's negative emotions and children's socioemotional adjustment vary with child age, 81 parents of 3- to 6-year-old children completed questionnaires assessing their responses to children's negative emotions and their children's emotion regulation, lability, social competence, and behavioral adjustment. As predicted, child age moderated the associations between parents' supportiveness and children's socioemotional adjustment. For younger children, parents' supportiveness predicted better emotion regulation and less anxiety/internalizing and anger/externalizing problems. However, for older children, these associations were reversed, suggesting that socialization strategies which were supportive for younger children may fail to foster socioemotional competence among 5- to 6-year-old children. These results suggest the importance of considering emotion socialization as a dynamic, developmental process, and that parents' socialization of children's emotions might need to change in response to children's developing emotional competencies and social demands.

AB Despite the well-established link between parental depressive symptoms and children's internalizing symptoms, studies that divide transmission into gender-specific components remain scarce. Therefore, the present study focused on gender-specific associations between internalizing symptoms of parents and children over the course of early school age, a key stage where gender-specific roles are increasingly adopted. Participants were 272 children (49.6% girls) oversampled for internalizing symptoms. Parents completed questionnaires twice during early school age (mean age time 1 = 7.4 years; SD = 0.24; mean age time 2 = 8.5 years; SD = 0.28). Mothers and fathers separately reported on their own depressive symptoms and their child's internalizing symptoms. Latent multiple group analyses indicated gender-independent stability as well as gender-specific relations between parental and child outcomes. Maternal depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with symptoms of girls and boys, while paternal symptoms were concurrently associated only with symptoms of boys, but not of girls. Moreover, the associations between children and the parent of the same gender became more relevant over time, suggesting a growing identification with the same-gender model, particularly for fathers and boys. In regard to prospective effects, girls' internalizing symptoms at age 7 predicted paternal depressive symptoms 1 year later. In a rigorous longitudinal design, this study underscores the importance of gender specificity in the associations of internalizing symptoms between children and their mothers and fathers after controlling for symptom stability over time. The study also raises the interesting possibility that girls' internalizing symptoms elicit similar symptoms in their fathers.

AB Reports of current ADHD symptoms in adults with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD are often discrepant: While one subgroup reports a particularly high level of current ADHD symptoms, another reports-in contrast-a very low level. The reasons for this difference remain unclear. Although sex might play a moderating role, it has not yet been examined in this regard. In an epidemiological cohort study from birth to young adulthood, childhood ADHD diagnoses were assessed at the ages of 4.5, 8, and 11 years based on parent ratings. Sex-specific development of ADHD symptoms was analyzed from the age of 15 to 25 years via self-reported ADHD symptoms in participants with (n = 47) and without childhood ADHD (n = 289) using a random coefficient regression model. The congruence between parent reports and adolescents' self-ratings was examined, and the role of childhood ADHD diagnosis, childhood OCC/CD, and childhood internalizing disorder as possible sex-specific predictors of self-reported ADHD symptoms at age 25 years was investigated. With regard to self-reported ADHD symptoms, females with a childhood ADHD diagnosis reported significantly more ADHD symptoms compared to females without childhood ADHD and males with and without ADHD throughout adolescence and young adulthood. In contrast, males with childhood ADHD did not differ from control males either at age 15 or at age 25 years. Only in females did a childhood diagnosis of an externalizing disorder (ADHD and CD/ODD) predict self-reported ADHD symptoms by age 25 years. Our findings suggest that self-reports of young adults with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD are influenced by sex. Specifically, females with childhood ADHD report increased levels of ADHD symptoms upon reaching adulthood. To correctly evaluate symptoms and impairment in this subgroup, other, more objective, sources of information may be advisable, such as neurophysiological measures.

AB IMPORTANCE There are concerns that apparently healthy extremely preterm children face a risk of developing motor impairments, such as developmental coordination disorder.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prevalence of developmental coordination disorder and associated comorbidities in a national cohort of apparently healthy children born at 22 to 26 gestational weeks, compared alongside term-born peers.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, population-based cohort study included all children who were consecutively born at 22 to 26 gestational weeks in Sweden from April 1, 2004, through March 31, 2007. At 6.5 years, 441 preterm children were evaluated alongside 371 controls. A total of 275 preterm children (62.4%) and 359 term-born children (96.8%) did not have neurodevelopmental disabilities. Motor assessments were completed for 229 of 275 preterm children (83.3%) and 344 of 359 (95.8%) term-born children, who composed the final study sample.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Developmental coordination disorder was defined as a score of the fifth percentile or lower on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition scale, using control group scores. Assessment tools included the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scales, the Five to Fifteen questionnaire, and the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire.
   RESULTS Of the 229 extremely preterm children and 344 term-born controls who underwent motor assessments, 115 (50.2%) and 194 (56.4%) were boys, respectively. Developmental coordination disorder was present in 85 of 229 (37.1%) preterm children and in 19 of 344 controls (5.5%) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.92; 99% CI, 3.69-17.20). When preterm children with developmental coordination disorder were compared with term-born peers, the risk was increased for total behavioral problems, internalizing, externalizing, attentional problems, hyperactivity, perceptual problems, executive dysfunction, and poor social skills, with adjusted ORs varying from 2.66 (99% CI, 1.09-6.48) for time concepts to 9.06 (99% CI, 3.60-22.8) for attentional problems (all P < .01). When preterm children with and without developmental coordination disorder were compared, preterm children with developmental coordination disorder had more behavioral problems; the adjusted OR for total behavioral problems was 2.71 (99% CI, 1.15-6.37); for externalizing problems, 2.80 (99% CI, 1.10-7.12); for inattention, 3.38 (99% CI, 1.39-8.18); and for combined attention/hyperactivity problems, 3.68 (99% CI, 1.47-9.16) (all P < .01). Parents underestimated the children's motor problems and only a few of the children had received psychological care or physiotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children who were born extremely preterm faced a high risk for developmental coordination disorder with associated comorbidities. Our findings support the importance of a structured follow-up of motor function, behavior, and cognition. (C) 2018 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB Emotion regulation appears to play a key role in eating disorders. However, prior attempts to associate specific emotion regulation abilities with specific types of eating disorders resulted in inconsistent findings. Moreover, far less is known about emotion regulation in eating disorders during adolescence, a critical period of emotional development. The current study addresses this gap, comparing emotion regulation characteristics between adolescents with restrictive types of eating disorders and those with binge eating or purging types of eating disorders. Ninety-eight adolescents with eating disorders (49 with restrictive and 49 with binge eating/purging eating disorders) completed a set of questionnaires including the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The results revealed that binge eating/purging types of eating disorders were associated with greater difficulties in a variety of emotion regulation dimensions including impulse control, goal-directed behavior and access to effective emotion regulation strategies. Awareness and clarity of emotions were also worse in the binge eating/purging types of eating disorders, but this difference did not remain when comorbid psychopathology measures were controlled for. Moreover, the emotion regulation profile of adolescents with anorexia nervosa-binging/purging type was more similar to that of adolescents with bulimia nervosa than to that of adolescents with anorexia nervosa-restrictive type. While both restrictive and binge eating/purging eating disorders have been associated with emotion regulation difficulties, the current study shows that the presence of binge eating or purging episodes is linked with greater severity of emotion regulation deficits among adolescents with eating disorders.

AB Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are thought to reflect the high, symptomatic extreme of quantitative trait continua. However, extreme deviations in either direction on disorder continua, high and low, may both represent maladaptive behavioral and cognitive outcomes. We aimed to test this hypothesis. Method: In a population sample of 378 children, ADHD and ASD traits were rated by parents on questionnaires that provide resolution at high and low extremes of the ADHD and ASD trait continua. ADHD and ASD traits were related to parent-ratings of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and tests of cognitive functioning using polynomial regression. Results: The low ends of the ADHD and ASD trait continua were related to fewer behavior problems and better cognitive functioning than symptomatic ends. Conclusion: Studying the correlates of the low continuum ends may deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adaptive behavioral and cognitive outcomes.

AB Objective: This study (a) compared behavioral sleep problems in children with comorbid ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with those with ADHD and (b) examined child/family factors associated with sleep problems. Method: Cross-sectional study comparison of 392 children with a confirmed ADHD diagnosis (ADHD+ASD, n=93, ADHD, n=299) recruited from 21 peadiatric practises in Victoria, Australia. Data were collected from parents. Key measures included the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). Results: Children with ADHD + ASD experienced similar levels and types of behavioral sleep problems compared with those with ADHD. In both groups, the presence of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing comorbidities was associated with sleep problems. Sleep problems were also associated with parent age in the ADHD + ASD group and poorer parent mental health in the ADHD group. Conclusion: Findings suggest comorbid ASD is not associated with increased behavioral sleep problems in children with ADHD and that co-occurring internalizing and externalizing comorbidities may flag children in these groups with sleep problems.

AB Children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often show comorbid emotional and behavior problems. The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the relation between emotion control (i.e., negative emotionality, emotion awareness, and worry/rumination) and the development of internalizing and externalizing problems. Boys with and without ASD (N = 157; age 9-15) were followed over a period of 1.5 years (3 waves). We found that baseline levels of worry/rumination was a specific predictor of later externalizing problems for boys with ASD. Furthermore, the developmental trajectory of worry/rumination predicted the development of internalizing and externalizing problems in both groups. Our findings suggest that worry/rumination may constitute a transdiagnostic factor underlying both internalizing and externalizing problems in boys with and without ASD.

AB The present study investigated the stability of friendship nominations over the course of a school year as a function of early adolescents' and their classroom best friends' internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and somatization). Sample consisted of 156 early adolescents (57.1% female; age = 12.62; SD = 0.62) involved in 78 same-sex best friendship dyads. We assessed best friendship (classroom) nominations at beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the school year. Results of longitudinal analyses performed with the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model indicated adolescents' and their classroom best friends' depressive symptoms predicted lower stability of best friendships over time, whereas best friends' somatization emerged as a predictor of higher friendship stability. In addition, positive dyadic friendship quality predicted greater stability over time. These findings highlight the importance of employing a dyadic framework when examining the role of internalizing symptoms in friendship stability.

AB Evidence from the United Kingdom Millennium Cohort on children at ages 3 and 5 with older siblings addresses the questions of whether those living with both biological parents and only full siblings have better emotional and behavior outcomes than other children, and whether nonfull siblings affect children's outcomes independently of parents' partnership status. Adjusting for measured family circumstances and resources in cross-sectional regressions accounted for much of the adverse association of family complexity with child outcomes. Controlling for unobserved family and child fixed effects did not, however, attenuate all estimates further. Fixed unobservable factors appeared to be masking underlying associations. Allowing for them intensified some, albeit modest, estimates. These revealed excess externalizing behavior problems for boys with single or stepparents but only full siblings. For girls with single mothers, the chances of internalizing problems were raised. Whether siblings were full or not made little difference to outcomes in general.

AB Using a person-centered approach, this study identified profiles of students exhibiting behavior and social adjustment problems in school. We conducted Latent Profile Analysis to identify these subgroups in a sample of 582 fifth and sixth graders. We found four profiles among girls-well-adjusted girls (66.10%); girls displaying externalizing behaviors and student-teacher conflict (4.75%); girls exhibiting internalizing behaviors and isolation from peers (10.17%); and girls with student-teacher nonclose interactions and nonprosocial behaviors toward peers (18.98%). We found three profiles among boys-well-adjusted boys (78.05%); boys displaying externalizing behaviors and student-teacher conflict (10.10%); and boys with externalizing, internalizing, and social problems with peers and teachers (11.85%). Next, we investigated longitudinal associations between these profiles and student behavioral engagement and academic achievement. Path analysis revealed that, compared to students with a well-adjusted profile, having a non-adjusted profile was associated with negative changes in teacher-reported behavioral engagement. Girls with an Externalizing Problem/Student-teacher Conflict profile or an Internalizing Problems/Peer Isolation profile also showed negative changes throughout the school year in their self-reported behavioral engagement and in academic achievement. We discussed these results and their practical implications in light of existing literature.

AB Purpose: Victimization is a common problem for many children but is exacerbated for children with a developmental language disorder (DLD). However, the severity of communication problems does not explain their victimization rates. In children without DLD, difficulties with emotional competence are a risk factor for victimization and also increase the risk of bullying. In this longitudinal study, we examined the extent to which the level and development of emotional competence (understanding of one's own emotions and levels of anger, sadness, and fear) contributed to the prediction of victimization and bullying in children with and without DLD, over and above the type and severity of communication problems of children with DLD.
   Method: Clinically referred youngsters (8-16 years old) with (n = 112; 48% girls, 52% boys) and without (n = 233; 58% girls, 42% boys) DLD completed self-reports 3 times over an 18-month period. Parents of children with DLD reported on their children's communication problems.
   Results: Participants with DLD reported more victimization but comparable levels of bullying behavior compared with peers without DLD. Higher levels of sadness and fear were risk factors for more victimization in both groups. Better understanding of one's own emotions had a larger effect on less victimization in children with DLD, independent of their communication problems. In addition, increased levels of anger and lower levels of understanding of one's own emotions explained more bullying in both groups.
   Conclusion: Outcomes indicate that secondary difficulties in emotional competence in children with DLD make these children more vulnerable to victimization and warrant specific support and interventions.

AB The present review is concerned with the role of different physiological systems (e.g., skin conductance, heart rate, electromyography, and the eye-bling startle reflex) in understanding heterogeneity in conduct disorder (CD). Four subtyping approaches are considered: age of onset, comorbid psychopathology, callous-unemotional traits, and proactive/reactive aggression. Empirical findings are discussed in terms of distinct theoretical perspectives that aim to explain CD behaviors based on physiological over arousal, under-arousal, and empathy deficits. According to the studies reviewed, the callous-unemotional (CD + CU) and internalizing (CD + Internalizing) sub-types can best inform CD heterogeneity. Findings indicated that children in the CD + CU and CD + Internalizing subtypes score on opposite extremes on heart rate, skin conductance and startle reactivity measures. Heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia dysfunctions, associated with emotional dysregulation, were more evident among children in the CD + Internalizing group, while dysfunctional facial electromyography activity, which has been linked with reduced empathy, with the CD + CU group. In conclusion, it might be important to redefine CD diagnostic criteria based on physiological heterogeneity to enable the identification of distinct subtypes of CD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although anti-bullying interventions are often effective, some children continue to be victimized. To increase knowledge of potential factors that might impede children's benefiting from an anti-bullying intervention, we examined potential reasons for individual differences in victimization trajectories during a group-based anti-bullying intervention. Data stem from a five-wave survey among 9122 children (7-12 years old; grades 2-5) who participated in the KiVa anti-bullying intervention (n = 6142) or were in control schools (n = 2980 children). Three trajectories were found in the intervention sample, representing children who experienced stable high, decreasing, or stable low/no victimization. A two-trajectory model of high and low trajectories represented the control sample best. Multinomial regressions on the intervention sample showed that children who experienced particularly high levels of peer rejection, internalizing problems, and lower quality parent-child relationships decreased less in victimization; thus these characteristics appeared to contribute to persistent victimization. The results call for tailored strategies in interventions aiming to reduce victimization for more children.

AB BackgroundThe experience of childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for the development of depression. This risk is particularly heightened after exposure to additional, more contemporaneous stress. While behavioral evidence exists for this relation, little is known about biological correlates of these stress interactions. Identifying such correlates may provide biomarkers of risk for later depression.MethodsHere, we leverage behavioral, experiential, and neuroimaging data from the Duke Neurogenetics Study to identify potential biomarkers of stress exposure. Based on the past research, we were specifically interested in reward-related connectivity and the interaction of early and more recent stress. We examined psychophysiological interactions between the ventral striatum and other brain regions in relation to these stress variables, as well as measures of internalizing symptomatology (n = 926, participant age range = 18-22 years of age).ResultsWe found relatively increased reward-related functional connectivity between the left ventral striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex in individuals exposed to greater levels of childhood maltreatment who also experienced greater levels of recent life stress ( = 0.199, p < 0.005). This pattern of functional connectivity was further associated with elevated symptoms of depression ( = 0.089, p = 0.006). Furthermore, using a moderated mediation framework, we demonstrate that this functional connectivity provides a biological link between cumulative stress exposure and internalizing symptomatology.ConclusionsThese findings suggest a novel biomarker linking cumulative stress exposure with the later experience of depressive symptoms. Our results are discussed in the context of past research examining stress exposure in relation to depression.

AB Purpose/Objective: Our goal was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an app-based coaching intervention (Social Paiticipation and Navigation; SPAN) to help survivors of acquired brain injury attain social participation goals. Research Method/Design: This is a nonrandomized pilot trial of SPAN, including 15 adolescents (9 with traumatic brain injury, 6 with brain tumor) between the ages ol 14-22. The SPAN intervention consisted of a mobile app to support the development and implementation of social participation goals, weekly video-conference coaching sessions to identify goals and step-by-step action plans and online didactic materials Assessments were completed pre- and postintervention. Satisfaction with the intervention. confidence in the adolescents' ability to participate in and plan social activities and manage then emotions and behaviors and frequency and satisfaction with social participation were assessed via self- and parent-report questionnaries developed for This project. Behavior problems, social competence, and social problems were measured by using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report. Results: High levels of participant and parent satisfaction were reported. Increases in parent-reported frequency of social participation and teen-reported confidence in their ability to participate and develop social participation goals and plans were observed. A decline in parent-reported total problems internalizing problems, externalizing problems and social problems was noted. Conclusion/Implications: Results support the feasibility of the program because participants were able to successfully meet with then coaches and use the app to develop and accomplish social participation goals. Further research will be needed to refine the app and program, particularly when reaching out to populations beyond traumatic brain injury.

AB Rationale: Work-family conflict and enrichment refer to parents' challenges and benefits of combining work and family roles. Emerging evidence suggests detrimental effects of work-family conflict and facilitating effects of work-family enrichment on couple, family, and child functioning. This effect may be more pronounced in mothers, who must juggle different roles within the family and work context. To date, research has examined these relations as unidirectional, but reciprocal associations may be possible.
   Objective: This study investigated the shape and direction of associations between maternal work-family conflict and enrichment, child internalizing and externalizing problems, and inter-parental conflict.
   Method: Growth curve modelling used six waves of biennial data spanning ten years of childhood (4-5 to 14-15 years) for 2946 children and their employed mothers from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children.
   Results: Results indicated bidirectional associations between the work-family interface and child outcomes; mothers' initial work-family conflict was associated with a quadratic increase in child internalizing (but not externalizing) problems over time. Child internalizing problems at 4-5 years predicted a linear decrease in mothers' work-family enrichment over time. However, work-family enrichment at 4-5 years was not associated with the change in either child internalizing or externalizing problems. Work-family conflict and inter-parental conflict at 4-5 years were not associated with change in one another. Initial work-family enrichment was associated with a quadratic decrease in inter-parental conflict, and initial inter-parental conflict was associated with a linear increase in externalizing problems; no evident reverse association was found.
   Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the importance of the work-family interface in shaping family health outcomes. The primary direction of influence was from work-family factors to inter-parental conflict and child mental health problems. Thus, interventions aimed at promoting family-friendly work environments and policies would likely yield benefits for parents and their families.

AB Genetic predispositions play an important role in the development of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Understanding the mechanisms through which genetic risk unfolds to influence these developmental outcomes is critical for developing prevention and intervention efforts, capturing key elements of Irv's research agenda and scientific legacy. In this study, we examined the role of parenting and personality in mediating the effect of genetic risk on adolescents' major depressive disorder and conduct disorder symptoms. Longitudinal data were drawn from a sample of 709 European American adolescents and their mothers from the Collaborative Studies on Genetics of Alcoholism. Results from multivariate path analysis indicated that adolescents' depressive symptoms genome-wide polygenic scores (DS_GPS) predicted lower parental knowledge, which in turn was associated with more subsequent major depressive disorder and conduct disorder symptoms. Adolescents' DS_GPS also had indirect effects on these outcomes via personality, with a mediating effect via agreeableness but not via other dimensions of personality. Findings revealed that the pattern of associations was similar across adolescent gender. Our findings emphasize the important role of evocative gene-environment correlation processes and intermediate phenotypes in the pathways of risk from genetic predispositions to complex adolescent outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heavy parent digital technology use has been associated with suboptimal parent-child interactions and internalizing/externalizing child behavior, but directionality of associations is unclear. This study aims to investigate longitudinal bidirectional associations between parent technology use and child behavior, and understand whether this is mediated by parenting stress.
   METHODS: Participants included 183 couples with a young child (age 0-5 years, mean = 3.0 years) who completed surveys at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Cross-lagged structural equation models of parent technology interference during parent-child activities, parenting stress, and child externalizing and internalizing behavior were tested.
   RESULTS: Controlling for potential confounders, we found that across all time points (1) greater child externalizing behavior predicted greater technology interference, via greater parenting stress; and (2) technology interference often predicted greater externalizing behavior. Although associations between child internalizing behavior and technology interference were relatively weaker, bidirectional associations were more consistent for child withdrawal behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest bidirectional dynamics in which (a) parents, stressed by their child's difficult behavior, may then withdraw from parent-child interactions with technology and (b) this higher technology use during parent-child interactions may influence externalizing and withdrawal behaviors over time.

AB Background Maintaining a healthy lifestyle in adulthood has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Increasing evidence suggests that behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease are established in childhood; however, limited research has evaluated whether childhood psychological factors play a role.
   Purpose To evaluate the association between childhood psychological distress and young to mid adulthood healthy lifestyle.
   Methods Using prospective data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort, we assessed whether psychological distress in childhood (captured by internalizing and externalizing symptoms at ages 7, 11, and 16 years) predicted healthy lifestyle at ages 33 (N = 10,748) and 42 (N = 9,581) years. Healthy lifestyle was measured using an index previously demonstrated to predict cardiovascular disease, consisting of five components: absence of smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and ideal body weight.
   Results Few participants (3.8% at age 33 years and 2.8% at age 42 years) endorsed all five healthy lifestyle components. Linear regression models, adjusting for potential child- and family-level confounders, revealed that higher distress levels in childhood were negatively associated with healthy lifestyle at age 33 years (beta = -0.11, SE = 0.01, p < .001) and 42 years (beta = -0.13, SE = 0.01, p < .001). Higher distress was also associated with significantly lower odds of endorsing each lifestyle component, except physical activity, at both ages. Additional analyses indicated that childhood distress levels were highest among those whose lifestyle scores were low at age 33 and further declined between ages 33 and 42.
   Conclusions Psychological distress in childhood may indicate children at risk of less healthy lifestyle practices later in life. Although our findings are preliminary, psychological distress may also provide an important target for public health interventions aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease.

   IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Background: International guidelines recommend the use of item based scales for the assessment of pain and sedation. In our previous study, the implementation of the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS), and the associated systematic assessment and treatment of pain and sedation reduced pain and over-sedation in our intervention group, but lead to a significant increase of individual opiate exposure. This increased opiate exposure was not associated with impaired motor and mental development at one year of age. As one-year follow-up is not necessarily representative for future outcomes, we retested our sample at three years of age.
   Methods: Fifty-three patients after (intervention group) and 61 before implementation (control group) of the N-PASS and the Vienna Protocol for the Management of Neonatal Pain and Sedation (VPNPS), were compared for motor, mental and behavioural development at three-years follow-up using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.
   Results: Cumulative opiate exposure was not associated with mental (p = .31) and motor (p = .20) problems when controlling for other important medical conditions, but was associated to lower behavioural scores (p = .007). No statistically significant differences were found with regard to mental (p = .65), psychomotor (p = .12) and behavioural (p = .61) development before and after the implementation of the N-PASS and the VPNPS.
   Conclusion: Implementing a neonatal pain and sedation protocol increased opiate exposure without affecting neurodevelopmental outcome at three-years of age.

AB Very-preterm (VPT), moderately-preterm (MPT), and full-term (FT) infants' emotion-regulation behaviors were assessed via the Still-Face procedure at a corrected age of four months. As a developmental task during the first year of life, emotion regulation is important for social and cognitive development. Although substantial evidence indicates that VPT infants exhibit emotion-regulation difficulties, little is known about MPT infants' emotion regulation capabilities, this group also possibly being at risk. The participants included 135 parent-infant dyads: 46 VPT (gestational age 24-32 weeks), 51 MPT (gestational age 32-34 weeks), and 38 FT (gestational age 37-41 weeks). The infants' affect, gaze-aversion, and self-comforting behaviors were coded. Preterm infants responded to parental still face in similar fashion to F1 infants, displaying robust still-face and recovery effects. The preterm infants exhibited less developed emotion-regulation behaviors, however, manifested in less positive affect and more gaze aversion in the face-to-face and reunion episodes compared to FT infants. With respect to self-comforting behaviors, each group displayed a significantly different pattern of behaviors throughout the procedure, suggesting better emotion regulation skills among MPT infants compared to the VPT infants. The findings on gaze aversion and self-comforting behaviors could have implications for strategies to incorporate into intervention programs supporting development of emotion regulation skills.

AB Depression is associated with negative attention and attribution biases and maladaptive emotion responsivity and regulation, which adversely impact self-evaluations and interpersonal relationships. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural substrates of these impairments. We compared neural activity recruited by 126 clinically depressed and healthy adolescents (ages 11-17 years) during social exclusion (Exclusion > Inclusion) using Cyberball. Results revealed significant interaction effects within left anterior insula (AI)/inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Insula hyperresponsivity was associated with peer exclusion for depressed adolescents but peer inclusion for healthy adolescents. In additional, healthy adolescents recruited greater lateral temporal activity during peer exclusion. Complementary effect size analyses within independent parcellations offered converging evidence, as well as highlighted medium-to-large effects within subgenual/ventral anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal, lateral temporal and lateral parietal regions implicated in emotion regulation. Depressogenic neural patterns were associated with negative self-perceptions and negative information processing biases. These findings suggest a neural mechanism underlying cognitive biases in depression, as reflected by emotional hyperresponsivity and maladaptive regulation/reappraisal of negative social evaluative information. This study lends further support for salience and central executive network dysfunction underlying social threat processing, and in particular, highlights the anterior insula as a key region of disturbance in adolescent depression.

AB Purpose: To (1) describe rates of suicidal behaviors in a sample of college students, (2) evaluate sex differences, and (3) provide a preliminary examination of the unique association of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms and other mental health dimensions in relation to suicidal behaviors in college students.
   Methods: Participants were 1,704 college students from two universities who completed measures assessing mental health symptoms and suicidal behaviors (i.e., past ideation/attempts, past-year ideation, disclosure of intent to commit suicide to another person, and likelihood of a future suicide attempt).
   Results: Four percent of participants reported a previous suicide attempt and 2.2% indicated that it was likely they would attempt suicide someday. 7.5% reported thinking about killing themselves often in the past year; 41.4% of these participants reported they had never told someone they might attempt suicide. Approximately one quarter (24%) of participants were classified with suicide risk based on an empirically established cutoff score, though rates differed between women (26.1%) and men (20.4%). Women were also more likely than men to report a previous suicide attempt and to tell someone else about their suicidal ideation. In regression models, depression was the strongest correlate of suicidal behaviors. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms were unassociated with suicidal behaviors when accounting for internalizing symptoms. SCT remained significantly associated with increased suicidal behaviors beyond other mental health dimensions including depression.
   Conclusions: A substantial minority of college students report suicidal behaviors, with sex differences dependent on the specific behavior examined. This study provides the first evidence linking SCT to suicidal behaviors in young adults. (C) 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines whether fathers' parental warmth and parenting stress were associated with behavior problems when children were approximately 36-months of age, beyond the influence of maternal behaviors. Study participants were 3342 low-income fathers and mothers who participated in the Building Strong Families (BSF) study. Cross-sectional regression analyses indicated that for unmarried nonresidential families, fathers' parental warmth and parenting stress were associated with child internalizing behavior problems; and fathers' parenting stress only was marginally associated with child externalizing behavior problems. For consistently cohabiting residential fathers, only fathers' parenting stress was marginally associated with child internalizing behavior problems. No associations of fathers' parental warmth and parenting stress on either internalizing or externalizing behavior problems were observed in married families. Overall, study results suggest that fathers' parental warmth and parenting stress may have a modest positive association on the development of child internalizing behavior problems particularly in vulnerable families (i.e., families in which fathers were nonresidential).

AB Objective: To describe the trajectory of patient and caregiver mental health from diagnosis through the first year of treatment for pediatric cancer and assess whether rates of clinically relevant symptoms were elevated compared with norms. We examined mean levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in children with cancer, and depression, anxiety, and PTSS in caregivers during the first year of treatment; the proportion of patients and caregivers that scored in the clinical range at each time point; and the typical trajectory of symptoms in patients and caregivers and whether trajectories differed between individuals. Method: Families (N = 159) of children newly diagnosed with cancer (M-age = 5.6 years; range = 2-18 years) participated in a short-term prospective study. Primary caregivers provided monthly reports of their own and their children's psychological adjustment. Results: On average, children were well-adjusted. However, compared with norms, there was a higher than expected proportion of children with clinically relevant internalizing symptoms around the time of diagnosis. On average children's symptoms declined over time, though variability was observed. Caregivers were less well-adjusted on average, with a high proportion reporting clinically relevant symptoms over time for depression and anxiety. Caregiver symptoms also declined over time, though considerable variability was observed. Conclusion: Although most children remain well-adjusted during the first year of treatment, many caregivers experience clinically relevant symptoms of psychological distress. Implications for development of interventions targeting at-risk patients and caregivers are discussed. Identifying processes that predict between-family variability in trajectories of psychopathology is an important next step.

AB Study Objectives: Previous research has suggested that general anesthetics can disturb postoperative sleep patterns by affecting the sleep-wake cycle. The objective was to identify the effects of general anesthetics on sleep quality and related behavioral changes in children.
   Methods: This was a prospective, observational case-control study with children, aged 18 months to 8 years, undergoing general anesthesia for elective surgery. Participants wore an actigraph for 7 days on three occasions: prior to surgery, the immediate postoperative period, and 3 months after surgery. Data regarding behavior patterns were collected using behavioral assessments at baseline, the first postoperative week, and 3 months following surgery.
   Results: Thirty-one participants (mean age 4.8 +/- 2.0 years, 81% male) underwent urologic or otolaryngologic surgery. The median (interquartile range) anesthetic duration was 132.0 (80.0-184.0) min. No significant differences were found in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, wake time after sleep onset, or sleep onset latency between baseline, 7 day postoperative period, and the 3 month follow-up. No significant differences were found in sleep-related behavioral metrics including internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and executive functioning. Data were compared with a control group of 18 participants (mean age 5.3 +/- 1.8 years, 61% male). No significant differences were found in sleep patterns and related behavioral metrics between both groups.
   Conclusions: In this study, general anesthesia did not result in disturbed sleep or associated negative behavioral changes in otherwise healthy children undergoing elective surgeries of low complexity. Physicians can advise parents that a child's surgery and associated general anesthetic exposure may not result in significant changes in postoperative sleep patterns.

AB The challenges of transitioning into adolescence may be exacerbated for Latino youth whom, on average, often experience additional unique stressors such as discrimination and poverty. However, self-regulation traits, such as effortful control, could protect youth against the negative effects of stressors. Using a resilience framework, we examined the relations of multicultural stressors on depressive and externalizing problems in Latino youth, and tested if effortful control counteracted these relations. We hypothesized that stressors would positively predict depressive and externalizing problems, but that effortful control would compensate against these risks. Latino families with a fifth-grade child (N = 57, mean age = 10.5, 57.9% female, 83% two-parent) living in the Midwest were recruited utilizing community resources. Data were cross-sectionally analyzed using structural equation modeling in Mplus. Stressors were positively associated with depressive and externalizing problems, whereas effortful control had negative direct effects on maladjustment. Results suggest that effortful control may help counteract contextual risks commonly experienced by Latino youth.

AB Objective The present study sought to examine adolescents' perceptions of their interpersonal stressors and resources across parent, sibling, friend, and school relationships, and the longitudinal associations with self-reported adjustment after traumatic brain injury (TBI) over a 12-month period. Methods We examined the main effects of stressors and resources on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 152 adolescents who had sustained complicated mild-to-severe TBI. We also investigated the conjoint effects of stressors and resources and the moderating effects of TBI severity with stressors and resources on outcomes. Results High stressors consistently predicted worse adjustment. High resources were generally only associated with fewer internalizing symptoms. Main effects were qualified by interactions between school stressors and resources in predicting externalizing symptoms and between friend stressors and resources in predicting internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For school stressors, the effects of resources on externalizing symptoms functioned as a buffer. In comparison, the buffering effects of friend resources on internalizing and externalizing symptoms disappeared at moderate-to-high levels of friend stress. Moderating effects of TBI severity were also observed, such that as family resources increased, only adolescents with complicated mild-to-moderate TBI, but not those with severe TBI, experienced decreases in internalizing and eternalizing symptoms. Conclusion Interpersonal stressors and social support have important implications for adolescent adjustment after TBI. Adolescents with low levels of school resources, with high levels of friend stress, and who sustain severe TBI are at greatest risk for difficulties with adjustment.

AB Several studies have documented the existence of a behavioral addiction related to Video Games, which appears to be similar to other forms of addiction (gambling and substance-related) in terms of characteristics and consequences. Literature about this topic has suffered from the lack of a standard definition of this disorder before the publication of DSM-5. Thus, the prevalence of the disorder and its characteristics at the moment are unclear. The present research aimed to investigate the differences between sub-clinical problematic Video Game (VG) use and Internet use and clear Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and Internet addiction in terms of gender, amount of time spent gaming, preferential coping strategies, adjustment problems, interpersonal relations, and to identify risk factors that predict a problematic engagement in video gaming. We administered a survey containing measures about coping strategies, interpersonal relations, internalizing/externalizing problems, and Internet and Video Game addiction to 612 Italian students recruited in the four main regions of the country (age range 9-19; M = 13.94). Results show that 15.2% of participants showed a sub-clinical problematic use of Video Games, while those with a clear IGD were 2.1% (n = 13); 16.3% of them showed a sub-clinical problematic Internet use, while full-criteria Internet addiction was found in 5.9% of the sample. IGD appears to be linked to various dysfunctional outcomes including a wide range of psychological symptoms and behavioral and social problems. Also, problematic video gamers tend to preferentially adopt dysfunctional coping strategies as distraction and avoidance, so VGs seem to represent a mean to cope with problems and difficulties.

AB Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with a constellation of physical, neurocognitive, and behavioral abnormalities in offspring. The presence of internalizing (e.g., anxiety, mood disorders) and externalizing (e.g., oppositional defiant and conduct disorders) behavior problems has devastating and often long-lasting impacts on children, adolescents, and their families. The present meta-analysis explored the strength of the association between PAE and behavior problems, as well as factors that increase or mitigate risk. The current meta-analysis included 65 studies comparing children and adolescents with PAE to non- or light-exposed controls and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) samples, on a variety of internalizing and externalizing behavior outcomes. Results indicated that individuals with PAE are at increased risk for internalizing (d=0.71, medium effect) and externalizing (d=0.90, large effect) problems compared to control samples. The occurrence of total behavior problems was similar to that seen in ADHD samples. The strength of the association between internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and PAE was significantly moderated by several distinct sample characteristics, such as sample age, socioeconomic status, severity of exposure, and type of behavior problem. These findings further our understanding of the behavior problems experienced by children and adolescents with PAE.

AB Internalizing disorders are mainly defined as psychosomatic, anxiety and depression problems. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between dairy affective states and internalizing disorders in early adolescence (10-12 years old), considering the influence of sex. The participants of the study were 367 children aged between 10 and 12 (190 girls and 177 boys). The results showed that fear was the best predictor for all internalizing disorders, and the only common predictor for all of them. The prediction of boys' internalizing disorders was based only in fear, whereas the prediction for girls involved more variables besides fear. An early detection/regulation of these affective states (particularly fear) may be useful for the prevention and treatment of child internalizing disorders.

AB Prenatal adversity shapes child neurodevelopment and risk for later mental health problems. The quality of the early care environment can buffer some of the negative effects of prenatal adversity on child development. Retrospective studies, in adult samples, highlight epigenetic modifications as sentinel markers of the quality of the early care environment; however, comparable data from pediatric cohorts are lacking. Participants were drawn from the Maternal Adversity Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) study, a longitudinal cohort with measures of infant attachment, infant development, and child mental health. Children provided buccal epithelial samples (mean age = 6.99, SD = 1.33 years, n = 226), which were used for analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation and genetic variation. We used a series of linear models to describe the association between infant attachment and (a) measures of child outcome and (b) DNA methylation across the genome. Paired genetic data was used to determine the genetic contribution to DNA methylation at attachment-associated sites. Infant attachment style was associated with infant cognitive development (Mental Development Index) and behavior (Behavior Rating Scale) assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 36 months. Infant attachment style moderated the effects of prenatal adversity on Behavior Rating Scale scores at 36 months. Infant attachment was also significantly associated with a principal component that accounted for 11.9% of the variation in genome-wide DNA methylation. These effects were most apparent when comparing children with a secure versus a disorganized attachment style and most pronounced in females. The availability of paired genetic data revealed that DNA methylation at approximately half of all infant attachment-associated sites was best explained by considering both infant attachment and child genetic variation. This study provides further evidence that infant attachment can buffer some of the negative effects of early adversity on measures of infant behavior. We also highlight the interplay between infant attachment and child genotype in shaping variation in DNA methylation. Such findings provide preliminary evidence for a molecular signature of infant attachment and may help inform attachment-focused early intervention programs.

AB It is possible that findings suggesting a link between prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and anxiety symptoms in offspring are confounded by postnatal and/or shared mother-child heritability effects. Following exposure to a natural disaster, the Queensland Flood Study investigated the unique and additive effects of various types of disaster-related PNMS (objective hardship, cognitive appraisal, and subjective distress) on childhood anxiety symptomatology (internalizing and/or anxiety symptom measures). Timing of flood exposure during pregnancy and child sex were examined as potential moderators. After controlling for maternal psychosocial factors, greater objective hardship as a result of the floods was significantly associated with greater anxiety symptoms (N = 114) and marginally associated with greater internalizing behaviors (N = 115). Earlier timing of the flood in pregnancy was associated with greater anxiety symptoms. No such associations were found between any PNMS measure and teacher-rated child internalizing behaviors (N = 90). Sex and timing did not moderate associations. Our findings suggest that, in isolation, increased maternal hardship due to exposure to an independent stressor, during pregnancy, may have a programming effect on childhood anxiety symptoms.

AB Prenatal programming models have rarely been applied to research on children with prenatal substance exposure, despite evidence suggesting that prenatal drug exposure is a form of stress that impacts neurodevelopmental outcomes and risk for psychopathology. Utilizing data from two longitudinal multisite studies comprising children prenatally exposed to substances as well as a nonexposed comparison group (Maternal Lifestyle Study, n = 1,388; Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle study, n = 412), we tested whether early phenotypic indicators of hypothesized programming effects, indexed by growth parameters at birth and infant temperament, served as a link between prenatal substance exposure and internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 5. Latent profile analysis indicated that individual differences in reactivity and regulation for infants prenatally exposed to substances was best characterized by four temperament profiles. These profiles were virtually identical across two independent samples, and demonstrated unique associations with adjustment difficulties nearly 5 years later. Results of path analysis using structural equation modeling also showed that increased prenatal substance exposure was linked to poorer growth parameters at birth, profiles of temperamental reactivity in infancy, and internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 5. This pathway was partially replicated across samples. This study was among the first to link known individual-level correlates of prenatal substance exposure into a specific pathway to childhood problem behavior. Implications for the developmental origins of a child's susceptibility to psychopathology as a result of intrauterine substance exposure are discussed.

AB In 785 mother-child (50% male) pairs from a longitudinal epidemiological birth cohort, we investigated associations between inflammation-related epigenetic polygenic risk scores (i-ePGS), environmental exposures, cognitive function, and child and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. We examined prenatal and postnatal effects. For externalizing problems, one prenatal effect was found: i-ePGS at birth associated with higher externalizing problems (ages 7-15) indirectly through lower cognitive function (age 7). For internalizing problems, we identified two effects. For a prenatal effect, i-ePGS at birth associated with higher internalizing symptoms via continuity in i-ePGS at age 7. For a postnatal effect, higher postnatal adversity exposure (birth through age 7) associated with higher internalizing problems (ages 7-15) via higher i-ePGS (age 7). Hence, externalizing problems were related mainly to prenatal effects involving lower cognitive function, whereas internalizing problems appeared related to both prenatal and postnatal effects. The present study supports a link between i-ePGS and child and adolescent mental health.

AB This paper explains, first, that, since households disregard the impact in the aggregate of their fertility and education choices on the return to their own savings, the market does not implement the mix of population and skills that a planner internalizing all externalities from fertility and education would choose. It then shows that for an economy without capital over-accumulation-the empirically relevant case, cf. Abel et al. (Rev Econ Stud 56(1):1-19, 1989)-a market supplying efficiency units of labor beyond the planner's level does so by leading households to go for quality over quantity in their reproductive choices-over-investing in education and depressing fertility with respect to the planner's levels-a feature reminiscent of reproductive patterns in developed economies. It is finally shown that a pension scheme contingent to the household's fertility and education investment decentralizes the planner's allocation as an equilibrium outcome. Such pension scheme is financed through a tax on the increase in labor income that results from households education investment. Interestingly enough, the usual tax-financed compulsory education does not decentralize the planner's allocation, even when the mandatory level of education is the planner's, since it does not address the misalignment of incentives at the heart of the problem.

AB IMPORTANCE Childhood psychoticlike experiences (PLEs) are associated with greater odds of a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder during adulthood. However, no known, well-validated self-report tools have been designed to measure childhood PLEs.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the construct validity and psychometric properties of a measure of PLEs, the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child Version (PQ-BC).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This validation study used data from the firstwave of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a prospective longitudinal study aimed at assessing risk factors associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes from ages 9 to 10 years into late adolescence and early adulthood. The population-based sample of 3984 children within the ABCD data set was recruited from 20 research sites across the United States. Data for this study were collected from June 1, 2016, through August 31, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The PQ-BC Total and Distress scores were analyzed for measurement invariance across race/ethnicity and sex, their associations with measures of PLEs, and their associations with known correlates of PLEs, including internalizing and externalizing symptoms, neuropsychological test performance, and developmental milestones.
   RESULTS The study analyses included 3984 participants (1885 girls [47.3%] and 2099 boys [52.7%]; mean [SE] age, 10.0 [0.01] years). The results demonstrated measurement invariance across race/ethnicity and sex. A family history of psychotic disorder was associated with higher mean (SE) PQ-BC Total (3.883 [0.352]; beta = 0.061; 95% CI, 0.027-0.094) and Distress (10.210 [1.043]; beta = 0.051; 95% CI, 0.018-0.084) scores, whereas a family history of depression or mania was not. Higher PQ-BC scores were associated with higher rates of child-rated internalizing symptoms (Total score: beta range, 0.218 [95% CI, 0.189-0.246] to 0.273 [95% CI, 0.245-0.301]; Distress score: beta range, 0.248 [95% CI, 0.220-0.277] to 0.310 [95% CI, 0.281-0.338]), neuropsychological test performance deficits such as working memory (Total score: beta = -0.042 [95% CI, -0.077 to -0.008]; Distress score: beta = -0.051 [95% CI, -0.086 to -0.017]), and motor and speech developmental milestone delays (Total score: beta = 0.057 [95% CI, 0.026-0.086] for motor; beta = 0.042 [95% CI, 0.010-0.073] for speech; Distress score: beta = 0.048 [95% CI, 0.017-0.079] for motor; beta = 0.049 [95% CI, 0.018-0.081] for speech).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results provide support for the construct validity and demonstrate adequate psychometric properties of a self-report instrument designed to measure childhood PLEs, providing evidence that the PQ-BC may be a useful measure of early risk for psychotic disorders. Furthermore, these data suggest that PLEs at school age are associated with many of the same familial, cognitive, and emotional factors associated with psychotic symptoms in older populations, consistent with the dimensionality of psychosis across the lifespan.

AB This study focused on the interrelations among different domains of maternal adaptation (i.e., emotion-regulation difficulties, depressive symptoms, and couple-relationship satisfaction) over the transition to parenthood and also then associations with mothers' recalled childhood maternal nonsupportive emotion socialization. Data were obtained from a socioeconomically and racially diverse sample of 196 primiparous mothers during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and at 6 months postpartum. Results indicated that (a) mothers' adaptation in different domains had shared roots in then recalled childhood maternal nonsupportive emotion socialization; (b) maternal adaptation in various domains were interrelated with rather than independent of each other, and such associations were unidirectional rather than reciprocal (e.g., mothers' prenatal couple-relationship satisfaction was negatively associated with their depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum rather than the reverse); and (c) mothers' adaptation in a given domain served as the mechanism via which then recalled childhood maternal nonsupportive emotion socialization shaped their adaptation in the other domains (e.g., mothers' recalled maternal nonsupportive emotion socialization was positively associated with then depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum via its positive association with their prenatal emotion-iegulation difficulties). These associations were independent of several critical covariates (e.g., child negative affect, maternal attachment). Such findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity inherent within maternal adaptation over the transition to parenthood and highlight potential avenues for interventions aimed at promoting mothers' successful navigation of challenges over this transition.

AB Introduction: Researchers have identified a variety of motivations for solitude and for social withdrawal. These motivations may differ across cultures. The purpose of this study was to explore Ugandan adolescents' descriptions of solitude and social withdrawal, with the aim of guiding future research on social withdrawal in Uganda.
   Methods: Ugandan adolescents' (M = 14.23 years old, SD = 1.63 years) descriptions of solitude and social withdrawal were investigated in a cross-sectional, exploratory study. The sample (N = 219 [106 girls, 90 boys, 23 missing sex data]) was drawn from two primary schools and a secondary school in Eastern Uganda. Adolescents' responses to open-ended questionnaire items about general solitude, conflicted motivations for social withdrawal, and non-conflicted motivation for social withdrawal were coded and categorized.
   Results: Some of the adolescents' descriptions were consistent with the literature. For example, they described shyness and internalizing emotions, externalizing and socially incompetent behaviors, and poor peer relationships. Some descriptions were unique and likely reflected Uganda's challenges, for instance, family or household factors such as being an orphan.
   Conclusions: Results underscored the importance of exploring contextual processes (e.g., parental loss) that might affect Ugandan adolescents' solitude. More generally, the results suggested that solitude should be researched using a broad, synergistic lens that incorporates potential determinants from adolescents and their environments at multiple levels (e.g., person, peer, household, culture).

AB BackgroundWe modeled both psychopathology and executive function (EF) as bi-factor models to study if EF impairments are transdiagnostic or relate to individual syndromes, and concurrently, if such associations are with general EF or specific EF impairments.MethodsData were obtained from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS; N = 2230). Psychopathology was assessed with parent-report questionnaires at ages 11, 14, 16, and 19, and EF with tasks from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program at ages 11 and 19. Bi-factor models were fitted to the data using confirmatory factor analysis. Correlations were estimated to study the associations between general or specific components of both psychopathology and EF.ResultsA bi-factor model with a general psychopathology factor, alongside internalizing (INT), externalizing, attention deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), and autism spectrum (ASD) problem domains, and a bi-factor model with a general EF factor, alongside specific EFs were adequately fitting measurement models. The best-fitting model between EF and psychopathology showed substantial associations of specific EFs with the general psychopathology factor, in addition to distinct patterns of association with ASD, ADHD, and INT problems.ConclusionsBy studying very diverse psychopathology domains simultaneously, we show how EF impairments cross diagnostic boundaries. In addition to this generic relation, ADHD, ASD, and INT symptomatology show separable profiles of EF impairments. Thus, inconsistent findings in the literature may be explained by substantial transdiagnostic EF impairments. Whether general EF or specific EFs are related to psychopathology needs to be further studied, as differences in fit between these models were small.

AB In this study we examined the association between Arab mothers' self-efficacy and parenting attitudes and their children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and whether these associations are mediated by the use of corporal punishment. Further, we examined whether the child's gender moderates these associations. We included 2380 mothers of kindergartners who answered a questionnaire assessing levels of self-efficacy, attitudes on corporal punishment, use of corporal punishment, and their children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Using structural equation modeling we tested for the mediation by corporal punishment of the association between self-efficacy, attitudes on corporal punishment and children's behaviors. We further tested possible moderation by gender of the model. Results supported the hypothesized mediation effect of corporal punishment. Results suggest that mothers' low self-efficacy and attitudes supporting corporal punishment were associated with elevated likelihood of use of corporal punishment which, in turn was associated with elevated levels of child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. No moderation by gender of this pathway was found, suggesting that boys and girls react similarly to the use of corporal punishment by their mothers. Interventions aimed at helping Arab mothers understand the impact of their behavior and guide them toward effective disciplinary strategies are suggested.

AB Stress in children and adolescents is common and related to many developmental problems. However, most studies have made no distinction between temporary or chronic stress due to the lack of a suitable questionnaire. This study tested the factor structure, reliability and validity of the 17-item self-report Chronic Stress Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (CSQ-CA) in three samples, that is, 717 adolescents from the general population, 161 adolescents of parents with a severe chronic medical condition (CMC) like multiple sclerosis, and 113 adolescents with healthy parents. Results showed that a one-factor solution provided a reasonable fit overall. Reliability was good (alpha = .80 to .88). Convergent validity was supported by positive relations between total stress scores and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, experience of daily hassles, and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and negative relations with quality of life, happiness, mindfulness, self-esteem, and coping skills. Adolescents from all samples, who themselves had a light CMC like asthma, showed higher chronic stress levels than those without a CMC. In line, adolescents of parents with a severe CMC reported more chronic stress than those of healthy parents, and adolescents with a chronic illness themselves and a parent with a chronic illness, showed the highest scores across the two family types. Overall, this study presents good psychometric properties of the first available measure of chronic stress in children and adolescents.

AB Emotional and behavioral maturity expectations increase as children transition to primary school; thus, maternal responses that support and encourage children's expression of negative emotion may not benefit school-age children as much as preschoolers. The current study explored a change in the utility of these maternal responses among 187 families (62 5-year-olds, 75 6-year-olds, and 50 7-year-olds). Mothers reported on their responses to children's negative emotions and children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors at two time points over 1 year. Multiple group analysis within cross-lagged path models revealed a positive association between non-supportive maternal responses and later child externalizing behaviors among 5-year-olds. However, non-supportive responses were related to decreases in externalizing behaviors among the 7-year-olds. Discrepant findings between the 5- and 7-year-olds may represent a developmental shift in the function of mothers' emotion socialization practices.

AB Parents' reactions to children's emotions shape their psychosocial outcomes. Extant research on emotion socialization primarily uses variable-centered approaches. This study explores family patterns of maternal and paternal responses to children's sadness in relation to psychosocial outcomes in middle childhood. Fifty-one families with 8- to 12-year-old children participated. Mothers and fathers reported their reactions to children's sadness and children's social competence and psychological adjustment. Cluster analyses revealed three family patterns: Supportive (high supportive and low non-supportive reactions from both parents), Not Supportive (low supportive reactions from both parents), and Father Dominant (high paternal supportive and non-supportive reactions, low maternal supportive and non-supportive reactions). Supportive families had children with higher social competence and more internalizing symptoms whereas Father Dominant families had children with lower social competence and fewer internalizing symptoms. Not Supportive families had children with average social competence and fewer internalizing symptoms. Findings are discussed in relation to the divergence model which proposes that a diverse range of parental responses to children's sadness, rather than a uniformly supportive approach, may facilitate children's psychosocial adjustment.

AB Stably elevated behavioral inhibition (BI) is an established risk factor for internalizing disorders. This stability may be related to genetic factors, including a valine-to-methionine substitution on codon 66 (val66met) of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. Past work on the BDNF met variant has inconsistently linked it to vulnerability to internalizing problems; some of this inconsistency may stem from the failure to consider gene-trait interactions in shaping the course of early BI. Toward elucidating early pathways to anxiety vulnerability, we examined gene-by-trait interactions in predicting the course of BI over time in 476 children, assessed for BI using standardized laboratory methods. We found that children with the met allele showed lower stability of BI between ages 3 and 6 than those without this allele. While the mechanisms that underlie this effect are unclear, our findings are consistent with the notion that the met variant, in the context of early BI, influences the stability of this trait in early development.

AB ObjectiveMaternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) has been associated with offspring internalizing and externalizing disorders. The purpose of this research is to examine whether MSDP is also associated with variations in normal personality traits in childhood and adulthood.
   MethodThis study uses four independent samples (total N=16,323) to examine whether there are mean-level differences in offspring personality traits by MSDP, controlling for relevant sociodemographic factors. Two samples are of children (Ns=3,782 and 3,841) and two samples are of adults (Ns=1,786 and 6,914).
   ResultsA meta-analysis across the four samples indicated that offspring of mothers who did smoke during pregnancy scored higher in Neuroticism (p=.000) and Extraversion (p=.003) and lower in Conscientiousness (p=.002) than offspring of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy. The association between MSDP and Neuroticism and Conscientiousness held across both childhood and adulthood and when propensity score matching was used, whereas the association with Extraversion was only apparent in adulthood and did not hold with propensity scores.
   ConclusionsThese results suggest that MSDP is associated with individual differences in psychological traits in childhood and adulthood and may be one prenatal factor that contributes to trait Neuroticism and Conscientiousness.

AB This study tests a theoretical cascade model in which multiple dimensions of facilitator delivery predict indicators of participant responsiveness, which in turn lead to improvements in targeted program outcomes. An effectiveness trial of the 10-session New Beginnings Program for divorcing families was implemented in partnership with four county-level family courts. This study included 366 families assigned to the intervention condition who attended at least one session. Independent observers provided ratings of program delivery (i.e., fidelity to the curriculum and process quality). Facilitators reported on parent attendance and parents' competence in home practice of program skills. At pretest and posttest, children reported on parenting and parents reported child mental health. We hypothesized effects of quality on attendance, fidelity and attendance on home practice, and home practice on improvements in parenting and child mental health. Structural Equation Modeling with mediation and moderation analyses were used to test these associations. Results indicated quality was significantly associated with attendance, and attendance moderated the effect of fidelity on home practice. Home practice was a significant mediator of the links between fidelity and improvements in parent-child relationship quality and child externalizing and internalizing problems. Findings provide support for fidelity to the curriculum, process quality, attendance, and home practice as valid predictors of program outcomes for mothers and fathers. Future directions for assessing implementation in community settings are discussed.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate whether experiences of high betrayal trauma (BT; maltreatment by a parent/caregiver) during mothers' own childhoods may influence the inter-generational transmission of maltreatment and its associated psychopathology from mothers to their children. A prospective, longitudinal design was utilized to assess maternal physical and sexual betrayal trauma in relation to children's own maltreatment experiences, and child mood and behavioral symptoms during pre-adolescence. Data from 706 mothers and children who participated in the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) was analyzed, including: mothers' physical and sexual maltreatment histories, child protective services' documented physical and sexual maltreatment during children's first twelve years of life, and mother and child-reports of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 12. Children of mothers who survived high BT (maltreatment by a caregiver) were 4.52 times more likely to experience maltreatment than children of no BT mothers (mothers whom were not maltreated), and 1.58 times more likely than children whose mothers survived low BT (maltreatment by a non caregiver). Higher levels of maternal physical BT significantly predicted more internalizing and externalizing symptoms in children at age 12, according to both mother (CBCL) and child (YSR) reports. More incidents of child physical maltreatment partially mediated associations between maternal physical BT and child symptoms. Incidents of sexual maltreatment also partially mediated associations between maternal sexual BT and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms (CBCL only). These findings have implications for understanding the role of betrayal trauma in perpetuating the cycle of maltreatment across generations.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are important public health concerns, with links to higher prevalence rates of both health-risk behaviors and physical health difficulties in adulthood. Research has demonstrated an association between early adversity and long-term health-risk behavior development. The current study assessed the role of emotion dysregulation and facets of impulsivity as potential mediators in the relation between ACEs and general health-risk behaviors, including alcohol-related consequences and risky sexual behavior. College students (N = 668) completed online questionnaires that assessed history of ACES, emotion regulation difficulties, impulsivity under extreme affect, and current engagement in health-risk behaviors. Emotion dysregulation and impulsivity under extreme positive emotion, but not negative emotion, demonstrated a significant serial mediation between ACEs and alcohol-related consequences. Results also suggest that emotion dysregulation mediates the relation between early adversity and all three outcomes (i.e., overall engagement in maladaptive behavior, alcohol related consequences, and risky sexual behavior). Impulsivity under positive or negative affect did not demonstrate a mediation effect on the three outcomes. Results of this study highlight the importance of assessing for emotion regulation skills when working with young adults with histories of adversity.

AB Findings from the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE)study articulated the negative effects of childhood trauma on long-term well-being. The purpose of the current study is to examine the associations between ACEs experienced in infancy and toddlerhood and adaptive behavior and academic status in middle childhood. We used data collected from a sample of low-income families during the impacts study of Early Head Start (EHS). Data were collected by trained interviewers demonstrating at least 85% reliability with protocols. Data come from 1469 sociodemographically diverse mothers and children collected at or near ages 1, 2, 3, and 11. At ages 1, 2, and 3, an EHS-ACEs index was created based on interview and observation items. The EHSACEs indices were averaged to represent exposure across infancy and toddlerhood. At age 11, parents were asked about school outcomes and completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Across development, children were exposed to zero (19%), one (31%), two (27%), and three or more ACEs (23%). Logistic regression analyses, controlling for EHS program assignment, and parent, school, and child characteristics, showed ACEs were significantly associated with parental report of the child: having an individualized educational program since starting school and in the current school year, having been retained a grade in school, and problems with externalizing and internalizing behavior, as well as attention. Findings suggest that ACEs influence children's behavioral and academic outcomes early in development.

AB Children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are at increased risk for developing poor relationships with people around them, but the longitudinal links between ODD symptoms and subsequent interpersonal functioning remain unclear. In the current study, we examined the bidirectional associations between ODD symptoms and children's relationships with parents, peers, and teachers. We included separate analyses for parent vs. teacher reports of ODD symptoms, with regard to subsequent interpersonal relationships. Participants included 256 children with ODD, recruited in China, along with their parents and teachers, assessed at three time points roughly two years apart. Parents and teachers reported child ODD symptoms at each time point, and children reported their perceptions of father- and mother-child attachment, peer relationships, and teacher-student relationships across the three time points. ODD symptoms reported either by parents or teachers predicted impairments in interpersonal functioning. Meanwhile, child interpersonal impairments with peers and teachers predicted subsequent increase in teacher-reported ODD symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of transactional models of influence-and of considering early intervention for ODD in protecting children from developing further deficits and impairments. Additionally, we discuss the perspectives of multiple informants on ODD symptoms, including their different patterns of association with subsequent interpersonal relationships.

AB The present study sought to clarify the trajectory (i.e., continuous vs. discontinuous) and expression (i.e., homotypic vs. heterotypic) of anxiety and depressive symptoms across childhood and adolescence. We utilized a state-of-the-science analytic approach to simultaneously test theoretical models that describe the development of internalizing symptoms in youth. In a sample of 636 children (53% female; M (age) = 7.04; SD (age) = 0.35) self-report measures of anxiety and depression were completed annually by youth through their freshman year of high school. For both anxiety and depression, a piecewise growth curve model provided the best fit for the data, with symptoms decreasing until age 12 (the "developmental knot") and then increasing into early adolescence. The trajectory of anxiety symptoms was best described by a discontinuous homotypic pattern in which childhood anxiety predicted adolescent anxiety. For depression, two distinct pathways were discovered: A discontinuous homotypic pathway in which childhood depression predicted adolescent depression and a discontinuous heterotypic pathway in which childhood anxiety predicted adolescent depression. Analytical, methodological, and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Experiencing an early pubertal transition has been shown to increase the risk for internalizing and externalizing outcomes among girls. It is less clear how the expectations of other individuals can be critical determinants of vulnerability for early developers. This study used an experimental design to examine whether the expectations of teachers might be influenced by girls' pubertal timing (early, on-time, late) and race (Black, White). Elementary school teachers (N = 220; M-age = 43 years; 91% female; 84% White) were randomly shown behavior vignettes consisting of drawings of girls in varying stages of pubertal development. They then rated each girl's future academic/social functioning. Results demonstrated that teachers expected White and Black early developers to have more academic/social problems. Teachers also ascribed more academic/social problems to Black early developers relative to White early developers. The findings offer new insights into the synergistic linkages between pubertal timing and teachers' expectations, with girls' race accentuating this relationship.

AB Increased rates of clinically significant internalizing disorders (obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression) have been demonstrated in males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and a Duchenne muscular dystrophy neuropsychiatric syndrome has been suggested. Although symptoms of depression are widely recognized, some of the other internalizing symptoms are less frequently identified. Through a retrospective chart review of 107 males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we identified 15 patients with obsessive compulsive disorder spectrum symptoms; 11 of those also had anxiety symptoms. Many of these patients received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment, commonly noting improvement in symptoms. Here we describe the clinical features of several patients in detail to facilitate early recognition and consideration for treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and internalizing psychiatric symptoms. The results of this cohort showed a significantly increased rate of obsessive compulsive disorder spectrum symptoms (14%) compared to the general population.

AB Although parents have a strong influence on their children's religiosity, little research has been conducted on how different parental anxiety and depressive problems affect the transmission of religiosity. The current study asked emerging adults to report on the religiosity and internalizing behaviors of their mothers and fathers as well as their own religiosity. Structural equation modeling was used to measure whether perceived parental internalizing problems, parent gender, and participant gender moderated the relationship between parental and emerging adult religiosity. Results indicated that the interaction terms between perceived maternal religiosity and both depressive and anxiety problems were significant only for females. Participant gender did not suggest a three-way interaction among variables, though parent gender did as the interaction term between maternal religiosity and both anxiety and depressive problems were significantly stronger than paternal ones.

AB Background: Adverse family environments confer susceptibility to virtually all psychiatric problems. This study evaluated two possible models to explain this diversity of associations. Stressful family circumstances during childhood could either activate general, transdiagnostic liabilities to mental disorder or promote numerous disorder-specific liabilities. Methods: We recruited a high-risk sample of 815 mother-offspring pairs and assessed social stressors in the family context prospectively from the perinatal period through offspring age 5. We factor analyzed offspring mental disorder diagnoses at age 20 to parse transdiagnostic and disorder-specific dimensions of psychopathology. Results: Structural analyses revealed nearly equivalent prospective effects of early family stress on overarching Internalizing (beta = .30) and Externalizing (beta = .29) dimensions. In contrast, there was no evidence of disorder-specific effects. Conclusions: Social stressors early in life activate transdiagnostic, and not disorder-specific, liabilities to psychopathology. A focus on higher-order dimensions of psychopathology could accelerate etiological research and intervention efforts for stress-linked mental disorders.

AB It is not uncommon for caregivers and adolescents to provide different perspectives of adolescents' mental health symptoms; however, few studies have examined these discrepancies, especially between foster parents and adolescents in the child welfare system. The goal of this study was to investigate the levels of disagreement on adolescent mental health symptoms among caregivers and adolescents in foster care, to examine factors associated with caregiver-adolescent discrepancies, and the potential moderating role of caregiver-child closeness on the link between the length of time the youth lived with caregivers and discrepancies regarding adolescent mental health symptoms. These research questions were examined using two measures of adolescent-caregiver disagreement, intraclass correlations and discrepancy scores, using data from a nationally representative study of youth involved with the child welfare system. Analyses of 183 adolescent-caregiver dyads revealed caregiver-adolescent disagreement on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with caregivers reporting higher levels of adolescents' problems on average. Adolescent gender, type of maltreatment experienced, and placement type were associated with caregiver-adolescent discrepancies. Results also indicated that closeness with caregivers significantly moderated the relationship between the length of time adolescents lived with their caregivers and discrepancies on adolescent externalizing symptoms.

AB Chronic tic disorders (TD) are associated with a number of psychological problems such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) as well as anxious and depressive symptoms. ODD is often considered a risk factor for many psychological symptoms and recent work suggests that different ODD dimensions show independent predictions of later psychological problems. This study examined the longitudinal predictions between ODD dimensions of Irritability and Defiance and the most frequent comorbidities in TD from childhood to early adulthood. From an initial sample of 135, parent reports were obtained on 58 participants with TD using standard clinical questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Defiance symptoms decreased from baseline to follow-up whereas Irritability symptoms were more stable over time. In multiple regressions, Irritability in childhood predicted anxiety and OCB in early adulthood while Defiance in childhood predicted ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms in early adulthood. No developmental link was found for depressive symptoms. Results indicate that ODD dimensions are developmentally linked to both internalizing and externalizing adult mental health symptoms in TD.

AB Insecure attachment is linked to a host of negative child outcomes, including internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P) is a manualized, video-based, eight unit, group parenting intervention to promote children's attachment security. COS-P was designed to be easily implemented, so as to make attachment interventions more widely available to families. We present the theoretical background of COS-P, research evidence supporting the COS approach, as well as a description of the COS-P intervention protocol. The case example of Alexa, mother of three children (aged 7, 6, and 4 years), illustrates how parents can make use of the COS-P intervention to better understand children's needs, build skills in observing and interpreting children's signals, learn to recognize and regulate their own responses to their children, and learn new ways of responding to children's needs.

AB Cannabis use among youth is of significant concern given the potential negative health impacts on young people. This study describes the mental health characteristics, cannabis use, and substance use profiles of youth aged 14 to 24 years seen at the Youth Addiction and Concurrent Disorders Service at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, through an age and gender lens. Almost all participating youth indicated lifetime cannabis use. Substance use and mental health profiles among those indicating a history of cannabis use differed along sex and age. Male youth were more likely to use cannabis more frequently, while female youth were more likely to use greater variety of substances and display more co-occurring mental health problems. Adolescent problematic substance use tended to co-occur with externalizing problems whereas problematic young adult substance use tended to co-occur with internalizing problems. Implications for the integrated, coordinated care of substance use and mental health concerns, with attention to the unique needs of subgroups of youth, are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to explore the longitudinal relation between internalizing symptoms and academic achievement, as two processes of children and youth development, among children in Norway, and whether having an immigrant background moderated this association. Data collected from 4,458 students in Norway in four waves over three years were analyzed with multi-group latent growth curve modeling (LGM). Results showed that internalizing symptoms level remained unchanged over time both for immigrant and non-immigrant children, while levels of academic achievement increased only for children of immigrants with both parents born outside of Norway. Further analyses supported a reciprocal relation between internalizing symptoms and academic achievement and revealed that the initial level of academic achievement predicted the rate of change in internalizing symptoms over time, but not vice versa. Moreover, immigrant background did not moderate the associations in the model, however, children of immigrants with both parents born abroad initially had lower levels of academic achievement, but showed an increase in academic achievement, compared to their non-immigrant peers as well as to peers with one native-born parent after controlling for gender and their grade at the first observation. The implications for policy and practice were discussed.

AB Neurodevelopmental outcomes including behavior, executive functioning, and IQ exhibit complex correlational structures, although they are often treated as independent in etiologic studies. We performed a principal components analysis of the behavioral assessment system for children, the behavior rating inventory of executive functioning, and the Wechsler scales of intelligence in a prospective birth cohort, and estimated associations with early life characteristics. We identified seven factors: (1) impulsivity and externalizing, (2) executive functioning, (3) internalizing, (4) perceptual reasoning, (5) adaptability, (6) processing speed, and (7) verbal intelligence. Prenatal fish consumption, maternal education, preterm birth, and the home environment were important predictors of various neurodevelopmental factors. Although maternal smoking was associated with more adverse externalizing, executive functioning, and adaptive composite scores in our sample, of the orthogonally-rotated factors, smoking was only associated with the impulsivity and externalizing factor ( - 0.82, 95% CI - 1.42, - 0.23). These differences may be due to correlations among outcomes that were accounted for by using a phenotypic approach. Dimension reduction may improve upon traditional approaches by accounting for correlations among neurodevelopmental traits.

AB It has been suggested that the structure of psychiatric phenomena can be reduced to a few symptom dimensions. These proposals, mainly based on epidemiological samples, may not apply to clinical populations. We tested the structure of psychiatric symptoms across two pediatric clinical samples from England (N = 8434) and Norway (N = 5866). Confirmatory factor analyses of the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) evaluated the relative fit of several models, including a first-order model, a second-order model with the widely-established broad symptom dimensions of internalizing-externalizing, and two bi-factor models capturing a general psychopathology factor. Predictive value of the SDQ subscales for psychiatric disorders was examined. A first-order five-factor solution better fit the data. The expected SDQ subscale(s) related best to the corresponding psychiatric diagnosis. In pediatric clinical samples, a granular approach to psychiatric symptoms where several dimensions are considered seems to fit the data better than models based on lumping symptoms into internalizing/externalizing dimensions.

AB The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the course of sexualized behavior problems (SBP) over 2 years in a sample comprised of 104 children aged 2-12, including 62 children with histories of child sexual abuse (CSA). Parents completed questionnaires assessing SBP, internalizing and externalizing difficulties at baseline, as well as 2 years later. In more than half (56.7%) of children with clinically significant SBP at baseline, sexualized behaviors persisted and remained at a clinically significant level over time. In children with CSA, 48.4% presented persistent SBP, 27.4% presented transitory SBP, while 19.4% did not present clinically significant SBP at either time. CSA increased the relative risk of persistent SBP 3.29 times, and for each one-unit increase in scores of externalizing difficulties, the odds of persistent SBP increased by 21%. The findings suggest that SBP consequent to CSA, especially when it co-occurs with externalizing difficulties, is likely to remain at levels warranting clinical intervention.

AB Emotional and behavioral problems (EBP) during childhood and adolescence are a common concern for parents and mental health stakeholders. However, little has been documented about their prevalence in Kenyan children and adolescents. This study aimed to close this gap. The study included Child Behavior Checklist reports from 1022 Kenyan parents on their children (ages 6-18 years) and Youth Self-Reports from 533 adolescents (ages 12-18) living in Kenya's Central Province. EBP in Kenya are highly prevalent compared to multi-cultural standards for parent reports, with 27 and 17% scoring in the borderline and clinical range, respectively. Based on parent reports, younger children scored higher on EBP than older children, and higher on internalizing problems. Based on self-reports girls scored higher than boys, particularly on internalizing problems. The study provides evidence on elevated parent-reported EBP in Kenyan youths. Mental health providers should focus on interventions that reduce EBP in Kenyan youths.

AB Many emerging adults, particularly those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, struggle to manage the developmental and contextual changes that accompany the transition to university. We examined new students' formation of positive peer relationships as facilitators of their good university adjustment and as buffers of their ADHD symptom levels. Participants were 571 new university students who had moved away from home to attend university. Sociometric procedures indexed participants' social acceptance and reciprocated friendships with university peers. Participants completed questionnaires on ADHD symptoms, internalizing difficulties, and attachment to university. Academic transcripts were obtained from the registrar. Students with high ADHD symptoms displayed poorer adjustment overall. However, peer acceptance and reciprocated friendships incrementally predicted better attachment to university, while peer acceptance predicted higher year-end grade point average. Buffering effects of friendships on internalizing difficulties and attachment to university were strongest for those with high ADHD symptoms. Implications for service provision are discussed.

AB Introduction: Cigarette use among young adults continues to rise. As young adults transition to college and assume other adult roles and responsibilities, they are at risk for the development of mental health problems and for the progression of substance use problems. Previous studies suggest that individual differences in negative and positive mood contribute to cigarette use in established college-aged smokers, but less is known whether fluctuations in mood influence daily cigarette use, controlling for trait levels of internalizing symptoms and nicotine dependence.
   Methods: Data for this study came from a sample of college students (N = 39, 59% female, mean age 20.4 years) who reported regular cigarette use and participated in a 21-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study assessing within-individual variation in cigarette use and mood.
   Results: A three-level hierarchical linear model accounting for the structure of 1896 occasions of cigarette use nested within days and individuals indicated that within-individual variability in positive mood was associated with cigarette use at each occasion, after taking into account baseline levels of nicotine dependence and internalizing problems.
   Conclusions: Daily shifts in positive moods are importantly associated with consuming cigarettes throughout the day.

AB To guide recruitment, the ABCD Study requires a method for identifying children at high risk for early-onset substance use that may be utilized during the recruitment process. This study was undertaken to inform the development of a brief screen for identifying youths' risk of early-onset substance use and other adverse outcomes. To be acceptable by participants in this context, consideration of potential items was limited to child characteristics previously determined to be potentially pertinent and parental cigarette smoking. To focus the analyses on a single target substance use outcome pertinent to the stated goals of the ABCD Study, early-onset marijuana use was selected. Utilizing data collected prior to the initiation of the ABCD Study, four longitudinal data sets were used in nine secondary data analyses to test, replicate and validate a brief screening assessment for boys and girls to identify those at risk for early-onset marijuana use by ages 14-15. The combination of child externalizing problems reported by the parent (4 items: destroys things belonging to his/her family or others; disobedience at school; lying or cheating; steals outside the home) and parent smoking (1 item) proved to be the optimal screen. This was largely replicated across the four data sets. Indicators of predictive efficiency were modest in magnitude and statistically significant in 8 out of the 9 analyses. The results informed the screen's optimal threshold for identifying children at risk for early-onset marijuana use. The addition of child internalizing problems did not improve these predictions. Further analyses showed the predictive utility of the screen for several other substance use outcomes at ages 15 to 18, including alcohol and nicotine use. The results support the use of a short screening assessment to identify youth at risk for early-onset substance use in the ABCD Study and other research.

AB There are numerous empirical studies demonstrating that agreement between parent-reports of youth and youth self-reports of internalizing behavior problems is modest at best. This has spurred much research on factors that influence the magnitude of associations between informants, including individual difference characteristics of the informants and contexts through which individuals interact with the child. There is also tremendous interest in understanding symptom trajectories longitudinally. However, each of these lines of work are predicated on the assumptions that the psychometric construct that is being assessed from each informant and at each measurement occasion is the same. This study examined measurement invariance between maternal and child reports and longitudinally across ages 9 and 12 on five dimensions of anxiety using the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Disorders (SCARED; Birmaher et al., 1999). No cross-informant models for anxiety dimensions achieved acceptable fit and at least partial metric and scalar invariance. Moreover, few longitudinal models demonstrated acceptable fit and at least partial metric and scalar invariance. Thus, using the SCARED as an example, these results show that inter-informant agreement may be compromised by different item functioning, and highlight the need for testing invariance before using measures for longitudinal tracking of symptoms.

AB Background: A model for statewide dissemination of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for traumatized youth was piloted and taken to scale across North Carolina (NC). This article describes the implementation platform developed, piloted, and evaluated by the NC Child Treatment Program to train agency providers in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy using the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress Learning Collaborative (LC) Model on Adoption & Implementation of EBTs. This type of LC incorporates adult learning principles to enhance clinical skills development as part of training and many key implementation science strategies while working with agencies and clinicians to implement and sustain the new practice.
   Methods: Clinicians (n = 124) from northeastern NC were enrolled in one of two TF-CBT LCs that lasted 12 months each. During the LC clinicians were expected to take at least two clients through TF-CBT treatment with fidelity and outcomes monitoring by trainers who offered consultation by phone and during trainings. Participating clinicians initiated treatment with 281 clients. The relationship of clinician and client characteristics to treatment fidelity and outcomes was examined using hierarchical linear regression.
   Results: One hundred eleven clinicians completed general training on trauma assessment batteries and TF-CBT. Sixty-five clinicians met all mastery and fidelity requirements to meet roster criteria. One hundred fifty-six (55%) clients had fidelity-monitored assessment and TF-CBT. Child externalizing, internalizing, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as parent distress levels, decreased significantly with treatment fidelity moderating child PTSD outcomes. Since this pilot, 11 additional cohorts of TF-CBT providers have been trained to these roster criteria.
   Conclusion: Scaling up or outcomes-oriented implementation appears best accomplished when training incorporates: 1) practice-based learning, 2) fidelity coaching, 3) clinical assessment and outcomes-oriented treatment, 4) organizational skill-building to address barriers for agencies, and 5) linking clients to trained clinicians via an online provider roster. Demonstrating clinician performance and client outcomes in this pilot and subsequent cohorts led to legislative support for dissemination of a service array of EBTs by the NC Child Treatment Program.

AB Background: Numerous industries use organic solvents, and many workers from various occupational sectors are exposed to these known neurotoxicants, including pregnant women. Our objective is to explore whether occupational exposure of pregnant women to solvents may impair the neurodevelopment of their babies and consequently affect their behavior in childhood.
   Methods: Within the French birth cohort PELAGIE, parents assessed their children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors using items from the Child Behavior Checklist and the Preschool Social Behavior Questionnaire at age 2, and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 6. The occupational exposure to solvents of the pregnant women was self-reported prospectively at the beginning of their pregnancy (N = 715). We applied structural equation modeling to capture the longitudinal association of prenatal exposure to solvents with children's behavioral traits at 2 and 6 years.
   Results: Increased externalizing behavior score at age 2 was associated with prenatal exposure to solvents (standardized score: 0.34 (95% CI = 0.11, 0.57) for occasional exposure and 0.26 (0.05, 0.48) for regular exposure). This association was attenuated at age 6 (0.22 (-0.02, 0.47) for occasional exposure and 0.07 (-0.14, 0.28) for regular exposure). No association was observed for internalizing behavior.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women's occupational exposure to solvents may affect their children's behavior in early childhood. This effect may be attenuated with aging or diluted by the effects of other postnatal predictors.

AB To date, more than 11 million Syrians have been forced from their homes due to the civil war in that country. However, little research has been done on adolescent Syrian refugees. This study aimed to fill that gap in the research literature by examining how adolescent Syrian refugees cope with the harsh situation of having fled from their homes. We explored how personal capital factors, sense of coherence (SOC), wishes, and expectations, as well as socio-demographic and situational factors, contribute to a variety of mental health and psychological problems, namely, internalizing and externalizing problems and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Data were gathered from 110 adolescents aged 13-18 of whom 50.9% were boys. Participants filled out self-report questionnaires that asked about demographics, exposure to war, appraisal of danger, receiving aid, SOC, wishes, and expectations. They also completed the Achenbach Youth Form. The results show that girls appraised their situation as more dangerous and reported more internalizing, externalizing, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. By contrast, boys reported more exposure to war experiences and stronger SOC. Younger adolescents reported stronger SOC, while older adolescents reported more psychological problems. The adolescents who had more recently arrived in the refugee camp were in better condition, thereby reporting stronger SOC, higher expectations, and fewer psychological problems. The amount of time spent in the refugee camp, gender, exposure to war situations, and appraisal of danger all contributed to the explained variance in the different psychological problems. However, once the personal resource SOC was entered into the model, it mediated the relationships between all of the socio-demographic and situational variables, on the one hand, and the examined psychological problems, on the other. The results are discussed based on the personal-capital model of salutogenesis and its relations with traumatic stress.

AB Background: Molecular aging biomarkers, such as epigenetic age predictors, predict risk factors of premature aging, and morbidity/mortality more accurately than chronological age in middle-aged and elderly populations. Yet, it remains elusive if such biomarkers are associated with aging-related outcomes earlier in life when individuals begin to diverge in aging trajectories. We tested if the Horvath epigenetic age predictor is associated with pubertal, neuroendocrine, psychiatric, and cognitive aging-related outcomes in a sample of 239 adolescents, 11.0-13.2 years-old.
   Results: Each year increase in epigenetic age acceleration (AA) was associated with 0.06 SD units higher weight-for-age, 0.08 SD units taller height-for-age, -0.09 SD units less missed from the expected adult height, 13 and 16% higher odds, respectively, for each stage increase in breast/genitals development on the Tanner Staging Questionnaire and pubertal stage on the Pubertal Development Scale, 4.2% higher salivary cortisol upon awakening, and 18 to 34% higher odds for internalizing and thought problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (p values < 0.045). AA was not significantly associated with cognition.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that already in adolescence, AA is associated with physiological age acceleration, which may index risk of earlier aging. AA may identify individuals for preventive interventions decades before aging-related diseases become manifest.

AB The psychological well-being of the siblings of hospitalized children is at risk. This study examined the variables related to siblings' internalizing problems and personal growth during hospitalization from the perspectives of mothers and other main caregivers who temporarily assumed the main caregiver role to the siblings of hospitalized children in place of mothers in the period of children's hospitalization. A cross-sectional, exploratory survey conducted in Japan examined 113 mothers' and 90 other main caregivers' perspectives regarding the psychological state of 2- to 18-year-old siblings of hospitalized children. Mothers and/or other main caregivers of siblings during their brothers' or sisters' hospitalization completed the Child Behavior Checklist and the Siblings' Personal Growth Scale. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed with Child Behavior Checklist internalizing problems and total Siblings' Personal Growth Scale scores as dependent variables for mothers' and caregivers' perspectives. From mothers' perspectives, environmental factors that change with hospitalization affected siblings. From the perspectives of the other main caregivers, children's and families' demographic factors affected siblings' psychological state. Frequency of e-mail contact between mothers and siblings, explanation of the hospitalized child's condition, and hospital visitation rules (F = 5.88, P = .001) explained 12.3% of variance in mothers' Siblings' Personal Growth Scale scores. Among other main caregivers, 11.6% of variance in the Child Behavior Checklist scores was explained by hospitalized children's birth order and main caregiver's prehospitalization residence (F = 5.51, P = .006). Results suggest that the perceived variables related to siblings' psychological changes differ between mothers and other main caregivers.

AB During adolescence, some personality characteristics may represent vulnerabilities to adolescents' adjustment. Adopting a person-centered approach, the aims of this study were (a) to examine the relations of early adolescents' personality profiles to internalizing (i.e., anxious/depressed, withdrawal, and somatic complaints) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive and rule breaking behavior) problems three years later, and (b) to explore the moderating role of gender in these relations. Six hundred fifteen Italian preadolescents (mean age = 12.5) completed the Big Five Questionnaire for Children at age 12 and the Youth Self-Report at age 12 and three years later. Four personality types were identified using Latent Profile Analysis: Resilient, Moderate, Undercontrolled and Vulnerable. In multiple-group path analysis, after controlling for the stability of the outcomes, for both genders, Resilient reported low levels of externalizing problems three years later, whereas Vulnerable youths reported high levels of internalizing problems. Finally, Undercontrolled reported high levels of subsequent externalizing problems. The present study corroborated the unique and specific prediction by personality profiles of different types of subsequent maladjustment.

AB Background: The increasing use of the Internet and social network sites (SNS) has created a new domain of socio-emotional development for adolescents. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore cybervictimization across seven European countries, in relation to socio-demographic, Internet use and psychosocial variables.
   Methods: A cross-sectional school-based study was conducted in the participating countries: Germany, Greece, Iceland the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Spain. Anonymous self-completed questionnaires included sociodemographic data, internet usage characteristics, school achievement, parental control, the Internet Addiction Test and Achenbach's Youth Self-Report.
   Results: The highest rate of cyber victimization was found in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest in Spain (13.3%). Multiple logistic regression analyses gave differing results between countries. In Romania, Poland and Germany cyberbullying victimization was associated with SNS use, whereas Internet use was associated with increased odds of cybervictimization only in Romania. Cybervictimization was associated with greater internalizing behavior problems in all countries analysed, and with externalizing problems in all except Romania.
   Conclusions: Cyberbullying victimization is an on-going problem, which is subject to country-specific socio-demographic factors and diverse patterns of current Internet use and its development. Preventive measures should emphasize the integration of Internet communication technology education in educational contexts, and focus on the consistent association between cybervictimization and internalizing and externalizing difficulties.

AB Background: Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a very common chronic pediatric problem with bad psychological consequences.
   Methods: Forty primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) children and 20 healthy controls were recruited in the study and subjected to history taking, neurological and urological examinations, and psychological assessment using the Arabic-translated and validated version of child behavior checklist, sleep architecture studying through one-night polysomnography (PSG), and vasopressin levels determination both diurnal and nocturnal.
   Results: Enuretic children had positive family history of NE in 42.5%, inverted vasopressin circadian rhythm in 52.5% and PSG changes in the form of increased N3 deep sleep % of total sleep time (TST), sleep stage transition index (SSTI), periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and snore index. Enuretic children PSG showed decreased deep sleep latency, N1% of TST, N2% of TST, and REM % of TST. The child behavior checklist showed higher anxious depressed symptoms, social problem, attention problems, and internalizing problems in enuretic children than control subjects.
   Conclusions: MNE is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple factors interplay in its pathogenesis. So, the management must be tailored patient by patient according to the dominating etiology.

AB Background: The association between decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and increased internalizing symptoms is well documented. Adolescence is a critical period for the development of mental health problems, in particular internalizing symptoms. Previous research has illustrated sex differences in adolescent HRV, such that females have reduced short-term resting state HRV compared to males. Studies on long-term ecological recordings of HRV in adolescents are scarce. The aims of the present study were, (a) to test if adolescent females show decreased long-term HRV and cardiac complexity (CC) compared to males, and (b) to explore whether sex and HRV and CC measures, as well as their interaction, would predict internalizing symptoms.
   Materials and Methods: HRV was recorded in n = 166 adolescents (86 girls), on a normal school day. HRV and CC measures were calculated on the interbeat interval time series.
   Results: Females showed lower HRV and CC in most of the assessed indices. Internalizing symptoms were mainly predicted by HRV whereas sex only predicted symptoms of social anxiety. The interaction between sex and HRV did not predict internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that reduced HRV should be considered as a potential contributor to exacerbating internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Girls with reduced HRV and CC might be prone to the development of internalizing disorders. HRV is a promising tool for the early identification of vulnerability.

AB Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the relationships among the lifetime incidence of trauma, internalizing symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) in out-of-school youths (OSYs).
   Methods: We recruited 50 OSYs in South Korea. Participants completed the following surveys: completed Lifetime Incidence of Traumatic Events for children, Youth Self Report, and The KIDSCREEN-27 QoL measure for children and adolescents. Mediation analysis was conducted to test the research hypotheses.
   Results: The mean lifetime incidence of traumatic events among OSYs was 3.27 (standard deviation, 2.41). Internalizing symptoms significantly mediated the lifetime incidence of trauma and QoL. OSYs with fewer internalizing symptoms exhibited a better QoL in the domain of psychological well-being, although their lifetime incidence of trauma was higher.
   Conclusion: The results of current study suggest that assessment and therapeutic intervention with regard to internalizing symptoms are needed to increase the QoL of OSYs.

AB Studying behavioral problems in children is complex, especially if they have an intellectual disability. The aetiology of such problems is diverse: context, genetics, family and interaction, and some of these factors can be themselves a cause of psychopathology or increase its risk. The aims were: to identify emotional and behavioural problems in 6-to-11-year-old children with intellectual disability from different socioeconomic levels (SEL) from Tucuman, Argentina; to analyse internalizing and externalizing behaviour in children with intellectual disability; and to analyse whether there were differences in emotional and behavioural problems depending on the children's SEL. The findings of this study can be related to greater emotional and behavioural problems in children who have a moderate intellectual disability associated with attention, shyness and social problems. In addition, greater emotional problems were found in children with intellectual disability of low socioeconomic levels from Tucuman.

AB Internalizing and externalizing behaviors are heritable, and show genetic stability during childhood and adolescence. Less work has explored how genes influence individual differences in developmental trajectories. We estimated ACE biometrical latent growth curve models for the Teacher Report Form (TRF) and parent Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) internalizing and externalizing scales from ages 7 to 16 years in 408 twin pairs from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study. We found that Intercept factors were highly heritable for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors (a2 = .61-.92), with small and nonsignificant environmental influences for teacher-rated data but significant nonshared environmental influences for parent-rated data. There was some evidence of heritability of decline in internalizing behavior (Slopes for teacher and parent ratings), but the Slope genetic variance was almost entirely shared with that for the Intercept when different than zero. These results suggest that genetic effects on these developmental trajectories operate primarily on initial levels and stability, with no significant unique genetic influences for change. Finally, cross-rater analyses of the growth factor scores revealed moderate to large genetic and environmental associations between growth factors derived from parents' and teachers' ratings, particularly the Intercepts.

AB Findings are presented on a study of 40 gay father families created through surrogacy and a comparison group of 55 lesbian mother families created through donor insemination with a child aged 3-9years. Standardized interview, observational and questionnaire measures of stigmatization, quality of parent-child relationships, and children's adjustment were administered to parents, children, and teachers. Children in both family types showed high levels of adjustment with lower levels of children's internalizing problems reported by gay fathers. Irrespective of family type, children whose parents perceived greater stigmatization and children who experienced higher levels of negative parenting showed higher levels of parent-reported externalizing problems. The findings contribute to theoretical understanding of the role of family structure and family processes in child adjustment.

AB A growing body of literature is associating excessive and addictive use of digital media with physical, psychological, social and neurological adverse consequences. Research is focusing more on mobile devices use, and studies suggest that duration, content, after-dark-use, media type and the number of devices are key components determining screen time effects. Physical health effects: excessive screen time is associated with poor sleep and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, obesity, low HDL cholesterol, poor stress regulation (high sympathetic arousal and cortisol dysregulation), and Insulin Resistance. Other physical health consequences include impaired vision and reduced bone density. Psychological effects: internalizing and externalizing behavior is related to poor sleep. Depressive symptoms and suicidal are associated to screen time induced poor sleep, digital device night use, and mobile phone dependency. ADHD-related behavior was linked to sleep problems, overall screen time, and violent and fast-paced content which activates dopamine and the reward pathways. Early and prolonged exposure to violent content is also linked to risk for antisocial behavior and decreased prosocial behavior. Psychoneurological effects: addictive screen time use decreases social coping and involves craving behavior which resembles substance dependence behavior. Brain structural changes related to cognitive control and emotional regulation are associated with digital media addictive behavior. A case study of a treatment of an ADHD diagnosed 9-year-old boy suggests screen time induced ADHD-related behavior could be inaccurately diagnosed as ADHD. Screen time reduction is effective in decreasing ADHD-related behavior. Conclusions: Components crucial for psychophysiological resilience are none-wandering mind (typical of ADHD-related behavior), good social coping and attachment, and good physical health. Excessive digital media use by children and adolescents appears as a major factor which may hamper the formation of sound psychophysiological resilience.

AB Research increasingly demonstrates the detrimental effects of psychologically controlling parenting on children's adjustment. An important and practically relevant question is whether some children are more vulnerable for the effects of psychologically controlling parenting. In the current diary study, we investigated whether daily psychologically controlling parenting relates to children's daily externalizing and internalizing problems and whether these associations depend on child personality. A total of 206 children (M age=9.93years; 46.6% female) along with their mothers and fathers (M age=40.30 and 42.40years) participated in this multi-informant diary study. All three family members filled out a diary each day for seven days. Multilevel analyses indicated that daily maternal and paternal psychological control were positively related to daily externalizing and internalizing problems, a pattern that was fairly consistent across informants. Out of the 35 interactions tested, only three turned out to be significant. Overall, the limited number of interactions suggests that psychologically controlling parenting is generally detrimental to children's daily functioning. Still, children differ somewhat in their susceptibility to the effect of psychologically controlling parenting. (c) 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology

AB Cyber victimization has consistently been associated with internalizing difficulties in adolescents. However, the underlying psychological mechanisms linking this relationship have not been adequately examined. The present study aimed to investigate the mediational roles of coping self-efficacy and emotion dysregulation in the relationships between cyber victimization with depression and social anxiety. Participants were 459 students (199 girls) from independent middle-class schools in grades 8 (M (age) = 13 years 9 months) and 10 (M (age) = 15 years 7 months). They completed a self-report questionnaire about cyberbullying participation, internalizing symptoms, coping self-efficacy, and emotion dysregulation. Structural equation modeling revealed that most domains of coping self-efficacy and emotion dysregulation partially mediated the relationship between cyber victimization and depression, and fully mediated the relationship between cyber victimization and social anxiety. The results highlight the importance of targeting these mediating factors in intervention programs to reduce the negative impact of cyber victimization on adolescents.
