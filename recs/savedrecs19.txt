AB The science of reading and developmental dyslexia has experienced spectacular advances during the last few years. Five aspects of this research are discussed in the article. (1) The holistic phenomenon of reading is complex. Many lower-level psychological processes (e.g., phonemic awareness, phonological decoding, ability to process stimuli rapidly and automatize this process, memory, ability to recognize words) contribute to a single act of reading. Conceptualizing the complex process of reading through its partly overlapping but partly independent components-which contribute to, but do not fully explain, the holistic process of reading-provides an excellent model for understanding complex hierarchies of higher mental functions. Those who master reading skills successfully and those who have difficulties doing so differ in a wide range of reading-related processes. The central deficit experienced by poor readers appears to be related to phonological processing (a complex hierarchy of functions related to processing phonemes), whereas characteristics of automatization processes seem to moderate the reading outcome for people whose phonological skills are weak. (2) There are new data addressing models of dyslexia in languages other than English. The most fascinating finding is that the model implicating phonological deficit as central to dyslexia, and the lack of ability to automatize as leading to troubled reading, appears to be universal, regardless of the specific language. However, there is an interaction effect between the characteristics of a particular language and the developmental model of dyslexia. In phonologically more difficult languages (e.g., English): the most pronounced weakness appears to occur in phonological processing, whereas in phonologically easier languages (e.g., German), the crucial role in the manifestation of dyslexia is played by the lack of the skills needed to achieve automatization. (3) There is abundant evidence that reading (i.e., any single act of reading as well as reading as a holistic process) is "cooked" by the brain. Although no unified brain map of reading has been developed, some specific areas of the brain have been implicated in different reading-related cognitive processes by different laboratories and on different samples. (4) Indisputable evidence has been accumulated suggesting the involvement of the genome in developmental dyslexia. As of now, specific regions of the genome have been identified as being intimately involved with a number of different reading-related processes. Today the field of developmental dyslexia is the only area of genetic studies of human abilities and disabilities in which linkages to the genome have been robustly replicated in independent laboratories. (5) Finally, evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia might be only one of the manifestations of a deep, underlying, anatomical syndrome. The comorbidity of developmental dyslexia with both internalizing and externalizing behavioral disturbances, as well as with other learning disabilities, underscores the need for wide-ranging cognitive and behavioral approaches in the remediation programs offered to dyslexic children.

AB Purpose: To describe recent self-reported suicide attempts in a triethnic group of adolescents, to analyze differences in the correlates of attempts by ethnicity and gender, and to explore theoretical correlates of recent suicide attempts using a resilience framework.
   Methods: Quantitative data were collected from 10,059 students in 7th, 9th, and 11th grades in Connecticut in 1996. Secondary analysis was done to compare respondents of African American, Hispanic Latino, and Caucasian ethnicities. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate procedures. Logistic regression was used to identify the best set of explanatory variables for recent suicide attempts.
   Results: The Percentage of suicide attempts was significantly higher among Hispanic Latina girls (19.3%) than in any other ethnic-gender group. Significant relationships were found between recent suicide attempts and (a) family history of suicide attempt, (b) friend's history of suicide attempt, (c) history of sexual abuse, (d) history of physical abuse, and (e) environmental stress. The significant set of explanatory variables for recent suicide attempts for the three ethnic groups combined were stress, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, physical and sexual abuse, family and friend attempted suicide, social connectedness, and religious influence.
   Conclusions: Findings support use of a resilience model for suicide attempts among three ethnic groups. The finding of a significantly higher percentage of recent suicide attempts by Hispanic girls compared to girls in other ethnic-gender groups warrants further investigation along with development and testing of culturally sensitive Preventive interventions.

AB This longitudinal study investigated gender differences in the relation between (1) internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety reported by adolescents, and (2) emotional distress and marital discord reported by their mothers. Structural equation modeling was used to track the relationship between these variables in a community sample of 116 males and 101 females and their parents across three data intervals roughly corresponding to early adolescence (M = 11,4), mid-adolescence (M = 13,7), and late adolescence/ early adulthood (M = 19,2). For early adolescents, there were no gender differences in the relation between internalizing symptoms and parental distress and discord. Gender differences did emerge, however, by midadolescence, at which time parental disturbances were significantly associated with internalizing symptoms in adolescent females but not adolescent males. The emergence of this risk factor during this developmental phase may help account for frequent findings that place adolescent females at higher risk for anxiety and depression than adolescent males.

AB The relationship between parenting style and adolescent functioning was examined in a sample of 302 African American adolescent girls and their mothers who lived in impoverished neighborhoods. Although previous research has found that authoritative parenting, as compared with authoritarian, permissive, and disengaged parenting, is associated with positive adolescent outcomes in both European American, middle-class and large multiethnic school-based samples, these parenting categories have not been fully explored in African American families living at or near poverty level. Data were collected from adolescent girls and their self-identified mothers or mother figures using in-home interviews and self-administered questionnaires. Parenting style was found to be significantly related to adolescent outcome in multiple domains including externalizing and internalizing behaviors, academic achievement, work orientation, sexual experience, and pregnancy history. Specifically, teens whose mothers were disengaged (low on both parental warmth and supervision/monitoring) were found to have the most negative outcomes.

AB Objective: To examine how the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC 0-3) primary diagnoses, Parent-infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist/2-3 (CBCL/2-3) externalizing and internalizing symptoms augment the DSM-III-R/IV and guide treatment. Method: 82 children aged 18 to 47 months, who presented with disruptive behavior to an early childhood psychiatry clinic, were diagnosed using DSM-III-R/IV DC 0-3, and the CBCL/2-3. Results: Children with DSM-III-R/IV disruptive disorders or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were diagnosed with DC 0-3 regulatory disorders, disorders of affect, and traumatic stress disorder. Clinically significant externalizing and internalizing symptoms co-presented in 45.1% of the children. Of children with disorders of affect, 41.2% had relationships categorized as disordered, contrasting with 21.1% of those with traumatic stress disorder and 10.3% of those with regulatory disorders. Increasingly disordered relationships were significantly correlated with externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and children with disordered relationships were 3.6 times more likely to have clinically significant levels of internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: In these children with disruptive behaviors, co-presentation of externalizing and internalizing symptoms is most common. Those with increased relational risk had more externalizing and internalizing symptoms and more disorders of affect.

Moderate to high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive power, and diagnostic efficiency were evidenced across criterion measures. Convergent validity was evidenced by significant correlations with the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Internalizing scale, and the Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory (JEPI) Neuroticism scale. Discriminant validity vas observed through nonsignificant correlations with the CBCL Externalizing and the JEPI Extraversion scales.

AB Maternal smoking during pregnancy elevates risk for later child behavior problems. Because prior studies considered only Western settings, where smoking cooccurs with social disadvantage, we examined this association in Yugoslavia, a different cultural setting. Mothers enrolled in pregnancy as the low-exposure group in a prospective study of lead exposure were interviewed about health, including smoking history. A total of 199 children were assessed on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at ages 4, 4 1/2, and 5 years. Average cumulative blood lead (BPb) was determined from serial samples taken biannually since delivery. Longitudinal analyses were derived from 191 children with available data on behavior and covariates. Smoking was unrelated to social adversity. Controlling for age, gender, birthweight, ethnicity, maternal education, and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Acceptance, smoking was associated with worse scores on almost all subscales; BPb concentration was related to small increases in the Delinquency subscale. Daughters of smokers received significantly higher scores on Somatic Complaints compared to daughters of nonsmokers, consistent with other work relating biological factors and internalizing problems in young girls. Because the present smoking/child behavior associations persist after control for individual and social factors also related to behavior problems, possible biological mediators are considered.

AB The association between behaviour problems and dyslexia was assessed in a population sample of 10- to 12-year-old children. Twenty-five dyslexic children and a matched control group were recruited through a screening in primary schools in the city of Bergen, Norway. For the assessment of behaviour problems the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Self Report (TRF), and Youth Self Report (YSR) were filled out by parents, teachers, and children, respectively. Information on health and developmental factors were obtained from parents on a separate questionnaire designed for the study. The dyslexic group had significantly more behaviour problems than the control group according to both the CBCL and the TRF. On the YSR there was no significant difference between the groups. Dyslexic children had higher CBCL and TRF scores on the Total Behaviour Problem scale, the Internalizing and Externalizing subdomains, and the Attention problem subscale. The groups differed in social background, prenatal risk factors, birth weight, preschool language problems, and IQ, but these variables showed no relationship to the level of behaviour problems in the present sample. We conclude that pre-adolescent dyslexic children show a wide range of behaviour problems that cannot be attributed to social or developmental background variables.

Girls reported significantly more internalizing, withdrawn, somatic, anxious-depressive thought and attention problems. The adolescent was defined as having maladjustment if he/she had used mental health services or had more severe problems than the peer group according to parent or self-report (11% of the sample). There were significant differences at the 0.001 level on all YSR scales between maladjustment and non-maladjustment groups. In logistic regression analysis anxious-depressive and delinquency scales had the strongest association with maladjustment. The results are compared with results from previous population-based studies using the YSR in Nordic countries.

AB Three hundred and eighteen parent-bereaved children aged 5-17 recruited from the community and their surviving parents were interviewed at 1, 6, 13, and 25 months post-parental death about their participation in funeral related rituals and subsequent adjustment following the death. Nearly all the children attended their parent's visitation, funeral, and burial. Children from families who did not have such rituals fare less well over time. Children who reported internalizing or externalizing behavior at rituals were more likely to experience some increased problems in the first two years post-death. Children who were withdrawn or quiet during the rituals had fewer subsequent problems than children who acted out during these rituals. Visitation attendance was associated with better outcome one and two years later. The symbolism of rituals (e.g., playing a favorite song) often brings comfort to child survivors. Cremation does not appear to have any negative effect on children's outcome.

AB Objective. It is not known when behavior problems begin in children with epilepsy. The purposes of this study were to: 1) describe the rates of behavior problems in children before their first recognized seizure, 2) determine the differences in behavior problems between children with a first recognized seizure and their healthy siblings, and 3) identify the seizure variables early in the course of the condition that are associated with behavior problems before the first recognized seizure.
   Methods. The sample was 224 children (4-14 years old) with a first recognized seizure and their 135 healthy siblings. As part of a larger study, computer-assisted structured telephone interviews were conducted with mothers to measure child and sibling behavior problems. Behavior problems were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist. Frequencies, t tests, correlational analysis, and multiple regression were used to analyze data.
   Results. Higher than expected rates of behavior problems in the 6 months before the first recognized seizure were found in the total seizure sample, with 32.1% being in the clinical or at-risk range. Rates were highest in children who had previous events that were probably seizures, with 39.5% in the clinical or at-risk range. Children with seizures had significantly higher Total, Internalizing, Attention, Thought, and Somatic Complaints problem scores than their nearest-in-age healthy siblings. Within the seizure sample, variables significantly associated with behavior problems after adjusting for research site, child sex, child age, and socioeconomic status (as represented by primary caregiver's education) were interactions of previously unrecognized seizures with gender and epilepsy syndrome/type of seizures.
   Conclusions. Children with previously unrecognized seizures are already at increased risk for behavior problems at the time of their first recognized seizure. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in some children, epilepsy is a pervasive condition that includes both seizures and behavioral problems.

AB Socially anxious children have been described in the literature as at risk of developing increasing emotional problems and of being deprived of valid teaming experiences with peers. In order to enable teachers to detect social anxiety in preschoolers the authors developed a scale. The TRSA-"junior" (Teacher Rating Scale of Social Anxiety-"junior") is a brief Likert-type questionnaire for the identification of social anxiety in 5-to 6-year-old children. Reliability (internal consistency plus test-retest correlation) collected in 2 samples was high. Convergent and divergent validity of this newly developed rating-scale were also studied. A high level of social anxiety correlated with a low level of social participation, as observed on the playground. The TRSA-'Junior" score correlated with "internalizing" as measured by the Behavior Questionnaire for Toddlers and Preschoolers (BQTP) and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), and with the subscales "anxious-depressed", "thought problems", "social problems" and "withdrawn behavior" of the CBCL. In the second study a high score on social anxiety appeared to be related to less positive sociometric judgments by peers. The authors conclude that the TRSA-"junior" may aid in the identification and prevention of social anxiety at an early age. In addition, the scale would appear to be a useful instrument in research, given its sound psychometric qualities.

AB In a school-based sample of N = 661 adolescents aged 10 to 17 years, the following issues were studied in two 3-year follow-ups studies: (1) the correlation between individually and collectively perceived attributes of the learning environment (acknowledgment of the classmates, competitive behavior among the pupils, patronizing treatment by the teacher, pressure to perform, opportunities to participate) and internalizing and externalizing problems; (2) using a cluster analysis, typical manifestation patterns of the assessed attributes of the learning environments were determined; (3) the changes in the attributes of the learning environment were analyzed in relation to the type of school and the prediction of internalizing and externalizing problems by the individually and collectively perceived attributes of the learning environment. There was a stronger correlation between the individually perceived attributes of the learning environment than with the collectively perceived ones. Cluster analysis established two favorable and three unfavorable learning environments. Cross-sectionally, significantly higher scores for the scales of internalizing and externalizing disorders appeared in the unfavorable learning environments. The longitudinal analysis revealed that the attributes of the learning environment changed in interaction with the school types. Predictors for internalizing problems of the girls were individually per-ceived pressure to achieve and lack of opportunities to participate; externalizing problems were predicted by individually perceived competitive behavior and lacking opportunities to participate as well as collectively perceived patronizing treatment by the teacher. Predictors for externalizing problems of the boys were individually perceived lack of opportunities to participate and collectively perceived acknowledgment of the classmates.

AB Research on mood and anxiety disorders has historically proceeded without sufficient reference to the growing body of work on the nature of typical emotional development and temperament. Reviewing data from several studies, we consider experiential, biological, and generic factors as providing causal input to typical developmental variation in fearfulness and anxiety during infancy and early childhood. Longitudinal behavioral methods, psychophysiologic measures, and a behavior-genetic framework are used to approach these issues. Results from twin studies implicate moderately strong genetic influences on different facets of temperamental fearfulness, as well as childhood anxiety symptoms. Then, we consider the dis tinction between normal range temperament and overt anxiety symptoms from a quantitative generic perspective. Biological correlates (cortisol, asymmetric frontal EEG activation cardiac reactivity) of inhibited behavior are considered as I-elated endophenotypes for anxiety. In a nongenetic analysis, we report the prediction of internalizing problems during kindergarten from earlier temperament and earlier basal cortisol measures. Our review highlights connections between behavioral indicators and various putative endophenotypes and the fuzzy boundary between normal-range temperament and anxiety disorders..

   maturational rate
ID MATERNAL DEPRESSION; POPULATION; DISORDERS; MATURITY; TWIN; ADHD; SEX
AB A slow maturational rate may be an underlying antecedent of a psychiatric disorder. If this is correct, differences in behavioural problems could be related to the maturity level in children of the same chronological age. The aim of the study was to compare the parents' perceptions and assessments of their children's maturational status and behavioural problems. A population based on a nationwide sample from the Swedish twin-register of 8 to 9-y-old children (n = 1079) was used. The parents completed a questionnaire including their views on their child's maturity level, the Swedish version of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) checklist based on the DSM-III-R criteria. Multivariate analyses showed a statistically significant relationship between immaturity reported by the parents and several behavioural problems reported on the CBCL: somatic complaints, anxious and depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, behaviour problems and aggressive behaviour. There was also a statistically significant relationship between the maturity factor and the CBCL grouping of syndromes (internalizing, externalizing, total behaviour problems score) as well as between the maturity factor and ADHD.
   Conclusion: We conclude that at least from the parents' point of view the behaviour problems in their children may be related to maturity.

AB Objective: To compare problem behaviour in Turkish immigrant children living in the Netherlands versus problem behaviour in Dutch children from the general population as reported by teachers.
   Method: Teacher's Report Forms (TRF) were filled out by Dutch teachers, and for a subsample also by Turkish immigrant teachers, concerning 524 Turkish immigrant children selected randomly from the immigrant population in two large cities in the Netherlands. TRFs completed for Turkish immigrant children were compared with TRFs filled out for 1625 children selected randomly from the Dutch general population.
   Results: No significant differences were revealed between children from both cultures on the TRF total problems, internalizing, externalizing and specific syndrome scales. Turkish immigrant teachers, however, reported higher total problems, internalizing and anxious/depressed scores for immigrant children than did Dutch teachers for the same immigrant children.
   Conclusion: No significant differences were found in the levels of behavioural and emotional problems reported by Dutch teachers for Turkish immigrant versus Dutch children. However, Turkish immigrant teachers reported high levels of anxiety and depression in immigrant children which go largely undetected by their Dutch teachers.

It is therefore essential that mental health professionals who work with adolescents be aware of the characteristics of firesetters. This study describes the individual and environmental factors that relate to the etiology and levels of firesetting. Specifically, it discusses different types of firesetters and their aggressive tendencies, internalizing problems, family dynamics, and sociability. Further, it explores the treatment of adolescent firesetters.

AB Objective: To compare Cambodian and Central American adolescent refugees to Quecbec with their Quebec-born peers in regard to emotional and behaviours, problems, feelings of competence, and risk-behaviour profiles, and to examine relations between emotional variahles and living conditions in the 3 groups.
   Method: The sample consisted of 76 Cambodian, 82 Central American and 67 Quebecois youth living in the Montreal urea. The teenagers internalization and externalization symptoms were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR); the YSR also provided a measure of their feelings of competence. Risk behaviour was reported by the teenagers'. The socioeconomic status of the teenagers' households was taken into account in multiple regression analyses conducted for each group.
   Results: The level of emotional and behavioural problems by teenagers was lowest in Central Americans and highest in Quebecois: the the latter group also, reported more risk behaviours than did either, refugee group. The socioeconomic status of the Cambodian and Central American refugee households was lower than that of the Quebecois. Living conditions were not a major determinant of emotional distress in young Cambodians, but low annual income was associated with internalizing symptoms among Central American youth. The most powerful predictor of externalizing symptoms among the Quebecois youth was having a single-parent household..
   Conclusion: This study underscores the contrast between? the living conditions of young Cambodian and Central American refugees to Quebec and those of Quebec-born youth. These refugees precarious socioeconomic status is not accompanied by an increase in adolescents' emotional and behavioural problems.

A mete-analysis containing 60 studies and 126 independent effect sizes was conducted. Results suggest that maternal and paternal ratings exhibit moderate correspondence in ratings of internalizing behavior problems in children and large correspondence in ratings of externalizing and total behavior problems in children. In terms of discrepancy of reports, parents reported similar levels of all types of problems. Age, gender, and socioeconomic status were found to moderate correspondence between mothers' and fathers' ratings but did not moderate discrepancies in mothers' and fathers' ratings.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of informant agreement for behavioral ratings of children with epilepsy. Informants completed Achenbach's 1991 scales: parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), teachers completed the Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and youth completed the Youth Self-Report Form of the CBCL (YSR). Analyses included degree of concordance of ratings as a function of informant, child gender, and condition severity (active vs inactive epilepsy). Results indicated that across all four types of raters (mothers, fathers, teachers, and adolescents) there was a similar pattern. Mothers' ratings tended to be the highest and youths' ratings tended to be the lowest across scales. In general, agreement among adult raters was greater than between youth and adults. Mothers and teachers reported more internalizing symptoms than did youth; mother, father, and teacher ratings on externalizing symptoms were not significantly different from each other. There were no significant effects of gender and condition severity on concordance among ratings although there were some interesting trends. (C) 2000 Academic Press

AB Initial moderator analyses in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) suggested that child anxiety ascertained by parent report on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 2.3 (DISC Anxiety) differentially moderated the outcome of treatment. Left unanswered were questions regarding the nature of DISC Anxiety, the impact of comorbid conduct problems on the moderating effect of DISC Anxiety, and the clinical significance of DISC Anxiety as a moderator of treatment outcome. Thirty-three percent of MTA subjects met DSM-III-R criteria for an anxiety disorder excluding simple phobias. Of these, two-thirds also met DSM-III-R criteria for comorbid oppositional-defiant or conduct disorder whereas one-third did not, yielding an odds ratio of approximately two for DISC Anxiety, given conduct problems. In this context, exploratory analyses of baseline data suggest that DISC Anxiety may reflect parental attributions regarding child negative affectivity and associated behavior problems (unlike fearfulness), particularly in the area of social interactions, another core component of anxiety that is more typically associated with phobic symptoms. Analyses using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) indicate that the moderating effect of DISC Anxiety continues to favor the inclusion of psychosocial treatment for anxious ADHD children irrespective of the presence or absence of comorbid conduct problems. This effect, which is clinically meaningful, is confined primarily to parent-reported outcomes involving disruptive behavior, internalizing symptoms, and inattention: and is generally stronger for combined than unimodal treatment. Contravening earlier studies, no adverse effect of anxiety on medication response for core ADHD or other outcomes in anxious or nonanxious ADHD children was demonstrated. When treating ADHD, it is important to search for comorbid anxiety and negative affectivity and to adjust treatment strategies accordingly.

AB To elucidate processes underlying therapeutic change in a large-scale randomized clinical trial, we examined whether alterations in self-reported parenting practices were associated with the effects of behavioral, medication, or combination treatments on teacher-reported outcomes (disruptive behavior, social skills, internalizing symptoms) in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants were 579 children with Combined-type ADHD, aged 7-9.9 years, in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA). We uncovered 2 second-order factors of parenting practices, entitled Positive Involvement and Negative/ineffective Discipline. Although Positive Involvement was not associated with amelioration of the school-based outcome measures, reductions in Negative/Ineffective Discipline mediated improvement in children's social skills at school. For families showing the greatest reductions in Negative/ineffective Discipline, effects of combined medication plus behavioral treatment were pronounced in relation to regular community care. Furthermore, only in combination treatment (and not in behavioral treatment alone) was decreased Negative/Ineffective Discipline associated with reduction in children's disruptive behavior at school. Here, children in families receiving combination treatment who showed the greatest reductions in Negative/Ineffective Discipline had teacher-reported disruptive behavior that was essentially normalized. Overall, the success of combination treatment for important school-related outcomes appears related to reductions in negative and ineffective parenting practices at home; we discuss problems in interpreting the temporal sequencing of such process-outcome linkages and the means by which multimodal treatment may be mediated by psychosocial processes related to parenting.

AB Tested the validity of the Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders (DSMD; Naglieri, LeBuffe, & Pfeiffer; 1994) in a sample of 108 adolescent psychiatric inpatients. DSMD scales were compared to parent-report, interiew-based, self-report and diagnostic measures. DSMD measures of conduct problems and delinquency were significantly associated with the predicted parent-report, interiew-based, and diagnostic measures of conduct disorder and substance abuse and not with any measures of anxiety or depression. DSMD measures of anxiety and depression were related to other parent-report ratings of internalizing symptoms but had more limited convergent and discriminant validity. The DSMD was compared so the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991)for diagnostic classification accuracy. The two measures were comparable in classifying oppositional or conduct disorder The CBCL was superior for classification of major depression. The DSMD was superior for classification of substance abuse.

AB The development of a measure of coping and involuntary stress responses in adolescence is described. The Responses to Stress Questionnaire (RSQ) reflects a conceptual model that includes volitional coping efforts and involuntary responses to specific stressful events or specified domains of stress. The psychometric characteristics of the RSQ were examined across 4 domains of stress in 3 samples of adolescents and parent reports obtained in 2 samples. The factor structure of the RSQ was tested and replicated with an adequate degree of fit using confirmatory factor analysis across 3 stressors in 2 samples. Internal consistency and retest reliability for the 5 factors were adequate to excellent. Concurrent validity was established through correlations with another measure of coping, heart rate reactivity, and correlations of self- and parent-reports. Significant correlations with both adolescents' and parents' reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were consistent with hypotheses.

AB The authors examined how well 394 triads of male youths, caregivers, and teachers agreed about youth problems reported on the Achenbach checklists. Dyadic agreement was measured through difference scores (subtracting the raw score of youth self-report from the caregiver's or teacher's score for shared items), q correlations between pairs of raters across items, and D-2 (generalized distance between item profiles) for both externalizing and internalizing items. Teachers reported fewer internalizing and externalizing problems than did caregivers or youths. Teacher-youth disagreement was higher for African American than European American males about externalizing criteria. Caregiver depression and stress (but not paternal antisocial behavior or maternal substance abuse) correlated with higher disagreement with other informants about all criteria. These factors appear to increase disagreement about the level of problems but not about specific symptom patterns.

AB A large and heterogeneous sample of 364 homeless adolescents was interviewed about residential and family histories, as well as about their experiences while homeless. They were also administered a diagnostic interview and various self-report measures of emotional and behavioral functioning. Analyses were conducted to provide a better description of these youth, with a special focus on gender and age heterogeneity. Results of analyses suggested that homeless youth came from generally troubled backgrounds and had elevated rates of psychiatric disorders. For boys, their histories typically included physical abuse during childhood, physical assault on the street and elevated rates of externalizing disorders. For girls, histories were more often marked by sexual abuse during childhood, sexual victimization on the streets. and elevated rates of internalizing disorders, implications of these results for service delivery are discussed.

AB This study examines adult reports of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology at home and school in a sample of 224 high-risk adolescent boys and girls (average age 12 years). Four groups of young adolescents were defined, based on the consistency of the teacher and parent Child Behavior Checklist reports: normal, internalizing, externalizing only, and comorbid. Group comparisons revealed the comorbid and externalizing groups were more engaged in a deviant peer group and were observed in higher levels of deviancy training with their friends, compared to other young adolescent groups. In general, elevated levels of arrest, drug use, and sexual promiscuity were associated with cross-setting consistency in externalizing disorders. Comorbid youth, however, showed the highest levels of sexual promiscuity in middle adolescence, compared to all other groups. These findings are consistent with a developmental account of adolescent maladjustment and suggest that emotional disturbance in early adolescence might exacerbate youth vulnerability, especially to deviancy training within friendships.

To better understand the specific effects of adoption on the construction of 2 maternal representations, birth and adoptive maternal representation of adopted children was compared with that of nonadopted children. In addition, the effect of incongruous representations of birth and adoptive mothers on adoptees' externalizing and internalizing behavior; was explored. Compared with nonadopted children, adoptees' representations of the mothers appear as more concrete and less benign. Among adopted children, representations of the birth mothers were found to contain split negative aspects of the adoptive mothers. Moreover, the differences between birth and adoptive mother representations were found to associate with adoptees' externalizing behaviors.

AB Early emergent patterns of behavioral problems, social skill deficits, and language delays were examined in 259 three-year-old children enrolled in Head Start classrooms. The Child Behavior Checklist for Children Ages 2 to 3 (CBCL/2-3) and the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS, Pre-School Version) were completed by the children's primary caregivers. Language skills were assessed using the Preschool Language Scale (PLS)-3 and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT)-III. Findings indicated that this population is at elevated risk for behavioral and language problems. Approximately 25% of both boys and girls showed clinical/subclinical levels of internalizing problem behavior on the CBCL. More than 20% of boys scored in the clinical range for externalizing problems. Children with behavioral problems were more likely to have low language scores than were their peers without behavioral problems. Nearly half of the children scored in the category "lower than average" for social skills on the SSRS. Children with low social skills were more likely to have low language scores than were their peers with average social skills. The need to screen for early emergent behavioral problems, the potential contribution of poor language skills to children's problem behavior, and implications for early intervention are discussed.

AB Children's appraisals of interparental conflict consistently have been associated with adjustment problems, but the processes that give rise to this association are not well understood. This paper proposes that appraisals of threat and self-blame mediate the association between children's reports of interparental conflict and internalizing problems, and tests this mediational hypothesis in two samples of children, one drawn from the community (317 ten- to fourteen-year-olds) and the other from battered women's shelters (145 ten- to twelve-year-olds). Results indicate that perceived threat mediates the association between interparental conflict and internalizing problems for boys and girls in both samples, and self-blame mediates this association for boys in both samples and girls in the shelter sample. Perceived threat and self-blame do not mediate links with externalizing problems, and there is no evidence of a moderating effect of appraisals on the association between conflict and child adjustment. Implications for understanding the mechanism by which exposure to interparental conflict could lead to child maladjustment are discussed.

AB Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the most widely-researched therapies for children and adolescents. In this paper, the general tenets of CBT are described, followed by a review of the treatment outcome literature. Overall, there is strong empirical support for CBT with internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depressive disorders whereas more moderate empirical support exists for CBT with externalizing disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder. The relative efficacy of individual, family, and group forms of CBT is also examined. Finally, future directions for research on CBT are discussed, including (a) determining the focal person(s) of treatment; (b) the importance of field effectiveness trials; and (c) the integration of CBT with other approaches (e.g. function analytic techniques, acceptance-based approaches).

AB This study aimed to determine whether sodium valproate (VPA) improves cognitive performance and behaviour in children with learning and behavioural problems associated with electrographic epileptiform discharges but without clinical seizures. A randomized, double-blind, single-crossover trial was carried out with VPA or placebo on eight participants with different learning and behaviour problems. Participants also underwent neuropsychological testing under video EEG and the parent and teacher Behaviour Check List (CBCL; Achenbach 1991a,b) during each treatment phase. Clinically none of the children improved on VPA. On formal testing children were more distractable, had increased delay in response time, and showed lower memory scores while on VPA. In addition, parents reported higher internalizing scores on the CBCL while children were on VPA. Our data do not support the use of VPA in similar patients.

AB This study investigated the association between reading disability (RD) and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in a large community sample of twins with (N = 209) and without RD (N = 192). The primary goals were to clarify the relation between RD and comorbid psychopathology, to test for gender differences in the behavioral correlates of RD, and to test if common familial influences contributed to the association between RD and other disorders. Results indicated that individuals with RD exhibited significantly higher rates of all internalizing and externalizing disorders than individuals without RD. However, logistic regression analyses indicated that RD was not significantly associated with symptoms of aggression, delinquency, oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder after controlling for the significant relation between RD and ADHD. In contrast, relations between RD and symptoms of anxiety and depression remained significant even after controlling for comorbid ADHD, suggesting that internalizing difficulties may be specifically associated with RD. Analyses of gender differences indicated that the significant relation between RD and internalizing symptoms was largely restricted to girls, whereas the association between RD and externalizing psychopathology was stronger for buys. Finally, preliminary etiological analyses suggested that common familial factors predispose both probands with RD and their non-RD siblings to exhibit externalizing behaviors, whereas elevations of internalizing symptomatology are restricted to individuals with RD.

AB Individual (coping strategies), family (parent/child relationships), and community-based (religious involvement) variables were examined as potential protective factors for 224 low-income urban sixth- through eighth-grade African American adolescents. Each of those variables was examined as a moderator and analyses were conducted to determine whether the association between stress and psychological symptoms was attenuated for youth endorsing positive coping strategies, strong parent/child relationships, and religious involvement. Results indicated that positive relationships with father figures buffered the effects of stress on externalizing symptoms for boys and for girls; religious involvement was protective for girls bur not for boys. The sole coping strategy to demonstrate a protective effect was avoidant coping, which attenuated the relation between stress and externalizing symptoms for boys. Supplemental analyses focusing on specific subsets of stressful experiences indicated that avoidant coping and social support-seeking coping accentuated the relation between daily hassles and internalizing symptoms for girls.

AB Objective: To examine a wide range of parent- and teacher-reported behaviors in relation to child-reported depression and anxiety in preadolescence. Method: Subjects were participants in a longitudinal study of 420 preschool children from the general population that started in 1989. At second follow-up 8 years later (ages 10-11 years), usable parent information was obtained for 358 children. For this study, 274 children for whom complete child, parent, and teacher reports were obtained at age 10 to II years were included. Measures included the Dimensions of Depression Profile for Children, the State-Trait Anxiety inventory for Children, the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18, and the Teacher's Report Form. Results: Of 120 parent-reported problem items, only 11 and 9 were associated with child-reported depression and anxiety, respectively. For teachers, 33 and 20 items (of 120) were significantly associated with child-reported depression and anxiety, respectively including items referring to withdrawal, anxiety, depression, social problems, and academic problems. Conclusions: Teachers are more likely than parents to notice internalizing problems and related problems such as social and academic problems in children reporting depression or anxiety.

AB In this study, 110 mothers and 110 fathers of 5- to 12-year-old boys and girls completed the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale and measures of child behaviour, parenting style, and marital satisfaction. We replicated the factor structure of the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale produced by Johnston and Mash (1989), and provided evidence that the Satisfaction and Efficacy scales from this measure assess distinct aspects of parenting self-esteem. Interestingly, parents of girls reported higher Efficacy scores than parents of boys. To address the validity of the PSOC scale, we calculated partial correlations between Efficacy and Satisfaction PSOC scores and other measures of family functioning, controlling for the shared variance between the two scales. Significant small-to-moderate size correlations were found between parents' reports of both internalizing and externalizing child problems and Satisfaction scores, but correlations with Efficacy scores were generally small and nonsignificant, particularly for mothers. We also found that mothers and fathers who reported a more easy-going, low-conflict parenting style were more satisfied in parenting; for mothers, a similar relationship was found for parenting efficacy. In addition, Satisfaction scores shared a small but significant amount of variance with mother-father agreements in parenting style, as well as marital satisfaction. Implications of the findings for the use of the Parenting Sense of Competence scale are discussed.

ID STABILITY
AB Objective: The purpose of this research was to provide a prospective look at the relationship between change in placement and problem behaviors over a 12-month period among a cohort of foster children.
   Method: The sample contained 415 youth, and was part of a larger cohort of children who entered foster care in San Diego, California and remained in placement for at least 5 months. The Child Behavior Check List was used to assess behavior problems. Every change of placement during the first 18 months after entry into the foster care system was abstracted from case records.
   Results: The results suggest that volatile placement histories contribute negatively to both internalizing and externalizing behavior of foster children, and that children who experience numerous changes in placement may be at particularly high risk For these deleterious effects. Initial Externalizing behaviors proved to be the strongest predictor of placement changes for the entire sample and for a sub-sample of those who initially evidenced problem behaviors on at least one broad-band CBCL scale. Our findings also suggest that children who initially score within normal ranges on the CBCL may be particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of placement breakdowns.
   Conclusions: On the basis of these findings we argue for an analytical approach that views behavior problems as both a cause and as a consequence of placement disruption. Children who do not evidence behavior problems may in fact constitute a neglected population that responds to multiple disruptions of their primary relationships with increasingly self-defeating behaviors.

AB Objective: Three areas of basic family research were selected for review as being of special importance to the clinically oriented child and adolescent psychiatrist: behavioral genetics, expressed emotion, and the interaction of family dynamics and childhood illness. Method: Medline and PSYCINFO searches using appropriate keywords were obtained for each of the 3 major areas. All English-language articles published after 1989 that included empirical research pertaining to children or adolescents were reviewed. Results: Behavioral genetics research indicates that the shared environment, including issues of parental monitoring and discipline, is important in the development and outcome of externalizing disorders. Differential parental treatments of one sibling are critical in internalizing disorders. Criticism las measured by expressed emotion) is associated with poor outcome of many childhood medical and psychiatric disorders. Chronic illness in a child changes the family dynamics toward being more structured and less emotionally warm and communicative. The family's role in adherence to treatment is critical, and families with high levels of criticism have more difficulty. Conclusions: Families can cause problems, but many times the problems families have are in response to a child's problems. There is a continued need to empirically assess which family processes are important for specific childhood disorders.

AB Objective: This prospective longitudinal study investigated the simultaneous impact of early biological and psychosocial risk factors on behavioral outcome at school age. Method: A cohort of 362 children born between 1986 and 1988 with different biological (perinatal insults) and psychosocial risk factors (family adversity) was followed from birth to school age. When their children were aged 8 years, parents of 89.0% of the initial sample completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: More externalizing as well as internalizing problems were found in children born into adverse family backgrounds, whereas no differences at broad-band syndrome level were apparent between groups with varying obstetric complications. Children with family risk factors had higher scores on 5 of the 8 CBCL scales (including attention, delinquent, and aggressive problems), whereas children with perinatal risk factors had more social and attention problems than children in the nonrisk groups. With one exception, no interactions between risk factors emerged, indicating that perinatal and family risk factors contributed independently to outcome. The differences between risk groups applied irrespective of gender. Conclusions: The adverse impact of family adversity clearly outweighed the influence of obstetric complications in determining behavioral adjustment at school age.

AB Objectives: To describe the level of self-esteem among the study population, to examine how self-esteem ratings may vary by disorder characteristics and medication use, and to identify predictors of low self-esteem while adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Method: In a school district-wide sample of children in special education programs, the authors assessed self-esteem with the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale among 143 students at high risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the school year 1995, with an interview participation rate of 73%. Disorder characteristics and medication use were assessed using multiple informants and standardized measures. Results: Self-esteem scores, on average, were in the normal range. However, across ADHD comorbidity profiles, children with ADHD and internalizing symptoms had significantly lower self-esteem scores, especially in the areas of anxiety and popularity, than children with ADHD alone or those with comorbid disruptive behavior disorders. Independent predictors of lower self-esteem were being white, high functional impairment, and comorbid internalizing conditions, but not medication use. Conclusions: Findings suggest that interventions for ADHD should be culturally sensitive as well as aimed at improving a child's functional level and associated internalizing symptoms. Medication use among this younger patient group was not related to self-esteem scores.

AB Objective. Prenatal cocaine exposure has been associated with alterations in neonatal behavior and more recently a dose-response relationship has been identified. However, few data are available to address the long-term behavioral effects of prenatal exposures in humans. The specific aim of this report is to evaluate the school-age behavior of children prenatally exposed to cocaine.
   Methods. All black non-human immunodeficiency virus-positive participants in a larger pregnancy outcomes study who delivered singleton live born infants between September 1, 1989 and August 31, 1991 were eligible for study participation. Staff members of the larger study extensively screened study participants during pregnancy for cocaine, alcohol, cigarettes, and other illicit drugs. Prenatal drug exposure was defined by maternal history elicited by structured interviews with maternal and infant drug testing as clinically indicated. Cocaine exposure was considered positive if either history or laboratory results were positive. Six years later, 665 families were contacted; 94% agreed to participate. The child, primary caretaker (parent), and, when available, the biologic mothers were tested in our research facilities. Permission was elicited to obtain blinded teacher assessments of child behavior with the Achenbach Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Drug use since the child's birth was assessed by trained researchers using a structured interview.
   Results. Complete laboratory and teacher data were available for 499 parent-child dyads, with a final sample size for all analyses of 471 (201 cocaine-exposed) after the elimination of mentally retarded subjects. A comparison of relative Externalizing (Aggressive, Delinquent) to Internalizing (Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints) behaviors of the offspring was computed for the TRF by taking the difference between the 2 subscales to create an Externalizing-Internalizing Difference (T. M. Achenbach, personal communication, 1998). Univariate comparisons revealed that boys were significantly more likely to score in the clinically significant range on total TRF, Externalizing-Internalizing, and Aggressive Behaviors than were girls. Children prenatally exposed to cocaine had higher Externalizing-Internalizing Differences compared with controls but did not have significantly higher scores on any of the other TRF variables. Additionally, boys prenatally exposed to cocaine were twice as likely as controls to have clinically significant scores for externalizing (25% vs 13%) and delinquent behavior (22% vs 11%). Gender, prenatal exposures (cocaine and alcohol), and postnatal risk factors (custody changes, current drug use in the home, child's report of violence exposure) were all related to problem behaviors. Even after controlling for gender, other prenatal substance exposures, and home environment variables, cocaine-exposed children had higher Externalizing-Internalizing Difference scores. Prenatal exposure to alcohol was associated with higher total score, increased attention problems, and more delinquent behaviors. Prenatal exposure to cigarettes was not significantly related to the total TRF score or any of the TRF subscales. Postnatal factors associated with problem behaviors included both changes in custody status and current drug use in the home. Change in custody status of the cocaine-exposed children, but not of the controls, was related to higher total scores on the TRF and more externalizing and aggressive behaviors. Current drug use in the home was associated with higher scores on the externalizing and aggressive subscales.
   Conclusions. Results of this study suggest gender-specific behavioral effects related to prenatal cocaine exposure. Prenatal alcohol exposure also had a significant impact on the TRF. Postnatal exposures, including current drug use in the home and the child's report of violence exposure, had an independent effect on teacher-assessed child behavioral problems. Furthermore, among the children prenatally exposed to cocaine, change in the child's custody status was a significant predictor of TRF scores. It remains possible that other unmeasured postnatal characteristics of the cocaine-using household may play important roles in teacher-assessed child behavior.

AB This study investigated the relationship of maternal and paternal parenting behavior (acceptance and firm control) during adolescence to four domains of early adult functioning (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, prosocial competence, and cognitive competence). Twenty-one females and 29 males from intact families, along with their mothers and fathers, participated. Assessments were conducted in adolescence and early adulthood, separated by approximately five and one-half years. Higher levels of maternal firm control during adolescence were associated with more secure early adult romantic attachment and lower levels of educational achievement. There were no main effects for fathers, but paternal parenting behavior interacted with maternal parenting behavior to predict both early adult romantic attachment and delinquency. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB To examine the relation between social support and appraisal of Life events in predicting adaptive, externalizing, and internalizing behavior in 265 school-age children, child-report on both a global and a significant other measure of social support was used. Life event scores were separated into events endorsed as negative and events endorsed as positive by the child. Using hierarchical regression analyses, the present study tested two models: main effects and moderator models of the relation between life events, social. support, and behavioral outcome. Support was found for global social support and positive life events in predicting adaptive, externalizing, and internalizing behavior. Gender differences were also found. Support was found for both the main effects and moderator models of the association between life events and global social support. Appraisal of life events as positive appears to compensate for lower levels of global social support. Appraisal is discussed as a possible protective factor from maladjustment after exposure to major life events.

AB On the basis of Quay's (1988a, 1988b, 1993, 1997) model in which the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) are Linked to various forms of child psychopathology, predictions were made regarding the relation between inhibitory control and two dimensions of psychopathology: externalizing and internalizing behavior. Inhibitory control was measured using two versions of Logan and Cowan's stop signal paradigm (1984; Logan, Cowan, & Davis, 1984; Osman, Kornblum, & Meyer, 1986, 1990). The primary outcome measure for the stop tasks was stop signal reaction time (SSRT) which measures the latency of the inhibition process. A positive relationship was predicted for externalizing behavior, whereas a negative relationship was predicted for internalizing behavior. A total of 42 non-clinical elementary school children, in the age range of 6 to 12 years, participated in the study. Externalizing behavior was positively related to response inhibition. Symptoms of ADHD seem to be better at predicting inhibitory functioning than symptoms of aggressive behavior disorders. Some support was found for a negative relation between internalizing behavior and inhibitory control. These findings support Quay's model and the discriminant validity of inhibitory control with regard to externalizing and internalizing behavior.

AB Examined the differences in the perception of control in 67 school-age children with externalizing and children with both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The results indicated that children with externalizing behavior and mixed behavior could be differentiated by their perception of control. Specifically, children with externalizing behavior endorsed a significantly stronger unknown locus of control than children in the mixed behavior group. Findings suggest that when behavior groups are clearly defined, neither external nor internal locus of control is the dominant style. Implications for the findings are discussed.

AB In a general population study of 4-year-olds, using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), parent reports of child behavior problems were compared in samples of 67 monoethnic Sami, 52 multiethnic Sami/Norwegian, and 63 monoethnic Norwegian children from the Sami core area in northern Norway. Mean CBCL total problem scores were low for all three groups [Sami: 21.1 (SD 15.5), Sami/Norwegian: 19.4 (SD 12.2) and Norwegian: 18.8 (SD 13.6)]. No significant differences across ethnic groups were found for the Total Problems scale and the Internalizing and Externalizing scales, nor for the syndrome scales, except for the Withdrawn scale, the Sami/Norwegian sample showing the highest scores. However, significant ethnicity x gender interactions emerged, indicating that the effect of ethnicity was different for boys versus girls. Sami mothers reported the highest and the Norwegian mothers the lowest scores for girls, whereas the opposite pattern was found for boys. Correlations between mothers' and fathers' reports were generally low. Differences in mean scale scores between pairs of parents (n = 122) were found for boys but not for girls, mothers scoring higher than fathers. The authors underline the importance of taking gender differences, age and ethnic context into account when assessing problem behavior in minority children. Methodological problems in cross-cultural assessments, including the influence of cultural norms of child behavior on parents' problem ratings, are discussed.

AB Background: Efforts to understand the correlates of psychological distress in children frequently examine possible correlates in samples of children who are selected for high levels of distress. The propose of this study was to compare distress correlates in a sample with depressed mothers, and thus at high-risk for distress, to a low-risk sample. Methods: Examining data from part of a larger project, the association of children's depressive symptoms and internalizing and externalizing problems to maternal depression level, life stress, verbal ability, and the experience of a traumatic event were examined in a series of regression equations. Results: Results indicated that children's depressive symptoms, rather than internalizing and externalizing problems, tended to be most consistently related to maternal variables, and also suggested that any experience of maternal depressive symptoms was associated with child problems. It was also found that child depressive symptoms were correlated with life events, but only for nondepressed mothers, and that at-risk children with higher levels of verbal ability were significantly less likely to report experiencing depressive symptoms and internalizing problems than were those with lower levels of verbal ability. Limitations: Because these data are preliminary, further research examining a broader array of variables is important. Conclusions: These results suggest the need for different models of these processes in different populations of children. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Examined whether maltreated preschoolers are more likely than nonmaltreated preschoolers to have fewer moral-affiliative and more conflictual narrative representations and whether these representations mediate child behavior problems. A structured narrative story-telling task was administered to assess representations, and independent ratings of behavior problems were obtained from teachers. The narratives of maltreated children contained more conflictual and fewer moral-affiliative themes. Maltreated children also exhibited more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. A partial mediation effect of conflictual representations on the relation between child maltreatment and externalizing behavior problems was found. The results demonstrate the relation between child maltreatment and children's organization of their life experiences and their behavioral symptomatology.

AB Examined the relation of the depression aspect of the tripartite model of depression and anxiety to the diagnostic status and future symptoms of two samples that included 74 child and adolescent psychiatric inpatients, ages 7 to 17 years (M = 13.57, SD = 2.39), some with either internalizing or externalizing diagnoses. The tripartite model suggests that anhedonia (low positive affect, or PA) differentiates depression from other conditions, whereas generalized negative affect (NA) also characterizes depression but is not specific to it. In this study, differences among children in PA and NA were associated with depressive versus externalizing diagnostic status and with future symptoms of depression. Depressive disorder diagnoses were associated with the combination of low levels of PA and high levels of NA. Changes over time in depression, but not in anxiety, also were associated with the combination of low PA and high NA. Results provide support for the applicability, clinical utility, and extension of the tripartite model with children.

AB Examined high, medium, and low social inhibition groups in a Swedish sample (N = 815) of 7- and 8-year-old children on the basis of parental reports about their children's reaction to novel social situations. High social inhibition was associated with increased levels of internalizing problems and low social competence. Among the low-inhibited children, we identified a subgroup by using an index of overfriendliness. Overfriendliness was associated with more internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems and lower prosocial orientation. The findings support the notion of high social inhibition as a risk factor for the development of internalizing problems and low social competence but question the view of low inhibition as descriptive of generally well-functioning children. Rather, this is true for low-inhibited children only when they are also low in overfriendliness. Thus, the results point to a need for a better understanding of developmental pathways for both high- and low-inhibited children.

AB The relations of patterns of family functioning, prosocial behaviors, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms over time were evaluated among a sample of economically disadvantaged inner-city African American and Mexican American male adolescents. Ethnic group differences for configurations of family functioning over time, levels of prosocial and problem behaviors, and relations of family functioning to risk were found. Among both ethnic groups, exceptionally functioning families provided a protective effect against risk. Overall, African American youth had stronger attitudes toward school and higher educational aspirations than Mexican American youth. Unlike previous investigations, once socioeconomic status was controlled, no differences were found for either internalizing or externalizing problems between the 2 groups. The importance of considering socioeconomic status and community context when evaluating minority parenting and family functioning is discussed.

AB Objective: To examine the relative importance of prenatal exposure to cigarettes and alcohol and familial/genetic susceptibility for alcohol dependence in the etiology of childhood psychopathology. Method: A longitudinal prospective study of 150 children/adolescents (51.3% male), who were at either high or low risk for developing alcohol dependence because of their familial loading for alcoholism, provided multiple diagnostic assessments (N = 318) of these subjects. High-risk families were identified through the presence of two adult alcoholic sisters; low-risk control families were selected from the community. Annual assessments of offspring from these families included an in-depth psychiatric interview of each child;Ind his/her parent to determine the presence or absence of childhood disorders. Mothers were interviewed concerning their prenatal use of substances, and information was gathered concerning their personal and familial loading for psychiatric disorders. Results: Using conventional logistic regression analyses, internalizing and externalizing disorders were found to be associated with familial loading for alcoholism and prenatal exposure to cigarettes and alcohol. In addition, a specialized statistical analysis, a multivariate confounder score approach, was conducted using familial risk status and the child's exposure to maternal prenatal use of alcohol and cigarettes. This analysis demonstrated that only one relationship between a single variable and a childhood disorder was significant while controlling for the other two variables: Oppositional disorder remained significant in association with familial risk status. Three additional analyses were performed to evaluate the effects of familial risk status, prenatal alcohol exposure and prenatal cigarette exposure on childhood psychopathology while controlling for two known risk factors (SES and parental ASPD) for externalizing disorders. Results of these analyses revealed that the only childhood disorder that was elevated was ADHD, and that this was the result of the familial risk Variable only. Conclusions: Familial loading for alcohol dependence is an important risk factor for the development of childhood psychopathology and may account for the previously reported associations between prenatal exposure to nicotine and alcohol. Studies of substance abuse/dependence etiology and childhood psychopathology need to include consideration of both prenatal exposures and familial loading for alcohol dependence and other psychiatric disorders.

AB One hundred and twenty families and their 4-year-old children participated in a study on family stories. The participants were primarily White (91 %), with the remainder Black (4 %), Hispanic (2 %), and Asian (2 %). The parents were primarily middle class and upper class, with approximately 5% identifying themselves as from a lower socioeconomic background Parents were asked to tell their son or daughter stories about when the parent was growing up. All parents completed measures of child behavior and a subset of parents completed the Bem Sex Role inventory. Stories were coded for the strength of affiliation, achievement and autonomy themes. No gender differences were found for parents or child in the strength of affiliation themes. Fathers told stories with stronger autonomy themes than did mothers, and sons were more likely to hear stories with themes of autonomy than were daughters. An interaction was found between gender type of parent and gender of child for strength of achievement theme. Traditional gender-typed parents told stories with stronger achievement themes to their sons, and nontraditional gender-typed parents told stories with stronger achievement themes to their daughters. Exploratory analyses were conducted examining the relations among story theme, parent gender type, and child behavior Higher levels of externalizing behaviors were found in boys whose fathers endorsed strong masculine attitudes, but told stories with weak achievement themes. Higher levels of internalizing behaviors were found in girls whose mothers told stories with strong affiliation themes, but endorsed weak feminine attitudes. Family stories are proposed to be one aspect of socialization that includes an interaction between child and parent characteristics.

AB Recent evidence, showing that gender differences in depression and antisocial behavior originate in early adolescence, points to the importance of socialization and dimensions of the self in understanding the higher rates of internalizing disorders among females and higher rates of externalizing disorders among males. We review theories and research that link gender stratification to dimensions of the self and through this, to gender differences in disorders. These theories and evidence further suggest that girls and boys differ in the boundaries drawn between the self and others. Ranging from high degrees of connectedness to high degrees of separation, such boundaries are conceptualized as people's basic operating assumptions about social relationships An analysis of empathy provides a preliminary test of the contribution of boundary assumptions to explaining gender differences in internalizing and externalizing disorders.

AB Mother-child data of the Notional longitudinal Survey of Youth were used to identify the parenting practices that mediate relations between persistent, recent, and transitional poverty and the externalizing and internalizing behaviors of children four to five years old. Persistent poverty is associated with a lower-quality physical home environment, which is linked to children's internalizing behaviors. Lower-quality physical environment, maternal emotional unresponsiveness, and fewer stimulating experiences contribute significantly to the effect of recent poverty on internalizing behaviors. Lower-quality physical environment and fewer stimulating experiences mediate the relation between recent poverty and externalizing behaviors. Contrary to hypothesized relations, transitional poverty predicts fewer externalizing and internalizing behaviors.

AB One of four children in the United States lives in a family in which the child is exposed to alcoholism. Children of alcoholics (COAs) are two to ten times more likely to develop alcoholism than non-COAs. This paper reviews studies that have attempted to identify risk factors that mediate the increased vulnerability and the protective factors that moderate the risk Factors discussed include parental antisocial personality disorder, externalizing behavior, internalizing symptoms, differential response to the effects of alcohol, and positive and negative alcohol-related expectancies. The heterogeneous nature of COAs is emphasized, and some of the challenges related to treatment and prevention are discussed.

AB Symptoms of internalization were examined in relation to children's self-reports of three emotions in situations that were either ambiguous or unambiguous as to the child's responsibility for various standard violations. Children ranging in age from 6 to 13 years were drawn from elementary schools (61 boys, 79 girls, mean age = 8.7) and from a community mental health center (23 boys, 18 girls, mean age = 8.5) to which they had been referred for problems related to internalization or externalization. Shame proneness was consistently linked to internalizing symptoms across contexts. Guilt proneness, in response to ambiguous scenarios, was also associated with internalization, whereas pride responses were unrelated to symptoms. Few age- or gender-related differences were found. The results cast doubt on notions that self-conscious emotions, such as guilt, are necessarily adaptive or maladaptive. Systematic research is needed to understand which features of any emotion contribute to children's psychological adjustment.

Specificity was defined according to a between-subjects and a within-subjects method, using parent and teacher reports of psychopathology. Temperamental withdrawal, parental internalizing psychopathology, and early single parenthood (for girls) were identified as correlates that are specific for internalizing problems, whereas temperamental high general activity level was identified as externalizing-specific. Further, parenting stress. poor school results (only for boys), and stressful life events (only for girls) were found to be common correlates of psychopathology. Research implications regarding the findings and the use of a within-subjects method are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between anger-based marital conflict and the development of an anger organization in children between the ages of 4 and 8 years old. Anger organization was defined as an adversarial approach to relationships demonstrated through (a) short-term anger expressions during social interaction and (b) aggression in relationships. Seventy-one children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, their mothers, and their teachers participated in the study. Mothers completed questionnaires on anger-based marital conflict and on children's aggression. Sociometric ratings of anger and aggression were obtained from peers. Teachers supplied reports of children's aggression. Children's short-term emotional expression and the circumstances that elicited emotions were observed during peer interaction. Anger-based marital conflict was found to be strongly associated with peer, maternal, and teacher reports of aggression, but not with reports of internalizing symptomatology. Anger-based marital conflict was also associated with short-term anger expressions, but not with short-term expressions of sadness. I argue that children develop an emotional organization in which anger predominates when they are exposed to high levels of anger-based marital conflict.

AB Objectives: Errorless compliance training is a success-based, noncoercive intervention for children with severe oppositional behavior. The strategy involves hierarchical introduction of more demanding parental requests at a gradual pace that greatly reduces noncompliance and obviates the need for constraining consequences (e.g., time-out). In this study, this approach was evaluated as a treatment for severe disciplinary problems in children from violent homes. Method: Participants were 15 children (aged 3-10 years) and their mothers. All participants had experienced long-term family violence. Using a multiple-baseline design, the authors trained parents in a group format and conducted observations of child compliance in the home throughout the intervention. Results: Observations indicated improvements in generalized child compliance that were maintained up to 6 months posttreatment. Pre-/post maternal reports indicated significant reductions in maternal perception of child noncompliance, externalizing and internalizing problems, and parenting stress. Conclusions: Researchers have noted a dearth of empirically supported interventions for children from violent homes. Errorless compliance training may help to fill this void, as it appears well suited to treatment of difficulties encountered by these youngsters and their parents.

AB Psycholinguistic abilities, gramatical comprehension and pragmatic skills were analysed on a sample comformed by 82 preschool children. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between language impairments and socio-emotional problems. From their scores on a number of language tests and pragmatic protocol there are evidence of expected association. Internalizing and inattention symtomatic children were deficient on the lenguage comprehension in terms of the extent as the frequency. The results will highlight the implications for clinical practice and for school practice. Sistematic assesment of language in the early period of school are needed to prevent socio-emocional problems.

AB Three models of the relations of coping efficacy, coping, and psychological problems of children of divorce were investigated. A structural equation model using cross-sectional data of 356 nine- to twelve-year-old children of divorce yielded results that supported coping efficacy as a mediator of the relations between both active coping and avoiding coping and psychological problems. In a prospective longitudinal model with a subsample of 162 of these children, support was found for Time 2 coping efficacy as a mediator of the relations between Time 1 active coping and Time 2 internalizing of problems. Individual growth curve models over four waves also found support for coping efficacy as a mediator of the relations between active coping and psychological problems. No support was found for alternative models of coping as a mediator of the relations between efficacy and symptoms or for coping efficacy as a moderator of the relations between coping and symptoms.

AB Purpose: To examine the influence of family adversity and support on levels of psychiatric symptomatology in Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian adolescents.
   Method: More than 4000 students from five high schools in Hawaii completed a survey during the 1992-1993 school year about their family environment and mental health. The response rate was approximately 60%. Logistic regression analyses were performed and responses for Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians were compared.
   Results: Hawaiian adolescents experienced significantly more adversity than their non-Hawaiian counterparts. The cumulative effect of family adversity had a greater effect on psychiatric symptomatology than any single indicator. Family support reduced the risk for internalizing symptoms, particularly for Hawaiian adolescents. The influence of family support was less clear for externalizing symptoms, increasing the risk for some adolescents and decreasing the risk for others.
   Conclusion: We identified strong associations between family adversity and levels of psychiatric symptomatology. We found that Hawaiian adolescents are at increased risk for psychiatric symptomatology, given the presence of family adversity and the effect of reduced family support. However, risk was also substantial for non-Hawaiians. Clinicians need to assess the family environ-ment routinely and implement family-oriented interventions.

AB Even early-treated patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) have a higher risk of psychosocial maladjustment. This study was performed to determine whether emotional and behavioural problems are specific in phenylketonurics and whether they depend on the quality of biochemical control. This comparative study covered 42 PKU patients aged 10-18 years (mean 14.7 years) and 42 diabetic patients matched for sex, age and socioeconomic status. Patients' groups were compared with a control sample of healthy controls (n = 2900) from an epidemiological study. We used the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) according to Achenbach, intelligence quotient (IQ) test according to Weiss, and monitoring of blood phenylalanine concentrations and HBA1 concentrations. Internalizing problems such as depressive mood, anxiety, physical complaints or social isolation were significantly elevated in both phenylketonuric and diabetic patients, whereas externalizing problems were not. The two patient groups did not differ significantly either in the degree or in the pattern of their psychological profile. In both groups no significant correlations could be computed between the psychological characteristics and the biochemical control, the IQ, and the socioeconomic status. No patient was undergoing psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy. Our results strongly support a psychological perspective for the development of behavioural and emotional problems in both phenylketonuric and diabetic patients. Thus, medical treatment should be accompanied by psychological support for the families.

TI Biracial youth and families in therapy: Issues and interventions
SO JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGY
AB Empirical research and clinical resources focusing specifically on minority youth and families have increased tremendously in the last 2 decades. Despite this trend, certain groups continue to be relatively neglected. In particular very few resources exist for understanding the unique challenges that often face biracial youth and their families. In this article, we use a nationally representative database to compare functioning in biracial youth to white adolescents and other minority adolescents. Results suggest that biracial/biethnic youth are a particularly vulnerable group in terms of self-reported delinquency, school problems, internalizing symptoms, and self-regard. As a group, they are also more likely to receive some form of psychological intervention. Given these findings and the shortcoming of clinical resources for work with this population, we provide an in-depth discussion of why biracial youth may be particularly vulnerable from a social constructionist framework and offer several strategies based on narrative family therapy for working with biracial youngsters and their families.

AB Objective. To investigate the hypothesis that children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) would have more social and emotional problems than case-control classmates.
   Methods. Using a case-control design, children with JRA (n = 74), ages 8-14, were compared with case-control classmates (n = 74). Peer relationships, emotional well-being, and behavior, based on peer-, teacher-, parent-, and self-report scores on common measures, were compared using analysis of variance.
   Results. Relative to case-control classmates, children,vith JRA were similar on all measures of social functioning and behavior. Mothers reported more internalizing symptoms in the child with JRA, but child self reports and father reports showed no differences. Scores on all standardized measures were in the normal range for both the JRA and the case-control groups.
   Conclusion. Children with JRA were remarkably similar to case-control children on measures of social functioning, emotional well-being, and behavior. These findings are not supportive of disability/stress models of chronic illness in childhood and suggest considerable psychological hardiness among children with JRA.

AB This study investigated developmental aspects of psychological defenses in relation to self-complexity, self-perception, and symptomatology through a comparison of two groups of adolescents characterized by defense maturity level (i.e., immature versus mature defenses). The Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-78), the Self-Complexity Inventory (SCI), the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, and the Youth Self Report behavior checklist (YSR) were completed by 79 high school students ranging in age from 15 to 18 years. Subjects were characterized as either employing predominantly mature or immature defensive strategies based on median splits of the two defense factors. Dependent variables included the Self-Complexity Inventory, The Youth Self Report and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. The mature defense group (N = 26) reported significantly higher self-complexity than the immature defense group (N = 26), supporting a developmental approach to defense mechanisms. In general, mature defense mechanisms seem to be more adaptive in late adolescence than immature defenses as indicated by higher global self-worth and fewer internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The findings lend support to the developmental approach to the self and highlight the importance of examining psychological indices of development independent of chronological age.

AB We surveyed 62 school administrators from three midatlantic (MD, VA, WV) and one northeastern (CT) state on factors relevant to developing school-based mental health programs. Administrators were from schools that varied on education level (elementary, middle, and high) and geographic location turban, suburban, and rural, with equivalent numbers in each subgroup. Administrators provided ratings to questions grouped in five categories: (a) Stressful Conditions, (b) Internalizing Behavioral Problems, (c) Externalizing Behavioral Problems, (d) Substance Abuse, and (e) Barriers to Mental Health Care, and provided open-ended comments on needs of youth and mental health programs for them. They rated behavioral and substance abuse problems as progressively more serious as students advanced in school level. Urban youth were reported to encounter higher stress and present more severe internalizing problems than suburban or rural youth. Suburban and rural schools provided more health and mental health services than urban schools. Across geographic locales, physical health services far outnumbered mental health services. Findings related to barriers to mental health care, and the viability of schools as delivery sites for comprehensive mental health services, are discussed.

AB The focus of this article is on internalizing problems that are experienced by children and adolescents. We provide an historical perspective, selectively examine the current state of knowledge, consider advances and gaps in what is known, and identify new research directions. Diagnosis, epidemiology, theory, and research first are considered separately for anxiety and depressive disorders. These internalizing problems, however, whether clinical or subclinical, share many common features and show high comorbidity rates. We emphasize the importance of systematic analysis of comorbid anxiety and depression, including their comorbidity with externalizing problems. This could lead to more valid classification of subtypes of internalizing problems and further an understanding of the diverse conditions that constitute internalized distress. We highlight the need to study anxiety and depression within a developmental psychopathology framework, as well as to include both categorical and dimensional assessments of these problems in the same research designs. This will be essential for understanding the complex interplay of biological and environmental processes that contribute to the emergence, progression, and amelioration of internalizing problems over time.

AB Examined whether cognitive features in Beck's (1967) model of depression and his cognitive content-specificity hypothesis (Beck, Brown, Steer, Eidelson, & Riskind, 1987) are broadband specific features that distinguish internalizing problems from om externalizing problems. From a community (n = 389; 196 boys, 193 girls; age M = 9.98, SD = 1.52) and clinic (n = 82; 55 boys, 27 girls; age M = 10.42, SD = 2.91) sample, 4 groups were defined on behavioral measures and then examined on cognitive measures: externalizing only (n = 33), internalizing only (n = 41), comorbid externalizing and internalizing (n = 53), and control (neither externalizing nor internalizing; n = 35). Both the internalizing only and comorbid groups reported significantly more cognitive disturbances (negative cognitive triad, cognitive processing distortions, and "depressive" and "anxious" thought content) than both of the externalizing only and control groups in both the community and clinic samples. The results were not related to either overall level of psychopathology (as reported by mothers) or social desirability in children's reporting. These findings suggest that the cognitive features in Beck's model distinguish internalizing from externalizing problems and add to a growing literature that calls for further conceptual refinement of cognitive models for understanding both narrow-band and broadband syndromes.

AB The authors examined the association of psychological adjustment, styles of coping, and disease severity for children with recurrent syncope. Participants were 44 children and adolescents with a history of recurrent syncope and 40 healthy comparison control children. Dependent variables were measures of internalizing adjustment (e.g., anxiety, depression, withdrawal) reported by children and their parents and styles of coping reported by children. Parents reported higher frequencies of the internalizing of behavioral symptoms (i.e., anxiety, withdrawal) for children with recurrent syncope compared with their healthy counterparts. Children's self-reports did not reveal significant differences between the syncope and comparison groups in psychological adjustment and styles of coping. The authors conclude from these findings that adjustment difficulties, including symptoms of anxiety and social withdrawal, may occur with recurrent syncope. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

AB This study examined gender differences in the associations between posttraumatic stress symptoms and problematic substance use in psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Ninety-five adolescent inpatients (38 boys, 57 girls) were systematically evaluated with a battery of psychometrically well-established self-report measures to assess trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, problematic alcohol and drug use, and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Twenty-three percent (N = 22) of patients met DSM-TV-based symptom criteria for PTSD, and 37% (N = 35) and 34% (N = 32) of patients endorsed problematic levels of drug and alcohol use, respectively. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly associated with problematic drug and alcohol use in girls but not in boys. There were no significant gender differences in posttraumatic stress symptoms and/or problematic substance use, to account for the gender differences in the association between PTSD and substance use. Our findings suggest that the link between substance abuse and PTSD may be especially salient for female adolescents.

AB Kindergarten teacher ratings of physical aggression, hyperactivity, inattention, anxiety, and prosocial behavior were used to predict self-reported delinquency, peer-rated social withdrawal, add school placement in preadolescence (ages 10 to 12 years) in a large longitudinal sample of boys from low socio-economic neighborhoods. Two analytic strategies were used: person-oriented and variable-oriented approaches. In the person approach, eight clusters, based on the kindergarten behaviors, were used to predict delinquency, social withdrawal, and school placement. In the variable approach, the kindergarten behaviors were used as dimensions in logistic regressions. Family adversity was used as the first predictor in both approaches; it significantly predicted all the outcomes in preadolescence. The results obtained using the two approaches were partly in accordance. In both sets of results, kindergarten teacher-rated externalizing behavior problems were most related to later self-reported delinquency, and internalizing problems to peer-rated social withdrawal. However, the person approach showed that all patterns of kindergarten behavior problems increased the risk for placement out of an age-appropriate regular classroom, while only inattention and lack of prosocial behavior were the significant dimensional predictors of this negative outcome according to the variable approach. Also, the person approach showed that the Multiproblem kindergarten boys had the highest percentage of comorbidity of preadolescent problems. The ROC curves indicated that prediction of delinquency, social withdrawal, and school placement were equally accurate using the cluster and variable approaches. Advantages and limits of both approaches are discussed with reference to their usefulness for clinicians.

AB The present study investigated the relationships between the achievement strategies adolescents deploy in a school context and their self-esteem, school adjustment and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. A total of 1185 14-to15-year-old adolescents filled in the Strategy and Attribution Questionnaire (SAQ), Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, and scales measuring school adjustment, depression and externalizing problem behavior The adolescents' parents were also asked to evaluate their children's achievement strategies, school adjustment and, externalizing problem behavior The results revealed that low self-esteem was associated with adolescents' use of maladaptive achievement strategies which, in turn, was associated with their maladjustment at school, and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Moreover; the association between adolescents' maladaptive strategies and their externalizing problem behavior was partly mediated via their school adjustment. The results suggest that the achievement strategies adolescents deploy are reflected nor only in their school adjustment but also in their overall problem behavior.

ID GENERAL HOSPITALS; FOLLOW-UP
AB Objective: Clinical presentations of children and adolescents admitted to eight psychiatric hospitals were examined to determine variation in symptoms and severity of illness. Methods: A prospective design was implemented using the Childhood Severity of Psychiatric Illness (CSPI) scale, a reliable measure of psychiatric severity and factors thought to affect decision making about mental health services. The CSPI was completed by mobile crisis workers after interviews with 875 children and adolescents to assess whether hospitalization was appropriate. All the children were wards of the state in Cook County, Illinois, and all were subsequently hospitalized. Results: A factor analysis of the CSPI revealed three distinct factors: caregiver problems, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms. Children were classified as having mild, moderate, or severe problems or symptoms in the areas covered by the three factors. Chi square analyses revealed that significant variation existed between hospitals in the proportions of children with problems or symptoms in the three factor areas and in the severity of their problems or symptoms. Conclusions: The major finding of variation among the eight hospitals on measures of severity; of children's psychiatric illness and caregiver problems empirically supports the importance of adjusting for severity before implementing initiatives to manage performance and outcome across a system of hospitals.

AB Seasonal variations were assessed in symptoms of internalizing (anxiety and mood), externalizing (attention-deficit/hyperactivity and oppositional defiant disorders), and substance use disorders in youth. This study is based on secondary data analysis of two NIMH-funded epidemiologic-services studies: (a) Alternative Service Use Patterns by Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance (N = 936, ages 9-17); and (b) Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (N = 1285, ages 9-17). Child psychiatric diagnoses were measured by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. Variables that indicate site of the interview and service system, as well as age, gender, and ethnicity, were used as covariates. Significant annual variations were found in symptom counts of overanxious disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, and major depressive disorder, with the estimated nadir in August-October. There may be weak seasonal variations in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with estimated nadir in August, oppositional defiant disorder with estimated nadir in August-September, and marijuana use with estimated zenith in August-September. Significant seasonality in alcohol, other substance use, agoraphobia, and panic disorder was not found. There may be an instrument-specific bias in estimated nadir. Real nadirs may be up to 3 months prior to the estimated nadirs specified above. Findings suggest that seasonality in symptoms should be considered when assessment instruments of childhood psychiatric disorders are developed, as well as when epidemiological and clinical data are collected and analyzed.

AB Objective: To determine whether there are associated long-term deficits in the cognitive, academic, or behavioral outcomes of children with a previous episode of Kawasaki disease.
   Design: Cohort analytic study.
   Setting: A tertiary care pediatric hospital in Ottawa, Ontario.
   Participants: Thirty-two patients with a past diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. Siblings of the patients with Kawasaki disease were eligible to be controls.
   Measures: A blinded psychometrist (Y.K.) assessed cognition by the appropriate Wechsler Intelligence scale, academic achievement by the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, and behavior by the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: No differences were found in cognitive or academic measures and the mean scores corresponded closely to national norms. Parents rated their children who had Kawasaki disease as having significantly more internalizing (P<.03) and attentional (P<.02) behavior problems than controls; the risk of a clinically significant behavioral score was 3.3 times greater (P<.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.9) than for sibling controls.
   Conclusions: While no effect on cognitive development or academic performance was demonstrated, these results provide preliminary indication of a post-Kawasaki disease deficit in internalizing and attentional behavior.

AB Objective: This study had three main objectives: First, to assess physically abused children's perceptions of teacher, peer, and family support; second. to determine whether the levels of perceived support differ according to the person's social role; and third to assess which sources of social support show stronger associations with adjustment in a physically abused sample.
   Method: Perceived social support from teachers, families and peers was assessed in a sample of 37 physically abused children using a shortened version of the Survey of Children's Social Support (Dubow & Ullman, 1989). Child adjustment was indexed by child and parent reports of child depression, anxiety, and anger.
   Results: Analyses indicated that the children rated their families, peers, and teachers highly as sources of social support, with families being rated as the most important source. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived peer support was significantly negatively related to children's and parent's reports of children's depression and anxiety. Furthermore, perceived family support was significantly negatively associated with child reported depression. No significant relationships were found between perceived teacher support and symptomatology.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that peer and family support are particularly important for physically abused children's psychological functioning, particularly for internalizing problems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A sample of 6th-grade children (N = 470), initially aged 12 years, in Shanghai, People's Republic of China, participated in this longitudinal study. Data on children's sociability and prosocial orientation were collected from peer assessments. Information on indexes of adjustment was obtained from multiple sources. The results indicated that sociable and prosocial functions were 2 overlapping, but distinct, dimensions of social competence and had common as well as unique contributions to the prediction of adjustment in specific areas. Whereas prosocial orientation was mainly predictive of social and school adjustment and externalizing problems, sociability uniquely contributed to the prediction of internalizing problems and emotional adjustment. Finally, prosocial orientation and sociability might moderate the development of adjustment difficulties.

AB Purpose: We conducted a 4-year follow-up study of behavior problems in children with either epilepsy (n = 115) or asthma (n = 105) to identify changes in behavior problems as they were related to gender and change in condition severity. All children were between ages 8 and 13 years and had been diagnosed with their respective conditions for greater than or equal to 1 year at entry into the study.
   Methods: Behavior problems were measured by using the mother's rating on the Child Behavior Checklist. Baseline and follow-up behavior problem scores were examined to see if significant changes occurred over the observation period of the study. To explore change in behavior based on condition severity, each child was placed into "low" and "high" condition severity groups at each time, resulting in four groups: low/low, low/high, high/flow, or high/high. There were too few cases in the low/high group to be included in some analyses. Data were analyzed by using analysis of covariance with adjustment for baseline behaviors, age, and age of onset.
   Results: Within both samples, there was a significant improvement over time for the Total Behavior Problems and Internalizing Problems scores (p less than or equal to 0.006). Improvement in Internalizing Problems was greater for the asthma sample than for the epilepsy sample (p less than or equal to 0.007). Within the epilepsy sample, there was a significant gender-by-change in seizure condition interaction for Total Behavior Problems, Internalizing Problems, and Externalizing Problems. The interaction effect indicated that behavior problems in girls with high seizure severity at both baseline and follow-up became substantially worse over the 4-year period.
   Conclusions: It was concluded that adolescent girls, particularly those with high-severity epilepsy during the transition to adolescence, merit closer clinical supervision for behavior problems.

AB Cross-sectional quantitative designs are often used to investigate whether peer victimization is positively related to psychosocial maladjustment. This paper presents a meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies, published between 1978 and 1997, of the association of peer victimization with psychosocial maladjustment. Mean effect sizes were calculated for the association between peer victimization and each form of maladjustment (depression, loneliness, generalized and social anxiety, and global and social self-worth) assessed. The results suggested that victimization is most strongly related to depression, and least strongly related to anxiety. There was no evidence that victimization is more strongly related to social than to psychological forms of maladjustment. Effect sizes were stronger when the same informants were used to assess both victimization and maladjustment than when different informants were used. There were some design limitations to the studies reviewed, but all together their results provide a strong background for more complex research into the course and treatment of victims' distress.

AB In this study, the relationship between short-term emotion expressions and dimensional ratings of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology was examined. Short-term emotions, defined as facial or vocal displays of emotion generally lasting less than 10 seconds and elicited by a specific and proximal event, were observed during recess in 71 children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, who were between 4 and 8 years old. Internalizing and externalizing symptomatology was assessed through parent and teacher questionnaire. Sociometric ratings were obtained from peers on children's anger and aggression. It was hypothesized following Tomkins (1979) and others that one affect becomes predominant in the emotional experience of the individual. Different operationalizations of this concept were examined. Using regression analyses, externalizing symptomatology was found to be predicted by higher levels of anger, lower levels of happiness, and lower levels of sadness. Internalizing symptomatology was found to be predicted by higher levels of sadness and lower levels of anger. It was concluded on the basis of these data that the relationship between short-term emotion and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology is best understood as the balance between different short-term emotions. Results are discussed in the context of theories of emotion and their functions.

AB The current investigation examined whether the positive association of family conflict to adolescent depression and conduct problems is attenuated by maternal, paternal, and peer attachment, and maternal and paternal monitoring, within a low-income, multiethnic sample of 284 adolescents. Parental attachment and monitoring moderated the link front family conflict to conduct problems bur not depression; the relationships among family conflict, the hypothesized protective factors, and conduct problems were further modified by adolescent gender bur not ethnicity. In general, higher levels of the hypothesized protective factors attenuated the relationship between family conflict and conduct problems for girls bur exacerbated this relationship for boys. These findings suggest that, in general, parental attachment and monitoring served as protective factors for girls while serving as additional risk factors for boys in conflictual families.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the protective effect of social support in the relationship between exposure to violence and psychopathology. Exposure to violence in the family and exposure to violence in the community were examined separately. Exposure to violence was further divided according to whether violence was experienced as a victim or as a witness. Internalizing and externalizing forms of psychopathology, as well as post-traumatic stress symptomatology were examined.
   Method: Participants consisted of 65 high-risk adolescents admitted consecutively to psychiatric inpatient units. Data were collected by means of individual interviews, self-report questionnaires, and hospital charts.
   Results: Social support emerged as a protective factor with respect to the maladaptive effects of family violence, experienced as either a victim or as a witness. In contrast, social support did not appear to buffer the maladaptive effects of community violence, regardless of whether violence was experienced as a victim or as a witness. In fact, the relationship between community violence and psychopathology was found to be generally nonsignificant regardless of social support status.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that exposure to family violence may affect development differently than exposure to community violence, allowing social support to effectively buffer the effects of family, but not community violence. This finding highlights the importance of examining violence exposure that occurs within the family separately from violence exposure that occurs within the community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The study evaluated the effectiveness of mental health center treatments for children aged 5-12 years. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was administered before and after treatment to the parents of the treatment group (N = 71). The results were analyzed and compared to the results of the pretest and posttest CBCL administered to the parents of a matched group of comparison subjects (N = 33). The results showed that the treatment subjects significantly improved on both the externalizing and internalizing scales of the CBCL. The controls showed no significant change between pretest and posttest scores. As a result, it appears that clinic treatments can help clients with measurable problems decrease problematic behaviors. More data is needed to determine whether clinic treatments such as the ones described in this study can substantially help the most seriously disturbed school-age children.

AB Studies on the effect of migration on the mental health of the adolescent immigrants are inconclusive. The aim of this paper was to study the psychological state of juvenile Greekpontians, who migrated from ex-Soviet Union to Greece. 48 immigrant highschool students and 300 native peers completed the Youth self Report (Y.S.R.) (Achenbach, 1991), a psychological test measuring competence and problem areas. The mental health profile of the immigrants' group was better compared to the local native group. The immigrants group scored lower (i.e. reported fewer problems) on the following to problem scales: sumaric complaints, anxiety/depression, attention problems; delinquency behaviour, aggressive behaviour, internalizing, externalizing. total problem for females and aggressive behavior for both males and females. Having considered selection bias in the process of immigration and social desirability bias ("reactive overcompliance") in the process of questionaire response, the authors conclude with the generation of the hypothe sis that a likely explanation for this phenomenon may be a favourable balance between stressful migration events and protective mechanisms.

AB In a sample of 405 children assessed in kindergarten through the seventh grade, we determined the basic developmental trajectories of mother-reported and teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors using cross-domain latent growth modeling techniques. We also investigated the effects of race, socioeconomic level, gender, and sociometric peer-rejection status in kindergarten on these trajectories. The results indicated that, on average, the development of these behaviors was different depending upon the source of the data. We found evidence of the codevelopment of externalizing and internalizing behaviors within and across reporters. In addition, we found that African-American children had lower levels of externalizing behavior in kindergarten as reported by mothers than did European-American children but they had greater increases in these behaviors when reported by teachers. Children from homes with lower SES levels had higher initial levels of externalizing behaviors and teacher-reported internalizing behaviors. Males showed greater increases in teacher-reported externalizing behavior over time than did the females. Rejected children had trajectories of mother-reported externalizing and internalizing behavior that began at higher levels and either remained stable or increased more rapidly than did the trajectories for non-rejected children which decreased over time.

AB Objective: To establish prodromal signs of and risk factors for childhood bipolar disorder (BD) by characterizing youths at high risk for ED. Method: Structured diagnostic interviews were performed on 60 biological offspring of at least one parent with ED. Demographics, family histories, and parental history of childhood disruptive behavioral disorders were also assessed. Results: Fifty-one percent of bipolar offspring had a psychiatric disorder, most commonly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depression or dysthymia, and ED. ED in offspring tended to be associated with earlier parental symptom onset when compared with offspring without a psychiatric diagnosis. Bipolar parents with a history of childhood ADHD were more likely to have children with ED, but not ADHD. Offspring with bilineal risk had increased severity of depressed and irritable mood, lack of mood reactivity, and rejection sensitivity, while severity of grandiosity, euphoric mood, and decreased need for sleep were not preferentially associated with such offspring. Conclusions: Bipolar offspring have high levels of psychopathology. Parental history of early-onset ED and/or childhood ADHD may increase the risk that their offspring will develop ED. Prodromal symptoms of childhood ED may include more subtle presentations of mood regulation difficulties and less presence of classic manic symptoms.

DE enuresis; self-concept
ID NOCTURNAL ENURESIS; CHILDREN
AB Background. Previous studies have suggested changes in self-concept with successful treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE), but behavioral changes have not been reported as a consistent associated finding.
   Objective. To determine if self-concept and behavior change after 6 months of treatment of monosymptomatic PNE by conditioning alarm or desmopressin acetate (DDAVP).
   Design. Randomized, controlled trial in an inner-city hospital clinic. Subjects were 182 children referred or recruited through media publicity, randomly assigned both to 1 of 8 pediatricians and 1 of 3 treatment groups (alarm, DDAVP, or placebo). Included were children >7 years old with PNE, no daytime symptoms, bladder capacity >50% expected, and wetting >3 times a week. Excluded were children with central nervous system disorders or developmental delays, and those currently on DDAVP or alarm. Subjects completed the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale and Harter's Perceived Competence Scale for Children (PCSC) at initial visit and after 6 months of treatment. Parents completed the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at the same times.
   Results. After 6 months of treatment the Piers-Harris total score showed a highly significant treatment by period interaction effect for DDAVP, a significant effect for alarm, and no effect for placebo. For children who achieved 75% dryness the CBCL showed a treatment by improvement interaction effect that was highly significant for DDAVP and placebo with no effect for alarm. For the PCSC there were no treatment or outcome interaction effects.
   After 6 months of treatment there were significant changes over time unrelated to outcome or treatment in the Piers-Harris Subscales and in the CBCL Internalizing and Externalizing Scores, and the Social Thought and Attention Problems Subscales. The PCSC was more stable with no changes in total score, and positive changes over time in only 2 Subscales, Scholastic and Social.
   Conclusion. Children's self-concept improved with the type of treatment and amount of success. Parents' perceptions of behavior improve with type of treatment and amount of success. Children rate their self-concept and some physical attributes better after treatment with any of DDAVP, alarm, or placebo regardless of outcome. Frequent follow-up with emotional support and encouragement appear to be important components of an efficacious intervention for children with nocturnal enuresis.

Only 28% of the children scored within normal ranges on all three types of outcomes. Intellectual and linguistic delays were predicted best by prenatal measures of maternal Performance IQ and social support from extended family. Socioemotional problems were predicted best by maternal internalizing problems and social support from partner and friends. Adaptive behavior was associated with parenting style. Implications for the early identification of high-risk children-and associated intervention programs-are discussed.

AB The focus in this study is on social competence and behavioural problems in a group (n=57) of hearing-impaired 7- to 12-year-old children. Results were related to hearing status, school placement, and gender. Parent and teacher questionnaires were used to measure two aspects of social competence, prosocial orientation and social initiative, and three aspects of behavioural problems, externalizing, internalizing, and concentration problems. A sample of 214 normally-hearing children was used as a comparison group. Overall, the results showed only minor differences between the two groups, with the exception that the hearing-impaired children showed less social initiative in parent ratings. There were no relationships between social functioning and hearing status or school placement (mainstream vs. special classes for hearing-impaired children) nor any clear pattern of gender differences. These Endings indicate that hearing-impaired children in Sweden fare well. The results are discussed in terms of the need for longitudinal studies and possible interventions targeted at social behaviours.

AB In order to test the effect of systematic supervised physical training, we divided a total of 129 children and adolescents with congenital heart disease into a group undergoing intervention and a control group. All patients underwent exercise tests, measurements of physical activity, and a survey of psychosocial factors. An improvement in uptake of peak level of oxygen was observed after intervention. There was also an improvement in physical activity in both groups measured by a monitor, although this was significant only in those with intervention. The psychosocial scales measured by the Child Behavior Checklist showed a decrease in internalizing scores for those subjected to intervention. This was decreased due to decreased withdrawal and somatic complaints. In conclusion, we recommend systematic supervised training, including testing of routine follow-ups, in patients with congenital heart disease.

AB Objective: This study examined the differential effects of various forms of abuse, as well as their combined effects. The study also sought to separate the factors uniquely associated with abuse from those associated with the more general problems present in an abusive family environment.
   Methodology: Data were collected from 329 homeless adolescents. Preliminary analyses indicated some degree of matching for family background variables. Any differences in demographic or family characteristics were controlled for statistically.
   Results: Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences across groups For rates of assault, rape, depression/dysthymia, and attempted suicide. Multivariate analyses (MANOVAs) indicated significant differences in severity of internalizing problems and cognitive problems. Without exception, the group with histories of both physical and sexual abuse exhibited the most severe symptomatology and was at greatest risk for revictimization. Multiple regression analyses suggested that abuse histories were predictive of internalizing problems while family characteristics were more predictive of externalizing problems.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that both abuse type and family characteristics contribute to the development of symptomatology, Future prospective and longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the sequelae of abuse, as well as the possible cause and effect relations between abuse, family characteristics, and psychological outcome.

AB Moffitt's theory regarding two types of adolescent antisocial behavior was investigated using a prospective, longitudinal study of normal and abnormal development in a primarily low socioeconomic status, ethnically diverse sample. Results supported the presence of an early-onset/persistent (EOP) group and an adolescence-onset (AO) group. Groups were most reliably and significantly distinguished by indices of socioemotional history within the first 3 years, but no significant differences were found on early measures of temperament or neuropsychological functioning. EOPs scored significantly lower than other groups on measures of neuropsychological functioning only during late childhood and adolescence, suggesting that the declines in verbal Functioning that have been so reliably found in this and other samples of early-starting antisocial adolescents are progressive and consequent to adverse experience. In adolescence, AOs were significantly more likely to report high levels of internalizing symptoms and life stress, suggesting that AO antisocial behavior is not a benign phenomenon. Implications of these findings for etiologic theories of adolescent antisocial behavior are discussed.

AB In the context of a French validation study, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was administered to more than 3000 French speaking mothers of 5-year-old children. Scores were factor-analyzed. Principal components analysis revealed four dimensions: externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, immaturity and somatoform disorders. Another sample of 40 mothers participated in a longitudinal study, filling in the CBCL when their children were 5 years old. These children had been observed previously in the Strange Situation (SSP) at 21 months. Several dichotomous variables derived from the SSP (e.g. secure versus insecure, proximal versus distal interaction with the mother, avoidant behavior) have been used as predictors of the four dimensions extracted from the CBCL. Hierarchical regressions showed that proximal behaviors with the mother, which reflect temperamental characteristics independently of the quality of attachment, predicted internalizing problems, whereas avoidance of the mother, or insecure-avoidant attachment, predicted internalizing as well as externalizing problems at 5 years of age. These results show that attachment and temperament, as assessed by the SSP, may each have specific implications for later behavior problems. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID PRESCHOOL ACTIVITY; BEHAVIOR
AB Very little information has been published about 2- and a-year-old children who have experienced major burns. This study used a standardized instrument to measure the behavioral adjustment of these young burn survivors, and the results were compared with those of a nonclinical normative sample. Thirty-three pediatric burn survivors with 50% +/- 28% total body surface area burns were evaluated 1.2 +/- 0.7 years postburn. Parental observations were assessed with the use of the Child Behavior Checklist for 2- and 3-Year-Olds, a 99-item standardized checklist designed to identify behavior problems. Forty of the questions are specific to 2- and 3-year-olds, and the scores of male and female children are not differentiated. The raw scores of the children with burns were statistically compared with the reported normative sample for this version of the Child Behavior Checklist. Pediatric burn survivors in this sample exhibited significantly more internalizing behaviors than the children in the normative group. Parents reported children who had been burned to be more depressed and to have more somatic complaints and sleep problems. Determining the relationship of behavior problems to posttrauma sequelae and preburn environmental factors would assist with the establishment of appropriate psychosocial interventions.

AB Examined the role of the working alliance in the treatment of delinquent bays in community-based community-based residential programs, clarifying the relation between therapeutic process and behavioral change. Howatlz and Greenberg's (1989) Working Alliance Inventory was used to assess the therapeutic alliance between youth and staff after 3 weeks in treatment and again after 3 months. Achenbach 's (1991) Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Youth Self-Report [YSR] and Teacher Report Form [TRF]) and recidivism scores were used to assess treatment progress and outcome Results indicated that a positive working alliance assessed after 3 months in treatment related to positive psychological changes and predicted lower rates of recidivism, Unexpectedly, a positive working alliance assessed early in treatment was associated with negative outcomes (increased internalizing and externalizing symptoms and higher rates of recidivism). This finding suggests that for some delinquent youth initially optimistic assessments may be prognostic of slow progress or treatment failure.

AB Studied 185 seventh- and eighth-grade inner-city adolescents. Participants were categorized as low and high in exposure to stressors (stressful events or neighborhood disadvantage) and externally exhibited competence (self-, teacher, and school reports). We predicted that resilient (high-stress/high-competence) and stress-affected (high-stress/low-competence) youth would differ across three domains of hypothesized protective resources: infernal resources (i.e., coping skills, perceived competence), familial support, and extrafamilial support. We also predicted that there would be an emotional cost to resilient youth in terms of experiencing internalizing problems (depression, anxiety). There were direct effects for stressor level on several protective resources; however, the hypothesized protective resources did not discriminate resilient from stress-affected youth. Both Resilient and stress-affected youth experienced equivalent levels of internalizing symptoms, and these groups' scores were higher than those of low-stress participants. These results are possibly reflective of the effects of chronic stressors.

AB The Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC) is a relatively new self report measure designed to assess the bread domain of internalizing problems of children and to integrate the two- and three-factor models of affect proposed by Watson, Clark, and colleagues (cf. Watson & Clark, 1992). To date, limited research has been conducted investigating the performance of the negative affect/general dic tress and positive affect dimensions of the ISSC. The present research investigated convergent and discriminant validity coefficients between domain-specific self-report (RCDS, RCMAS, SSRS) and peer-report (PNID) measures with both the ISSC total and subscale scores. Validity coefficients support the continued use of the ISSC total score as a measure of distress that compares favorably with other commonly used measures. Correlations between ISSC subscales and other self-report measures indicate that the relationships between positive affect and negative affect and anxiety and depression proposed in the adult literature may also apply to children. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

Based on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) scores of target child behavior, families were divided into four groups: (a) No LD and no behavior problems (BP), (b) LD only, (c) BP only, and (d) LD and BP. Siblings (n=71) and their parents (n=67) were interviewed in their homes. Regardless of whether the target child was LD or NLD, parent reports of the internalizing and externalizing behavior scores from the CBCL differentially reflected the presence of behavior problems. The results indicated that (a) LD and NLD siblings differed in their perception of the quality of their sibling relationships and self-reports of their own behavior, and (b) the parents of children reported to have a behavior problem with or without LD reported higher levels of perceived burden. A substantial indicator of the impact of a child with LD on siblings and parents was related to whether children with LD also had behavior problems.

The incarcerated participants evidenced higher levels of cognitive distortion (self-serving and self-debasing) and problem behavior (externalizing and internalizing) than did comparison participants. Both self-serving and self-debasing cognitive distortions were associated with unique variance in overall problem behaviors. Most notably, self-serving cognitive distortions specifically related to externalizing behaviors, whereas self-debasing cognitive distortions specifically related to internalizing behaviors. The theoretical and treatment implications of the findings are discussed.

AB The aim of the study was to determine whether IDDM affects the course of psychological adjustment in youths. The study sample included 164 children with IDDM (mean age = 10.2) and their parents compared to 164 healthy controls matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Adjustment was measured with the Child Behavior Checklist, a parental rating scale, validated and adapted for the French population. Two-way ANOVAs on CBCL scale scores showed that scores for both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors and the total CBCL score were significantly raised in diabetic children (p < 0.001). Further comparisons on the 8 narrow-band scale scores of the CBCL indicated increased scores for diabetic children on 6 dimensions. A significant Gender x Status (IDDM versus Controls) interaction was found, supportive of higher rates of aggressive behaviors amongst male diabetic children (p < 0.01). Controlling for age, no correlation was found between CBCL total, internalizing and externalizing scores and duration of IDDM or HbAlc levels within the diabetic group. Psychological adjustment to chronic illness needs to be considered with respect to both normal developmental demands as well as in the context of the specific challenges posed by the disease.

AB The prevalence, structure, stability, and predictors of change in early behavior problems were examined in a population-based sample of Norwegian children at 18 and 30 months of age (N = 750). A clear factor structure involving four dimensions emerged at both assessment times: Two factors were characterized by externalizing behaviors and were labeled Social Adjustment and Overactive-Inattentive; one factor tapped internalizing problems and was labeled Emotional Adjustment; and the fourth, related to general immaturity, was labeled Regulation. Specific patterns of child and family risk factors were associated with stability and change over the two time points for each factor. Children with stable problems had the most problematic characteristics on all significant predictors, followed by children with problems at one, but not both, time points. The data suggest that it is possible to identify risk factors for stable problems at 18 months, allowing some prediction of those children whose problems will persist over early childhood. Since specific risk factors emerged for specific types of behavior problems, the results may provide some much-needed guidance to early intervention efforts.

AB Previous epidemiological studies of correlates of child and adolescent mental disorders in the general population have focused more on child/adolescent and socioeconomic/sociodemographic characteristics than on family characteristics. Moreover, there are no generally accepted methods to analyze and interpret correlates. The purpose of the Quebec Child Mental Health Survey in this regard was twofold: (1) to identify correlates of DSM-III-R internalizing and externalizing disorders according to informant (youth, parent, teacher), for three age groups (6-8, 9-11, and 12-14 years), including relevant family characteristics not considered in previous studies; and (2) to interpret the relative importance of risk indicators by ranking correlates according to strength and consistency of association across age groups. Logistic regression models suggest the inconsistency of correlates across informants. The ranking of correlates reveals that individual and family characteristics make a more important contribution than do socioeconomic characteristics, thereby supporting the relevance of proximal variables in the development of psychopathology.

AB This study examines whether two aspects of mothering-acceptance and consistency of discipline-buffer the effect of divorce stressors on adjustment problems in 678 children, ages 8 to 15, whose families had divorced within the past 2 years. Children reported on divorce stressors; both mothers and children reported on mothering and internalizing and externalizing problems. Multiple regressions indicate that for maternal report of mothering, acceptance interacted with divorce stressors in predicting both dimensions of adjustment problems, with the pattern of findings supporting a stressbuffering effect. For child report of mothering, acceptance, consistency of discipline, and divorce stressors interacted in predicting adjustment problems. The relation between divorce stressors and internalizing and externalizing problems is stronger for children who report low acceptance and low consistency of discipline than for children who report either low acceptance and high consistency of discipline or high acceptance and low consistency of discipline. Children reporting high acceptance and high consistency of discipline have the lowest levels of adjustment problems. Implications of these results for understanding variability in children's postdivorce adjustment and interventions for divorced families are discussed.

AB In a prospective, longitudinal study with community samples of disruptive and nondisruptive children, the predictive relations between peer-assessed dimensions of behavioral reputation in elementary school and teacher-rated behavioral adjustment and lest scores of academic achievement were examined over a 4-year period. The Revised Class Play (RCP), a social role matching instrument completed by students about their classmates, was used to assess behavioral dimensions of children's peer reputation at baseline. Regression analyses showed that the RCP dimensions of aggressive-disruptive, sensitive-isolated, and social etiquette were the best predictors of later teacher-rated externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and subsequent adaptive skills respectively. Only IQ predicted later academic achievement. When IQ and disruptive / nondisruptive group st at us were added to each regression equation they further contributed as significant predictors. When parent and teacher ratings of behavior problems at baseline were entered jointly with RCP dimensions into regression equations, the peer dimensions further explained outcome variance. Additive effects of the RCP dimensions were found only for the externalizing problems outcome. Disruptive children with mild levels of aggressive behavior and high levels of sensitive-isolated behavior had less externalizing problems at outcome. A comparison of the difference between disruptive and nondisruptive groups in the relationship of baseline RCP scores to leacher outcomes showed no difference between groups. suggesting that the groups did not depart appreciably from their initial differences relative to each other over time.

AB This study examined social-emotional functioning in children with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (TS) alone and children with TS and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In addition, the contribution of family functioning to social competence was examined. Children with a clinical diagnosis of TS were recruited from the Yale Child Study Center TS specialty clinic. Unaffected control children were recruited through newspaper advertisements and announcements within the university and at area schools. The final sample consisted of 72 children (45 boys and 27 girls) between the ages of 8 and 14. Sixteen children met DMS-III-R criteria for TS, 33 children met criteria for TS and ADHD, and 23 children had no psychiatric diagnoses. Children with TS and ADHD evidenced more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and poorer social adaptation than children with TS only or unaffected controls. Children with TS only were not significantly different from unaffected controls on most measures of externalizing behaviors and social adaptation but did exhibit more internalizing symptoms. Tic symptom severity was not associated with social, behavioral, or emotional functioning among children with TS, even after stratifying by medication status. However, ADHD diagnosis, obsessional symptom severity, and family functioning were significantly associated with social and emotional adjustment among TS children. Moreover, family functioning was associated with social and emotional adjustment even after controlling for TS and ADHD diagnostic status. These findings demonstrate that much of the social and behavioral dysfunction in children with TS is ADHD-specific and children with TS alone have a very different social-emotional profile than do those with TS plus ADHD. Finally, social-emotional adjustment in children with TS is best understood within the family context.

AB Children exposed to interparental violence have been characterized by an array of psychological problems, but findings regarding the precise nature of these problems have been inconsistent. This study used cluster analysis to determine whether distinct patterns of adjustment could be identified in 228 8-to 14-year-old children residing in battered women's shelters. Five such patterns emerged: multiproblem-externalizing, multiproblem-internalizing, externalizing, mild distress, and no problems reported. This solution was cross-validated in independent halves of the sample and was similar for buys and girls. Differences among the clusters on relevant family and demographic variables were examined, and it was found that the clusters could be distinguished on the basis of the frequency of children's exposure to interparental violence, parent-child aggression, and children's appraisals of interparental conflict.

The YSR internal consistency was higher for the Internalizing and Externalizing groupings than for the narrow-band syndromes. The concurrent validity analysis showed relations between the Internalizing YSR grouping and several depression and the Psychological inadequacy CAQ scales. On the contrary, the Externalizing grouping did not show a consistent relational pattern to CAQ scales. It can be added, that for boys and girls the explanation of Internalizing problems was linked to different psychological contents.

Analysis showed that, with the exception of the Social Phobia and the Specific Phobia subscales, Screen total and subscale scores were significantly related to Internalizing problems (rs between .40 and .77). Thus, the more frequently children reported Anxiety Disorder symptoms, the more often they reported emotional problems. Furthermore, in particular, anxious-depressed problems as measured by the Youth Self-report were significantly associated with scores on Screen scales. These results further support the concurrent validity of the Screen.

AB Background: A positive family history of alcoholism is one of the most consistent and powerful predictors of a person's risk for developing this disorder. This finding has stimulated much research on etiological vulnerability factors and mechanisms by which children of alcoholic parents are at high risk for developing alcohol-related problems. In primarily Euro-American samples, parental alcoholism has been associated with a variety of negative outcomes for children and adolescents, including problematic behavior. Native-American Indians, in addition to high rates of alcoholism and alcohol-related mortality, have the highest prevalence of a positive family history far alcoholism of all ethnic groups in the United States.
   Methods: This study used the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to evaluate behavioral problems in 96 Mission Indian children and adolescents based on the presence or absence of parental alcohol dependence and sex of the offspring.
   Results: Consistent with previous research, results indicated a high prevalence of a positive family history of alcoholism in these Native-American youths. Seventy-four percent of the offspring had either one or both parents with alcohol dependence (children of alcoholics). Only 7% had no first- or second-degree alcoholic relatives. Results indicated that sons of alcoholics scored significantly higher on the Total Behavior Problem scale, as well as the Internalizing and Externalizing scales, of the CBCL than sons of nonalcoholics, whereas there were no significant differences in CBCL scores between daughters of alcoholics and daughters of nonalcoholics. It is noteworthy that scores on the CBCL for Mission Indian children of alcoholics were comparable to scores in the published literature of children of alcoholics of other ethnicities. In addition, a relatively low percentage of youths were identified with significant levels of behavioral problems.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that sons of alcoholics of Mission Indian heritage experience more problems than sons of nonalcoholics, but also suggest that Mission Indian children of alcoholics are not more vulnerable to behavioral problems than children of alcoholic parents of other ethnic backgrounds.

AB This review examines theoretical and empirical literature on children's reactions to three types of violence-child maltreatment, community violence, and interparental violence. In addition to describing internalizing and externalizing problems associated with exposure to violence, this review identifies ways that violence can disrupt typical developmental trajectories through psychobiological effects, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cognitive consequences, and peer problems. Methodological challenges in this literature include high rates of co-occurrence among types of violence exposure, co-occurrence of violence with other serious life adversities, heterogeneity in the frequency, severity, age of onset, and chronicity of exposure, and difficulties in making causal inferences. A developmental psychopathology perspective focuses attention on how violence may have different effects at different ages and may compromise children's abilities to face normal developmental challenges. Emphasis is placed on the variability of children's reactions to violence, on outcomes that go beyond diagnosable disorders, and on variables that mediate and moderate children's reactions to violence.

AB We review cultural psychopathology research since Kleinman's (1988) important review with the goals of updating past reviews, evaluating current conceptualizations and methods, and identifying emerging substantive trends. Conceptual advances are noted, particularly developments in the definition of culture and the examination of both culture-specific and cultural-general processes. The contributions of the Culture and Diagnosis Task Force for DSM-IV and the World Mental Health Report are reviewed and contrasted. Selected research on anxiety, schizophrenia, and childhood disorders is examined, with particular attention given to the study of ataque de nervios, social factors affecting the course of schizophrenia, and cross-national differences in internalizing and externalizing problems in children. Within the last ten years, cultural psychopathology research has become a significant force. Its focus on the social world holds promise to make significant inroads in reducing suffering and improving people's everyday lives.

AB Background: We examine the relationship between neurologic soft signs and cognitive deficits, learning disorders, and psychiatric problems in low birthweight (LBW) and normal birthweight (NBW) children,
   Methods: Representative samples of LEW and NEW children were selected from the 1983-1985 newborn discharges of two major hospitals in Michigan, Eight hundred-twenty three children (75% of the target sample) were evaluated at ages 6 and 11. A standardized neurologic evaluation was used by neurologists to measure neurologic soft signs at age 6 (children with frank neurologic impairment were excluded), Ie was measured by WISC-R and behavior problem lists were rated by mothers and teachers, Standard tests of academic achievement were used to identify learning disorders, All assessments were blind to LEW status, Using multiple regression analysis, applying generalized estimating equations (GEE), we estimated the effects of soft signs on 3 behavioral domains, based on information from multiple informants and times of assessment.
   Results: LEW was associated with a two-fold increased risk for soft signs, Soft signs increased the risk for subnormal le and for learning disorders in children with normal IQ Soft signs were associated with excess internalizing problems in LEW and NEW children, and with attention and externalizing problems in LEW children; the excess in externalizing problems in LEW children was observed only at age 6.
   Conclusions: Soft signs are a marker of high risk for cognitive and psychiatric problems, Of particular concern is their presence in LEW children, in whom they are associated with more severe cognitive deficits and more pervasive psychiatric problems.

AB This study examined the relation between parenting similarity and comorbid internalizing and disruptive behavior problems among 70 children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). General child rearing similarity and discipline similarity were found td be associated with fewer disruptive behavior problems but not related to internalizing problems. Parenting similarity was also found to be associated with greater marital adjustment and less marital conflict among parents of ADHD children. In contrast to previous studies in non-clinical populations, controlling for parental effectiveness these relations are significant. Parenting similarity, related to fathers' reports of parenting alliance and discipline similarity, is also found to be associated with lower parenting stress for mothers. Implications for parent training for ADHD children are discussed.

AB This manuscript reviews information on past use of the CBCL to describe the clinical status of children in state custody and the results of a recent study of a representative statewide sample. The sample included a random sample of children in state custody, including those in foster care, kinship care, group residential facilities, and state institutions. One third (34%) of the children in state custody were reported as having significant behavior problems. The narrow band scales reflecting greatest difficulties included Aggressive, Delinquent, and Withdrawn behavior. The youngest teenage group was significantly more likely to have Internalizing problems in the clinical level, and those living in family homes were more likely to have scores in the non-clinical range than those in foster homes or group placements. There were no effects of gender, race, adjudication status, or length of time in custody. Implications for policy makers, caseworkers, and researchers are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorder's (SCARED) divergent and convergent validity and its ability to identify anxious children. The SCARED, the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC) were administered to children, adolescents (n = 29), and their parents attending an outpatient noon and anxiety disorders clinic. DSM-IIIR/IV diagnoses were made using a semistructured interview (n = 130) or a symptom checklist (n = 165). The Multi-Trait Multi-Method Matrix was used to assess construct validity, and Receiver Operating Curve analysis was used to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the SCARED, CBCL, and STAIC, The SCARED correlated significantly better with the CBCL's internalizing factors than with the externalizing factors. In addition, parent and child forms of the SCARED correlated significantly with the trait and state subscales of the STAIC, Children with ala anxiety disorder scored significantly higher on the SCARED than children with depression only or disruptive disorders only (P < 0.05), thus demonstrating the discriminant validity of the SCARED. The SCARED is a reliable and valid screening tool for clinically referred children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Developmental pathways relating to internalizing disorders among girls and externalizing disorders among boys were applied to the study of school adjustment within a transactional systems framework. Reports of hassle frequency, hassle severity, and uplift frequency were obtained from 701 third- through fifth-grade children across parent, peer, academic, and family domains. Frequency of peer hassles and uplifts and perceptions of hassle severity were examined in relation to girls' school adjustment. Parental and school-related hassles and uplifts were examined in relation to boys' adjustment. Gender differences and patterns of relationships among predictor variables and adjustment status generally supported the application of developmental transactional systems to understanding school adjustment. implications of these data for school-based prevention efforts are discussed.

AB Objective: Examine behavioral adjustment and emotion regulation among 6-year-old children with asthma and a group of healthy controls.
   Method: Subjects were 81 children with asthma and 22 healthy controls. Asthma and allergy statuses were confirmed by objective measures. Emotional and behavioral functioning were assessed through parent report, child interview, and child participation in an emotional regulation paradigm.
   Results: Maternal report revealed more internalizing and total behavior problems for children with asthma compared to controls. Child interview and behavioral observations of emotion regulation yielded no differences between groups. Severity of asthma was related to increased emotional difficulties by clinician interview and observation but not by maternal report.
   Conclusions: Two groups of children with asthma who have psychological difficulties include those with increased anxiety and those with poor emotion regulation and more asthma symptoms. Different measures of child adjustment yield a complex picture of the behavioral difficulties associated with pediatric asthma.

AB Female adolescent drug use has increased dramatically in the last 30 years, and there is a growing consensus that the syndrome of female adolescent substance abuse is different from the well-recognized male pattern. Gender differences in patterns of comorbidity and family functioning were investigated in a sample of 95 youths (42 girls and 53 boys) referred for substance abuse treatment. The findings indicate that male and female adolescent substance users differ in several clinically meaningful ways. The results from a discriminant function analysis indicate that substance-using adolescents referred to treatment are distinguished especially by the greater degree to which girls have internalizing symptoms and family dysfunction. The clinical implications of these gender differences are articulated.

AB Shedler and Block offered the provocative proposal that individuals who experiment with drugs are psychologically healthier than either those who abstain completely or those who are frequent users. Not all studies have come to such conclusions, however In an effort to specify under what conditions Shedler and Block's conclusions might hold the present study examined three groups of drug users (abstainers, experimenters, frequent users) classified according to three different criteria: (a) marijuana rise at age 20; (b) alcohol use during 10th grade; and (c) alcohol use at age 20. The three groups were compared at age 20 in terms of personality, deviant behavior and psychopathology. The results revealed that abstainers were never more psychologically impaired, and were occasionally healthier than experimenters. Fuequent users of marijuana were consistently more impaired than both the abstainers and experimenters, in terms of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Classification according to marijuana use appeared to be more related to psychopathology than did classification according to alcohol use.

AB Objective: This research uses children's story-stem play narratives to examine whether certain specified internal representations of self and experiences will predict later childhood anxiety Method: Thirty-five nonclinical children were studied from 5 to 5 years of age Narratives of the 5-year-old children were coded for negative expectations of self, others, and experiences. Parents and teachers completed the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher's Report Form when the children were 5 and 6 years of age. Mothers completed the anxiety section of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children when the children were 6 years of age. Parental anxiety and child temperament were also measured. Results: Five-year-old child negative expectations significantly predicted mother/father/teacher reports of internalizing and anxiety symptoms and mother reports of separation anxiety overanxious, and social phobia/avoidant: disorder symptoms in the children at 6 years of age, even when anxiety and internalizing symptoms at 5 years of age were entered first in the regression equations. Child negative expectations predicted later anxiety in these analyses better than parental anxiety and child temperament. Conclusions: Child negative expectations may be a risk factor or a mechanism for the development of later anxiety. Children's narratives may be useful for examining such representations and identifying children at risk.

AB The present contribution answers the question to what extent physical complaints in adolescence represent an indicator of mental disorders. For that purpose we examined 352 adolescents aged 12 to 16 by using questionnaires to measure these two characteristics. Among other things the results gave evidence that physical complaints particularly covariegate with internalizing syndromes, whereat the correlation is higher for boys than for girls. The results Lire discussed with regard to possible causes as well as consequences for the intercourse with adolescents.

AB Background: Only few prospective longitudinal studies have described the course of psychological disorders from childhood to adulthood. The investigations carried out the date almost without exception show numerous methodological weaknesses. Objective: The course of psychological disorders in 8-year-old children till adulthood. Methods: The ACCA-study followed 321 8-year-old children till the age of 25 years. Highly structured interviews were used for case definition. Diagnoses were based on ICD-9 for the first two waves (8 and 13 Fears) and on ICD-IO for the last two waves (18 and 25 years). Results: The overall stability of psychological disorders was 50% between consecutive waves. The stability of antisocial externalizing disorders was higher than that of emotional/internalizing disorders. 2%-10% of the children and adolescents showed chronic psychological disorders. Conclusions: A significant expansion of therapeutical institutions is required.

AB Background: In taxonomic systems of child psychopathology, externalizing and internalizing disorders are differentiated. Objective: The question of whether a specific pathogenesis and etiology becomes discernible for these diagnostic categories was addressed. Method: In a prospective longidudinal study of 362 children born with different organic and psychosocial risks, emotional and behavioral problems from infancy to school age were assessed using a standardized clinical interview. At the age of 3 months infants were observed interacting with their mothers. Results: Externalizing disorders manifested themselves earlier, were more frequent at every age, and showed a greater stability than internalizing disorders. Early indicators of later disorder; became apparent in toddlerhood. In particular, externalizing disorders were associated with early psychosocial risks. Dysfunctional patterns of mother-child interaction in early infancy emerged as precursors of later disorders in school age. Conclusions: The results support the notion of distinct categories of developmental psychopathology.

AB Background: Previous studies have demonstrated the short-term efficacy of pharmacotherapy and behavior therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but no longer-term tie, >4 months) investigations have compared these 2 treatments or their combination.
   Methods: A group of 579 children with ADHD Combined Type, aged 7 to 9.9 years, were assigned to 13 months of medication management (titration followed by monthly visits); intensive behavioral treatment (parent, school, and child components, with therapist involvement gradually reduced over time); the two combined; or standard community care (treatments by community providers). Outcomes were assessed in multiple domains before and during treatment and at treatment end point (with the combined treatment and medication management groups continuing medication at all assessment points). Data were analyzed through intent to-treat random-effects regression procedures.
   Results: All 4 groups showed sizable reductions in symptoms over time, with significant differences among them in degrees of change. For most ADHD symptoms, children in the combined treatment and medication management groups showed significantly greater improvement than those given intensive behavioral treatment and community care. Combined and medication management treatments did not differ significantly on any direct comparisons, but in several instances (oppositional/aggressive symptoms, internalizing symptoms, teacher-rated social skills, parent-child relations, and reading achievement) combined treatment proved superior to intensive behavioral treatment and/or community care while medication management did not. Study medication strategies were superior to community care treatments, despite the fact that two thirds of community-treated subjects received medication during the study period.
   Conclusions: For ADHD symptoms, our carefully crafted medication management was superior to behavioral treatment and to routine community care that included medication. Our combined treatment did not yield significantly greater benefits than medication management for core ADHD symptoms, but may have provided modest advantages for non-ADHD symptom and positive functioning outcomes.

AB Background: Intent-to-treat analyses of the study revealed that medication management, alone or combined with intensive behavioral treatment, was superior to behavioral treatment and community care in reducing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms; but only combined treatment showed consistently greater benefit than community care across other outcome domains (disruptive and internalizing symptoms, achievement, parent-child relations and social skills). We examine response patterns in subgroups defined by baseline variables (moderators) or variables related to treatment implementation (mediators).
   Methods: We reconducted random-effects regression (RR) analyses, adding factors defined by moderators (ses, prior medication use, comorbid disruptive or anxiety disorder, and public assistance) and a mediator (treatment acceptance/attendance).
   Results: Study outcomes (N = 579) were upheld in most moderator subgroups (boys and girls, children with and without prior medication, children with and without co-morbid disruptive disorders). Comorbid anxiety disorder did moderate outcome. in participants without anxiety, results paralleled intent-to-treat findings. For those with anxiety disorders, however, behavioral treatment yielded significantly better outcomes than community care (and was no longer statistically different from medication management and combined treatment) regarding ADHD-related and internalizing symptoms. In families receiving public assistance, medication management yielded decreased closeness in parent-child interactions, and combined treatment yielded relatively greater benefits for teacher-reported social skills. In families with high treatment acceptance/attendance, intent-to-treat results were upheld. Acceptance/attendance was particularly important for medication treatments. Finally, two thirds of children given community care received stimulants. Behavioral treatment did not significantly differ from, but medication management was superior to, this subgroup.
   Conclusions: Exploratory analyses revealed that our study (the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [MTA]) re suits were confirmed across most baseline variables and treatment acceptance/attendance. Tn children with ADHD plus anxiety, behavioral treatment surpassed community. care and approached medication-based treatments regarding parent-reported ADHD symptoms.

ID STRUCTURED INTERVIEW; RELIABILITY; SCHEDULE; PARENT; SCALE
AB The management of school refusal behavior in children and adolescents has long been a nettlesome process for clinicians. However, a functional analytic model of school refusal behavior has been proposed to assist clinicians in organizing, assessing, and treating this heterogeneous population. The present study examined, on a preliminary controlled basis, the treatment utility of this functional model and the School Refusal Assessment Scale (SRAS). Specifically, participants with acute school refusal behavior were initially assigned prescriptive (n = 4) or nonprescriptive (n = 4) treatment from child and parent SRAS ratings. Those receiving nonprescriptive treatment did so in a lagged design prior to prescriptive treatment. Results indicated that nonprescriptive treatment led to worsened percentage of time out of school and daily ratings of anxiety and depression. However, prescriptive treatment substantially ameliorated these problems. In addition, improvements were seen across child self-report measures and parent and/or teacher ratings of internalizing and externalizing behavior. Using a functional model, treatment may thus be assigned efficiently and effectively for this population.

AB Research has linked language delays in young children to behavior problems and risk far psychopathology. We hypothesized that low language skill would affect normal socialization of emotion regulation, which in turn would affect the development of behavior problems. Seventy-eight mother/preschool-age child pairs participated in two mildly frustrating situations. Parents of children with low verbal comprehension used more unexplained compliance demands than other parents. Further, children whose parents used more unexplained compliance demands used fewer cognitive and distraction strategies, and more instrumental strategies. Children's use of physical self-comforting was positively related to overall, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems. Findings supported the original hypothesis.

AB In a cross-sectional study of 83 unmedicated boys, 6 to 16 years of age (M = 10.6, SD = 2.1), attending public (N = 48) and therapeutic schools for behaviorally disturbed children (N = 35), we examined relations of externalizing psychopathology to age-dependent change in performance on cognitive and motivational dimensions of impulse control assessed by laboratory tasks. When we controlled for internalizing symptoms and IQ or school achievement, all children showed improving competence with increasing age on both dimensions over the age range of the sample. Children with externalizing problems performed more poorly on both dimensions at all ages than children without such problems. Comparing age-dependent competence for the two groups, a model of convergent maturation in cognitive aspects of impulse control, and a model depicting a stable deficit in motivational aspects of impulse control in those children with externalizing behavior problems, relative to those without such problems, emerged. Studies of individual growth in impulse control, together with correlates of growth, are needed to validate these observations.

AB This study examined whether particular forms of parental psychopathology are related to similar forms of comorbid psychopathology in offspring with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parental disorders were assessed using maternal interviews, and child disorders were assessed using multiple-informant interviews for 111 clinic-referred boys (aged 7-12) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) ADHD. Associations between parental and child internalizing disorders and between parental and child externalizing disorders were found, but associations across categories of disorder (i.e., internalizing and externalizing) were not. Similar relationships were observed in 66 clinic-referred boys without ADHD. These findings support specific modes of familial transmission, in contrast to theories that comorbidity simply reflects more severe psychopathology in children with ADHD.

AB Two-year outcomes are reported for a school-based early intervention program for 82 children identified as at risk for emotional disturbance (ED) by their kindergarten teachers. Matched pairs of children were randomly assigned to Parent-Teacher Action Research (PTAR) teams or to a control group for their first- and second-grade years. Teachers also provided social skills instruction to all participants, along with their classmates. At the end of the 2-year period, the PTAR group showed significantly greater reductions than the control group in teacher-reported internalizing problems and delinquent behavior; parent-reported total problems, externalizing. and delinquent behavior; and observed internalizing problems in the classroom. PTAR group parents also reported significantly greater increases in their children's cooperation, self-control, and total competence, as well as in their own feelings of empowerment in obtaining school-based services for their children. The findings demonstrate long-term incremental benefits of PTAR teams combined with whole-class social skills instruction for children at risk for ED.

AB Characteristics prevalent in known child abusers and in child victims of abuse (i.e., internalizing, externalizing sociopathy, delinquency, and nonrational conflict-solving tactics) were examined as predictors of abuse potential in adolescents. The Child Abuse Potential (CAP) Inventory (Milner, 1986) was administered to male (n = 71) and female (n = 63) teenagers attending alternative educational sites due to behavioral problems or pregnancy. Regression analyses found unique variance in abuse potential contributed by youth (16%) and teacher (6%) reports of internalizing behavior, and youth reports of sociopathy (4%) and delinquency (4%) for a total of 33% of the variance (p < .0001, n = 91) after controlling for age, sex, and pregnancy status. Number of elevated predictors in each student was also related to increased abuse potential (r = .39, p < .001). Pregnancy status and SES were not independently associated with abuse potential. Conduct disorder as a probable precursor to future abusive behavior is suggested, and the use of the CAP with adolescents is discussed.

AB Objective: To determine whether preterm children born at less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation who did not cooperate for developmental testing at 31/2 to 41/2 years old were more likely to have school problems at 7 to 10 years old than preterm children who completed developmental testing.
   Study design: The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities were administered to a cohort of 118 preterm children at 31/2 to 41/2 years old when they were seen in the neonatal follow-up clinic. When these children were 7 to 10 years old, their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist, and the child's teacher completed the Teacher's Report Form.
   Results: Parents returned questionnaires on 105 (89%) children. On the Teacher's Report Form, children who were untestable had more somatic complications and more attention problems and scored higher on the Total Problems Scale and the Internalizing Scale than children who had completed testing. Children who were untestable were twice as likely to receive help in school than were children who completed developmental testing.
   Conclusions: Preterm children born at less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation who do not cooperate for developmental testing at 31/2 to 41/2 years old should be examined at school age for evidence of school and behavior problems.

AB Assessment of psychopathology in adolescents can be complicated due to uncertainties about who should be considered the primary informant. While a multimethod, multiinformant approach to assessment allows for a thorough assessment, it can also result in contradictory findings. The purpose of this study was to use a sample of 121 adolescents to investigate issues of parent-adolescent agreement on behavior rating scales and a structured diagnostic interview. Additionally, this study evaluated whether adolescent report offers unique information to the assessment beyond the parent's report. The sample included both normal controls and adolescents who met criteria for diagnosis of an Internalizing or Externalizing disorder based on the DSM-IV criteria. Agreement between parents and adolescents on the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (DICA-R) was low for ADHD (39.4%) and Externalizing Disorders (41.1%) and moderate for Internalizing Disorders (56.6%). A significant difference was found between the number of ADHD symptoms reported, with parents reporting more symptoms (M = 9.42) than adolescents (M = 8.34). Regression analysis indicated that the adolescent completed Youth Self-report (YSR) contributed unique information beyond the parent completed measures in predicting both the adolescent and the parent interviews for Internalizing Disorders. This finding emphasizes the need to continue to collect self-report information, especially when assessing Internalizing disorders, which inherently contain symptoms indicating high-risk behaviors such as suicide ideation.

AB Objective: To investigate the stability and predictive strength of behavioral and emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. Method: A referred sample (N = 1,652), aged 4 to 18 years at initial assessment, was followed up after a mean interval of 6.2 years. Problem scores derived from Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report, and Teacher's Report Form at initial assessment (T-1) were related to scores on the same instruments at follow-up (T-2). Results: Correlations between T-1 and corresponding T-2 problem scores averaged 0.41 intrainformant (range 0.22-0.61) and 0.22 interinformant (range -0.09-0.57). Stabilities were similar across gender, and larger for Externalizing versus Internalizing scores, except on youths' self-reports. Psychopathology scores at follow-up were predicted by corresponding T-1 scores. Girls were predicted to have higher T-2 Somatic Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, and Internalizing scores than boys. Children younger at intake were predicted to have higher scores than older children on T-2 Social and Attention Problems. Conclusions: Findings indicate continuity of specific behavioral and emotional problems in clinically referred children and adolescents.

AB Based on the results of previous research, multiple factors in several domains (individual attributes of the adolescent, family attributes, and extrafamilial factors) were identified as possible risk and protective factors for development of problem behavior during adolescence. The first aim of this study was to examine the relative importance of these factors for the development of externalizing and internalizing problems. In addition to examining the role of particular risk and protective factors, we also tested the hypothesis that risk and protection have a cumulative effect. The results show that the individual attributes of the adolescent play an important role, both as a risk and as a protection, for the development of internalizing problems, but they appear to be of less importance for the development of externalizing problems. The family attributes (support, monitoring, and attachment) seem to be important for both types of problem behavior Finally, the relationship with peers (especially the association with deviant peers) has both a risk and a protective effect for the development of problem behavior: When index of the number of risk and protective factor is used, it appears that the amount of risk has a stronger relation to variation in problem behavior than protection. Finally, in this sample, no evidence was found for the moderating effect of the protective factors.

AB The techniques used in studies of self-monitoring for children's problems were examined, with an emphasis on methodology. As originally conceptualized, self-monitoring was viewed as both an assessment tool and an intervention technique. Although self-monitoring as an assessment tool is conceptually sensible, the use of self-monitoring solely for purposes of assessment with children introduces significant problems. As a result, the self-monitoring literature oh children has focused not on its use as an assessment tool but primarily on its use as an intervention technique, with the exception of the assessment of internalizing disorders. The methodology of self-monitoring as it is used with children was examined in targeting internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression, specific academic skills, broader processes of self-regulation, on-task behavior, and disruptive behavior problems of children. Conclusions and recommendations are provided for research and practice in the use of self-monitoring for children's problems.

Results: Adolescents reported significantly more problem behaviors than their parents, Adolescent girls reported a significantly higher level of distress than boys in most symptom domains. The discrepancies between parent reports and youth self-reports were greater, especially for internalizing symptoms, for girls than for boys. Conclusions: Many adolescents in need of psychiatric assessment do not receive appropriate help because their problems remain unnoticed by adults. Internalizing problems among girls seem especially likely to remain unrecognized by adults.

AB Aims. (i) To describe illegal drug use patterns in an adolescent normal population sample with special emphasis on MDMA, ecstasy; (ii) to investigate where ecstasy is introduced in a hypothesized drug use sequence, and (iii) to contrast the predictors of ecstasy use with those of other illegal substances. Special attention was given to the relationship to subcultural music preferences and house-party-going. Design. A school-based survey of the total cohort of adolescents enrolled in the school system in a city. Participants. 10 812 adolescents, age 14-17 years, response rate 94.3%. Setting. Oslo, the capital and only metropolitan town in Norway. Measurements. Social class was measured by the occupation standard ISCO 88, questions were posed as regards frequency of alcohol use and alcohol intoxication, cigarette smoking and use of cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy and heroin. Alcohol problems were measured by a shortened version of Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI), conduct problems were measured according to the four categories of acts forming the basis of the diagnosis conduct disorder in DSM-IV, internalizing mental health problems were measured using items fr om Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HCL). A number of questions were asked as regards subcultural music preferences and house-party-going. Statistical models. A hypothesized cumulative sequence in drug use was investigated by means of latent class analysis, and she predictors of the various patterns of drug use were estimated and compared by means a multinominal logistic regression analysis. Findings. The use of ecstasy was often intermingled with the use of cannabis, amphetamines and heroin, in a pattern of polydrug use, The latent class analysis revealed the following drug use sequence: (1) alcohol, (2) cigarettes, (3) cannabis, (4) amphetamines, (5) ecstasy and (6) heroin. There was no significant association between ecstasy use and parental social class or residential area of the town. All patterns of illegal drug use were highly associated with cigarette smoking, alcohol use, alcohol problems and conduct problems, whereas the associations with internalizing mental health problems were of less magnitude. Multinominal logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of ecstasy (E) was significantly more weakly associated with cigarette smoking than were the use of cannabis only (C), amphetamines (A) and the combination of ecstasy and amphetamines (A + E). The association between E and conduct problems (CP) was weaker than the association between CP and A and A + E. Finally, there were associations between E and A + E and House/Techno preferences and house-party-going, which were not found for C and A. Conclusions. Ecstasy is used by adolescents who use other legal and illegal substances in a polydrug-use pattern. The substance is introduced late ill a hypothesized drug use sequence. Even so, ecstasy use seems to differ from the use of, e.g. amphetamines, in that the association with smoking and conduct problems is weaker and that the associations with subcultural music preferences and house-party-going are much stronger.

AB The study objective was to examine correlates of suicide risk in psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents with a reported history of childhood abuse. Predictors of suicide risk were examined in 74 subjects who reported a history of childhood abuse and 53 depressed subjects who did not report a history of childhood abuse. Subjects completed a battery of psychometrically well-established self-report instruments to assess childhood abuse, suicide risk, and internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Correlational analyses showed that higher levels of depression, self-criticism, and hopelessness were significantly associated with suicide risk in both study groups and violence was significantly associated with suicide risk in the childhood abuse group. For the childhood abuse group, multiple regression analyses with seven predictor variables accounted for 54% of the variance in suicide risk: depression and alcohol problems made significant independent contributions, while violence and self-criticism were independent predictors at the trend level. For the depressed/nonabused group, multiple regression analyses with the seven predictor variables accounted for 60% of the variance in suicide risk; depression, hopelessness, and self-criticism were independent predictors. Our findings suggest that both internalizing (i.e., depression or self-criticism) and externalizing (i.e., violence or alcohol) factors predict suicide risk in adolescent inpatients who report childhood abuse, This profile appears different from the more internalizing pattern (i.e., depression, self-criticism, and hopelessness) observed for the depressed adolescent inpatients who reported no history of childhood abuse.

AB Neuropsychological and behavioral status were examined in 57 children aged 7 to 16 years with complex partial seizures (CPS) and compared with 27 sibling control children of the same age. Epilepsy had a significant effect on both cognitive and behavioral adjustment measures. Children with CPS had significant impairment across all seven cognitive domains assessed, reflective of a profile of relatively diffuse and generalized cognitive dysfunction. Age at onset of recurrent seizures was the strongest and most consistent predictor of adequacy of cognitive functioning; earlier age at onset was associated with poorer cognitive status. Children with GPS also had more problems compared with sibling control children on measures of social and school competence and internalizing behavior problems, but not externalizing behaviors. Further, frequency of seizure activity in the past year, rather than age at seizure onset, emerged as the strongest predictor of these behavioral difficulties. These findings are discussed in the context of understanding the impact of GPS on cognition and behavioral adjustment, and identifying the contribution of various aspects of the neurodevelopmental course of CPS to these issues.

AB Noon and evening salivary cortisol levels were examined in 70 elementary school children during the Ist week of a new school year Samples were obtained on the Ist and 5th days of school and on weekend days. Delta cortisol scores were created to measure the change in children's levels on initial school days relative to weekend days. Temperament was assessed using Rothbart's Child Behavior Questionnaire, a parent report instrument. The three dimensions of surgency or extroversion, negative affectivity and effortful control were examined. Positive correlations were obtained with Day 1 delta cortisol for negative affectivity and Day 5 delta cortisol for surgency. Contrary to the expectation that internalizing aspects of temperament (shyness, fearfulness) would be associated with larger increases in cortisol to the novelty and challenge of a new school year these data indicate that larger increases in cortisol were observed in more extroverted children.

ID AMERICAN-CHILDREN; UNITED-STATES; RATINGS; THAI
AB The study compared general population samples of Jamaican children ages 6-18 years, via Jamaican versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) parent-, teacher-, and self-report forms. Repeated measures ANOVAs with informant as a repeated measures factor, assessed base-rate problem score differences according to children's area of residence (i.e., urban vs rural), gender, and age. No between subjects residence effects emerged for total problem score. However, adolescents self-reported higher total problem scores compared to the ratings they received from their parents and teachers. No gender total problem score effects emerged for any of the three informants, but girls received higher internalizing, and Somatic Complaints scores. Similar total problem scores across genders, and the high ratio of boys to girls in clinic samples suggest that Jamaican girls may not be receiving adequate services. Age X within subjects interactions revealed higher teacher reported problem scores for adolescents, reflecting possible developmental changes within the classroom context and teachers' low thresholds toward these problems. The d statistic revealed base rate syndrome, internalizing, externalizing, and total problem score differences in most Jamaican vs US sub-samples. In addition to the non-CBCL problems observed in earlier studies, these findings clearly indicate a need to ascertain syndrome structure and other psychometric properties of the Jamaican instruments.

AB The purpose of this article is to examine the purported attenuating effects of comorbid anxiety on conduct disturbance in a sample of youths exhibiting severe Conduct Disorder (CD). Further, we examined the differential expression of CD and comorbid anxiety in male and female youths. Seventy-nine incarcerated youths between the ages of 12 and 19 were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. Youths were identified who exhibited CD and CD plus an anxiety disorder. In contrast to previous findings with younger, less seriously disturbed male subjects, no overall differences were found between CD anxious and CD nonanxious youths in terms of age of first offense and overall number and severity of delinquent acts. Moreover, no differences were found between males and females, and gender did not moderate the effects of comorbidity anxiety on outcome measures. Findings suggest purported mitigating effects of anxiety on conduct disturbance may be attenuated in severe forms of CD and support the notion that comorbidity across internalizing End externalizing domains of child and adolescent psychopathology may differentially impact clinical presentation of disordered behavior depending on the severity of externalizing behavioral disturbance.

ID MARITAL DISRUPTION; SUPPORT; DEPRESSION; CONFLICT; MOTHERS; IMPACT;

AB We examined the extent to which differences in adolescent adjustment problems between divorced and intact families can be explained by loss of family income, parental conflict, the psychological adjustment and parenting practices of the custodial parent, and level of involvement of the noncustodial parent. The importance of these factors was assessed by hierarchial regression with a sample of 328 intact and 206 divorced families. The results indicated that quality of mother's parenting and of father's involvement in parenting explains the association between divorce and boys' externalizing problems, whereas quality of mother's parenting and postdivorce conflict explain the relationship between divorce and girls' externalizing problems. Divorce elevates a girl's risk for depression because it increases the chances that her mother will become depressed, which in turn reduces the quality of her parenting. Including the various explanatory variables did not reduce the association between divorce and boys' internalizing problems. Boys with divorced parents tended to be more depressed than those from two-parent families regardless of the psychological adjustment, level of conflict, or quality of parenting manifested by their parents.

AB Researchers have begun to develop models that explain the processes by which interparental conflict impacts children's adjustment. The present study tested a model based on emotional security theory. The longitudinal relations among interparental conflict, boys' reactions to conflict, and internalizing and externalizing problems were examined in a sample of 129 mother-son dyads from low-income, 2-parent families from the time sons were age 2 to 5. Results indicated that children exposed to interparental conflict were more likely to have concurrent and later behavior problems and that patterns of interparental conflict across time made unique contributions in predicting later problems. Children's emotional reactivity in response to conflict had no direct relation to interparental conflict and only modest relations to behavior problems. However, interparental conflict and reactivity factors interacted to predict behavior problems at ages 3 1/2 and 5. Thus, some support was demonstrated for emotional reactivity as a moderator in the development of young children's behavior problems.

AB The authors examined siblings' reports of children's depression, anxiety, and aggression, and their reports of the sibling relationship, and compared them with children's self-reports. In two samples, including 169 sibling pairs (age M = 9.98 years, SD = 1.51), no significant differences emerged in the levels of depression and anxiety found in siblings' reports of children's behavior and children's self-reports, although siblings reported children to have significantly higher levels of aggression than the children self-reported. Age, the difference in ages between siblings, sex, and sibling sex were not related to siblings' reports of children's behavior. The relations between children's and siblings' reports of children's behavior were significant, yet moderate (average r = .22). Both siblings' self-reports of internalizing behavior and their perceptions of aspects of the sibling relationship (affection, rivalry, hostility, and satisfaction with the sibling relationship) explained significant, and unique, variance in siblings' reports of children's internalizing behavior. The findings for aggressive behavior were similar, although siblings' perceptions of affection in the sibling relationship were not significantly related to their reports of children's aggression. The potential uses and benefits of sibling reports of children's behavior, and sibling and family relationships, are discussed.

AB The construct representation of the cross-informant model of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Samples were collected in seven different countries. The results are based on 13,226 parent ratings and 8893 teacher ratings. The adequacy of fit for the cross-informant model was established on the basis of three approaches: conventional rules of fit, simulation, and comparison with other models. The results indicated that the cross-informant model fits these data poorly. These results were consistent across countries, informants, and both clinical and population samples. Since inadequate empirical support for the cross-informant syndromes and their differentiation was found, the construct validity of these syndrome dimensions is questioned.

AB Consecutive admissions to an outpatient child psychiatry clinic diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or adjustment disorder were assessed for trauma exposure by a structured clinical interview and parent report. Controlling for age, gender, severity of internalizing behavior problems, social competence, family psychopathology, and parent-child relationship quality (assessed by parent report), an ODD diagnosis, with or without comorbid ADHD, was associated with increased likelihood of prior victimization (but not nonvictimization) trauma. ADHD alone was not associated with an increased likelihood of a history of trauma exposure. Traumatic victimization contributed uniquely to the prediction of ODD but not ADHD diagnoses. Children in psychiatric treatment who are diagnosed with ODD, but not those diagnosed solely with ADHD, may particularly require evaluation and care for posttraumatic sequelae.

AB Objective: To examine the stability of the occurrence of psychiatric disorders in a nonpsychiatric sample of young children.
   Method: There were 510 children ages 2-5 years enrolled through pediatric practices, with 391 children participating in the second wave, and 344 in the third wave of data collection 42-48 months later. The assessment battery administered at each wave yielded best-estimate consensus DSM-III-R diagnoses and dimensional assessments of psychopathology.
   Results: The prevalence of disruptive disorders (DDs) decreased, while emotional disorders (EDs), other disorders, and comorbid DD increased. The DDs were associated with lower family cohesion, more maternal negative affect, stressful life events, and male gender. Comorbid DDs were associated with increasing age and family cohesion. Older children, lower family cohesion, and maternal negative affect were associated with EDs. Time trends for the dimensional assessment of psychopathology was similar to DSMI-III-R disorders, but correlates differed.
   Conclusions: We discuss implications for service planning in pediatric primary care.

AB Adolescence ushers in a period of growth in the capacity to represent multiple perspectives on the self. The capacity to represent multiple perspectives may increase the risk of detecting self-discrepancies. Results confirmed that self-discrepancy, independent of actual-self positivity, was predictive of internalizing and externalizing problems. For adolescent girls, discrepancy with parental standards predicted functioning, regardless of whether these standards were adopted as their own (identified parental standards) or not (introjected parental standards). Discrepancy with self-standards that were independent from parents also predicted externalizing problems in girls. For adolescent boys, discrepancy with independent standards, but not parental standards, predicted internalizing problems. Results suggest that the relevance of own versus parental standards for self-regulation is gender specific.

AB The role of children's social self-perceptions in their social development was examined. Participants were 644 fourth graders who completed peer nominations and self-ratings to measure their self-perceptions. Comparisons of children's self-ratings with ratings by teachers yielded scores for self-other agreement. Comparisons of children's perceived liked-most and liked-least nominations with peers' actual liked-most and liked-least nominations yielded scores for dyadic perception accuracy. Significant relationships were found among the self-perception measures and they were moderately stable over time. Significant sociometric status and gender effects were found for both generalized and dyadic perceptions. Inaccurate social sell-perceptions predicted loneliness and internalizing behaviors. The results are consistent with the symbolic interactionist view of the link between social perceptions and relationships.

AB Objective: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the mediator role of coping strategies and social support on the adaptation of children following CSA. Empirical studies indicate that short-term consequences of child sexual abuse (CSA) are multiple and varied (Kendall-Tackett, Williams, & Finkelhor, 1993; Wolfe & Birt, 1995). While abuse-related characteristics were first studied to explain the variability of CSA outcome, more recently, the influence of other variables such as coping strategies and social support have been considered.
   Method: Fifty sexually abused children aged between 7 and 12 participated in this study. The Chad Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991) and the Perceived Competence Scale for Children (Harter, 1985) were used to measure victims' adjustment. Coping strategies were evaluated by the Self-Report Coping Scale (Causey & Dubow, 1992) and the children completed the perceived Social Support (Harter, 1985). A French version of the History of Victimization (Wolfe, Gentile, & Bourdeau, 1987) was used to gather abuse-related characteristics from medical records.
   Results: Results indicate that sexually abused children exhibit internalizing and externalizing behavior problems following CSA. Coping strategies and social support exert direct effects on victims' adjustment instead of the mediator influences originally expected. Among abuse-related variables, only the perpetrator's identity is directly related to internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: The absence of mediational effects of coping and social support is discussed in light of the measures used and the cross-sectional nature of the study. Results highlight the importance of parental implication and the consideration of coping strategies in designing therapeutic interventions with this population. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Objectives in this research were to examine contextual differences in correlates of substance use among high school students. The focus was on two broad categories of adjustment indices: personal psychopathology (internalizing and externalizing problems) and behaviors reflecting social competence (academic achievement, teacher-rated classroom behaviors, and peer acceptance or rejection). Associations between drug use and each of these constructs were examined in two sociodemographically disparate groups: teens from affluent, suburban families (n = 264), and low socioeconomic status adolescents from inner-city settings (n = 224). Results indicated that suburban youth reported significantly higher levels of substance use than inner-city youth. In addition, their substance use was more strongly linked with subjectively perceived maladjustment indices. Comparable negative associations involving grades and teacher-rated behaviors were found in both groups, and among suburban males only, substance use showed robust positive associations with acceptance by peers. Results are discussed in terms of developmental perspectives on adolescent deviance, contextual socializing forces, and implications for preventive interventions and treatment.

AB The processes whereby attachment and other social and cognitive factors contribute to social and emotional adjustment were examined. Participants were 56;African American children from low-income urban families. Attachment and sociability were assessed in the strange situation when children were 4.5 years old. Two years later, children were interviewed regarding their perceptions of social support and their attributions about others' intentions. Also assessed at Time 2 were child verbal intelligence, defensive response style, children's self-reports, and parent reports of child adjustment. As expected, attachment uniquely predicted perceived social support. Insecure attachment predicted self-reports of behavior problems and parental report of internalizing problems. Perceived social support was associated positively and significantly with viewing ambiguously depicted actions as prosocial rather than aggressive. Perceived social support was found to mediate the relation between attachment and adjustment. Results suggest that behaviorally mediated strategies for relating to caregivers in early childhood predict generalized social perception, thought, and emotion at later ages.

AB Gender differences: observed in interpersonal and self-critical vulnerabilities, reactivity to stressful life events, quality of relationships, and self-concepts inform a multivariate theoretical model of the moderating effects of gender on internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence. To test this model, data were collected in a 1-year prospective study from an ethnically diverse sample of 460 middle school students. Increases in girls' internalizing symptoms, compared with boys', were partly explained by greater stability in girls' interpersonal vulnerabilities and greater magnitude in coefficients linking girls' relationships with parents and peers and internalizing problems. Boys' risks for externalizing problems, compared with girls', were partly explained by the greater stability in boys' vulnerability to self-criticism. Coefficients for most pathways in the model are similar for boys and girls.

AB Analyzed longitudinal data from 3 samples of the Pittsburgh Youth Study on boys ages 7 to 18 to examine the co-occurrence of persistent substance use with other problem behaviors, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), persistent delinquency, and persistent internalizing problems (i.e., depressed mead, anxiety, shy or withdrawn behavior). In preadolescence, persistent substance users-also tended to be persistent delinquents, and half of this group displayed persistent internalizing problems as well. In adolescence a third of the persistent substance users did not manifest other persistent problems. Across the samples, the least common substance users were those who manifested persistent internalizing problems only. Logistic regression analyses showed that persistent substance use in preadolescence was predicted by persistent delinquency and internalizing problems and in adolescence by persistent delinquency only. The combination of persistent substance use and delinquency was predicted by oppositional defiant disorder in middle childhood and by persistent internalizing problems in middle to late childhood ADHD was not a predictor of persistent substance use (and delinquency) in any of the analyses. Results are discussed in terms of developmental models of multiproblem youth with an eye an improving early interventions.

AB Sixty-three 2-parent families participated in a study examining whether family organization-cohesion, parental leadership, and strong family subsystems-is related to teachers' perceptions of children's classroom behavior in Ist grade. Independent observers assessed whole-family organization and the quality of the interaction process in marital and parent-child dyads from videotapes of mothers, fathers, and children working together on a structured (difficult puzzle) and unstructured (building a model) task. Results indicate that adaptive family organization during the difficult puzzle task makes a significant, unique contribution to the prediction of children's externalizing behavior, over and above the quality of marital interaction and parenting style. No significant relationship was found between adaptive family organization in either task and teachers' perceptions of children's internalizing behavior.

AB Children of HIV-infected mothers have more psychosocial adjustment difficulties than no those of noninfected mothers. In this study, child psychosocial adjustment in children of HIV-infected women is examined across the three stages of HIV-infected: asymptomatic, symptomatic and AIDS. Participants were 99 HIV-infected women and 148 noninfected women. Children were not identified as being HN infected. Mother and child reports of behavioral difficulties are compared and competing hypotheses about mother report of child behavior difficulties are tested. Results indicate an ascending linear trend for child report of internalizing and externalizing difficulties from the noninfected stage through increasingly severe stages of HN-infection. According to mother report, child externalizing and internalizing difficulties are nonlinear, as mothers report an increase through the infected symptomatic stage, then a decrease in the AIDS stage. Implications for assessment, prevention and intervention in families with maternal HN infection are discussed.

AB Objectives: To examine the concurrent correlates of internalizing and externalizing disorders among substance-abusing and substance-dependent juvenile offenders and to determine the association between psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial functioning of the youths 16 months later. Method: Participants were 118 juvenile offenders meeting DSM-III-R criteria for substance abuse or dependence and their families. A multisource measurement battery was used to assess drug use, criminal activity, family relations, peer relations, school functioning, and out-of-home placements. Results: Comorbidity for externalizing disorders was associated with high rates of antisocial behavior and predicted worse 16-month outcomes than substance abuse alone or substance abuse with comorbid internalizing disorders. For criminal activity and drug use, the presence of internalizing disorders buffered the deleterious effect of externalizing disorders on substance-abusing and substance-dependent juvenile offenders. Conclusions: Even in substance-abusing delinquents, a population already extreme in antisocial behavior, the presence of externalizing disorders indicates high risk for deterioration.

AB Objective: To examine the applicability and outcome of parent management training in a group of Chinese children referred for aggressive and defiant behaviors. Method: Twenty-five children (aged 4-10 years) were assigned to a standardized 8 to 12 sessions of parent management training. Trained child and adolescent psychiatric nurses conducted the treatment. Measures taken at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 4-month follow-up period included the Child Behavior Checklist, direct observation of parent-child interactions, and a parent perception inventory. Results: Significant therapeutic gains occurred in parent-child interactions, externalizing behaviors, acid parents' perception of their parenting behaviors. These were maintained at 4-month follow-up. Fifty-two percent of cases improved to a level below clinical cutoffs. Poor parent-child interactions had stronger correlation with externalizing disturbances than internalizing disturbances. The changes in parent-child interactions had low correlation with the changes in the symptom profiles. Conclusions: The data provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of parent management training for Chinese children with conduct problems. The rationale for its success and modifications to improve its cultural sensitivity are discussed.

They completed STAIC; another questionnaire about anxiety the Echelle Comportementale d'Anxiete et de Peurs (ECAP); and the Child Depression Inventory! The parents filled in the Child Behavior Check-List (CBCL) and the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS). A group of healthy children was assessed with STAIC. Thirty asthmatic children had anxiety disorders. They had significantly higher STAIC scores than the nonanxious asthmatic and the nonasthmatic children. STAIC scores were independent of age and sex and were correlated with ECAP: CPRS anxiety subscore, CBCL total score, internalizing score, and CBCL anxiety-depression subscore. Internal consistency was 0.75. With a threshold value of 34 for anxiety disorders, this,method had a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 70%. STAIC was thus a useful method for anxiety disorder screening in a pediatric population.

DE X-linked mental retardation; behavior; personality; agenesis of the
   corpus callosum; FG syndrome
ID MENTAL-RETARDATION; GENE
AB FG syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive form of mental retardation, first described by Opitz and Kaveggia in 1974. Based on over 50 reported cases, FG syndrome is associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum, minor facial anomalies (high, broad forehead with frontal cowlick, ocular hypertelorism, down-slanted palpebral fissures, and small cupped auricles), relative macrocephaly, broad thumbs and halluces, and prominent fetal fingertip pads. Affected individuals manifest neonatal hypotonia and severe constipation, which usually resolves during mid-childhood. The hypotonia with joint hyperlaxity evolves into spasticity with joint contractures in later life. Affability, hyperactivity, and excessive talkativeness are noted frequently in patients with FG syndrome. Recently, we described three additional families (six additional patients) with FG syndrome who support the localization of a gene for the FG syndrome in chromosome region Xq12-q21 [Graham JM dr, Tackels D, Dibbern K, Superneau D, Rodgers C, Coming K, Schwartz CE. 1998. Am J Med Genet 80:145-156.]. Using these same families and one additional sporadic case of FG syndrome, we compared behavioral and personality characteristics of 6 FG boys with other boys with syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation: eight with Down syndrome, seven with Prader-Willi syndrome, eight with nonspecific mental retardation, and 13 with Williams syndrome. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Reiss Personality Profiles, and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, parents were asked to characterize the behavior and personality of their boys from ages 4 to 10 years. When compared with Williams syndrome, the FG boys had fewer internalizing behaviors and were significantly less anxious and withdrawn but had similar socially oriented, attention-seeking behaviors. On the Reiss Profile, FG boys were also quite similar to Williams syndrome boys. On the Vineland Scales, FG boys demonstrated significant relative strengths in their socialization skills, consistent with their personality, tending to confirm previous descriptions of their personalities.

ID SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; FAMILY PROCESS; MENTAL-HEALTH; LIFE STRESS;
   HARDSHIP; DISTRESS; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN; SOCIALIZATION; UNEMPLOYMENT
AB An important part of a science aimed at the prevention of human dysfunction involves the development of empirically based models that identify processes of risk for or protection from emotional distress or behavioral problems over time. The present study developed and evaluated such a model that proposed two pathways through which family economic pressure was expected to influence change in adolescent internalizing symptoms (depression and anxiety) during the period from the eighth to the tenth grades. A total of 377 rural families in a midwestern state provided data for the analyses. The results were generally consistent with the conceptual model in that family economic pressure increased adolescent perceptions of family economic hardship, which, in tom, reduced the adolescent's sense of control or mastery over time. Lowered mastery was associated with increases in emotional distress. Also consistent with the model, prior levels of mastery appeared to reduce the magnitude of economic stress experienced by the adolescent whereas prior emotional distress intensified the economic stress process. Although gender differences were found in these processes, the overall pattern of results suggests that girls and boys are both at risk for internalizing problems when families experience economic pressure. Implications of the findings for the development of effective preventive interventions with financially stressed families in rural areas are discussed.

   HISTORY
AB Background: Growing evidence indicates that anxiety and depressive disorder onset may involve a prodromal buildup of symptoms. Also, stressful life events may precipitate gradual symptom increase, leading to the development of full-blown disorders. This study used prospective longitudinal data to examine the theory that, over time, stressful events, such as parent-adolescent disagreements, influence the longitudinal course of adolescents' internalizing symptoms, which in turn predict first onset of a depressive or anxiety disorder.
   Methods: A community sample of 303 families with an adolescent aged 12 or 13 years in year 1 provided repeated measures of parent-adolescent disagreements and adolescents' internalizing symptoms over 3 and 4 years, respectively. At age 19 or 20 years, the adolescents were assessed for anxiety and depressive disorders using structured interviews based on DSM-III-R criteria. The hypothesized associations were estimated using latent growth curve modeling procedures.
   Results: Year 1 parent-adolescent disagreements predicted year 1 adolescent' internalizing symptoms, and changes in disagreements from year 1 to year 3 predicted changes in internalizing symptoms from year 1 to year 4. Both the year 1 level and changes in symptoms predicted internalizing disorder onset in years 4 through 7, and both the year 1 level and changes in disagreements indirectly predicted disorder onset.
   Conclusions: Among adolescents, persistent or escalating stressful events, such as disagreements with parents, indirectly increase the risk for internalizing disorder onset through their direct association with high or increasing symptom levels. Chronically high or increasing symptom levels directly increase risk for internalizing disorder.

AB Objective: To evaluate the relationships between asthma and type and incidence of psychiatric problems in a pediatric population.
   Methods: A series of 93 children and adolescents with asthma presenting during a 1-year period to a pediatric pneumology and allergy service was studied Their psychopathological problems were compared with those of 93 children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Various questionnaires were completed by the patients. the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Stare-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI). Their parents were administered the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The patients were examined using the revised Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-R).
   Results: There were more symptoms in the asthma group than in the IDDM group, as indicated by total CBCL, scores, internalization and externalization CBCL subscores, and the STAIC scores. Asthma was often associated with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) psychiatric disorders. We found 30 anxiety disorders, 5 affective disorders, and 6 disruptive behaviour disorders. Asthmatic children did not seem to be more depressed than the IDDM group, and their self-esteem, overall, was goon. However, the asthma subgroup presenting with psychiatric disorders had poorer self-esteem and social competence. Adolescents did not seem to suffer more psychiatric disturbances than did younger patients. Girls did nor suffer more psychiatric disturbances than did boys.
   Conclusion: Asthma appears to be associated both with higher overall incidence of psychiatric problems than in IDDM and with particular categories of psychiatric problems. In particular, the problems include anxiety disorders, internalizing symptoms, and disruptive behaviours.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB A psychological etiology or predisposition for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has long been suspected. Much of the psychiatric literature to date has blamed patients or their families for the problem or focused on psychoanalytic interpretation to account for the syndrome. Thirty-two patients with CVS were compared with 64 age- and sex-matched controls. The patients had a higher incidence of psychological symptoms and migraine. On the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist patients had higher internalizing, somatic complaints, and anxiety/depression scores. CVS is a migraine variant, with attacks usually precipitated by stress and intercurrent infections. The psychological characteristics of patients with CVS probably contribute to their vulnerability.

AB The goal of the present study was to examine a conceptual attributional model for the development of psychopathology after child physical abuse. Physically abused or maltreated children referred for treatment completed a series of measures to assess parent-to-child violence, abuse-specific attributions and general attributional style, other potential predictors, and children's psychopathology. Results revealed that the severity of current parent-to-child violence was associated with children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Attributions predicted the level of children's psychopathology beyond the variance accounted for by the severity of parent-to-child violence. The severity of parent-to-child violence, attributions about the abuse, general attributional style, and level of family functioning accounted for 28%-63% of the variance in children's abuse-specific, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Implications of the findings and research recommendations are discussed.

AB This article examines the empirical support for psychological therapies for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Empirical support for psychological treatments of noninjured children provides a foundation upon and a framework in which to discuss applications to children with neurobehavioral dysfunction. Behavioral interventions to address externalizing behaviors have received the greatest focus, whereas there is a paucity of work that pertains to internalizing features and prosocial behavior such as assertiveness. Although the systematic study of psychological intervention lags far behind the rapidly increasing knowledge of neurobehavioral sequelae to TBI, there are promising directions that stem from initial findings.

AB Objective: To prospectively assess the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children hospitalized following acute physical injury. The focus was identification of the incidence of PTSD, PTSD symptoms, and exploration of factors associated with development of PTSD symptoms and disorder.
   Method: Forty children ages 8-17 were interviewed approximately 1 month following a serious injury and assessed for PTSD, pretrauma behavior problems, levels of peritraumatic fear, and posttraumatic thought suppression.
   Results: Twenty-two and a half percent of participants met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD; 47.5% met criteria for at least two of the three PTSD symptom clusters. Greater thought suppression was associated with increased symptoms of PTSD, as were the child's peritraumatic fear response and pretrauma internalizing behaviors.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that many children who have been hospitalized for physical trauma may be experiencing clinically significant PTSD symptomatology and may benefit from psychological as well as medical intervention.

For females, predictors included low birthweight and death of a parent; for males, they included emotional dependency and internalizing behavior problems. Depressive symptomatology at age 15 emerged as an important risk factor for both genders. Clinical implications are discussed and areas for further research are proposed.

   PROCEDURES; CHRONIC ILLNESS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; SCHOOL PERFORMANCE
AB Purpose: To review the literature on the consequences of having a chronic disease on the child's functioning in daily life.
   Method: A wide search of the literature resulted in the location of around 200 empirical studies with a focus on chronically ill children. This body of literature is discussed in three parts: (1) the academic and psychosocial adjustment of chronically ill children, (2) the ways chronically ill children cope with disease-related stress and other stressors, and (3) the effectiveness of coping strategies.
   Results: Children with a chronic disease do not show lower school performance despite higher absence rates (an exception is epilepsy). Their self-concept is similar to that of healthy children. However, they show more behaviour problems, especially internalizing problems such as depression and social withdrawal. The authors could not find evidence for the claim that children with a chronic disease are more frequently confronted with stress than their healthy peers. Children with a chronic disease use a variety of coping strategies to deal with various disease-related and common stressors. The coping strategies they use in relation to common stressors appear to be similar to those of healthy children.
   Conclusion: Incidences of maladjustment vary across studies and different chronic diseases. Most studies on coping lack situational sensitivity, which makes it impossible to compare results. Findings on the effectiveness of these children's coping strategies are still scarce and inconclusive. Recommendations for future research on coping with chronic disease in childhood are given.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine whether types of discourse deficits were associated differentially with psychiatric disorders (PD) and with language impairments (LI) in children. Discourse analyses examining the occurrence of different types of discourse deficits in language structure, information structure, and flow of information were performed on the spoken narratives of 111 children aged 7 to 12 years who comprised 4 groups: (1) psychiatrically referred children with LI(PD + LI), (2) psychiatrically referred children with normally developing language (PD), (3) nonreferred children with language impairments (LI), and (4) nonreferred children with normally developing language (controls). Discourse deficits in language and information structure characterized children with PD. Children with the comorbid condition exhibited deficits related to pronominal reference and casual cohesion. The findings provide a preliminary understanding of the associations among language, discourse, and psychopathology in children.

AB Objective. This study, like earlier studies that focused on younger abused children, ascertained whether physically abused adolescents exhibited increased internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Relevance to pediatric practice is discussed.
   Design. A cross-sectional design was used to compare the behavior of physically abused adolescents and comparison adolescents using self-reports, parent reports, and teacher reports. The level of agreement among raters was also examined.
   Participants. The subjects were 99 physically abused adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years, who were recruited from Child Protective Services. Comparison subjects were 99 community-recruited nonabused adolescents who were matched for age, gender, and income with the abused adolescents,
   Measures. The behavior of the adolescents was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist, and the comparable Youth Self-Report and Teacher Report Form, which are widely used measures of behavioral and emotional problems. The Child Global Assessment Scale was also used as a measure of functional impairment and of the need for mental health services.
   Results. Parents and teachers rated the problems of abused adolescents as significantly greater than the problems of nonabused adolescents on all checklist subscales. Abused adolescents reported significantly greater problems only on externalizing behavior subscales. In addition, based on interviewer ratings, physically abused adolescents exhibited significantly greater functional impairment.
   Conclusions. Similar to previous research on abused children, physically abused adolescents exhibit externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and experience greater functional impairment. Parent, teacher, and adolescent reports of externalizing behaviors were similar, but physically abused adolescents reported fewer internalizing behaviors than did the other informants.

AB The present study examined the correspondence among adolescent/young adult and parental figure, professional, peer and partner reports, in their rating of emotional and behavioural problems of 195 young people aged between 12 and 25 years who attended a community-based psychotherapy centre. Data from young people were obtained at intake by participants completing the Youth Self Report Form and from significant others by them completing the Significant Other version of the Teacher's Report Form. professionals rated internalizing (emotional) problems lower than peers, partners or parental figures. Externalizing (disruptive) problems were rated lowest by professionals, highest by partners with parental figures and peers in between. Agreement for internalizing problems was highest between self and professionals and lowest for partners and peeps; parental figures were in between these two extremes. For externalizing problems, agreement was highest between self and friends bur very low for partners. Professionals' ratings of internalizing problems showed a strong association with clinicians' assessment of global functioning and there was a strong association between partner ratings of total problems and clinicians' ratings of global functioning. The study showed the value of using a wider range of informants for assessing emotional and behavioural problems presented by young people seeking treatment than used in the assessment of pre-adolescents.

AB To explore the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (SPPA) as an indicator of psychosocial outcome in adolescents with chronic physical disorders, we administered the questionnaire along with other well-established measures of psychosocial outcome (the semistructured Child Assessment Schedule (CAS) interview and the Youth Self Report (YSR) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires) to one group of diseased adolescents with good psychosocial adjustment (juvenile chronic arthritis, JCA) and one with a high level of psychosocial maladjustment (anorectal anomalies, ARA). The adolescents with ARA had significantly lower scores of global self-worth, school competence, and social acceptance as compared to the adolescents with JCA. However, global self-worth in neither group was impaired as compared with that of the general Norwegian adolescent population. Perceived physical appearance was the single self-concept domain accounting for the variance in global self-worth (R-2 = 0.71, p < 0.001). Among the other measures of psychosocial outcome, global self-worth was most strongly related to mood according to the CAS interview(r = -0.53, p < 0.001) and to the YSR internalizing score (r = -0.53, p < 0.001). Our findings indicate that the SPPA has limited ability to identify chronically diseased adolescents with adverse psychosocial outcome.

AB This study is a prospective investigation of the predictive association between early behavior problems (internalizing, externalizing, hyperactivity-impulsiveness, immaturity-dependency) and later victimization in the peer group. Teacher ratings of the behavioral adjustment of 389 kindergarten and 1st-grade children (approximate age range of 5 to 6 years-old) were obtained, using standardized behavior problem checklists. These ratings predicted peer nomination scores for victimization, obtained 3 years later, even after the prediction associated with concurrent behavior problems was statistically controlled. Further analyses suggested that the relation between early behavior problems and later victimization is mediated by peer rejection and moderated by children's dyadic friendships. Behavior problems appear to play an important role in determining victimization within the peer group, although the relevant pathways are complex and influenced by other aspects of children's social adjustment.

ID AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; DISTRESS; TRAUMA
AB Examined the role of availability of family support in moderating the negative effects of exposure to community violence on internalizing symptoms. Participants were 75 low-income African American children between the ages of 10 and 15. Two measures of availability of family support (mother's presence in the home and family size) were evaluated as moderators of the relations between exposure to community violence and depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. After controlling for age, sex, and concurrent life stress, mother's presence in the home moderated the relation between exposure to community violence and depressive symptoms but not the relation between exposure to community violence and PTSD symptoms. Children living in mother-absent families were at increased risk of depressive symptoms as exposure to community violence increased. In addition, family size approached significance as a moderator of depressive symptoms but not PTSD symptoms, revealing a trend toward children from smaller families being at increased risk of depressive symptoms as exposure to community violence increased These findings suggest that although availability of family support is an important moderator for depressive symptoms, this is not the case for PTSD symptoms.

AB Assessed the emerging view that generalized negative affect and anxious symptoms are important in understanding sex differences in depressive symptoms. Sixty-three adolescent psychiatric inpatients (32 boys, 31 girls), ages 12 to 16 (M = 13.87, SD = 1.36), completed measures of positive and negative affect and anxious and depressive symptoms. Results demonstrated, as predicted, that depressive and anxious symptoms were more highly associated in adolescent girls than boys. Furthermore, girls with depressive symptoms were more likely to have comorbid anxious symptoms than boys with depressive symptoms. Sex differences were not found for adolescents with specific depressive symptoms and specific anxious symptoms (i.e., the absence of comorbidity), Our findings supported the possibility that sex differences in pure forms of depression are overestimated and that comorbid internalizing conditions may be more prevalent in adolescent girls than boys.

AB Diabetes, as a chronic stressor, and negative life events (NLEs), as a discrete stressor, were related to children's behavioral adjustment, along with moderating effects of the family environment. Diabetes and NLEs predicted both higher internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) behavior problems, suggestive of nonspecific distress. Higher family conflict and lower cohesion each predicted more behavior problems (INT-EXT). However, conflict was the sole moderator of the stressors. Higher family conflict and diabetes exacerbated children's EXT behavior problems, with clinically elevated scores. Higher family conflict and higher NLEs resulted in clinically elevated INT-EXT behaviors. Conversely, low. family conflict protected children's behavioral functioning from the stressors. Family cohesion was the sole predictor of children's social competencies but did not moderate the stressors.

AB This study examined the relation between internalizing and externalizing symptoms in two groups of prepubertal boys (with and without multiple chronic tic disorder) with diagnosed attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parents and teachers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF), respectively. Children were carefully evaluated for the absence of a chronic tic disorder. Boys with ADHD and chronic multiple tic disorder (ADHD/+tics) received significantly higher (p = .0032, Bonferroni correction) scores for the Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, and Attention Problem scales of the CBCL and the Delinquent Behavior, Thought Problems, and Somatic Complaints scales of the TRF than did boys without chronic tic disorder (ADHD/-tics). Although many of the individual items that differentiated (p < .05) the two groups of boys pertained to behaviors that characterize motor ties, obsessions, or compulsions, the ADHD/+tics group exhibited higher rates of anxious behavior (CBCL) and obscene language (TRF) than did the ADHD/-tics group. Anxiety/depressive symptoms were associated with aggressive/oppositional behavior in both samples. Children with mild tic disorder were more similar (CBCL) to ADHD/- ties boys than they were to children with more severe tic disorder. The relatively higher rate of comorbidity in the ADHD/+tics group suggests that ties may be a marker for more severe symptomatology in clinic-referred samples of children with ADHD. Furthermore, these data suggest that it is not the presence, per se, but rather the severity of tic disorder that is associated with higher rates of emotional and behavioral disturbances.

AB This study investigated how children who identified themselves as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) via a DSM-based child interview would differ from children who were so identified by an adult only on a commonly used parent/teacher rating scale. Prevalence of ADHD, age, IQ, observed disruptive behavior, self-reported internalizing symptoms, and symptom severity of externalizing symptoms and comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders were examined. Although no significant differences were found in observed disruptive behavior between groups, the Child Set-Identified group endorsed significantly more internalizing items on commonly used self-raring scales. Findings suggest that children who self-identify as having ADHD may also exhibit higher levels of internalizing symptoms.

AB Three cohorts of 10- to 14-year-old adolescents were sampled to obtain perceptions of their parents' conflict-resolution styles, their own conflict-resolution styles, and their behavioral adjustment, to test J. H. Grych and F. D. Fincham's (1990) cognitive-contextual model of the relationship of marital conflict to child adjustment. As found previously, boys and girls were not exposed to different levels or types of interparental conflict, although boys tended to blame themselves more. Adolescents' reports of their own conflict-resolution styles with siblings were clearly related to level and types of their more general adjustment levels. A series of regressions supported Grych and Fincham's model for internalizing problems (and avoidant resolution style) in adolescents; only minimal support was found with externalizing problems (and attacking resolution style). Gender-specific patterns of intergenerational transmission of resolution styles were found and are discussed.

AB Two studies examined the relationship between parental trait anger, parental symptomatology, and children's and adolescents' emotional/behavioral problems. Results of Study 1 suggested that parental trait anger did not serve as a mediator between parental symptoms and children's emotional/behavioral problems. Study 2, however, suggested that parental trait anger did serve as a mediator between parental depression and adolescents' emotional/behavioral problems. For internalizing behaviors, inward anger expression and trait anger were mediators in father-son dyads, and outward anger expression was a mediator in mother-daughter dyads. For externalizing behavior, inward anger expression was a mediator in father-son dyads, and outward anger expression was a mediator in mother-son dyads. These results suggest the importance of examining parental dispositions toward anger in relation to the psychological symptoms family members may experience.

AB Family aggression patterns and behavior problems of children, aged 6-12, recruited from shelters for battered women (shelter group) were contrasted with three comparison groups of currently nonviolent families: two-parent, single-mother, and homeless. Girls who had been exposed to recent interparental wife abuse were predicted to show more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than similarly exposed boys, based on recent literature. Homeless and shelter mothers reported the highest rates of parent-child aggression. Shelter girls obtained significantly higher total, internalizing and externalizing behavior problem ratings than shelter boys, and than two-parent and single-mother girls. Shelter boys obtained significantly higher internalizing ratings than two-parent boys. Shelter and homeless children were rated as having equivalent levels of behaviour problems. Across all groups, mothers' psychological adjustment was a better predictor of daughters' adjustment than that of sons. The study concluded that the assumption that preadolescent girls have greater immunity to psychosocial risk is unfounded.

AB Objective: To study the long-term stability of Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) profile types, which represent children's overall patterns of single and comorbid scale elevations. Method: Profile types were determined for 623 outpatient children at referral and then at mean follow-up 4.8 years later, and their continuity was determined. Results: At baseline 37.5% of the children were classified by a profile type, and 41.9% of these originally classified children continued to be classified at follow-up. The average odds ratio for a child continuing as a specific CBCL profile type from baseline to follow-up was 8.2. When children changed from one specific profile type to another. they usually continued in the same broad externalizing or internalizing category. Children who were not classified by a profile type at baseline generally remained unclassified. Conclusions: Stability findings for CBCL profile types appeared good and were similar to past longitudinal results for CBCL scales and DSM diagnoses. These profile types may prove an important empirical method for addressing the problem of comorbid clinical pictures.

DE behavior problems; emotional problems; psychiatric disorders; Vietnam
AB Objective: To determine the distribution of behavioral and emotional problems and competencies among a sample of Vietnamese children aged 4 through 18 years living in Hanoi. Method: A representative community sample of 1,526 children and adolescents was selected from 2 precincts in Hanoi. Problems and competencies were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: Vietnamese children had lower mean raw scores than U.S. norms on the CBCL's Total, Externalizing, Internalizing, and Competence scales. Boys were reported to have more externalizing problems and girls more internalizing problems. Girls' levels of internalizing problems increased significantly with age. Conclusion: The lower levels of problems and competencies reported in Vietnamese children may represent differences in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, in parental perceptions of what constitutes deviant behavior, or in parental comfort with reporting psychopathological behaviors. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between the reported behavioral and emotional problems of Vietnamese children and the presence of psychiatric disorders. From a clinical perspective, the study's results suggest that levels of problems and competencies may vary significantly between different ethnic and cultural groups. Specific clinical cutoffs used to identify children requiring further psychiatric assessment need to be established separately for different ethnic groups.

AB Three groups of third-grade students classified as either Externalizers (n = 30) Internalizers (n = 55) or Controls (n = 96) were contrasted on 19 measures in social and academic domains using multivariate analyses. Based on these analyses, a series of descriptive discriminant function analyses were undertaken to determine the best predictors of Externalizing and Internalizing group membership. Of 19 variables, those that best predicted Externalizing status compared to Controls were critical events, social skills, academic competence, peer acceptance, negative narrative comments, math, and reading, in that order. Variables that best predicted Internalizing status compared to Controls were social skills, academic competence, math, critical events, reading, peer acceptance, and negative narrative comments. Variables that best separated students on Externalizing and Internalizing status were critical events, disciplinary referrals, social impact, academic self-concept, school absences, peer acceptance, and academic competence. Cross-validated classification analyses correctly classified 97% of the Externalizing group and 89% of the Internalizing group compared to Controls. A classification analysis contrasting Externalizers and Internalizers resulted in correct classification rates of 63% and 84%, respectively. Contrary to much research in special education, both Externalizing and Internalizing groups appeared to have adequate academic self-concepts and social self-concepts. These findings were interpreted in light of recent work on positive illusory biases and the hypothesized relationship between unrealistically positive self-evaluations and psychological adjustment.

AB The development of a broad spectrum of adjustment problems in girls was studied longitudinally from late childhood to early adulthood. A specific interest concerned how well the externalizing-internalizing distinction could explain the data. The sample consisted of about 500 Swedish girls, reasonably representative of the general population. Variable-oriented methods were complemented with person-oriented methods to study syndrome formation at the level of the individual. The results suggested a rather diversified pattern of multiproblem syndromes in late childhood, whereas the syndrome structure in early adolescence was organized around a differentiation between girls with externalizing adjustment problems and girls with peer problems. An externalizing syndrome was found to be stable between late childhood and early adolescence, increasing the risk of severe maladjustment in adulthood. Internalizing problems showed no clear-cut continuity with adult maladjustment. Results are discussed in relation to the externalizing-internalizing distinction, which to some extent is called in question.

AB The experiences of 150 children in after-school programs were examined in relation to performance in first grade. Three aspects of program experiences (emotional climate, quality of peer interactions, and program curriculum) were associated with the children's concurrent adjustment at school, controlling for family selection factors. Staff positivity in the after-school programs was associated with boys displaying fewer internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas staff negativity was related to boys obtaining poorer grades in reading and math. Program flexibility was associated with boys having better social skills. More frequent negative interactions with peers in the programs were related to more internalizing and externalizing problems, and poorer social skills at school. Boys who attended programs offering a larger number of different activities had more internalizing and externalizing problems, and poorer grades in reading and math. After-school experiences also were related to girls' behaviors, but associations were less apparent for girls than boys.

Parents as well as teachers filled in the questionnaire. The data shows that 48% of the children with SLI were considered to have behavioural problems either at home or in school. The problems differ significantly from the norm group on internalizing behaviour and total behaviour. The children do not demonstrate more externalizing behaviour than children in the norm group. It is hypothesized that the absence of aggressive behaviour might be a characteristic of children with SLI.

AB The purpose of the current study was to build on the emerging effort to produce a meaningful typology of child behavior for school-aged children. The Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Parent Rating Scales for Children (PRS-C) norming data were collected for 2029 6- to 11-year-old children at 116 sites representing various regions of the United States. The PRS-C has 130 items that are rated by the parent on a 4-point scale of frequency, ranging from " never " to " almost always ". The Ward method of cluster analysis was used to identify the initial centroids or cluster seeds in this norming sample. An iterative clustering method, a K-means procedure, was used to refine the Ward cluster solution. A nine-cluster solution was selected based on both rational and empirical considerations. The resulting clusters were labeled adapted, physical complaints/worry, average, well-adapted, minimal problems, attention problems, internalizing, general psychopathology-severe, and disruptive behavior problems. The nine-cluster solution is similar to those of Achenbach (1991), Thompson, Kronenberger, and Curry (1989), and other researchers. At the same time, some significant differences exist. The resulting typology points the way toward future cluster studies of child psychopathology and normal behavioral development by delineating additional research and theoretical directions.

AB We test three risk models (independent-additive, interactive, and exponential) to examine how multiple risk factors in the family environment-overt interparental conflict, poor parenting, and economic hardship-operate conjointly to predict youth problem behaviors. The sample includes 335 preadolescent and early adolescent youth. Findings from this study support the pattern of independent, additive effects of individual family stressors. We found no support for the idea that the effects of poor parenting, overt interparental conflict, and family economic hardship exacerbate one another; nor did the converse serve as buffers. The independent, additive model explains more variance in externalizing problem behavior for youth in nondivorced, two-parent households. Poor parenting is the strongest risk factor. Economic hardship is the only significant risk factor for youth internalizing problem behavior.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Objective. To determine if psychological morbidity in youth with chronic fatigue is caused by the stress of coping with a chronic illness.
   Study Design. Case-control study comparing pediatric patients with debilitating chronic fatigue and matched subjects with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic medical illness with similar functional sequelae.
   Setting. Pediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic and Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinic of Kosair Children's Hospital.
   Participants. Nineteen children and adolescents with debilitating chronic fatigue and 19 age- and sex-matched peers with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
   Outcome. Structured Interview, Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Child Behavior Checklist, and Youth Self-Report.
   Results. Intellectual functioning on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test Composite was average (103, standard score) for both groups. Pediatric patients with chronic fatigue had higher levels of internalizing psychological distress than patients suffering from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, despite the fact that both groups had a similar pattern of decline in social and physical activities. Duration of illness did not explain the difference in psychological symptoms.
   Conclusions. Psychological factors may play a more active role in debilitating chronic fatigue in pediatric patients than can be explained by the stress of coping with a similar chronic, non-life-threatening illness.

AB Background. Previous research has reported co-morbidity between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders. Interpretation of these findings is complicated by symptom overlap in the clinical presentation of the disorders. We estimate the prevalence of ADHD in both the current and childhood histories of adults with anxiety disorders, while taking symptom overlap into account. We also evaluate the utility of the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS) for retrospective reporting of ADHD.
   Methods. Consecutive admissions (N = 149) to an anxiety disorders clinic were given a diagnostic and psychometric assessment. The WURS was administered to obtain a retrospective diagnosis of childhood ADHD. Twenty-nine of the 35 people surpassing the cut-off score on the WURS were given a structured interview of adult ADHD symptoms.
   Results. The WURS contains many 'internalizing' items that may inflate retrospective accounts of ADHD. After taking this into account, there is still a significantly higher prevalence of ADHD in the retrospective reports of adults with anxiety disorders (15 %) than would be expected by chance (4 %). Furthermore, of those who meet retrospective criteria for ADHD, 45 % (13 of 29) continue to meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD as adults.
   Conclusions. The WURS may require considerable revision for use with clinical populations. In spite of these difficulties with retrospective assessment, available evidence indicates that ADHD is more prevalent in the histories of anxiety disordered patients than would be expected from base rates.

AB Self-reported internalizing symptoms of seriously emotionally disturbed (SED) and regular education students in grades 4-6 were compared using the Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children. All participants were African American and from an urban public school district in the Southeastern United States. Each of the two study groups consisted of 50 participants (35 boys, 15 girls) who were matched by gender and socioeconomic status. The SED group reported significantly higher levels of internalizing distress than the regular education group. In contrast to previous findings, there was no significant gender difference in self-reported internalizing symptomatology in the present study. A discriminant function analysis found that the ISSC scores were able to correctly classify 91% of the participants into their respective educational group. Results of this study provide additional evidence of the construct validity of the ISSC, a recently developed and unique self-report measure. Results are discussed in terms of future research needs and educational/clinical practice with students who have emotional and behavioral disorders. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB The Port Pirie Cohort Study is the first study to monitor prospectively the association between lifetime blood lead exposure and the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems experienced by children. Lead exposure data along with ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist were obtained for 322 11-13-year-old children from the lead smelting community of Port Pirie, Australia. Mean total behavior problem score (95% confidence interval (CI)) for boys whose lifetime average blood lead concentration was above 15 mu g/dl was 28.7 (24.6-32.8) compared with 21.1 (17.5-24.8) in boys with lower exposure levels. The corresponding mean scores (95% CI) for girls were 29.7 (25.3-34.2) and 18.0 (14.7-21.3), After controlling for a number of confounding variables, including the quality of the child's HOME environment (assessed by Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment), maternal psychopathology, and the child's IQ, regression modeling predicted that for a hypothetical increase in lifetime blood lead exposure from 10 to 30 mu g/dl, the externalizing behavior problem score would increase by 3.5 in boys (95% CI 1.6-5.4), and by 1.8 (95% CI -0.1 to 11.1) in girls. Internalizing behavior problem scores were predicted to rise by 2.1 (95% CI 0.0-4.2) in girls but by only 0.8 (95% CI -0.9 to 2.4) in boys.

AB This study examined the relationship between children's emotional and behavioral problems and teachers' social responding. Elementary school students completed the Children's Depression Inventory and a parent completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Teachers rated children on measures of interpersonal attractiveness and personal rejection. Teachers' ratings of student interpersonal attractiveness were significantly correlated with the level of student depression, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and overall psychopathology. However, teachers' ratings of personal rejection toward students only correlated with externalizing behavior problems. Family income was also related to child adjustment and teacher ratings. Externalizing behavior problems best predicted both lower interpersonal attractiveness and increased personal rejection, even after controlling for family income. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Homesickness is the distress or impairment caused by an actual or anticipated separation from home. It is characterized by acute longing and preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects. This study extended previous research on the phenomenology of childhood homesickness by assessing a sample of 316 boys, ages 8-16, who were spending 2 weeks at a single-sex residential summer camp. Some 18% of the children reported moderate or high levels of homesickness; 7% reported concomitant severe depressive and anxious symptoms. Homesickness intensity was negatively correlated with separation experience and age. It was most commonly associated with depressive symptoms and internalizing behavior problems. For severely homesick boys, intensity increased over time, decreasing just prior to their return home. Preseparation assessment suggested that severely homesick boys had elevated levels of homesickness and negative emotions months before arriving at camp. One-year follow-up data suggested that the intensity of severe homesickness decreased with age and experience. However, severely homesick boys were less likely than other boys to return to camp. The results demonstrate how brief separations can affect children's well-being and attitudes about separations. Severe homesickness is distinct from separation anxiety disorder, but has elements of this and other psychopathologies. Theories of negative emotion, attachment, and coping complement emerging theories of homesickness.

Boys and girls in the 3rd through 7th grades (N = 173, mean age = 11.3 years) were assessed on victimization, personal Variables (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and physical strength), and interpersonal variables (number of friends and peer rejection). One year later children were assessed again on all variables. Internalizing problems, physical weakness, and peer rejection contributed uniquely to gains in victimization over time. Moreover, initial victimization predicted increases in later internalizing symptoms and peer rejection. These reciprocal influences suggest the existence of a vicious cycle that supports the strong temporal stability of peer victimization.

AB Objectives: To examine the moderating effects of gender, grade level, and ethnicity on the associations between violence exposure and adolescents' internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavior and to explore whether such relationships persist over time. Method: A survey of adolescents' exposure to violence, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behavior was administered to 2 cross-sectional samples of 6th, 8th, and 10th graders (N = 2,748 in 1994 and 2,600 in 1996) in an urban school system. Approximately 1,100 adolescents participated in both surveys and served as the longitudinal sample. Results: Structural equation models indicated that violence exposure was closely associated with both externalizing behavior (r = 0.74-0.79) and internalizing symptoms (r = 0.36-0.38). The strength of association was similar across gender and ethnic groups. However, violence exposure was more closely related with internalizing symptoms for younger adolescents than their older counterparts. The longitudinal analysis suggested that exposure to violence reported at time 1 was related to adolescents' internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavior 2 years later. Conclusions: These results document high levels of violence exposure for urban youths and indicate links to a range of psychiatric symptoms and indicators of poor adjustment. Such findings carry implications for direct clinical work with young people, as well as for program development and public policy.

AB Objective: To determine whether children at risk for the development of adult alcohol dependence would show greater "behavioral inhibition" to the unfamiliar, an early childhood temperament characteristic. Method: One hundred peer play evaluations were conducted blindly with preschool children from families selected to be at high or low risk for developing alcohol dependence. Each child was paired with different children (same-sex pairs) in independent sessions to determine the stability of the behavioral response. Results: High-risk children spent significantly more time staring at the other child during the peer play session while refraining from engaging in play, and significantly less time speaking to the other child. Significantly more time was spent proximal to the parent, but only on the first peer play session. These behaviors have been shown to be indicators of behavioral inhibition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the presence of behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar in childhood may be a risk factor for later development of alcohol dependence. While there is abundant evidence that childhood externalizing behaviors are risk factors for later development of substance dependence, the present results suggest that internalizing behaviors may be a pathway as well.

AB Objective: To test associations between parental drug abuse and children's problems, children of cocaine- and opiate-dependent parents were compared with demographically matched referred and nonreferred children. Method: Cocaine- and opiate-dependent parents in treatment completed the Child Behavior Checklist for 410 children (218 boys, 192 girls) from ages 2 through 18 years (mean = 7.9 years). Children of drug abusers (CDAs) were demographically matched to referred (RCs) and nonreferred children (NRCs). Results: RCs scored lower than CDAs and NRCs on most competence scales, and higher than CDAs and NRCs on all problem scales. CDAs scored lower than NRCs on most competence scales, and higher than NRCs on Withdrawn, Thought Problems, Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. Group status also predicted clinical range scores on most competence and all problem scales. Conclusions: CDAs showed more internalizing and externalizing psychopathology relative to matched NRCs, but they showed significantly less psychopathology than shown by matched RCs. CDAs are an important group to target for preventive interventions.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationships between learning difficulties and behavior problems in preadolescent children both concurrently and longitudinally, using data from the Australian Temperament Project, and to examine associations between DSM-diagnosed disorders and types of learning difficulties. Method: Clinical and comparison groups of 11- to 12-year-old children were assessed on behavioral and learning indices and completed a structured diagnostic interview. Longitudinal data were available from earlier surveys of the development of these children. Results: Children in the clinical group were disadvantaged on all learning and behavioral indices, and their problems in many cases had been evident from 7 to 8 years of age. There were specific associations between types of learning difficulties and both internalizing and externalizing disorders. Numeracy difficulties were strongly associated with DSM diagnoses for both boys and girls. and externalizing problems tended to co-occur with a combination of learning problems. Conclusions: Behavioral maladjustment in many domains is strongly associated with learning difficulties even after intelligence and socioeconomic factors are controlled. The odds ratios for persistence of difficulties throughout elementary school are extremely high for children with clinical problems.

ID TEMPERAMENT; COMPETENCE; BEHAVIOR; SOCIALIZATION; FAMILY; CHILDHOOD
AB Relations between self-reported parental reactions to children's negative emotions (PNRs) and children's socially appropriate/problem behavior and negative emotionality were examined longitudinally. Evidence was consistent with the conclusion that relations between children's externalizing (but not internalizing) emotion and parental punitive reactions to children's negative emotions are bidirectional. Reports of PNRs generally were correlated with low quality of social functioning. In structural models, mother-reported problem behavior at ages 10-12 was at least marginally predicted from mother-reported problem behavior, children's regulation, and parental punitive or distress reactions. Moreover, parental distress and punitive reactions at ages 6-8 predicted reports of children's regulation at ages 8-10, and regulation predicted parental punitive reactions at ages 10-12. Father reports of problem behavior at ages 10-12 were predicted by earlier problem behavior and parental distress or punitive reactions; some of the relations between regulation and parental reactions were similar to those in the models for mother-reported problem behavior. Parental perceptions of their reactions were substantially correlated over 6 years. Some nonsupportive reactions declined in the early to mid-school years, but all increased into late childhood/early adolescence.

AB A three-wave longitudinal study design with two 6-month intervals was used to examine the stability and change in Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problem behavior among children and adolescents referred to outpatient mental health services. Our results indicated high stabilities for parent ratings of child psychopathology across a 1-year interval. Additionally, we found decreases in the level of problem behavior. Interindividual differences in change were found for Total Problems and Externalizing behavior but not for Internalizing. While both the child's temperament and intelligence level and family relations were related to the initial level of parent-rated problem behavior, only intermediary stressful life events had an influence on the rate of change of child psychopathology.

AB The purpose of the present study was to identify clinically relevant subtypes of aggressive children based on measures of children's self-systems and significant others' perceptions of relationship quality. In a sample of aggressive second- and third-graders, a cluster analysis of these children's perceptions of support and significant others' (mother, teacher, and peers) perceptions of relationship quality revealed one subgroup in which self- and other-ratings were both below the group mean (concordant-negative), one in which both were above the sample mean (concordant-positive), and one in which they were discrepant (high child-report and low other-report). All three clusters were rated as more aggressive than controls. However, children in the discrepant group were rated as considerably more aggressive and delinquent than those in the two concordant clusters, who did not differ from each other on measures of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results are discussed from an attachment perspective and in terms of the clinical significance of this self-other discrepancy.

AB The Quebec Child Mental Health Survey (QCMHS) was conducted in 1992 on a representative sample of 2400 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years from throughout Quebec. Prevalences of nine Axis-I DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association, 1987) mental health disorders were calculated based on each informant (for 6-11-year-olds: child, parent, and teacher; for 12-14-year-olds: child and parent). Informant parallelism allows the classification of results of the demographic variables associated with disorders in the logistic regression models. This strategy applies to group variables (correlates of disorders) whereas informant agreement applies to individual diagnoses. Informant parallelism implies that results for two informants or more an in the same direction and significant. In the QCMHS, informant parallelism exists for disruptive disorders, i.e. in two ADHD regression models (child and parent) higher rates among boys and young children, and in three oppositional/conduct disorders regression models (child, parent, and teacher) higher rates among boys. No informant parallelism is observed in the logistic regression models for internalizing disorders, i.e. the patterns of association of demographic variables with anxiety and depressive disorders vary across informants. Urban-rural residence does not emerge as a significant variable in any of the logistic regression models. The overall 6-month prevalences reach 19.9 % according to the parent and 15.8 % according to the child. The implications of the results for policy makers and clinicians are discussed.

AB In this article, two studies that investigate the convergent validity of the Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale (BERS) are reported. In both studies, special education teachers of students identified as seriously emotionally disturbed completed the BERS and a second measure of child functioning. In the first study, the five BERS subscales and overall strength quotient were correlated with the five subscales and total score from the Walker-McConnell Scale of Social Competence and School Adjustment-Adolescent Version. Correlations were generally moderate to high. In the second study, the BERS was correlated to the five competence scales, the broad-band dimensions (i.e., Internalizing and Externalizing), and the Total Problem score of Achenbach's Teacher Report Form. Correlations were generally moderate to high for the competence scales and the externalizing dimension, but not for the internalizing dimension. Recommendations for use of the BERS are discussed.

AB Objective: To study social problem-solving skills in psychiatrically defined aggressive boys, starting from Dodge's social information-processing model. Method: Videotaped stimuli of problematic social situations and questions were presented to elicit responses that indicate boys' social problem-solving skills (encoding and interpretation of social cues, generation of possible responses, evaluation of responses, self-efficacy evaluation, and response selection). Boys aged 7 to 12 years with oppositional defiant or conduct disorder (ODD/CD) (n = 48), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 27), and both disorders (ODD/CD+ADHD) (n = 29) were involved as well as a normal control group (n = 37) and a psychiatric control group with internalizing disorders (n = 23). Results: When compared with normal controls, boys with ADHD, with ODD/CD, and with ODD/CD+ADHD encoded fewer social cues and generated fewer responses. Boys with ODD/CD and with ODD/CD+ADHD moreover were more confident in their ability to enact an aggressive response than normal controls. When ODD/CD boys and ODD/CD+ADHD boys were given the opportunity to select a response from various types of responses shown, they selected an aggressive response more often than normal controls. Thus, in ADHD boys social problem-solving was affected only in encoding and in the generation of responses, whereas in ODD/CD and ODD/CD+ADHD boys social problem-solving was affected throughout the process. Conclusion: For the further study of social problem-solving in aggressive children, it is essential to differentiate between children with ADHD and children with ODD/CD and ODD/CD+ADHD.

AB This study compared scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) for samples of youths in 3 out-of-home placements with varying levels of restrictiveness. Mean CBCL T scores were more than a standard deviation higher than mean YSR T scores on the broadband scales and about 2/3 of a standard deviation higher on the syndrome scales. The magnitude of the discrepancy varied between placements for several scales, with the least restrictive placements having the largest difference between CBCL and YSR ratings for the Externalizing scale. For the Internalizing scale, the discrepancy was larger for older youths (ages 15-18) than for younger youths (ages 11-14) These results support previous findings that in clinical samples, adults rate children's behavioral and emotional problems as more severe than do children themselves. This study extends prior research by demonstrating the occurrence of this discrepancy across a continuum of care.

AB The study discussed in this article investigated the effects of social and economic disadvantage on parent distress, family processes, and adolescent mental health in a longitudinal, multiethnic sample of 800 urban adolescents and parents. The findings support the hypothesis that poverty, life stressors, and isolation affect parent mood and disrupt family processes, which, in turn, are linked to adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems. The findings illustrate the importance of integrating an understanding of family processes and context in assessment and intervention directed at adolescent mental health problems.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of a Danish translation of the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ) for children in Danish children. The PCQ was translated using a translation-back-translation method. The subjects were 352 healthy children and 40 children with juvenile arthritis (JA), aged 8-17 y. Sixteen of the JA children were divided into a high-pain group (n = 7) and a low-pain group (n = 9). The results were factor analysed using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Clinical pain intensity was measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) from the Varni/Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire. Experimental pain was induced using a cold presser pain paradigm and outcome measures were pain intensity, pain discomfort and tolerance to cold presser pain. A seven-factor solution emerged as the most consistent factor structure. Four subscales, Seeking Social Support (SSS), Cognitive Distraction (CD), Externalizing (EXT) and Internalizing/Catastrophizing (INT), corresponded with the parallel subscales proposed by Reid et al. (Pain 1998; 76: 83-96). Two subscales, Positive Self-Statements (PSS) and Behavioral Distraction (BD), were composed of four of the five items from the previously proposed subscales. One subscale, Information Seeking/Problem Solving (IP), consisted of items from two subscales proposed by Reid et al., i.e. Information Seeking and Problem Solving. Internal consistencies of the subscales were acceptable, with reliability coefficients ranging from 0.60 (BD) to 0.83 (IP) and with test-retest reliabilities between 0.59 and 0.78. Low-pain JA patients showed significantly higher levels of ED than High-pain JA patients (p < 0.05). Greater utilization of PSS and ED was associated with less patient-reported present pain and less average everyday pain (p < 0.05-0.01), and greater utilization of INT was significantly associated with higher experimental pain intensity (p < 0.01). These preliminary findings provide support for the reliability and validity of the Danish modification of the PCQ in a Danish population and for the hypothesis that paediatric pain-coping strategies are associated with the intensity of clinical and experimental pain.

ID NATIONAL POLICY; ADOLESCENTS; CARE; SUPPORT; FAMILY; SYSTEM
AB Evaluated psychosocial differences between youth receiving mental health services in Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs; n = 79) as compared to youth receiving services from a program operating in 10 Baltimore schools (n = 186). Racial and gender differences were shown, with more African American youth and females in the School than CMHC sample. Multivariate analyses that controlled for these racial and gender differences failed to reveal significant effects, indicating comparable functioning on measures of life stress, violence exposure, family support, self-concept, and emotional/behavioral problems for youth from the two samples. However, particularly for those with internalizing disturbances, youth in the School sample were less likely to have received prior mental health services than youth from the CMHCs. Findings support the conclusion that school-based mental health programs are reaching youth who need mental health services, who otherwise may not receive them.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioral screening questionnaire that can be completed in 5 minutes by the parents or teachers of children aged 4 to 16; there is a self-report version for 11- to 16-year-olds. In this study, mothers completed the SDQ and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) on 132 children aged 4 through 7 and drawn from psychiatric and dental clinics. Scores from the SDQ and CBCL were highly correlated and equally able to discriminate psychiatric from dental cases. As judged against a semistructured interview, the SDQ was significantly better than the CBCL at detecting inattention and hyperactivity, and at least as good at detecting internalizing and externalizing problems. Mothers of low-risk children were twice as likely to prefer the SDQ.

AB In contrast to assessment approaches that conceptualize traits as generalized response tendencies, this research develops a conditional approach that conceptualizes traits as patterns of relations between contexts and behaviors. Using extensive observations of social interactions, this study investigated internalizing, externalizing, and mixed-syndrome children identified by T. M. Achenbach's (1993) measures. Children in these groups differed in the patterning of their responses to social contexts and in the likelihood of encountering them. Mixed-syndrome children showed a distinctive behavior pattern consisting of aggressive and withdrawn responses to nonaversive contexts. The results demonstrate how measures of overall tendencies confound person and environment influences and obscure differences between children that are revealed by contextualized measures. The need to incorporate contexts more fully into clinical assessment is discussed.

AB This study examined whether family risk factors predicted attrition in a prevention research project that incorporated procedures to increase retention in assessment and intervention activities. Analyses used data from 667 rural families collected over 4 waves and consisted of (a) young adolescent and parent reports of internalizing and externalizing problems, (b) observer ratings of distress in parent-child interactions, and (c) family socioeconomic status (SES). Analyses failed to identify any risk factors as significant predictors of intervention participation. Only SES was found to be significant as a predictor of assessment attrition. This SES result appeared to reflect an association between lower educational attainment and an increased likelihood of attrition.

AB Maladaptive behavior was compared across 23 people with Prader-Willi syndrome due to paternal deletion to 23 age- and gender-matched subjects with maternal uniparental disomy. Controlling for the higher IQs of the uniparental disomy group, deleted cases showed significantly higher maladaptive ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist's Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total domains as well as more symptom-related distress on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Across both measures, deleted cases were more apt to skin-pick, bite their nails, hoard, overeat, sulk, and withdraw. A dampening of symptom severity is suggested in Prader-Willi syndrome cases due to maternal uniparental disomy. Findings are compared to Angelman syndrome, and possible genetic mechanisms are discussed, as are implications for Prader-Willi syndrome and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.

AB We investigated the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on behavioral problems (i.e., not mediated by low birth weight) in 3-y-old offspring. We assessed behavioral problems in 1 377 2- to 3-y-old twin pairs (registered in the Netherlands Twin Register) with the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 2-3 y (CBCL/2-3) from Achenbach, Edelbrock, and Howell. Two to 3 y earlier (i.e., soon after the birth of the twins) we collected information about the smoking habits (i.e., "never," "sometimes," and ''regularly") of the mother during pregnancy. We analyzed the effect of maternal smoking on the CBCL total score and on several subscale scores for first- and second-born twins separately, and we adjusted for the possible confounding effects of birth weight, socioeconomic status, maternal age, and type of feeding (i.e., breast or bottle fed). There was a significant effect of maternal smoking on so-called ''externalizing" behavioral problems (e.g., oppositional, aggressive, overactive), but not on "internalizing" behavioral problems (e.g., withdrawn, depressed, anxious), in both first- and second-born twins. The enhanced "externalizing" problems were attributed predominantly to increased aggression. Although boys have higher externalizing and aggression scores than girls, the effect of maternal smoking was the same for boys and girls.

AB This study examined whether children's cognitive appraisal biases moderate the impact of stressful divorce-related events on psychological adjustment in 355 children ages 9 to 12, whose families had experienced divorce within the past 2 years. Multiple regression indicated that endorsement of negative cognitive errors for hypothetical divorce events moderates the relations between stressful divorce events and self- and maternal reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but only for older children. Positive illusions buffer the effects of stressful divorce events on child-reported depression and mother-reported externalizing problems. Implications of these results for theories of stress and coping, as well as for interventions for children of divorced families, are discussed.

AB This article is an extensive review of the psychological literature on cleft lip and palate and other craniofacial anomalies. Issues of parental acceptance, social competence, self-concept, emotional adjustment, and cognitive functioning are examined. Cumulative research suggests that many children with craniofacial conditions develop in a typical manner and do not experience psychological problems. However, a significant number of children (30% to 40% in most studies) experience difficulties with internalizing and/or externalizing problems, learning disorders, and social competence. A multifactorial model for examining the domains that are related to both psychological risk and protection is recommended. The need for multicenter studies that are prospective and clinically relevant is emphasized.

AB This study examined 2 aspects of friendship (presence and perceived qualities of a best friend) as moderators of behavioral antecedents and outcomes of peer victimization. A total of 393 children (188 boys and 205 girls) in the 4th and 5th grades (mean age = 10 years 7 months) participated during each of 2 waves of data collection in this I-year longitudinal study. Results indicated that teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors predicted increases in peer-reported victimization, but the relation of internalizing behaviors to increases in victimization was attenuated for children with a protective friendship. Victimization predicted increases in internalizing and externalizing behaviors but only for children without a mutual best friendship. Results highlight the importance of peer friendships in preventing an escalating cycle of peer abuse.

AB This study examined the relationship between housing status and depression, anxiety, and problem behaviors among children age 6 and older who were members of low-income, single-parent, female headed families. Participants were 80 homeless and 148 never homeless children living in Worcester, Massachusetts. Children in both groups had recently been exposed to various severe stressors. Mother-reported problem behaviors were above normative levels for both homeless and poor housed youths but self-reported depression and anxiety were not. Controlling for other explanatory variables, housing status was associated with internalizing problem behaviors but not with externalizing behaviors. Among homeless youths, internalizing behavior problems showed a positive but curvilinear relationship with number of weeks having lived in a shelter. Housing status was not associated with self-reported depression and anxiety. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for programmatic interventions and in light of recent welfare reform.

AB This longitudinal study examined the relation between family instability and the problem behaviors of children from economically disadvantaged families. Family instability was assessed when the children were ages 5 and 7 and included number of residence changes, changes of intimate caregiver relationships, and recent negative life events. The results showed direct concurrent relations between family instability and preschool children's externalizing behavior in the context of other family process variables, relations between subsequent family instability and Ist-grade children's internalizing behavior (i.e., with preschool behavior ratings controlled), and an effect for persistent instability across grade. Moderator effects were also found for child variables, including gender, temperamental adaptability, and prior externalizing scores.

AB Background: The present study compared anxious vs, depressed children's and adolescents' perceptions about their family environment. Methods: One hundred inpatient youngsters were interviewed for the study. Of these participants, 21 who met criteria for a depressive disorder without an anxiety disorder and 18 who met criteria for an anxiety disorder without a depressive disorder were compared on several self-report family measures. These measures included the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales-II (FACES-II), Family Strengths, and Social Support Questionnaire-Revised (SSQS-R). Results: Youngsters with depressive disorders reported having less pride in their families and perceived their families as being less adaptable to problems than did anxious children. Also, depressed children expressed lower levels of satisfaction with their social network than did anxious children. Limitations: The fact that our study only included reports from inpatient youngsters, families of anxious and depressed children may differ in the way family members relate to one another and in the way they deal with everyday problems. Conclusions: Based on the evidence obtained in this study, anxiety and depression may be two distinct internalizing disorders with specific family characteristics. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This study examined factors that influence family therapists to include children in or exclude them from therapy sessions. We hypothesized that therapist comfort, child problem type (internalizing vs, externalizing) family composition (one- vs. two-parent families); and presenting problem (child-oriented problem vs. adult-oriented problem) affect therapists' inclusion of children. A survey of clinical members of AAMFT found that half of the therapists excluded children on the basis of their comfort and that those who felt more comfortable were more likely to include children in sessions. Therapists included children more frequently in cases of an internalizing vs, an externalizing child, more with single-parent than two-parent families, and more often when the presenting problem focused on a child than on an adult. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This investigation examined gender differences in growth rates of externalizing and internalizing problems over a 5-year period, from early to late adolescence. It also examined the role of parental warmth, low hostility, and child management practices in inhibiting the growth trajectories of these developmental problems. Specifically, parenting was hypothesized to exhibit either a compensatory or buffering effect on age-related increases in adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Data were collected annually from 319 mothers, fathers, and their adolescent children (168 girls, 151 boys). The results demonstrated significant gender differences in growth trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems. Both the compensatory and buffering hypotheses were supported with regard to externalizing problems. A compensatory effect of parenting practices on levels of internalizing problems also was demonstrated.

AB The investigation assessed psychiatric symptoms in children at two time points and the persistence of symptom groups over an interval of 4 years. We studied 1128 children by using parental questionnaires (Rutter Scale A2) in both studies (mean age of the children was 8.5 years in Study 1 and 12.5 years in Study 2). There was a tendency for the frequency of symptoms to decrease over the 4-year period. Most of the symptoms reported in Study 1 were also found in Study 2. Sex differences were similar in both studies. Four factors were constructed out of the items on Rutter Scale A2, reflecting externalizing, hyperactive, internalizing, and poorly socialized behaviours. Externalizing, hyperactive, and internalizing behaviours were moderately persistent in the sample studied. The stability of externalizing and internalizing behaviour was high among deviant children. Hyperactivity was not persistent among deviant boys but highly persistent among deviant girls. Poorly socialized behaviour was not persistent in the sample studied, but girls scoring high in this factor in Study 1 scored high on the externalizing factor in Study 2.

AB This study evaluated the continuity of psychiatric symptoms from adolescence into young adulthood. The study sample consisted of 121 young adults born in 1975-76 in the region of Helsinki. The young adults were assessed in adolescence (age 14 to 15 years) with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self Report (YSR) and at the age of 20 to 21 years with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). The results showed that the self-reported psychiatric symptoms in adolescence significantly predicted the psychiatric symptoms of young adulthood. The internalizing symptoms were stronger predictors than the externalizing symptoms. The associations between the symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood were stronger for girls than for boys; the self-reported symptoms were stronger predictors than the parent-reported symptoms. It was concluded that especially the internalizing symptoms reported by adolescents themselves should not be regarded as normative but should be addressed and treated.

AB Children are referred to mental health centers for treatment of a wide variety of emotional/behavioral problems. Some are referred because of the problematic nature of their behavior (e.g., acting out) while others are referred due to the problematic behaviors inflicted upon them by themselves or others (e.g., abuse). Twenty-five girls (aged 6 thru II) who had been sexually abused were compared to a matched group who experienced other difficulties (Dysfunctional Families group). The psychological and behavioral characteristics of these two groups of preadolescent girls referred for treatment at a rural mental health center were compared using the Revised Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Mean scores for both groups fell above the 69th percentile on all nine CBCL scales. From 24% to 36% of the sexually-abused group fell,within the clinical range on the Depressed, Social Withdrawal and Hyperactive CBCL scales. Nevertheless, ratings were significantly higher for the Dysfunctional Families group on the broad-band Internalizing and Externalizing scales, indicating the tendency for these girls to exhibit more fearful, inhibited, and overcontrolled behaviors, as well as more aggressive, antisocial, and undercontrolled behaviors.

This review provides critical examination of research published during the past ten years addressing CD and its comorbid conditions, specifically Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder(ODD), and internalizing disorders. It is concluded that comorbidity varies with age, gender, informant, diagnostic criteria, and nature of the sample (clinical vs, epidemiological). Implications of comorbidity for etiology, diagnosis, treatment, law, and policy and preventive efforts in work with children and adolescents with CD are offered for school psychologists.

   Problem-avoiding behavior and increased self awareness were general risk factors for both sexes. Self-esteem was a general compensating factor for both sexes, too. Active coping strategies presented as a protective factor in girls for internalizing disorders. Problem avoiding behavior proved to be a vulnerability factor for internalizing disorders for boys and girls. Beyond this, it was shown that problem-avoiding behavior resulted in a greater increase in externalizing disorders in boys than in girls.

Satisfactory test characteristics (reliability and validity) were found for the total score and the-broad-band scales externalizing (exception: boys aged 12 to 17) and internalizing syndromes. Of the narrow-band scales the same was:true only for the scales aggressive (with restriction) and hyperactive. A principal component analysis of the CBCL, based on 559 referred children (aged 6 to 17 years), yielded three easily interpretable factors, which were labeled as conduct disorders, emotional disorders and developmental retardation.

AB This study examined early behavioral outcomes among young children of alcoholics (COAs) as a function of differences in subtype of paternal alcoholism. Participants were 212 children (106 girls and 106 boys, ages 3 through 8) and both of their biological parents. Families were characterized as antisocial alcoholics, nonantisocial alcoholics, and nonalcoholic controls. There were significant familiar subtype group differences on parent report measures of children's total behavior problems, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior, and on measures of children's intellectual functioning and academic achievement. In all instances, COAs had poorer functioning than controls. In the behavior problem domain, but not for the domain of intellectual functioning, children from antisocial alcoholic families had greater problems than children from nonantisocial alcoholic families. In addition to the subtype effects, boys had higher levels of behavior problems than girls in all three areas, and older children had more internalizing problems than younger children. Maternal functioning pertaining to lifetime alcohol problem involvement and antisocial behavior also contributed to child subtype differences in internalizing behavior. Results indicate that, even at very early ages, male and female COAs are heterogeneous populations that are distinguishable by way of familial subtype membership, as well as distinguishable from their non-COA peers. Thus, findings underscore the need to consider the heterogeneity of alcoholism when looking at its effects on child development.

AB Objective: This study evaluated the emotional and behavioral adjustment of parents and children within 3 months and 1 year after the discovery of child extrafamilial sexual abuse.
   Method: Ninety-two case parents (63 mothers, 29 fathers) and 56 children were compared to a nonclinical comparison group of 136 parents (74 mothers, 62 fathers) and 75 children. Parent adjustment was assessed using self-report measures while child functioning was assessed using a combination of child-, parent- and teacher-report measures.
   Results: Mothers, fathers and sexually abused children experienced clinically significant effects both initially and at 12 months post-disclosure. Children's perceptions of self-blame and guilt for the abuse and the extent of traumatization predicted their self-reported symtomatology at 3 months and 1 year post-disclosure. Child age and gender also significantly contributed to the prediction of many of the child outcome measures. No abuse-related variable was related to any child self-report measure. Mothers' satisfaction in the parenting role, perceived support and intrusive symptoms predicted their initial emotional functioning. Avoidant symptoms, child's internalizing behavior and mothers' initial emotional functioning were significant predictors of longer-term emotional functioning.
   Conclusions: Results emphasize the need to address children's abuse-related attributions and underscore the need to expand our focus beyond the child victims to the traumatized families. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recent behavioral genetic research emphasizes the nonshared family environment as an important contributor to psychological differences between siblings raised in the same family. Most studies of nonshared sibling experiences have examined the effects of differential maternal and paternal treatment separately and have not examined family-level processes. This study attempted to replicate the findings of McHale, Grouter, McGuire, and Updegraff and also of Volling in which relations between family patterns of differential parental treatment, child outcomes, and family functioning were examined. Questionnaire data were collected from 60 maritally intact families with toddler and preschool siblings. Congruence in mothers' and fathers' reports of differential treatment (i.e., similar treatment from both mother and father) was most frequent. Parents' reports of differential enjoyment were related to differential favoritism, whereas their reports of differential discipline were not. Both mothers and fathers were more likely to discipline the older sibling than the younger toddler. Sibling and marital harmony characterized families in which the father disciplined the older sibling more and mothers disciplined the two children equally. Incongruent patterns of differential favoritism (i.e., one parent treats the children equally while the other favors one child) were associated with marital distress. Preschool siblings exhibited greater internalizing and externalizing symptoms when both mothers and fathers disciplined them more than their younger sibling. The findings of this study with very young siblings differ in some respects from those with older children and suggest that future research needs to examine differential parental treatment as a developmental process across childhood.

AB This study examines longitudinal correlates of coparental and family group-level dynamics during infancy. Thirty-seven couples observed at play with their 8-11-month-old infants (15 boys, 22 girls) rated their child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and their own coparenting behavior 3 years later. Teachers also rated child behavior at the 3-year follow-up. Several significant relationships emerged between observed family process (high hostility-competitiveness, low family harmony, and high parenting discrepancies in the triad) at Time 1, and subsequent reports of child and coparenting behavior at Time 2. Larger parenting discrepancies at Time 1 predicted greater child anxiety as rated by teachers; greater hostility-competitiveness and lower harmony forecast higher child aggression. Time 1 family process continued to predict Time 2 aggression even after controlling for individual and marital functioning. Several links were also found between distressed family process and later parental reports of negative coparenting behavior. These parental reports of coparenting also explained unique variance in concurrent child behavior ratings. The significance of coparenting as a distinct family construct Is discussed.

AB This investigation assessed psychiatric symptoms in children reported by teachers at two points of time, and the persistence of symptom groups over an interval of four years. 1128 children born in 1981 (mean age 8.5 yr in Study 1 and 12.5 yr in Study 2) were studied, using the Rutter Scale B2 questionnaires in both studies. The frequencies of teacher-reported problems generally decreased over an interval of four years. Hyperkinetic symptoms were the most prevalent at both occasions. Gender differences were seen in both studies, boys outnumbering girls on most items. Symptoms were classified into five groups representing hyperactivity, internalizing and externalizing behaviour, relationship difficulties, and habits. The correlations of these different groups in Study 1 with those in Study 2 were moderate. Among deviant girls, correlations were high or moderate for externalizing, hyperactivity and internalizing behavior between the two studies. For deviant boys, high correlations between the studies were found for hyperactivity and habits. Externalizing behavior was also highly correlated with relationship difficulties among deviant boys. Two symptom groups (hyperactivity and relationship difficulties) and low performance level in Study 1 increased the probability of being deviant in Study 2 among boys, and four interactional terms (hyperactivity by relationship difficulties, hyperactivity by performance level, internalizing by performance level, and externalizing by relationship difficulties) also had an effect. Among girls, the probability of being deviant in Study 2 was increased if they were hyperactive or had relationship difficulties in Study 1. Furthermore, one interactional term (hyperactivity by performance level) had an impact on deviance among girls.

AB This study examined the effect of parental distress on mothers' and fathers' reports of children's emotional and behavioral problems. The subjects were the parents of 696 children aged 10 to 11 or 14 to 15 years living in two-parent families in the community. The study utilized an extended version of the model previously employed by Fergusson, Lynskey, and Horwood (1993) to examine the impact of maternal depression on mothers' reports of children's behavior. In the present study, the extended model was used to assess the impact of distress on reports of childhood externalizing and internalizing problems obtained from both mothers and fathers. The results suggested that distress had little influence on mothers' or fathers' reports of childhood behavior problems. It is concluded that in community studies the size of any bias in mothers' and fathers' reports of childhood behavior problems due to parental distress is likely to be very small and of little clinical significance.

Data were gathered on 104 mother-child dyads from low-income families when children were between 1 and 5 years of age. Difficult temperament, aggression, and noncompliance from 12 to 24 months, and externalizing and internalizing problems at 36 and 60 months, were assessed. The results provide evidence for the continuity of early behavioral and emotional problems and support for the early differentiation between internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications of the current findings for prevention efforts are presented.

AB The current study examined two questions. First, do internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavior each mediate the relations between parent psychopathology (alcoholism, antisocial personality disorder, and affective disorder) and growth in adolescent heavy alcohol use? Second, are there gender differences in these mediated pathways? Using latent curve analyses, we examined these questions in a high-risk sample of 439 families (53% children of alcoholic parents; 47% female). Collapsing across gender, adolescent-reported externalizing behavior mediated both the relation between parent alcoholism and growth in heavy alcohol use and the relation between parent antisociality and growth in heavy alcohol use. Parent-reported externalizing behavior only mediated the relation between parent antisociality and growth in heavy alcohol use in males. No support was found for internalizing symptoms as a mediator of these relations. Avenues are suggested for further exploring and integrating information about different mediating processes accounting for children of alcoholics' risk for heavy alcohol use.

Three possible models of this relation were tested using hierarchical analyses: the compensatory model, the challenge model, and the immunity/vulnerability model. participants were 140 children between the ages of 8 to 13.6 years. Inconsistent with all 3 models, negative life events were not associated with adaptive or internalizing behavior However, consistent with the compensatory model, both negative life events and protective factors contributed independently to the prediction of externalizing behavior. Also, a significant interaction was found in predicting internalizing behavior for the female-only sample showing girls with significant negative life events and social support demonstrating less internalizing behavior.

ID CHILDHOOD
AB Examined the psychological correlates related to experiencing the death of a parent, the main and interactive effects of sex, race, and age on youth distress and the degree of cross-informant correspondence on the outcome measures. The predominately minority sample included 80 bereaved youth and 45 nonbereaved youth. Youth and their legal guardians completed a battery of questionnaires, including measures assessing the youth's psychological symptomatology. Results revealed that bereaved youth manifested greater psychological and behavior problems than their nonbereaved counterparts on guardian-reported measures (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]). The clinical significance of parental death experienced during childhood is indicated by the magnitude of distress exhibited by the bereaved sample; almost one quarter of bereaved youth scored in the clinical distress range (T score greater than or equal to 63) on the CBCL Externalizing and Internalizing Distress scales. The effect of parental death on guardian-reported externalizing distress was moderated by race, such that distress levels did not significantly differ between bereaved and nonbereaved minority youth but did differ significantly among bereaved and nonbereaved nonminority youth. Finally, the degree of cross-informant agreement was relatively low but consistent with prior studies. Study implications for interventions with bereaved youth and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Comparing 36 disruptive behavior-disordered and 40 normal female adolescents, we found higher levels of anxiety and poorer performance on a measure of verbal fluency in the clinical sample. No group differences were found on a nonverbal measure of reflectivity nor on a measure of interpersonal cognitive problem solving. Nor was evidence found for an hypothesized anxiety-related performance decrement among disruptive behavior-disordered youth. However. anxiety induction facilitated performance across groups on interpersonal cognitive problem solving. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB The purpose of this study was to (a) examine the occurrence of psychiatric symptomatology in children and adolescents with spina bifida, (b) investigate the relationship between psychiatric features and aspects of disability, and (c) explore the impact of spina bifida and psychiatric status on family functioning. Fifty-four children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years (M = 12.94, SD = 3.59) were examined. Parents completed the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) and the Family Assessment Device (FAD). Using the CSI, a psychiatric diagnostic screen, 43% of the sample obtained one, and 13% obtained two or more screening cutoff scores reflective of psychiatric diagnoses. The two most prevalent diagnostic categories were Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (33%) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (13%). The sample as a whole exhibited elevated levels of clinical symptoms, with internalizing symptoms more prominent than externalizing symptoms. No differences in diagnostic categories or overall symptomatology were found based on age, gender, ambulation status, or lesion level. Overall symptom counts were positively correlated with scales on the FAD reflecting problematic family functioning (.42-.63). Results suggest that psychiatric symptomatology occurs at a high rate in children and youth with spina bifida. Although ADHD was the modal diagnostic category, the sample asa whole exhibited extensive psychiatric symptoms independent of specific diagnostic categories. Psychiatric symptoms were also associated with increased problematic functioning in families.

AB The hypothesis that children's appraisals mediate the relationship between interparental violence and adjustment was tested in a sample of 106 maritally violent families. Multiple regressions showed that interparental violence was a predictor of total problems, externalizing, internalizing, and anxiety far boys, and total problems and internalizing for girls. Appraisals of conflict properties mediated the relationship between violence and boys' total problems and externalizing, and girls' total problems and internalizing. Interparental violence was related to appraisals in gender-differentiated ways, particularly to increased threat for boys, and self-blame for girls. Further threat mediated the impact of violence on boys' anxiety, while self-blame mediated the relationship between violence and girls' internalizing.

AB Objective: To examine sibling perception of parental differential treatment in families of children with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), Down syndrome (DS), and nondisabled controls. Method: Sibling self-concept and social support were studied in the context of sibling perceptions of parental differential treatment and caretaker plus teacher evaluations of sibling behavioral adjustment. Measures were completed at time 1 and time 2. The effect of parental stress and the difficulty of the disabled child, as well as the sibling relationship, were considered. Results: For siblings of PDD children, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems identified by caretakers were evident at time 1 and more accentuated at time 2, at which time teachers also identified these difficulties. DS siblings were reported by caretakers and teachers to have only internalizing problems and only at time 2. These difficulties related to the perception for PDD siblings that they were preferred over their disabled sibling and for the DS sibling that their disabled sibling was preferred. Feelings of low competence predicted internalizing difficulties. Social support, especially over time, had a positive effect for all siblings, including the controls. Conclusion: The elucidation of specific mechanisms contributing to adjustment problems in the siblings of disabled children will allow for the development of specific preventive interventions.

AB To investigate how teenagers deal with conflict in romantic relationships, 869 high school students (mean age 16 range 14-19), experienced in romantic relations, completed a conflict tactic scale (adapted from Rands et at, 1981, and Straus, 1979). A principal components analysis revealed six factors, which in descending frequency of use were Compromise, Distraction Avoidance, Overt Anger, Seeking Social Support, and Violence Conflict tactics varied as a function of demographic characteristics. Specifically, older teens used Compromise more than younger; girls used Compromise and Overt Anger more and Distraction less than boys; African-Americans used Violence more and Compromise less than European-Americans, whereas Asian-Americans used Distraction and Avoidance more than European-Americans. To assess predictors of conflict tactics, teens also completed scales assessing self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965), immature and mature defense mechanisms (Araujo and Steiner, 1998, under review) and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors (Achenbach, 1966). Each of these was singly and jointly associated with the use of conflict tactics. In multiple regression analyses, the externalizing problem score best predicted Overt Anger and Violence in dealing with romantic conflict, the internalizing problem score best predicted Avoidance and Distraction whereas the mature defense mechanism score was the best predictor of seeking Social Support and Compromise.

AB The present study considered risk factors associated with suicidal ideation and the likelihood of a suicide attempt in a sample of 297 homeless and runaway youth from four Midwestern states. It was hypothesized that sociodemographic characteristics, family factors, suicide exposure, street factors, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior would be related to suicidal ideation and to the likelihood of a suicide attempt. It was also hypothesized that suicidal ideation would mediate the relationship between the other predictor variables and the likelihood of a suicide attempt. Over half the sample (53.9%) endorsed some level of suicidal ideation, and over one quarter (2.6.3%) attempted suicide in the year prior to the interview Univariate and multivariate results indicated that sexual abuse by a family member, knowing a friend who attempted suicide, drug abuse, and internalization were highly related to suicidal ideation. In the absence of suicidal ideation, sexual abuse, sexual victimization while on their own, and internalization were highly related to the likelihood of a suicide attempt. Finally, the hypothesized mediating effect was found for both sexual abuse and internalization.

AB This article examines the factors that affect the residential placement and service recommendations made by case managers for children who enter state custody. One hundred case managers in five case management units were trained to conduct and interpret psychosocial assessments for each child at intake. The case managers' use of the completed assessments in recommending residential placements and mental health services was examined for 633 children. The results indicate that case managers' placement and service recommendations were guided less by the assessments of each child's psychosocial functioning than by labels given to the children before entering custody (e.g., substance abuser) and their particular "pathways" into custody (e.g., the reason for custody).

AB This prospective study tested the assertion that psychopathology would predict both adolescent alcohol use and problem use, whereas socialization factors would predict only use, and explored mechanisms by which predictors led to problem use in a community sample of families (N = 216). Externalizing symptoms, parental alcoholism, peer influences, and parental support were indirectly related to negative consequences through their effects on use level. Externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, peer influences, and parental approval of use directly predicted consequences, controlling for the indirect effects through use level. internalizing pathology potentiated the relation between consumption and consequences, whereas parental support and control mitigated this relation. Collectively, findings provided mixed support for the assertion that psychopathology would predict both use and problem use, whereas socialization factors would predict only use.

AB A total of 23 boys met DICA-P manic symptom and clustering criteria in a diagnostic investigation of 233 outpatient boys between ages 6 and 10. In this manic-symptom group, the most frequently endorsed of an average of five manic symptoms were extreme mood changes, difficulty concentrating, feeling too 'up' to sit still, and racing thoughts. Comparison groups were 23 non-manic boys seen next in the investigation and 23 non-manic boys matched to the manic-symptom boys on symptoms of three comorbid disruptive disorders (ADHD, ODD and CD). Manic-symptom boys differed significantly from next-seen boys, but not from matched comorbid boys, in number of oppositional symptoms and pervasiveness of problems. Manic-symptom boys differed significantly from next-seen boys on six of eight mother-rated RCBCL factors. In contrast, manic-symptom and matched comorbid boys did not differ on any of eight RCBCL factors, which suggests that the RCBCL differences can be attributed to shared ADHD, ODD and/or CD. However, manic-symptom and matched comorbid boys tended to differ on RCBCL Anxiety/Depression. On the teacher-rated TRF, manic-symptom boys were rated higher than next-seen boys on four internalizing factors, and higher than matched comorbid boys on two of those factors, including Anxiety/Depression. Thus, manic symptomatology also predicted substantial emotionality, which was not a controlled comorbidity. The findings of this and other studies suggest that there is a mania dimension or syndrome, which may be an indicator of true bipolar disorder-or simply a marker for disruptive comorbidity, behavioral and emotional multimorbidity, or general severity of psychopathology.

AB This study tested the hypothesis that dually diagnosed adolescent substance abusers could be matched to effective treatments on the basis of their comorbid psychopathology. Specifically, patients with externalizing disorders would have better outcomes when treated with cognitive-behavioral group treatment (CBT), and subjects with internalizing disorders without comorbid externalizing disorders would fare better in interactional group treatment (IT). Thirty-two dually diagnosed adolescent substance abusers were randomized into two 12-week manual guided outpatient group psychotherapies: CBT and IT. At 3-month follow-up, no patient-treatment matching effects were identified. Adolescents assigned to CBT demonstrated a significant reduction in severity of substance use compared with those assigned to IT. Improvement in severity of family function showed a trend in favor of CBT. School function, peer-social relationships, legal problems, and psychiatric severity all showed a consistent nonsignificant direction in favor of CBT over IT. CBT appears to be a promising short-term psychosocial intervention for adolescents.

AB Objective: To examine the reliability of the French Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-2.25) in Quebec in light of other DISC-2 studies conducted in the National Institute of Mental Health's Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders Study. Method: Reliability was assessed for DSM-III-R disorders in a community sample comprising 260 parents of youths aged 6 to 14 years and 145 adolescents aged 12 to 14 years. The DISC was completed at home. The mean test-retest interval was 13.8 days for parents and 12.8 days for adolescents. Results: Parents' reports: Internal consistency was acceptable for a majority of disorders. The kappa coefficients were in the fair or good ranges except for depressive disorders and were higher for children than for adolescents, and intraclass correlations were higher than kappa coefficients. Adolescents' reports: Internal consistency was acceptable or nearly acceptable for a majority of disorders. The kappa coefficients were in the fair range, and intraclass correlations were higher than kappa coefficients. The kappa coefficients were significantly higher for the test-retest interval of 7 to 14 days than for 14 to 21 days for adolescents' reports of anxious disorders and internalizing disorders. Conclusion: The French DISC-2.25 shows acceptable internal consistency and fair to good test-retest reliability. Across DISC-2 studies, test-retest reliability of the parents' reports improved for anxiety and depressive disorders.

AB Objective: A developmental-ecological model was used to explore the psychological adjustment and peer social competencies of maltreated preschool children. Method: Enhanced research methods were used that included verification of maltreatment status, multiple-variable matching of comparison children, and contextually relevant assessment. One hundred eight Head Start children, of whom 54 were maltreated, participated. Assessment of social functioning included measurement of peer play interactions, global social skills, peer sociometrics, and teacher and parent ratings of behavior problems. Results: Findings indicated that maltreated children were significantly less interactive in peer play and overall exhibited less self-control and interpersonal skill in social interactions than nonmaltreated children. In addition, maltreated children were more likely than their nonmaltreated peers to receive low sociometric ratings and were found by both teachers and parents to display more internalizing behavior problems than comparison children. Conclusions: These findings indicate the importance of using developmentally sensitive research methods to inform contextually relevant interventions.

AB The relations between social behavior and daily patterns of a stress-sensitive hormone production were examined in preschool children (N = 75) attending center-based child care. Three behavioral dimensions, shy/anxious/intemalizing, angry/aggressive/extemalizing, and social competence, were assessed by teacher report and classroom observation, and their relations with 2 measures of cortisol activity, median (or typical) levels and reactivity (quartile range score between second and third quartile values) were explored. Cortisol-behavior relations differed by gender: significant associations were found for boys but not for girls. Specifically, for boys externalizing behavior was positively associated with cortisol reactivity, while internalizing behavior was negatively associated with median cortisol. Time of day of cortisol measurement affected the results. Surprisingly, median cortisol levels rose from morning to afternoon, a pattern opposite to that of the typical circadian rhythm of cortisol. This rise in cortisol over the day was positively correlated with internalizing behavior for boys. The methodological and theoretical implications of these findings for the study of the development of hormone-behavior relations are discussed.

AB The contribution of attachment, maternal reported stress, and mother-child interaction to the prediction of teacher-reported behavior problems was examined for a French-Canadian sample of 121 school-age children, Attachment classifications were assigned on the basis of reunion behavior with mother when the children were between 5 and 7 years of age. Maternal reported stress and mother-child interaction patterns were assessed concurrent to the attachment measure, whereas behavior problems were evaluated both at ages 5 to 7 and 7 to 9 years. Security of attachment significantly predicted the Likelihood of school-age behavior problems: Controlling/other children were most at risk for both externalizing and internalizing problems across both age periods. Younger ambivalent children presented clinical cut-off levels of externalizing problems, and older avoidant boys had higher internalizing scores. Patterns of maternal-reported stress and mother-child interaction differed across attachment groups and contributed to prediction of school-age behavior problems, partially mediating the relation between attachment and adaptation. Results support the importance of attachment in explaining school-age adaptation and validity of attachment coding for children of this age.

AB To explore the meaning and function of attachment organization during adolescence, its relation to multiple domains of psychosocial functioning was examined in a sample of 131 moderately at-risk adolescents. Attachment organization was assessed using the Adult Attachment interview; multiple measures of functioning were obtained from parents, adolescents, and their peers. Security displayed in adolescents' organization of discourse about attachment experiences was related to competence with peers las reported by peers), lower levels of internalizing behaviors las reported by adolescents), and lower levels of deviant behavior las reported by peers and by mothers). Preoccupation with attachment experiences, seen in angry or diffuse and unfocused discussion of attachment experiences, was linked to higher levels of both internalizing and deviant behaviors. These relations generally remained even when other attachment-related constructs that had been previously related to adolescent functioning were covaried in analyses. Results are interpreted as suggesting an important role for attachment organization in a wide array of aspects of adolescent psychosocial development.

AB Relative effects of membership in one of two family structures (married-never divorced vs. divorced-not remarried) and interparental conflict (high vs. low) on children's well-being (internalizing, externalizing behavior and trouble with peers) are examined for a sample of 10- to 17-year-old children and their parents from the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 618). Findings support the hypothesis that parental conflict influences children's well-being regardless of family structure. Children in high conflict families showed lower levels of well-being on all outcomes, but no well-being differences were found between family structure groups. Analyses of child gender indicated that parental warmth toward the child mediated the relationship between conflict and well-being for girls. For boys, both conflict and parental warmth were directly related to well-being independently, implications of results for theory, research and policy are discussed.

AB A large school-based sample of children in Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 were screened for disruptive behavior and subsequently assessed over a 5-year period for DSM-III-R symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other externalizing and internalizing behavior disorders. Parents completed structured diagnostic interviews in Years 1, 4, and 5, and teachers completed Behavioral Assessment for Children-Teacher Rating Scales behavioral ratings annually. For parent-derived diagnostic data, both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom groups declined from Year 1 to Year 4, with hyperactivity showing more significant decline. For teacher-rated behavioral dimensions, the Attention Problems scale declined from Year 1 to Year 3 and stabilized thereafter. The Hyperactivity scale showed stability during the first 3 years before declining in Year 4. Of those children diagnosed with ADHD in Year 1, 69% still met criteria for ADHD in either Year 4 or 5. Persisters were more likely to exhibit coexisting conduct disorder in Year 1 and oppositional defiant disorder in Years 1, 4, and 5. Parents of persisters reported more psychosocial adversity on measures of parenting and marital satisfaction.

AB This study examined the psychological consequences and secondary stressors associated with death of a parent. The sample (N = 116) consisted of 26 youths who had lost a parent to homicide, 45 youths who had lost a parent to natural death, and 45 nonbereaved youths. Youngsters completed face-to-face interviews, while their guardians completed measures assessing the children's functioning. Results based on both child and guardian reports indicated that parental death was associated with an increase in secondary stressors, regardless of the mode of death. Findings based on guardian reports also revealed that parental death was related to increased internalizing distress, and that parental death due to homicide was related to increased externalizing distress. Furthermore, secondary stressors mediated the parental death-child distress relation such that parental death led to an increase in stressors, which in turn led to increased child distress. Implications for secondary and tertiary preventive interventions are discussed.

AB Children showing a comorbid behavior pattern of hyperactivity-impulsivity-inattention and conduct problems (HIA + CP) were contrasted to children having only an internalizing and externalizing behavior pattern (I + E) and matched controls. Children displaying the HIA + CP behavior pattern were at greater risk on a number of outcome measures in social and academic domains beginning in Grade 3 and continuing into Grade 4. The most marked differences among the three groups were found on peer measures of rejection and friendship and teacher ratings of social skills. On average, almost two-thirds of the HIA + CP group were rejected by their peers compared to one-third of the I + E group and only 12.5% controls. Over 70% of the HIA + CP group had no reciprocated friendships from Grade 3 to Grade 4 compared to less than half of the I + E group and approximately one-fourth of controls. Contrary to much theorizing in the literature, the HIA + CP and I + E groups showed average levels of academic self-concept and did not differ from controls in on measures of social self-concept and academic self-concept and general self-esteem. These findings were interpreted in light of positive illusory biases and the established link between aggressive behavior and egotism. The current article offers partial support for Lynam's (1996) notion of the "fledgling psychopath."

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; PARENTS; COHESION; DYADS
AB We examined mothers', adolescents', and observers' discrepancies in perceptions of family interaction guided by two approaches to discrepancies: divergent realities approach, which explores discrepancies in different peoples' perceptions of the same family member's interaction, and perceived inequality approach which focuses on one individual's perception of discrepancies between family members' interaction. We used a video-recall procedure to assess the videotaped conversations of 79 rural working-class families. Results using the divergent realities approach support a developmental life-span perspective that posits that adolescents and mothers have different developmental tasks, which result in their viewing their behaviors with each other through different lenses. Adolescents viewed family interactions as more conflictual and perceived greater inequalities between themselves and their mothers. These discrepancies may contribute to the transformation toward more symmetrical and individuated parent-child relationships. Results using the perceived inequalities approach revealed that discrepancies between adolescents and their mothers were associated with adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

Within-person correlation between atopic symptoms and Child Behavior Checklist internalizing symptoms (CBCL-INT) was .21 (p < .001) for the total sample. Cross-correlations between atopy and CBCL-INT were .26 for monozygotic and .04 for dizygotic twins. A common and specific factor model applied to the data revealed that the cross-correlation between atopy and CBCL-INT was mainly due to genetic influences (77 % of the covariance). This study supports the hypothesis that there is a shared genetic risk for atopy and internalizing symptoms.

Higher levels of cohesion and routines attenuated the relation between hassles and both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, whereas high family conflict exacerbated the risk for adjustment difficulties. For externalizing behavior, higher levels of family adaptability protected children from the impact of daily hassles.

AB The purpose of this study was to quantify and to identify predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology after traumatic brain injury (TBT). Fifty children aged 6 to 14 years, hospitalized after TBI, were assessed soon after TBI regarding injury severity and preinjury psychiatric, socioeconomic, family functioning, and family psychiatric history status; neuroimaging was also analyzed. Psychiatric assessments were repeated 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Only 2 of 46 (4%) subjects with at least one follow-up assessment developed PTSD. However, the frequency with which subjects experienced at least one PTSD symptom ranged from 68% in the first 3 months to 12% at 2 years in assessed children. The presence of an internalizing disorder at time of injury followed by greater injury severity were the most consistent predictors of PTSD symptomatology. It is apparent, therefore, that PTSD and subsyndromal posttraumatic stress disturbances occur despite neurogenic amnesia. These problems should be treated, particularly if symptoms persist beyond 3 months.

ID CHILDREN; ANEMIA; PAIN
AB Objective: Investigate the hypothesis that family competence in addressing challenges associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) contributes to adolescents' adjustment.
   Method: During routine clinic appointments, 80 adolescents (M age = 14.4 years) and their parents independently completed the Self-Report Family Inventory (SFI), which assesses family competence, and measures of adolescent adjustment problems. Information related to disease severity was obtained from clinic files.
   Results: Regression analyses controlling for demographic and medical variables revealed that higher family competence was associated with fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors by the adolescent; these relations were particularly true for younger adolescents and for girls. Parental reports of somatic complaints in girls were predicted by parental ratings of family competence.
   Discussion: Interventions for adolescents with SCD should be family-centered and should focus on strengthening the family's ability to manage stressors associated with parenting an adolescent with a chronic illness.

AB Evidence is provided for the structural and functional divergence of two dimensions of social isolation: withdrawal (i.e., voluntary withdrawal from peers) and isolation (i.e., active isolation by peers). Whereas withdrawal refers to a child's isolation from the group due to anxiety about social interaction, isolation refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers. Using a sample of school-age boys and girls (N = 236), the divergence is demonstrated between these dimensions in two ways. First, confirmatory factor analysis showed these dimensions to be interrelated but empirically distinct constructs. Second, these hva dimensions differed significantly in their predictive outcomes, with isolation being a better predictor of externalizing behavior, and withdrawal being a better predictor of internalizing behavior.

AB Objective: To explore the influence of 1-year changes in child obesity and maternal psychopathology on changes in child psychological problems.
   Design: Hierarchical regression models were used to predict child psychological change, with demographic variables, maternal psychological change, and child percentage overweight change as predictors.
   Setting: Pediatric obesity research clinic.
   Participants: Clinic sample of 116 obese 8- to 12-year-old children and their mothers. Interventions: Family-based behavioral weight-control program.
   Main Outcome Measures: Child psychopathology nas assessed via mother-reported Child Behavior Checklists and maternal psychopathology was determined by standardizing scores on the Cornell Medical Index and the Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised.
   Results: Significant improvements were observed in child percentage overweight (-20.1% overweight), and child and maternal psychopathology. Improved maternal psychopathology accounted for a significant amount of variance in improvements in the Child Behavior Checklist total Problems Scale and internalizing and externalizing problems subscales. Decreased obesity accounted for a significant amount of variance in improvements in the Total Competence scale and, somatic complaints, social problems and social competence subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist. Significant interactions of child obesity change by sex were found for Total Problems and externalizing scores. The interactions were due to girls with greater obesity reduction showing greater improvement in Total Problems, whereas boys with greater obesity reduction showed less improvement in externalizing problems.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the multidimensional nature of psychosocial functioning in obese children and call attention to multiple avenues for intervention to improve their psychosocial functioning.

AB The genetic and environmental influences on problem behaviors at two assessment points, three years apart, and their stability were studied in a sample of international adoptees, initially aged 10 to 15 years. Parents of III pairs of adopted biological siblings, 221 pairs of adopted nonbiological siblings and 1484 adopted singletons completed the Child Behavior Checklist (75 pairs, 154 pairs and 1080 singletons respectively at second assessment). At first assessment, genetic factors accounted for more than 50% of the variance in the Externalizing, Aggressive Behavior, Attention Problems and Social Problems scales. Shared environmental influences explained 40% of the variance in the Total Problem scale and less for all other scales. Nonshared environmental influences were most important for the Internalizing scale and its subscales, and for the Thought Problems and Delinquent Behavior scales. At the second assessment, genetic factors explained most of the variance in the Total Problem, Externalizing and Aggressive Behavior scales, while nonshared environmental influences explained most of the variance in all other scales. Shared environmental influences explained 33% of the variance in the Internalizing scale and less for the other scales. The stability of the Externalizing scale over time was caused mostly by genetic factors, while nonshared environmental factors mostly caused the stability of the Internalizing scale.

ID CHILDREN; FAMILIES
AB The present study examined the difference between young people who terminated treatment prematurely and who continued in treatment. One hundred and thirty-four young people (ages 12 to 24 years) who attended a community-based psychotherapy centre for psychoanalytic psychotherapy between 1 April 1993 and 31 March 1996 comprised the sample. It was predicted that drop-outs would consist of younger adolescents who were referred, who show a high score for externalizing problems such as aggression and delinquency and a low score for internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression. It was also predicted that continuers would be elder, self-referred and show a high score for internalizing problems and a low score for externalizing problems. The results indicated significant differences between drop-ours and continuers: drop outs were younger, had greater externalizing problems, school problems and presented with moderate to severe hyperkinetic or conduct disorder. Continuers mere older, had fewer externalizing problems, were self-referred and were likely to be created by supportive therapists. Since age was the most significant predictor of attendance, the sample was separated into younger adolescents and older adolescents and the same analyses repeated. In the younger group ethnic minority status, and being treated by a supportive therapist predicted continuing in treatment and a diagnosis of conduct disorder predicted premature termination. The clinical implications of the present findings for the delivery of psychotherapy services to young people are discussed.

AB Examined the role of socioecological factors (family functioning and socioeconomic variables) in predicting behavioral and cognitive adaptation in children with sickle cell syndromes (SCD). Participants included 74 African American children and adolescents with SCD and their primary caretakers. Outcomes included internalizing and externalizing behavior symptoms, as rated by caretakers, as well as intellectual abilities and academic achievement, as assessed by individually administered standardized instruments. Family functioning consisted of both caretaker adjustment and family environment (i.e., family adaptability and cohesion). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that caretaker psychological adjustment predicted externalizing behaviors, while family environment (i.e., adaptability and cohesion) predicted neither behavioral nor cognitive functioning. Socioeconomic variables alone predicted intellectual abilities and academic achievement and also contributed to the prediction of child behavioral adaptation. Results are discussed in terms of relevant sociocultural issues and implications for family-level prevention and intervention.

ID AMERICAN-CHILDREN; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Nonreferred adolescent samples for ages 12 to is from Jamaica and the United States were compared via syndromes, syndrome groupings, and total problem scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher's Report Form. and Youth Self-Report. No significant total problem score differences were found between Jamaican and U.S. adolescents in reports by any informants. However, adolescents in both societies reported significantly more problems than their parents or teachers. Jamaican adolescents received and endorsed higher problem ratings for the Withdrawn and Somatic Complaints syndromes and on internalizing scores. These findings suggest that by virtue of the time spent in their society, Jamaican adolescents may develop problems their country facilitates. The results further indicate the need to test whether similar CBCL-based syndromes and syndrome groupings are evident in the Jamaican youth population. If such groupings are identified for Jamaican adolescents, different clinical cutpoints on some scores may be needed for Jamaican than for U.S, adolescents.

ID POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; FOLLOW-UP; RISK; ATTACHMENT; PREDICTORS;
   RESILIENCE; QUALITY; SCHOOL; HOME
AB The relation of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms to problem behaviors in a nonclinical sample of preschool children was examined. Data were collected from 46 women, their husbands, and their 4-year-old, first-born children. Observed maternal restrictive and punishing behavior and attachment security of the child were considered additional sources of risk for externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. Different predictors for child externalizing and internalizing behaviors were identified via hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and maternal restrictive and punishing behavior emerged as salient predictors of child internalizing behaviors. For externalizing behaviors, there were significant gender differences: For girls, maternal depressive symptoms made a significant contribution to the model; the model far boys was not significant. The results perhaps reflect different etiological pathways for externalizing and internalizing behaviors, supporting the suggestion that those behaviors are distinct clinical phenomena, even among very young children. The findings also suggest that nonclinical levels of parental symptomatology show systematic relations to children's problem behaviors.

DT Article
ID CHILDHOOD; ADULTS; ACHIEVEMENT; DISABILITY; DEFICIENCY; DISORDER
AB Objectives: To measure the prevalence of behavioral and learning problems among children with short stature and to assess the effect of growth hormone (GH) treatment on such problems.
   Study design: A total of 195 children with short stature (age range 5 to 16 years, mean age 11.2 years) were tested for intelligence, academic achievement, social competence, and behavior problems before beginning GH therapy and yearly during 3 years of treatment. Children were classified as having growth hormone deficiency (GHD) when GH responses to provocative stimuli were <10 ng/mL (n = 109) and as having idiopathic short stature (ISS) when >10 ng/mL (n = 86). A normal-statured matched comparison group was tested at the baseline only.
   Results: Seventy-two children in the GHD group and 59 children in the ISS group completed 3 years of GH therapy and psychometric testing. Mean IQs of the children with short stature were near average. IQs and achievement scores did not change with GH therapy. Child Behavior Checklist scores for total behavior problems were higher (P < .001) in the children with short stature than in the normal-statured children. After 3 years of GH therapy these scores were improved in patients with GHD (P < .001) and ISS (P < .003). Also, there was improvement in the scores of children in the GHD group in the internalizing subscales withdrawn: P < .007; somatic complications, P < .001; anxious/depressed, P < .001) and on the 3 components of the ungrouped subscales (attention, social problems, and thought problems, each P = .001). Larger effects were observed in the GHD group than in the ISS group.
   Conclusions: Many referred children with short stature have problems in behavior some of which ameliorate during treatment with GH.

AB Objective. To assess the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the Norwegian version of the childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) and to examine the relationship between disability, disease severity, and psychosocial factors in patients with early juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA),
   Methods. Physical functioning was assessed by the CHAQ in 109 patients (median age 6.6 years, range 1.0-16.6) with JRA and a median of 4 months' (range 2-23) disease duration. Eighty-three patients were reassessed after a median of 6 months' (range 3-21). Psychosocial functioning was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (n = 39).
   Results, The internal consistency of the CHAQ was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83). The test-retest and parent-patient correlations were high [intraclass correlation coefficients 0.85 (n = 18) and 0.75 (n = 20), respectively, p < 0.001]. The CHAQ correlated moderately with number of tender, swollen and mobility restricted joints, morning stiffness, C-reactive protein, gain, and patients' and physicians' global assessments [correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.55 to 0.30, p < 0.01], but weakly with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.17, NS). The CHAQ also correlated with low levels of social competence (r = -0.49, p < 0.05) and high levels of internalizing behavior problems in the patients (r = 0.43, p < 0.01) and low education levels of;the mothers (r = -0.31, p < 0.01). Pain (beta 0.45, p < 0.001), number of swollen joints (beta 0.31, p < 0.001), and internalizing behavior problems (beta 0.45, p < 0.01) were predictors of disability. The median CHAQ changed from 0.25 to 0.00 (p < 0.05) in the 41 patients who improved, from 0.31 to 0.85 (p < 0.05) in the 18 patients whose condition was worse, and from 0.50 to 0.59 (NS) in the 24 patients whose condition was unchanged after 6 months. The effect size of the change was small (0.28) in those who improved and moderate (0.54) in those who became worse.
   Conclusion. The Norwegian version of the CHAQ is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring disability in children with early JRA. Pain,joint inflammation, and psychosocial factors are the most important correlates of disability and the CHAQ is sensitive to clinical change.

AB This study examined: 1)the relationship between marital aggression and mother's behavior during problem-solving interactions with her child, and 2) the contribution of these two variables to the prediction of children's emotional and behavioral problems. Forty-three mother-child dyads and 35 of the children's teachers were included in this investigation. Marital aggression was assessed by mothers and children; mother's problem solving behavior with children was assessed using both questionnaire and observational measures; and child emotional and behavioral adjustment was assessed by mothers, children, and teachers. The pattern of results obtained suggests that mother's involvement in aggressive marital conflict is significantly related to angry and power assertive maternal behavior during problem-solving interactions with children. Both marital aggression and mothers' reported use of power assertion during problem-solving interactions with children contributed uniquely to the prediction of mother reports of child externalizing behavior problems, while only mothers' reported use of power assertion contributed significantly to the prediction of mother reported child internalizing behavior problems. Only marital aggression, however, contributed significantly to the prediction of child and teacher reports of child problems.

AB Objective: To determine whether physiological severity of asthma is associated with increased psychological symptoms in children. Method: Participants were 337 children, aged 7 to 19 years (mean 11.9, SE 0.13), and a parent of each child. Children's asthma severity was rated by experienced pediatric asthma specialists using current guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Children filled out the Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory. Parents reported on their child's medical history, completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) about their child, and completed the Pennebaker Inventory of Linguid Languidness as a measure of their own physical symptoms. Results: Child-rated anxiety symptoms were unrelated to asthma severity or to markers of asthma functional morbidity. Parental ratings of internalizing symptoms in their children were related to severity. Parent physical symptoms explained 10.2 % of the variance in CBCL Internalizing symptoms, and asthma severity added an additional 6.7 % to the variance. Conclusions: Asthma severity may be a more salient stressor to parents, who in turn report higher levels of child internalizing symptoms for children with severe asthma, than to children themselves. Contrary to prior hypotheses, children with severe asthma did not rate themselves as having higher levels of anxiety than those with mild or moderate asthma or than standardized norms.

AB Objective: To examine the association between chronic headaches and DSM-lll-R-defined psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, in a population-based sample of children and adolescents. Method: 1,013 children aged 9 to 15 years in the Great Smoky Mountains Study were evaluated annually over a 3-year period using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a child and parent diagnostic psychiatric interview, Headaches that lasted at least 1 hour and occurred at least once a week during the 3 months prior to the interview were studied. Results: Girls with depression and anxiety disorders had a significantly greater prevalence of headaches than girls without an internalizing disorder. This association was not found for boys. Conduct disorder was significantly associated with headaches in boys. Each of these associations was constant with age. Conclusions: This study suggests that a distinct gender difference exists between boys and girls in the associations between headaches and psychopathology. Carroll's theory of dysfunction in central pain regulation as an underlying cause of depression is discussed in relation to the proposed serotonergic dysregulation common to headaches, depression, anxiety, aggression, and pain.

ID EARLY-CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; SURGERY
AB The increased use of surgical intervention for intractable epilepsy during childhood has resulted in a critical need for information concerning possible cognitive and behavioral changes in pediatric patients after surgery. In this pilot study, comprehensive neuropsychologic evaluations were completed on nine children who had a temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy before 16 years of age. Performances before and after surgery were compared using cognitive and behavioral measures. Repeated measures analysis of variance did not indicate differences in performance on the basis of laterality of surgery, although the number of left (n = 5) vs right (n = 4) temporal resections was small, Paired comparison t tests, which included all patients, did not suggest marked changes in cognitive functioning after surgery, although decreases in delayed verbal memory were evident, Positive effects on quality of life during the first year after surgical intervention were suggested by reduced internalizing symptoms and increased social interaction. Replication of this study is recommended with a larger number of patients and multicenter collaboration. (C) 1998 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To examine associations between heart period variability (HPV) and psychopathology in young urban boys at risk for delinquency, a series of 69 7-11-year-old younger brothers of adjudicated delinquents received a standardized psychiatric evaluation and an assessment of heart period variability (HPV). Psychiatric symptoms were rated in two domains: externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. Continuous measures of both externalizing and internalizing psychopathology were associated with reductions in HPV components related to parasympathetic activity. These associations could not be explained by a number of potentially confounding variables, such as age, ethnicity, social class, body size, or family history of hypertension. Although familial hypertension predicted reduced HPV and externalizing psychopathology, associations between externalizing psychopathology and HPV were independent of familial hypertension. Psychiatric symptoms are associated with reduced HPV in young urban boys at risk for delinquency.

AB Objective: To examine the predictive accuracy of antisocial behaviours among 4- and 5-year-old children for problem behaviours 4 years later (ages 8 and 9 years).
   Method: Data from the Ontario Child Health Study (1983) and Follow-Up (1987) are used. Predictive accuracy is conceptualized using positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. The predictive accuracy of early antisocial behaviours for the 1987 outcomes is examined overall, by gender, by variable thresholds of predictor and outcome by gender and by using contextual variables alone or in combination with antisocial behaviour recorded in 1983.
   Results: The predictive accuracy of 1983 antisocial behaviour for 1987 outcome is generally modest and differs by gender (better for boys for externalizing disorder [PPV = 41%, sensitivity = 57%]; better for girls for internalizing disorder [PPV = 13%, sensitivity = 80%]; better for boys for conduct problems [PPV = 54%, sensitivity = 21%]). Using either gender-specific thresholds or gender-neutral thresholds does not alter predictive accuracy in a consistent way, nor does the use of a single contextual variable. Use of a cumulative risk index increases PPV but decreases sensitivity.
   Conclusions: The predictive accuracy of antisocial behaviour in 4- and 5-year-old children over 4 years in a nonclinical community population is limited. The clinical, research, and policy implications of this work are discussed.

AB Objective: To develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a scale termed the Maternal Worry Scale (MWS) designed to measure maternal worry about children with chronic illnesses.
   Method: The sample consisted of 140 mothers of young children (mean age 8.2 years, 64% female) with a chronic illness (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, or sickle cell disease). Maternal worry, depression, and anxiety, as well as information about the child's health and behavior, were assessed through structured interviews.
   Results: The MWS had good internal consistency (alpha = .94) and test-retest reliability (r = .84). Analyses indicated a single-factor structure for the MWS. Estimates of construct validity were quite positive: the MWS was moderately correlated with parental depression (r = .34-.39), anxiety (r = .27), and maternal report of child behavior problems (r = .25 [externalizing], r = .46 [internalizing]).
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the MWS is a useful, reliable, and valid scale for measuring worry of mothers raising children with chronic health conditions.

AB Objective: To study psychiatric and behavioral morbidity associated with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: A consecutive series (n = 24) of children aged 5 through 14 years whet suffered a severe TBI were matched to subjects who sustained a mild TBI and to a second matched group who sustained an orthopedic injury with no evidence of TBI. Standardized psychiatric, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessments were conducted on average 2 years after injury. Results: Severe TBI was associated with a significantly higher rate of current."novel" psychiatric disorders (15/24; 63%) compared with children with mild TBI (5/24; 21%) and orthopedic injury (1/24; 4%). Higher effect sizes were evident for child and adolescent self-report of internalizing symptoms rather than externalizing symptoms, for parents' report of overall behavior and internalizing symptoms rather than externalizing symptoms, and for teachers' reports of overall behavior and externalizing symptoms rather than internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: Severe TBI is a profound risk factor for the development of a psychiatric disorder. Survivors should be assessed for organic personality syndrome, which is the most common psychiatric disorder after this type of injury.

Infernal consistency was good for the second-order factors "Internalizing Problems," "Externalizing Problems, " and the "Total Problem Score," whereas it was less satisfactory for almost all syndrome scales. In general, internal consistency coefficients were slightly lower in the Swiss sample than in the U.S. sample. Correlations between the syndrome scales resulted in good replications of the original findings as obtained in the U.S. normative sample. Effect analyses showed that sex is more important than age and nationality (indigenous vs. immigrant subjects). However, all effects were small. Correspondence between YSR and Child Behavior Checklist scores showed that agreement between adolescents' and parents' reports is relatively small.

ID BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS; CHILDREN; HORMONE; TRIAL
AB Objective. To present longitudinal data on the psychological profile of a cohort of girls with and without Turner syndrome (TS) treated for 3 years with growth hormone (GH).
   Methods. Among a sample of 283 children with short stature, 37 girls with TS were recruited at 27 US medical centers. Of the original cohort, 22 girls with TS, 13 girls with isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and 12 girls with idiopathic short stature were followed through 3 years of GH therapy. All were school-age, were below the 3rd percentile for height, had low growth rates, and were naive to GH therapy. Psychological tests (the Wide Range Achievement Test and the Slosson Intelligence Test) were administered to the clinical groups within 24 hours of their first GH injection and yearly thereafter. Control subjects were 25 girls with normal stature matched for age and socioeconomic status, who were tested only at baseline. One parent of each subject also completed the Child Behavior Checklist for that subject.
   Results. At baseline, the clinical groups had more internalizing behavioral problems, had fewer friends, and participated in fewer activities than did the control subjects. The groups did not differ in mean IQ or academic achievement, but: the TS group did have more problems in mathematics achievement. Height and growth rate significantly increased in the clinical groups over the 3 years of GH therapy, but IQ and achievement scores did not. Significant linear reductions were noted in both Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Problems after GPI treatment, with the TS group having fewer behavior problems before and after GH treatment than did the GHD-idiopathic short stature group. Decreases in specific Child Behavior Checklist subscales, including attention, social problems, and withdrawal, also were seen in the clinical groups aff:er GH therapy.
   Conclusions. The comprehensive treatment of girls with TS should include educational and behavioral interventions in addition to traditional medical therapies.

ID VICTIM PROBLEMS; MIDDLE
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to assess bullying and psychological disturbance among 5,813 elementary school-aged children.
   Method: The data consisted of information given by the parents, teachers, and children themselves (Rutter A2 Scale, Rutter B2 Scale and Children's Depression Inventory). Children involved in bullying (as bullies, bully-victims, and victims) were compared to other children.
   Results: More boys than girls were found to be involved in bullying. Bully-victims scored highest in externalizing behaviour and hyperactivity, and they themselves reported feelings of ineffectiveness and interpersonal problems. Victims scored highest in internalizing behavior and also psychosomatic symptoms, and they themselves reported anhedonia. Some gender differences in psychiatric symptomatology were also found. Children involved in bullying, especially children who both bullied and were bullied themselves, were psychologically disturbed. More children involved in bullying than others were referred for psychiatric consultation. The probability of being referred was highest among bully-victims (6.5 fold for males and 9.9 for females when compared to children not involved in bullying).
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that bullying is a common phenomenon among children who are psychologically disturbed. Bullying also elevates the probability of being referred for psychiatric consultation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We examined 10:30 a.m. salivary cortisol levels in twenty-four 2-year-old children at home, and then at several points during transition into preschool. Week 1, Weeks 6-9, and the 1st week following a month-long holiday break. Cortisol levels did not increase when the children first started school as compared to either home or later school levels. Cortisol levels were correlated across similar, but not across dissimilar, psychosocial contests. Home levels were correlated with more shy, anxious, internalizing behavior, while the response to starting school was correlated with more assertive, angry, and aggressive behavior. Behavior was assessed using parent temperament reports, teacher reports, and observational measures. We conclude that HPA activity as indexed by salivary cortisol measures is differentially associated with behavior in familial and novel contexts. Consistent with our prior work, shy/anxious behavior is not significantly associated with elevations in cortisol when young children enter new social situations. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB In this study we examined relations between adolescents' perception of parental care and intrusiveness and the abilities-achievement gap. Cognitive abilities and academic achievement were assessed for 200 Israeli 10th graders. Representations of maternal and paternal care and intrusiveness and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were self-reported. Gender differences were found for the abilities-achievement gap. Boys' achievement in mathematics and language was significantly lower than could be expected from abilities in these domains. Representations of maternal care predicted achievement while aptitude and socioemotional symptoms were controlled and moderated the relations of abilities and achievement. Paternal representations were unrelated to abilities or achievement. Among boys, maternal intrusiveness had a unique contribution to the prediction of achievement, above and beyond abilities, socioemotional symptoms, and maternal care. The relevance of the findings to cognitive and attachment perspectives on adolescent achievement is discussed.

DE smoking; behavior problems; pregnancy; children
ID PREGNANCY; VALIDITY
AB Objective. Previous studies have linked maternal smoking during pregnancy with behavioral disturbance in children. However, additional evidence is needed to address the causality of the relationship. The present study analyses result from an Australian cohort of 5342 5-year-old children whose mothers were recruited early in pregnancy.
   Methods. Smoking history was gathered for prepregnancy, first clinic visit (FCV), late pregnancy, and when the child was 6 months and 5 years of age. Behavior problems at the age of 5 were assessed using a modified Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) shown to have high agreement with the complete CBCL. This resulted in the formation of three scales: internalizing; social, attentional and thought; and externalizing behavior problems, which were then dichotimized at the 90th percentile in each case. Logistic regression was used to model these outcomes as a function of maternal smoking at five time points during which it was assessed. A series of models explored the effect of additional adjustment for confounding. The predictors of attrition (29.5%) throughout the cohort were also identified by multivariate modeling.
   Results. The final analysis was carried out on a cohort of mother-child pairs for whom data and child behavior outcomes were complete. The mean age of children was 5 years, 6 months with a range from 4 to 6 years. The mean age of mothers at the time of birth of the child was 25 years, with a range from 13 to 47 years. Mothers lost to follow-up were more likely to be younger, single, and less well-educated than those who continued participation, although maternal smoking was not an independent determinant.
   Unadjusted analyses showed strong associations between externalizing child behavior and maternal smoking during pregnancy and at the 5-year follow-up, with relative risks (RRs) up to 2.6 for children of women smoking at least 20 cigarettes per day at the first antenatal clinic visit. A clear dose-response relationship existed in most relationships with higher levels of smoking being associated with higher rates of externalizing behavior problems. Weaker relationships occurred for internalizing behavior and social, attentional and thought behavior problems.
   Multivariate analysis of the timing in more detail that. the association between maternal smoking and child behavior problems persisted, although the evidence for dose-response diminished. Moreover, it was primarily associated with smoking as determined by questions asked at the FCV (RR = 1.52, 2.03, 2.16) for 1 to 9, 10 to 19, and greater than or equal to 20 cigarettes per day, respectively, compared with nonsmoking and secondarily by smoking determined at the 5-year follow-up (RR = 1.52, 1.87, 1.29) for 1 to 9, 10 to 19, and 20 cigarettes per day respectively, compared with nonsmoking. This association appeared to be independent of a wide range of possible confounders such as maternal age, education, social class, marital status and mental health, gestation at FCV, complications during pregnancy, the child's sex, gestational age at birth, and age at last follow-up. Adjustments were also made for the mother's employment since birth, family structure, and maternal mental health at the time of the CBCL assessment. Associations between externalizing behavior problems and maternal smoking at other times, and those between other behavioral problems examined and maternal smoking were not significant.
   Conclusion. Although previous studies have found evidence for an association between maternal smoking and child behavior problems, the strength of this study lies in its size, its detailed and consistent measurement of maternal smoking, and its ability to control for many social and biological factors linked to maternal smoking and child behavior.
   The statistical evidence for a causal relationship between maternal smoking as measured at the first antenatal clinic visit and the development of externalizing behavior in children is strongly suggestive, because of the specificity of effect and timing, and the adjustment for a comprehensive range of other risk factors. An alternative explanation that mothers who smoke might be inclined to report behavior problems differently was considered unlikely because the effect was specific to externalizing behavior and the major exposure occurred 5 years before the reported behavior. Additionally, the existence of a factor (beyond those already included in the analysis) that might be related to both behavior problems and any propensity to misreport smoking seems sufficiently implausible to rule out misclassification of smoking status as another alternative explanation for the findings.
   The timing of the relationship between smoking in pregnancy and externalizing behavior problems, and its independence of small for gestational age status at birth, suggests that placental insufficiency and oxygen deprivation are not important in the pathogenesis. It is possible that nicotine in the fetal brain derived from maternal smoking may alter gene expression and the nature and function of the nicotine receptors developing in early pregnancy. The presence of a separate, although slightly weaker, association between concurrent maternal smoking and externalizing child behavior suggests both biological and social explanations, including a direct psychopharmocologic effect of nicotine through passive smoking.
   Assuming the relationship to be causal, it is estimated that maternal smoking in early pregnancy may account for 25% of externalizing (aggressive) behavior while maternal smoking when the child is 5 years old may account for an additional 16%. These findings provide further support for antismoking programs in pregnancy and in young family settings.

AB The relations of teachers' and parents' reports of children's shyness (i.e., social inhibition) at ages 6-8, 8-10, and 10-12 years to dispositional regulation, emotionality, and coping were examined. Shyness was positively related to internalizing negative emotion, coping by doing nothing, and, for parent-rated shyness, behavioral inhibition/nonimpulsivity, attention focusing, and avoidant coping; it was negatively related to positive emotionality, instrumental coping, seeking support from teachers (at younger ages), and for teacher-rated shyness, attentional control. Often prediction held over several years and/or across reporters. Parent-reported internalizing negative emotion at age 4-6 predicted shyness at ages 6-8 and 8-10, hut primarily for children low in attention shifting. Teacher-rated shyness was related to low social status; parent-rated shyness correlated with boy's adult-rated social status at age 4-6 and with style of social interaction, particularly for girls. The relation between parent- and teacher-reported shyness decreased with age. The overall pattern of findings was partially consistent with the conclusion that parent-rated shyness reflected primarily social wariness with unfamiliar people (i.e., temperamental shyness), whereas teacher-rated shyness tapped social inhibition due to social evaluative concerns.

AB A family process model was tested that linked maternal education, maternal religiosity, and the adequacy of family financial resources to cognitive and psychosocial competence in the mothers' children. The sample included 156 6- to 9-year-old African American children living in single-mother-headed households in rural areas, 82% of whom lived in poverty. The distal variables of maternal education, maternal religiosity, and adequacy of financial resources were linked with the proximal variables of "no nonsense" parenting, mother-child relationship quality, and maternal involvement in the child's school activities. The proximal variables were, in turn, indirectly linked with children's cognitive competence, social competence, and internalizing problems through their association with the children's development of self-regulation.

AB Moderational and mediational models of the relationships among appraisals, interparental conflict, and children's adjustment were tested in a sample of 174 families with a school-age child. Parents rated children's exposure to interparental conflict and internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems. Children completed questionnaires regarding their appraisals of their parents' conflicts, including frequency and intensity, perceived threat, control, and self-blame, as well as measures of anxiety and depression. Results overall demonstrated more consistent support for the moderational than mediational hypotheses. Appraisals of conflict properties, threat, self-blame, and perceived control moderated the effects of interparental conflict on externalizing, total problems, and anxiety in boys. Conflict properties, threat, self-blame, perceived control, and self-calming acted as moderators of internalizing in girls.

AB Belsky, Steinberg and Draper (Child Development 1991, 62, 647-670) predicted that early childhood stress or conflict in the family environment would be associated with childhood behavioural symptoms, early puberty and early, less discriminate sexual behaviour. Their theory was tested in a retrospective self-report survey in 28 daughters (aged 12 to 15) and 21 mothers. In daughters, earlier menarche correlated with more family stress in a late childhood (age 7 to 11); more conflict with mother in early childhood (birth to age 6); more rejection from and less closeness to mother throughout childhood (birth to age 11); more anxiousness and internalizing symptoms (anxiousness/depression) in late childhood (age 7 to 11); earlier age at dating boys; and more boyfriends. An alternative interpretation is considered based on genetic transmission of maternal characteristics. (C) 1998 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

ID READING-DISABILITY; CLASSROOM-BEHAVIOR; CHILDREN
AB Our objective was to delineate the educational and behavioral differences between learning disabled children with and without attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A restrospective (TROHOC) multimeasure comparative design was employed. Parents' and teachers' questionnaires (ANSER system) pertaining to attention-activity, associated behaviors, and scholastic achievements were compared. Parents' questionnaires failed to distinguish between the two groups. Teachers' questionnaires were significantly more sensitive. Significant correlations between educational achievements and attention-activity and associated behaviors scores among children with learning disabilities were evident, no such correlations were found in the group with learning disability with ADHD. The factor analysis identified different educational and behavioral aggregates with language related difficulties and externalizing behaviors more typically aggregated in the learning disabled group with ADHD and recall deficit and internalizing/neurotic behaviors in the group with learning disability only. ADHD appears to be an associated comorbidity and not necessarily a specific learning deficit. However, children with learning disability with ADHD possibly have a different underlying neurocognitive pattern than their peers with learning disabilities only.

AB The psychosocial adjustment of 87 inner-city African American children 6-11 years old whose mothers were HIV infected was compared with that of 149 children from a similar sociodemographic background whose mothers did not report being HIV infected. Children were not identified as being HIV infected. Mother reports, child reports, and standardized reading achievement scores were used to assess 4 domains of adjustment: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, cognitive competence, and prosocial competence. The results indicated that, on average, children from both groups had elevated levels of behavior problem scores and low reading achievement scores when compared with national averages. Relative to children whose mothers were not infected, those whose mothers were HIV infected were reported to have more difficulties in all domains of psychosocial adjustment. Potential family processes that may explain the findings are discussed.

AB Over 2500 preschool children from across the United States were screened for emotional and behavioral problems using the 3 stage, multiple-gating procedures of The Early Screening Project (ESP). Preschool teachers were asked to nominate, rank, and rate children in their classroom on both externalizing and internalizing behavioral dimensions. The behaviors were then independently confirmed through direct observations in natural preschool environments. Gender disparities also were addressed. Significant differences were found between children who did and did not exceed the ESP's normative referral criteria. The ESP can minimize both the time and cost of preschool assessments while providing accurate screening for emotional and behavior problems with less gender bias. Additionally, the ESP can promote early prevention interventions for all young children.

AB The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; T. M. Achenbach, 1991), when used to assess the behavior of children with diabetes, may contain confounds because some behavioral items can have a physiologic etiology, and may skew reports of behavioral disturbance.
   Methods: Two techniques were used to disentangle possible scoring confounds in the behavioral ratings of children with and without diabetes: (1) the Somatic Complaints scale was deleted, or (2) Diabetes Items, identified a priori with 89% agreement by nine medical personnel, were deleted.
   Results: As expected, with traditionally scored protocols, children with diabetes obtained higher Internalizing and Total Behavior Problem scores than controls. This group difference persisted whether the Somatic Complaints scale or the Diabetes Items were deleted.
   Conclusions: Compared to controls, children with diabetes obtained mildly elevated scores on six of the eight CBCL scales, regardless of scoring method.

DE social competency; preschool children; assessment
ID HEAD-START; AMERICA
AB The purpose of the present stud, was to investigate the reliability and validity of the published teacher version of the preschool Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) for Head Start children. Three major questions were addressed. First, does the published SSRS replicate the factors found in the test manual, which are based on the tryout version of the SSRS? Second, is there empirical support for two independent Social Skills and Problem Behaviors domains? Third, do sociometric indices of peer acceptance provide convergent and divergent validity for SSRS constructs! The SSRS was administered to a sample of 943 urban Head Start children. Exploratory factor analyses replicated the Internalizing and Externalizing factors from the tryout version but did not replicate prosocial factors. Self-Control, Interpersonal Skills, and Verbal Assertion factors were found, but they were not identical to the tryout version factors. Higher-order factor analyses revealed only one social competency dimension with Social Skills and Problem Behaviors factors inversely related. Sociometric data did not provide convergent and divergent validity for SSRS factors. Implications for the continued development of the SSRS include further study of the relationship between the Social Skills and Problem Behaviors scale, concurrent validity, and the preschool patent version.

AB Two models of the relationship between socioemotional behavior and verbal abilities are compared: Social Adaptation and Social Deviance. The socioemotional integrity of 17 children with specific language impairment (SLI) and 20 unaffected children who were age-matched (AM) was examined using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher's Report Form (TRF) at kindergarten and first grade. All CBCL and TRF syndrome scale means for both groups were within normal limits. Significant group x respondent interaction effects were observed; teachers, and not parents, rated the children with SLI as having more social acid internalizing behavioral problems than their AM peers. Significant differences between groups were restricted to internalizing, social, and attention problems. Very little congruence or stability over time was observed in the clinical ratings. The outcomes support a Social Adaptation Model of socioemotional behavior and language impairment. Implications for the clinical management of children with SLI are discussed.

AB Objective: To compare the types and rates of psychiatric symptoms of young Central American and Cambodian refugees, as reported by both parents and children, and to examine parent-child agreement in reporting symptoms. Method: Interviews were conducted with 123 children aged 8 to 12 years and 158 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years and their parents. Parents assessed psychiatric symptoms via the Child Behavior Checklist, the 8- to 12-year-olds responded to the Dominic, and the adolescents answered the Youth Self-Report. Means of Internalizing and Externalizing scores were compared on the basis of ethnic origin, parent's sex, and child's sex, as were the Spearman correlation coefficients of parents' and children's ratings. Results: The Cambodian parents reported few symptoms in their children, and the Central Americans reported almost as many symptoms as did parents in U.S. clinical samples. The Cambodian children reported less symptoms than the Central Americans, but the interethnic difference was not significant in the adolescents' self-reports. Parent-child agreement varied considerably by sex and ethnic origin of the informant. Conclusions: The results underscore the need to involve multiple informants in assessing psychiatric symptoms of refugee children in spite of the difficulties inherent in field research with this population. They also show that data on multiple informants gathered from Western samples are not universally valid.

AB Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the 2-factor 2nd-order structure of T. M.

Results supported T. M. Achenbach's model in which the broadband Internalizing factor was represented by the narrowband Withdrawn, Somatic, and Anxious/Depressed syndromes, and the broadband Externalizing factor was represented by the narrowband Delinquent and Aggressive syndromes. Consistent with T.M. Achenbach's model, the remaining narrowband syndromes (i.e., Social, Thought, Attention) loaded equally on both broadband factors and should not be included in scoring either Internalizing or Externalizing. Fit of the I-factor model also was good and only slightly poorer than the 2-factor model. Therefore, an overall score would be appropriate as a measure of global problem behavior.

AB The factor structure of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI; M. Kovacs, 1992) was evaluated in a large community sample of 1,777 children and 924 adolescents. There were 5 first-order factors (Externalizing, Dysphoria, Self-Deprecation, School Problems, and Social Problems) for the child group; the adolescent group yielded the same 5 factors plus a 6th factor (Biological Dysregulation). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the stability and replicability of the obtained factor structures. Both samples yielded 2 higher order factors-Internalizing and Externalizing. The factors were compared with previous CDI factors identified for clinical (B. Weiss et al., 1991) and community (M. Kovacs, 1992) samples. Other notable findings included more boys reporting high scores (17 and above) on the CDI among the child sample, whereas, among adolescents more girls reported high scores (17 and above) on the total CDI as well as higher scores on the biological dysregulation factor.

AB The relation of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) to symptoms of internalizing disorders, Tourette's disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder was examined using both within- and between-family tests of association. The sample consisted of clinic-referred children.and their siblings and controls and their siblings. Between-family association was examined via the association of DAT1 genotypes with disorder symptoms in the population. Symptoms of all eight disorders increased with a greater number of 10-repeat DAT1 alleles. Using a quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT), linkage and within-family association was indicated by increased symptoms in children who received 10 repeat alleles from heterozygous parents relative to children who received 9 repeat alleles. Four disorders were associated with DAT1 using the QTDT: generalized anxiety, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive, and Tourette's. The effects of comorbidity were investigated by repeating the same between- and within-family analyses on residual scores, with any effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms removed. Although the residuals were associated less strongly with DAT1 than were the original scores, three disorders continued to show association both between and within families: generalized anxiety, Tourette's, and social phobia.

ID MICTURITION HABITS
AB Objective To analyse prospectively the incidence of behavioural disorders and the subjective views of children with urge incontinence (defined by detrusor instability, sudden urge symptoms and frequent micturitions) and voiding postponement (characterized by delayed micturition in typical situations and a low voiding frequency) according to an identical protocol in a paediatric and a child psychiatric unit.
   Patients and method Ninety-four consecutive or randomly selected children aged 5.0-10.9 years with either voiding postponement (52) or urge incontinence (42) were examined prospectively using an intelligence test (CFT1 or CFT20), the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL 4/18), the ICD-10 child psychiatric diagnoses and a structured interview.
   Results In the groups from both centres combined, those postponing voiding had a significantly higher incidence of externalizing behavioural symptoms (31% vs. 8%; P<0.01) and total problems (37% vs. 13%; P<0.05) in the clinical range (CBCL), and a higher rate of at least one ICD-10 child psychiatric diagnosis (54% vs. 29% P<0.05) and of expansive disorders (31% vs. 5%; P<0.01). The incidence of children with behavioural symptoms was lower in the paediatric centre, being exceptionally low among urge incontinent children (only 6%, CBCL). In contrast, from the children's subjective appraisal, there were no significant differences in concepts, explanations and implications of wetting; 79% of urge incontinent children and 64% of those postponing voiding suffered emotionally from the adverse effects of wetting. Only a minority (3% vs. 6%) saw any advantages at all.
   Conclusion Children with voiding postponement had a significantly higher incidence of behavioural problems, especially expansive/externalizing behaviour, 3-4 times higher than in the normal population. Children with urge incontinence had a significantly lower incidence of behavioural problems, mainly emotional/internalizing behaviour, that was only slightly higher (1-2 times) than that in the normal population. Because of selection, similar trends but lower incidences were found in the paediatric setting, with very few problems among urge incontinent children. In contrast, the children's subjective views did not differ; disadvantages associated with emotional suffering were reported by all children.

AB Aims The aim of the present study was to determine which medical variables were predictors of long-term behavioural/emotional outcome after surgical correction for congenital heart disease in infancy and childhood.
   Methods The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to predict parent-reported behavioural/emotional problems in 125 10-15 year-old congenital heart disease children from: (1) biographical status (2) medical history (3) heart surgery (4) short-term post-operative course and (5) number of heart operations and (6) extra cardiac concomitant anomalies.
   Results Higher CBCL total problem scores at follow-up were associated with a greater number of heart operations and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (<22 degrees). 'Internalizing problems' were associated with a greater number of heart operations, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, a short gestational age, low systemic oxygen saturation, and older age at surgical repair. 'Externalizing problems' were associated with a greater number of heart operations only.
   Conclusion Several medical variables were significant predictors and can be used to identify those congenital heart disease children who are at risk of long-term behavioural/emotional maladjustment.

AB The latent structure and stability of 10 common mental disorders were examined in a birth cohort at ages 18 and 21. A 2-factor model, in which some disorders were presumed to reflect internalizing problems and others were presumed to reflect externalizing problems, provided a more optimal fit to the data than either a 1- or a 4-factor model. To a significant extent, persons in the sample retained their relative positions on the latent factors across the 3-year period from age 18 to age 21. Results offer potential clarification of the meaning of comorbidity in psychopathology research by suggesting that comorbidity may result from common mental disorders being reliable, covariant indicators of stable, underlying "core psychopathological processes."

AB Objective: To test the relation between multiple family stressors and young children's adjustment problems. Method: Longitudinal data were collected on 300 low-income, ethnically diverse, male subjects beginning during infancy and followed until age 31/2. Results: General support was found for the family stressor hypothesis. Stressor groups at 18 and 24 months predicted Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing and Internalizing factors at 24 and 42 months, including clinically elevated problems. Conclusions: The results confirm and extend previous investigations of the family stressor hypothesis. They suggest that psychological evaluations of young children need to be ecologically based, including intra-and extrafamilial factors that appear to cumulatively increase risk of behavior problems.

AB A new measure of coping, the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ), is presented and validated in two studies of children and adolescents. Factor analyses of data from healthy children and adolescents supported eight hypothesized subscales (information seeking, problem solving, seeking social support, positive self-statements, behavioral distraction, cognitive distraction, externalizing, internalizing/catastrophizing) and three higher-order scales (approach, problem-focused avoidance, emotion focused avoidance). The subscales and higher-order scales were internally consistent. The pain coping scales were correlated in the expected directions with children's appraisals of, pain controllability, self-rated coping effectiveness, emotional distress when in pain, and among high school students, pain thresholds and functional disability. The structure and internal consistency of the PCQ were replicated in a sample of children and adolescents experiencing recurrent pain (headache, arthritis), and their parents. Relations between child- and parent-ratings of children's coping were moderate (median r = 0.34). Higher levels of emotion-focused avoidance were related to more emotional distress (both samples), less coping effectiveness (headache sample), and higher levels of pain (arthritis sample). Higher levels of approach coping were related to less disability (headache sample). Other relations between approach and distraction coping and the outcome variables were generally not significant. The PCQ is a promising instrument for assessing children's pain coping strategies. The items are simple and relatively few, making it useful for assessing coping across a wide age range. It can be administered to children as young as 8 years of age in approximately 15 min. (C) 1998 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB To assess the psychological consequences of a single congenital heart defect, we tested intellectual function, self-perception, "body image", child psychiatric symptoms and the family climate in 21 boys and 10 girls, at a mean age of 13.2y, on average 11.5y after surgery for transposition of the great arteries. Where applicable, test norms were used for comparison. WTSC-R IQ tended to be slightly lower than that of the general population. Self-perception, as reflected on the "I think I am" test, was normal. "Body image" as measured by the "Draw-a-man" test was poor in the boys, but did not show a relationship with any other test tapping mental health. Six children (19%) had clinically significant child psychiatric symptoms, which is slightly more than expected, and were overrepresented in patients with poorer cardiac function. Five of these represented "internalizing" disorders. The patients' families scored higher than expected on the family climate "chaos" subscale, which has been demonstrated to be associated with the development of psychiatric symptoms. Overall, however, the children and their families were regarded as socially and psychologically well-functioning.

Using teacher and peer ratings of socioemotional adjustment, target groups were formed; there were 22 AVG, 13 WTH, and 10 AGG children. Mothers and children were observed interacting in a variety of situations. Compared to mothers of AVG children, mothers of WTH children were behaviourally and psychologically overcontrolling (made more imperative compliance commands and were less responsive to their children), while mothers of AGG children were behaviourally undercontrolling (made fewer requests and play directives).

AB This study examined the relationship between number of family risk factors during adolescence and three areas of psychosocial adjustment (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and academic achievement) in adolescence and 6 years later in young adulthood. Risk factors examined included parental divorce, interparental conflict, maternal physical health problems, maternal depressive mood, and mother-adolescent relationship difficulties. The findings indicated both concurrent and long-term associations between number of family risk factors and psychosocial adjustment; however, the results differed based on area of adjustment examined and whether concurrent or longitudinal data were considered. Furthermore, a steep increase in adjustment difficulties occurred when number of risk factor's increased from three to four. The results are discussed in the framework of four hypotheses which were tested, and clinical implications are delineated.

   Results: Mean CBCL Total Problems scores were not different for the PWS and MHC groups, but differences were found for several of the CBCL subscales. Patterns of correlations among CBCL scales were similar in both groups, although coefficients were generally higher in the PWS group, indicating higher comorbidity or co-absence of CBCL syndromes in children and adolescents with PWS. Personality profiles were specific for Internalizing and Externalizing problems of children and adolescents with PWS.

Compared to general norms for these two rating scales, the child survivors of ALL showed significantly more problems in terms of social competence and internalizing behavior. Adolescents exhibited more difficulties in these areas than younger children. Externalizing behavior composite scores were elevated on the CBCL but not on the BASC. There were no differences found between children who had received cranial irradiation and those who had not, and age at diagnosis did not affect current functioning. Children receiving special education services scored significantly lower overall than those who were in regular classes.

AB Cicchetti and Lynch have conceptualized ecological contexts as consisting of nested levels with varying degrees of proximity to the individual. These levels of the environment interact and transact with each other over time in shaping individual development and adaptation. With a sample of maltreated (n = 188) and nonmaltreated (n = 134) children between the ages of 7 and 12 years, this investigation employed a 1-year longitudinal design to conduct an ecological-transactional analysis of the mutual relationships among community violence, child maltreatment, and children's functioning over time. Indicators of children's functioning were externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and self-rated traumatic stress reactions, depressive symptomatology, and self-esteem. Either full or partial support was obtained for the study's primary hypotheses. Rates of maltreatment, particularly physical abuse, were related to levels of child-reported violence in the community. In addition, child maltreatment and exposure to community violence were related to different aspects of children's functioning. Specific effects were observed for neglect and sexual abuse and for witnessing and being victimized by violence in the community. Finally, there was evidence that children and their contexts mutually influence each other over time. Results were discussed within the framework of an ecological-transactional model of development.

AB A developmental-organizational perspective was employed to explore underlying risk for problem behavior in children with language learning disabilities. The independent and relative influences of social discourse and social skills on problem behavior were examined in 50 children with language learning disabilities (LLD) and 50 control children (children without LLD) aged 8 to 12 years. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that when examined independently, both impaired social discourse skill and poor social skills accounted for the negative effect of LLD status on children's problem behavior. When social discourse and social skills were examined simultaneously in relation to problem behavior, social discourse no longer retained its predictive value. This result suggests that children's impaired social interactional functioning is central to the development of behavioral symptomatology. However, the importance of social discourse cannot be overlooked, given the significant correlation between social discourse and social skills ratings. Though these results are correlational in nature, it is argued that the impaired communicative competence of some children with LLD may contribute to poor social skills that ultimately manifest themselves as more clinical problem behaviors characterized by internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. Finally, differences were confirmed in social discourse performance, social skills, and problem behaviors between the children with LLD and the control group children. Findings emphasize the importance of the routine assessment and monitoring of broader social discourse skills, in addition to social competence, in children with LLD.

AB This study examined the cross-situational patterns of behavior problems shown by children in rural and urban communities at school entry. Behavior problems exhibited in home settings were not expected to vary significantly across urban and rural settings. In contrast, it was anticipated that child behavior at school would be heavily influenced by the increased exposure to aggressive models and deviant peer support experienced by children in urban as compared to rural schools, leading to higher rates of school conduct problems for children in urban settings. Statistical comparisons of the patterns of behavior problems shown by representative samples of 89 rural and 221 urban children provided support for these hypotheses, as significant rural-urban differences emerged in school and not in home settings. Cross-situational patterns of behavior problems also varied across setting, with home-only patterns of problems characterizing more children at the rural site and school-only patterns of behavior problems characterizing more children at the urban sites. In addition, whereas externalizing behavior was the primary school problem exhibited by urban children, rural children displayed significantly higher rates of internalizing problems at school. The implications of these results are discussed for developmental models of behavior problems and for preventive interventions. (C) 1998 Society for the Study of School Psychology.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between psychopathology and health care utilization beginning in the preschool (ages 2 to 5) years. Method: Five hundred ten preschool children were enrolled through 68 primary care physicians. The test battery used for diagnoses included the Child Behavior Checklist, a developmental evaluation, the Rochester Adaptive Behavior Inventory, and a videotaped play session. Consensus DSM-III-R diagnoses were assigned using best-estimate procedures. Frequency of primary care visits was established through 1-year retrospective record review; mothers estimated total visits and emergency department (ED) use. Results: Logistic regression models showed that a DSM-III-R diagnosis was related to increased ED use but not primary care or total visits. Greater functional impairment was associated with fewer primary care visits and more ED visits. Total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problem scores were associated with increased primary care and total visits; ED visits were associated with increased total and internalizing problems. Child's health status consistently correlated with utilization. Conclusion: There is a consistent relationship between health care use and child psychopathology beginning in the preschool years.

AB Although studies have explored the predictors of changes in rank ordering of adolescent substance use over time, little research has specifically examined the predictors of substance use escalation and de-escalation. The present study tested whether social influences, individual differences, and symptomatology predicted substance use escalation and de-escalation over a 9-month period in a community sample of adolescents (N = 390). Peer substance use, negative affectivity, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms prospectively predicted substance use escalation. Only peer substance use and parental control predicted de-escalation. Results provide support for the assertion that social influences, individual differences, and symptomatology predict substance use escalation and de-escalation but suggest that the relations differ for alcohol use versus illicit substance use and for the prediction of escalation versus de-escalation.

AB Several studies reveal a heightened risk for anxiety and other mental disorders in the offspring of patients with panic disorder and other anxiety disorders. Data on the specific type of transmitted disorders, however, are inconsistent. We investigated the specificity of the relationship between parents' and children's psychopathology. We assessed current and past mental disorders in 5- to 15-year-old children of patients with panic disorder (CPAN, n = 34), children of parents with no diagnosis of a mental disorder (CCON, n = 30) and children of animal phobics (CPHOB, n = 23) using a structured diagnostic interview according to DSM-III-R criteria. Diagnoses are based on parent as well as child information. CPAN and CPHOB had significantly more often at least one current mental disorder than children of the healthy control parents. Compared to CPHOB and CCON, children of panic patients had significantly more severe diagnoses and more often multiple diagnoses. Furthermore, a higher rate of internalizing anxiety disorders, particularly separation anxiety disorder, was found in CPAN. In contrast, children of animal phobics showed a higher rate of externalizing anxiety disorders. Our results suggest a specific transmission of such disorders that share common features of parental symptomatology.

AB Guided by the emotional security hypothesis, this study examined whether links between marital relations and child;en's adjustment were mediated by children's emotional security, as evidenced by their emotional reactivity (e.g., vigilance, distress), regulation of exposure to parent affect (avoidance, involvement), and internal representations in the context of interparental relations. Multiple methods and contexts were used to assess 6- to 9-year-olds' emotional security in response to standardized, simulated conflicts involving parents. Latent variable path analysis supported a theoretical pathway whereby marital dysfunction was linked with adjustment problems as mediated by response processes indicative of emotional insecurity in relation to parental conflicts. Emotional reactivity and internal representations were most closely linked with marital relations and child adjustment, especially with regard to internalizing symptoms. The importance of understanding children's emotional security in the context of the marital subsystem is discussed.

AB Recent reviews of research on child and adolescent psychopathology have highlighted the consistently high rates of co-occurring dimensions of psychopathology, particularly between internalizing and externalizing disorders, and have suggested that further research examining the causes of co-occurring syndromes is needed. The authors examined this question ina national sample of 720 same-sex adolescent siblings between 10 and 18 years of age consisting of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, full siblings, half siblings, and unrelated siblings. Composite measures of adolescent and parent reports and observational measures of depressive symptoms and antisocial behavior were subjected to behavioral genetic models that examine the genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in each dimension as well as in the co-occurrence between dimensions. Results indicated that approximately half of the variability in depressive symptoms and antisocial behavior is attributed to genetic factors; shared and nonshared environmental influences were also significant. The cooccurrence of depressive and antisocial symptoms was explained by genetic and shared and nonshared environmental influences. Specifically, approximately 45% of the observed covariation between depressive and antisocial symptoms could be explained by a common genetic liability. Results are interpreted in light of contribution of genetic studies to debates on child and adolescent psychopathology.

AB This article describes a conceptual and data-analytic model for characterizing different levels of common and specific features of child psychopathology: common features, which differentiate psychopathology from normality; broadband-specific features, which differentiate internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety, somatization) from externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, hyperactivity); and narrowband-specific features, which differentiate different narrowband syndromes (e.g., anxiety from somatization; hyperactivity from aggression) within each of the broadband syndromes. As an illustration of the model, data for 6 cognitive variables (e.g., global self-worth, causal attributions) are related to 6 psychopathology domains (e.g., aggression, depression) in a sample of 204 children, It is suggested that common features may be related to severity of psychopathology, whereas specific features may be more related to differentiation of psychopathology.

ID CHILDREN
AB The relationship between age of asthma onset and behavioral adjustment was analyzed using data from a longitudinal prospective investigation of 150 children identified prenatally as at genetic risk for developing asthma (the W. T. Grant Asthma Risk Study). The children's development and asthma status were monitored regularly for 6 years. Mothers were interviewed yearly using the Behavioral Screening Questionnaire (BSQ). Children who had an early onset of asthma (by 3 years of age) had significantly more behavior problems at age 4 than children who developed asthma later (between 3 and 6 years of age). Furthermore, the early-onset group had significantly more problems at age 6 than both children who developed asthma later and children who never developed asthma. Children with early asthma onset were compared to children who were asthma free on individual problem items of the BSQ, revealing a profile of behavior problems that included waking at night, depressed mood, and some indication of increased fearfulness. This profile is consistent with an earlier report of behavior problems among severely asthmatic preschool children (Mrazek, Anderson, & Strunk, 1984), who displayed the same internalizing behavior problems on the BSQ. These results suggest that early asthma onset may have predictable negative influences on behavioral adjustment over a wider range of asthma severity than has previously been reported.

AB Child and adolescent therapy outcome research findings attest to the efficacy of a variety of treatments. This article illustrates promising treatments for selected internalizing (anxiety and depression), externalizing (oppositional, and antisocial behavior), and other (obesity and autism) conditions, and for other aims (preparation for medical and dental procedures). Studies in these areas illustrate worthwhile characteristics that can help inform the search for empirically supported treatments. These characteristics include randomized controlled trials, well-described and replicable treatments, tests with clinical samples, tests of clinical significance, broad-based outcome assessment including measures of real-world functioning, and others. Continued research progress will depend on greater attention to magnitude and maintenance of therapeutic change, long-term follow-up, moderators and mediators of change, and development and testing of treatment in conditions relevant to clinical practice.

AB This study examined associations of community violence exposure and psychological well-being among 99 8-12 year old children (M = 10.7 years) using home interviews with mothers and children. Both moderators and mediators of the links between violence exposure and well-being were tested. After demographics and concurrent life stressors were controlled for, violence exposure was significantly associated with intrusive thinking, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses indicated that intrusive thinking partially mediated associations between Violence exposure and internalizing symptoms. Planned comparisons revealed that violence exposure had the strongest effect on wellbeing among children with low social support or high levels of social strains. Furthermore, children with high levels of intrusive thinking were most likely to show heightened internalizing symptoms when they had inadequate social support.

AB The posttraumatic stress symptoms of 64 children ages 7 to 12 were assessed by their mothers, who had experienced emotional and physical abuse during the past year A measure of child symptoms based on DSM-IV criteria was used. Of the children exposed to violence, 13% qualified for a complete posttraumatic stress disorder(PTSD) diagnosis. However 52% suffered from intrusive and unwanted remembering of the traumatic event(s), 19% displayed traumatic avoidance, and 42% experienced traumatic arousal symptoms. Children with PTSD symptoms had significantly more internalizing behavioral problems, as expected; they also had more externalizing problems than did children without trauma symptoms.

AB We examine the association between interparental conflict and youth internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Youth perceptions of three interparental conflict variables are studied: frequency of disagreement, parents' use of art overt conflict style, and parents' use of a covert conflict style. Data are from two samples of youth from Tennessee and Utah. Interparental conflict variables account for over 20% of the variance in youth problem behaviors, and hostile conflict styles are more strongly associated with problem behavior than is the frequency of disagreement. The results are fairly consistent for sons and daughters, preadolescent and early adolescent youth, youth in nondivorced and divorced (mother-custody) families, poor and less-poor youth, and Mormon and non-Mormon youth.

AB This study investigated the convergence of temperament dimensions with constructs from C. R. Cloninger's (1987a) theory using data from a sample of 949 adolescents (M age = 13.6 years). Substantial convergence was found, and both types of constructs were related in predicted ways to self-regulation variables and adolescent substance use. Structural modeling procedures tested a mediational model for substance use; results showed mediation through self-control, academic competence, negative life events, and deviant peer affiliations. Interactions indicated that substance use could be predicted from a balance of systems for good control and poor control. Poor self-control was present for dimensions implicated in both externalizing and internalizing disorders. Results are discussed with reference to self-regulation models of substance use and the comorbidity of substance abuse and mental disorder.

AB Objective: To determine whether children between the ages of 8 and 12 years are able to reliably report internalizing symptoms over short to medium-length time intervals as measured by an objective self-report instrument of internalizing symptoms. Method: The Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC) was group-administered initially to 131 children and at subsequent intervals of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Results: Pearson product-moment correlations for the ISSC total scores of the participants were computed across the various retest intervals, At 2 weeks, the correlation was.84. At 4 weeks, the correlation was.76. After 12 weeks, the correlation was.74. Conclusions: These data indicate that children between 8 and 12 years old can reliably report their experience over short to medium-length intervals. These findings provide strong support for the ISSC as a research and clinical instrument for the assessment of internalizing symptoms in children between 8 and 12 years of age, which may ultimately prove beneficial in the identification and treatment of childhood internalizing disorders. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.

DT Article
ID STRESS; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PARENTS; FAMILY; EVENTS; CANCER; GENDER; ILL
AB This study examined the strategies adolescents use to cope with their mothers' depressive symptoms and/or episodes. An open-ended semistructured interview and a closed-ended coping scale, the Maternal Affectivity Coping Scale derived from the Self-Report Coping Scale (D. L. Causey and E. F. Dubow [1992] "Development of a Self-Report Measure for Elementary School Children," Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, Vol. 21, pp. 47-59), was administered to pairs of adolescent siblings (N = 179) from families (N = 94) in which the mother was either depressed or well. With a few important exceptions, the results reveal similar coping styles in the offspring of depressed and well mothers. One difference was that mothers' current psychological distress was weakly related to young adolescents' coping patterns (e.g., problem solving, externalizing). Also, adolescents' coping styles (e.g., provide support) were related to the type of depressive symptoms the mother exhibited (e.g., anger, irritability). Second, greater sibling differences were found for emotion-focused coping strategies (e.g., distancing) in children of depressed mothers than in children of well mothers. Third, the results suggest that the sex of the adolescent may be important in attempting to understand individual differences in coping. Females were more likely than males to engage in interpersonally focused coping strategies (e.g., provide support to their mother, seek support from others). The feelings of responsibility for contributing to their mother's depression that were more evident in females than males may offer some insight into gender differences and may also have implications for placing females at higher risk for internalizing disorders.

AB This paper presents findings on the prevalence of psychological disturbance among a sample of 5- to 8-year-old Indian school children. The study was cross-sectional with a two-instrument, two-phase design. In the first phase (screening), 48 teachers rated 1535 children (810 boys and 725 girls) drawn from five schools in Bangalore city on the 26-item Children's Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ). This resulted in 281 children being identified as disturbed, giving a prevalence of 18.3%. In the second phase, 279 of the children identified as disturbed on the CBQ and a matched group of 272 'non-disturbed children' (182 boys and 90 girls) were again rated by teachers, this time using the Child Behaviour Checklist - Teacher Report Form, yielding a corrected prevalence rate of 19.8%. In the same phase, 166 of the disturbed children and a matched group of 169 non-disturbed children were rated by parents using the Child Behaviour Checklist, yielding a corrected prevalence rate of 31.7%. A larger proportion of boys than girls were identified as disturbed by teachers, whereas parents identified a large proportion of disturbed girls. Boys were found to manifest externalizing problems more often, while girls more frequently showed internalizing problems. Learning problems were identified in a substantial number of disturbed boys and girls.

AB Objective: To determine whether gender-specific patterns of risk behaviors are associated with a self-reported history of ever having been forced or pressured to have sexual intercourse among sexually active adolescents.
   Subjects and Methods: In 1995, 21 297 eighth-through 12th-grade students in 79 public and private schools in Vermont were anonymously surveyed. Data were analyzed for 7884 sexually active students (3931 girls and 3953 boys). Demographic variables and indicators of violence, suicide, recent substance use, sexual behavior, pregnancy, and weight control behavior were assessed. Data were analyzed with multiple logistic regression.
   Results: Of the sexually active students, 30.3% of the girls and 9.9% of the boys reported ever being forced or pressured to have sexual intercourse. Among sexually active girls, being in 1 or more physical fights in the past year (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-1.94), seriously considering suicide (OR, 1.97; CI, 1.69-2.31), more years of sexual activity (OR, 1.52; CT, 1.43-1.61), not using a condom at last sexual intercourse (OR, 1.28; CI, 1.09-1.49), and having been pregnant more often (OR, 1.40; CI, 1.16-1.69) were associated with having been forced or pressured to have sex. For sexually active boys, seriously considering suicide (OR, 1.64; CI, 1.23-2.20), more years of sexual activity (OR, 1.21; CI, 1.12-1.31), more male partners in the past 3 months (OR, 1.30; CI, 1.14-1.48), more female partners in the past 3 months (OR, 1.09; CI, 1.01-1.18), not using a condom at last sexual intercourse (OR, 1.37; CI, 1.03-1.82), having been involved in more pregnancies (OR; 1.64; CI, 1.29-2.08), and having vomited or used laxatives (OR, 3.44; CI, 2.18-5.43) were associated with having been forced or pressured to have sex.
   Conclusions: Patterns of risk behaviors differed among sexually active male and female adolescents reporting being forced or pressured to have sex. Having been forced or pressured to have sex was associated with externalizing behavior, such as fighting, among girls and with internalizing behavior, such as bulimia, among boys. These unexpected associations have notable implications for screening adolescents for a history of having been forced or pressured to have sex.

AB Objective: To examine the effect of parental response on pain severity, functional disability, and behavioral problems in pediatric headache patients.
   Patients: The patients totalled 153 (65 males; 88 females), recruited from a tertiary care referral clinic for children and adolescents with headache. The mean age was 11.8 years (SD = 3.0) and the mean history of headaches was 2.7 years (range: < 1 year to 15 years).
   Methods and Measurements: Children and parents independently completed a brief structured interview assessing headache symptoms, level of episode-specific functional disability, and parental response to headache episodes. Children also completed a coping scale (KidCope) and parents provided ratings of child behavioral problems. A 16-item scale evaluating functional disability was given to children. A 16-item parent response scale was used to assess parent perceptions of parents' responses to headache episodes. Both children and parents were asked to rate independently the degree of pain severity during an acute headache.
   Results: Negative parent responses and negative coping strategies were significant predictors of internalizing behavior problems for all adolescents. For adolescent males, negative parent responses and negative coping strategies significantly predicted externalizing behavioral problems. For females less than age 12, negative parent response was a significant predictor of externalizing behavioral problems.

AB In this selective review of recent research on internalizing disorders in childhood, we focus on four areas: the predictive validity of the diagnoses of depressive and anxiety disorders, rates of comorbidity, the chronology of onsets of the disorders of interest, and transmission of depressive and anxiety disorders in the pedigrees of affected individuals. To synthesize and reconcile findings in these four areas, we approach the information from a developmental perspective and assume that genetically driven biologic processes play a salient role in the expression of depressive and anxiety disorders in childhood. We also comment on the relevance of findings on children and adolescents to the field of depressive and anxiety disorders in adults and make recommendations for further research.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether children with borderline disorder (also referred to as multiple complex developmental disorder) (BD/MCDD) and comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) demonstrate evidence of abnormal attention and/or auditory processing impairments as indexed by both behavioral and physiological measures. Method: Three groups of children were compared in two different experiments on behavioral rating scales (Conners Parent Rating Scale and Child Behavior Checklist), behavioral accuracy to auditory and visual target detection tasks, selected neuropsychological tests, and brain physiology (event-related potentials) collected during auditory and visual target detection tasks. Results: The results demonstrate that children with BD/MCDD differ from children with ADHD in the (1) prevalence of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, (2) neuropsychological deficits related to auditory processing, and (3) event-related potential brain physiology associated with auditory cognitive target attention tasks. Conclusion: Some of the pervasive pathology described in children with BD/MCDD may be due to biological vulnerabilities, particularly problems with auditory processing. Auditory processing impairments in such children deserves special attention with respect to both understanding their behavioral symptoms and developing a comprehensive treatment plan.

TI Pediatric traumatic brain injury and burn patients in the civil justice

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID CLOSED-HEAD-INJURY; CHILDREN
AB The goal of this research was to conduct an assessment of psychopathology in plaintiffs following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) and burns and its relationship to awards of total compensatory damages. Childhood TBI (n = 43) and burn (n = 51) plaintiffs were ascertained through a survey of the U.S. civil justice system involving a review of judicial opinions and verdict reporters in cases that had resulted in an award of compensatory damages in all states from 1978 to 1988. Narrative summaries, drawn from these sources with supplemental information from counsel of record, where possible, were prepared. Psychiatric and disability ratings were made from the summaries, blind to award data. Outcome measures were the pattern and prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their correlation with the awards. It was found that psychiatric disorders, which were almost exclusively internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety), were present in approximately 25 percent of the subjects in each group. Psychiatric symptoms were not related to the award amount. Significantly greater awards in the TBI group were accounted for by greater disability measures. Physical disability and total disability (including physical and quality of life limitations) were significantly and independently correlated with the award. It is concluded that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in childhood TBI and burn plaintiffs is similar to that found in TBI and burn subjects in clinical studies. Distribution of disorders is atypical in that externalizing disorders (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) were not commonly reported for either class of injuries. Awards are strongly correlated with disability variables reflecting mainly the severity of physical injury. Internalizing psychopathology may be underappreciated in decisions involving magnitude of awards following selected childhood injuries.

AB The use of Ecstasy has received much attention in Norway during the last couple of years. However, there has been a lack of knowledge about the users: how many are they? Are they in particular subculturally oriented and resourceful adolescents from the prosperous western parts of Oslo, or has there been a diffusion to other segments of the youth population?
   In a representative sample of 11245 adolescents from Oslo, age span 14-17 years, the 12-month prevalence of cannabis, Ecstasy, and amphetamine use was investigated. Thirteen percent had used cannabis last year, while the corresponding figure was 3% for Ecstasy and for amphetamines. There was an association between Ecstasy use and preference for house and techno music. More significant was, however, an association between the use of all the three illegal drugs and between these and the use of cigarettes and alcohol and alcohol problems. Mokken Scale Analysis was used to investigate stage sequences and revealed that Ecstasy was introduced after alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis and amhetamines. Further, there were strong associations with behavioral problems and moderate associations with internalizing mental-health problems. There were small differences with regard to use of Ecstasy in the different areas of Oslo, but cannabis was more prevalent in the wealthier western parts of Oslo. In conclusion, ecstasy has become part of a well-established pattern of illegal drug use in Norway.

AB Several reports have speculated that variations in beta-endorphin functioning may actually proceed the development of alcoholism and other drug use disorders, and is consequently a genetic mechanism of some etiologic importance. The goal of this investigation was to determine whether differences in basal plasma beta-endorphin concentrations could be confirmed in prepubertal children naive to alcohol and drugs, yet at parental risk for alcoholism, or drug dependence. Consequently, we have examined fasting basal plasma beta-endorphin concentrations in a sample of prepubertal sons of alcoholic fathers and compared them to both our existing sample of sons of drug dependent fathers and normal control boys. In addition, we examined the relationship between plasma beta-endorphin concentrations and maternal reports of problem behaviors posited to be related to the liability for alcoholism or drug abuse. The results reveal no differences in fasting basal plasma beta-endorphin concentrations. Although the at-risk groups differ significantly from normal boys having elevated scale scores for internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, no association between plasma beta-endorphin and these behavioral risk factors could be found. Overall, the results fail to support an inherited 'opioid deficiency hypothesis' for the development of alcoholism or drug dependence. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Thirty-eight adolescent psychiatric patients and their mothers engaged in two dyadic interactions. The participants rated themselves and each other on four behavioral dimensions (calmness, friendliness, involvement, and bossiness) during a videotaped playback. An independent observer rated the dyads on the same dimensions. Analyses were conducted based on classification of adolescents as internalizers/externalizers, depressed/nondepressed, and socially anxious/nonanxious. Internalizing adolescent dyads were significantly calmer, friendlier, and more involved than were externalizing adolescent dyads. The dyads in which the adolescents scored lower on the depression scale were calmer, friendlier, and more involved than were the dyads with adolescents who had higher depression scores. No differences were noted between high and low socially anxious dyads. The findings indicated that the videotaping procedure could help familiarize clinical staff with the dynamics of parent-adolescent interactions.

AB The developmental timing of paternal substance use disorder (SUD) offset on internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors was examined in prepubertal sons. Analyses revealed a significant main effect of the developmental timing of SUD offset on both internalizing and externalizing problems. No differences were found between sons of control-subject fathers and SUD+ fathers whose offsets occurred before the son's sixth birthday. However, when paternal SUD extended beyond the boys' sixth year, significant increases in internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors were found. The results suggest the importance of early parental SUD intervention in prevention of the intergenerational transmission of behavioral problems.

AB By adolescence, appraisal of one's past life experience becomes critical to the stage-salient issue of identity formation. This study examined adolescents' perceptions of their maltreatment experiences. It scrutinized the combined and unique contribution of five maltreatment types (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and exposure to family violence) to variance in adolescent adjustment. It was predicted that these maltreatment types would account for significant variance in adjustment when controlling for the context variables of age, sex, socioeconomic status, IQ, and stressful life events. Adolescents (N = 160, aged 11-17) were randomly selected from the open caseload of a child protection agency. Participants completed global severity ratings regarding their experiences of the five types of maltreatment, as well as a battery of measures assessing self- and caretaker-reported externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. The youths' maltreatment ratings significantly predicted self-reported adjustment, even when controlling for all context variables. Psychological maltreatment was the most predictively potent maltreatment type, and enhanced the predictive utility of other maltreatment types. Significant sex differences in the sequelae of perceived maltreatment were evident. Also, interactions between youths' ratings and those obtained from CPS files were detected. The findings were consistent with recent research in child maltreatment, and contribute to our understanding of developmental psychopathology among adolescents.

AB Empirical evidence was provided on the utility of the Screen for Adolescent Violence Exposure (SAVE) in assessing adolescent exposure to school, home, and community violence. The SAVE was empirically developed on 1,250 inner-city adolescents, and obtained excellent reliability and validity. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified three factors: Traumatic Violence, Indirect Violence, and Physical/Verbal Abuse. The SAVE demonstrated utility in classifying high-and low-violence participants, and correlated significantly with both objective crime data and theoretically relevant constructs (anger, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and internalizing/externalizing problems). Thus, the SAVE provides measurement of the stressor criterion associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, and allows quantification of severity of violence exposure by setting.

AB Examined whether marital discord over childrearing contributes to child behavior problems after taking into account general marital adjustment, and if child age moderates associations between child behavior problems and either general marital adjustment or marital discord over childrearing. Participants were 146 two-parent families seeking services for their child's (4 to 9 years of age) conduct problems. Data on marital functioning and child behavior problems were collected from both parents. Mothers' and fathers' reports of marital discord over childrearing related positively to child externalizing problems after accounting for general marital adjustment. Child age moderated associations between fathers' reports of general marital adjustment and both internalizing and externalizing child problems, with associations being stronger in families with younger children. The discussion highlights the role that developmental factors may play in understanding the link between marital and child behavior problems in clinic-referred families.

AB One in every 400-500 African American babies carries a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD, a congenital, hereditary hematologic disorder places youth at risk for developing potentially serious and life threatening disease related medical problems. Many SCD youth manifest neurocognitive impairments and learning problems, externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, low self-esteem, and problematic disease coping. Compared to control families, families with an SCD child have more conflict and lower levels of family organization. In contrast to the burgeoning research on medical advances, few researchers have examined the psychological sequelae of SCD of effective psychosocial interventions. With America's changing health care climate, the need for psychologists to work with medically ill individuals in primary care settings is increasing. In response to this need and to the 1995 American Psychological Association's guidelines for-treatment efficacy studies, a manualized family-oriented treatment program for pediatric SCD patients was developed. This paper discusses the strengths and challenges associated with implementing a culturally and developmentally sensitive manual-based family intervention for a low SES African American chronically ill population. Possible solutions to the challenges of conducting family-oriented intervention efficacy studies with pediatric populations are presented.

AB Objective: To identify whether obstetric and perinatal factors are independent predictors of child behaviour at 5 years.
   Methodology: The Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) is a prospective cohort study of 8556 mothers enrolled in early pregnancy. The relationship of obstetric and perinatal factors, maternal lifestyle, age and gender of the child, and social disadvantage were examined as predictors of child behaviour in 5005 children completing a modified child behaviour checklist at 5 years. This checklist contained three independent groups of behaviour: externalizing, internalizing and SAT (social, attentional and thought problems).
   Results: In the initial analysis a limited number of associations were present. After adjusting for measures of social disadvantage, only number of antenatal admissions was associated with child behaviour in all three scales, while maternal cigarette smoking in pregnancy and male gender were associated with externalising and SAT behaviours.
   Conclusions: Most common epidemiologic obstetric and perinatal risk factors were not independent predictors of behaviour problems in children at 5 years.

AB Objective: To examine gender differences among children with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) from an ethnically diverse school sample. Method: From 2,984 children, children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined type (ADHD-C) (46 boys, II girls), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) (59 boys, 35 girls), and co-occurring ADHD-C/ODD [76 boys, 27 girls), diagnosed by teacher-rated DSM-IV symptoms, were compared with each other and with 254 controls on teacher ratings of symptoms, social functioning, and Achenbach Teacher's Report Form scales. Results: Children with ADHD-C/ODD received the poorest ratings on ail variables. in ''pure'' groups, children with ODD were rated as learning more, working harder, and being less inattentive than children with ADHD-C; only the ODD group showed more internalizing problems than controls. For ADHD-C and ODD groups, ratings of aggression and some individual symptoms were higher in boys than girls. Girls with ODD were rated as more appropriate and less inattentive, but unhappier and more socially impaired than boys with ODD. Overall, girls received higher peer dislike scores than boys. Conclusions: Comorbidity and gender issues affect the correlates of DBDs, with learning problems higher in ADHD-C, internalizing problems associated only with ODD, and greatest impairment for ADHD-C/ODD groups. Despite having similar or less behavioral dysfunction, girls with DBDs may have more social problems than boys with DBDs.

AB Objective: To examine antecedents of young children's internalizing problems using research related to emotion regulation to guide prediction. Method: Longitudinal data were collected on 86 low-income mother-child dyads to examine risk factors related to early internalizing problems as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (Ce;Ct). Results: The following risk factors, assessed during infancy, were related to the development of preschool-age internalizing problems: negative emotionality, disorganized attachment classification, negative life events, exposure to child-rearing disagreements, and parenting hassles. In addition, the interaction of high negative emotionality and exposure to parental conflict added unique variance to the prediction of scores on the CBCL Withdrawal and Depression/Anxiety subscales. Conclusions: Children's preschool-age internalizing problems can be identified during infancy from multiple domains related to the development of emotion regulation. Further longitudinal work is encouraged that incorporates direct measurement of children's negative emotionality parenting, and family factors that influence bath parenting and children's emotion regulation.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents in Germany Results of a representative study: Age, gender and rater effects. Method: A study on behavioral and emotional problems and competence in children and adolescents in Germany (PAK-KID study) is described. It is the first nationwide representative survey of this kind of children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years in Germany. For children aged 4 to 10 years the parents completed the German version of Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 4-18) developed by the Arbeitsgruppe Deutsche Child Behavior Checklist. Children and adolescents aged 11 years and older filled out the German version of the Youth Self-Report that is part of Achenbach's CBCL in addition to the parents completing the German version of the CBCL. A total of 2856 parent questionnaires and 1798 self-report questionnaires completed by children and adolescents were analyzed.
   Results: The sample was representative with respect to the main sociodemographic variables. On all problem scales children and adolescents aged 11 to 18 years reported significantly more problems than their parents did. The frequency of internalizing problems (social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety/depression) and delinquent behavior of children and adolescents reported by parents increased with the children's age, whereas aggressive behavior and attention problems decreased with age. Girls reported significantly more problems than boys on all internalizing scales of the Youth Self-Report. The effect was not totally replicated in the parent reports. In the parent reports, boys had more attention problems and more aggressive and delinquent behavior than girls.

ID DUAL DIAGNOSIS; ADULTS; SYMPTOMS
AB Although some genetic, mental retardation syndromes have well-described behavioral features, comparative studies have not yet assessed the relative uniqueness of these so-called phenotypes. Maladaptive behavior of 43 children with Prader-Willi syndrome was compared to age-and gender-matched children with Down syndrome and with nonspecific mental retardation. The Prader-Willi group showed more frequent and severe internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist. Some problems were elevated in all groups, and 12 behaviors were significantly elevated in Prader-Willi subjects relative to both comparison groups. Seven behaviors predicted membership into the Prader-Willi group with 91% accuracy. Implications were discussed for research on behavioral phenotypes in general and for dual diagnosis in particular.

AB Childhood phobias can be successfully treated using a variety of behavioral strategies, provided there has been a psychometrically sound assessment. Measures are also important for the evaluation of treatment efficacy and the testing of hypotheses generated by new ideas and theories of children's phobias. This paper outlines broad-based assessment procedures used in the evaluation of children's phobias, including the behavioral or problem-focused interview, the diagnostic interview, self-report inventories, caregiver completed instruments, behavioral observations, self-monitoring and physiological assessment. Reflecting recent theoretical and clinical advances in the study of childhood internalizing disorders, we also explore laboratory-based measures and family assessment measures. Particular attention is given to psychometric issues and developmental sensitivity in our discussion of these assessment procedures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This study evaluated the hypothesis that the behavior problems that place children at risk for victimization by peers are associated with victimization primarily when children are also at social risk for victimization. Social risk was defined as lacking supportive friends or as being rejected by the peer group. Participants were 229 boys and girls in the 3rd through 7th grades (M age = 11 years 2 months). As predicted, behavior problems (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and physical weakness) were more strongly related to victimization when children had few friends, had friends who were incapable of fulfilling a protective function (e.g., were physically weak), or were rejected by peers than when children had more friends, had friends capable of defending them, or were better liked by peers. Results illustrate the principle that individual risk variables depend on social context for expression.

AB Little is known about the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to risk for juvenile psychopathology. The Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent Behavioral Development allows these contributions to be estimated. A population-based, unselected sample of 1412 Caucasian twin pairs aged 8-16 years was ascertained through Virginia schools. Assessment of the children involved semi-structured face-to-face interviews with both twins and both parents using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA). Self-report questionnaires were also completed by parents, children, and teachers. Measures assessed DSM-III-R symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Conduct Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Overanxious Disorder, Separation Anxiety, and Depressive Disorder. Factorially derived questionnaire scales were also extracted. Scores were normalized and standardized by age and sex. Maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate contributions of additive and nonadditive genetic effects, the shared and unique environment, and sibling imitation or contrast effects. Estimates were tested for heterogeneity over sexes. Generally, monozygotic (MZ) twins correlated more highly than dizygotic (DZ) twins, parental ratings more than child ratings, and questionnaire scales more highly than interviews. DZ correlations were very low for measures of ADHD and DZ variances were greater than MZ variances for these variables. Correlations sometimes differed between sexes but those for boy-girl pairs were usually similar to those for like-sex pairs; Most of the measures showed small to moderate additive genetic effects and moderate to large effects of the unique individual environment. Measures of ADHD and related constructs showed marked sibling contrast effects. Some measures of oppositional behavior and conduct disorder showed shared environmental effects. There were marked sex differences in the genetic contribution to separation anxiety, otherwise similar genetic effects appear to be expressed in boys and girls. Effects of rater biases on the genetic analysis are considered. The study supports a widespread influence of genetic factors on risk to adolescent psychopathology and suggests that the contribution of different types of social influence may vary consistently across domains of measurement.

AB Objective: This study had two main objectives: (1) to examine the 1-year stability of neurological soft signs and (2) to examine the longitudinal relationship between soft signs and psychiatric symptoms in young boys. Method: A consecutive series of 56 boys from a high-risk sample received standardized psychiatric and soft sign assessments at study intake. Approximately 1 year later, 48 (86%) of these boys received a reassessment of their psychiatric and soft sign status. Results: Soft signs exhibited marked stability across the I-year period (intraclass correlation = .70, p < .001). Symptoms of both internalizing and externalizing disorders correlated with poor performance on the soft sign examination. For both internalizing and externalizing symptoms, the association with soft signs occurred primarily among individuals with persistently high scores on symptom scales across the two assessments. Conclusions: Performance on a standardized neurological soft sign examination is stable over a 1-year period. Soft signs measured with this examination relate to both internalizing and externalizing symptoms ir young boys, particularly when symptoms are relatively stable over time. Further research should consider the clinical significance of childhood soft signs.

AB This word studies the influence, in physically abused subjects, of sex and age on a series of variables which measure children's social and affective adjustment. The sample was made up of 62 boys and 57 girls; of them, 38 were of school age (9 to 10 years old), 45 were preteens (11 and 12 years old) and 36 were teens (13 and 14 years old). They completed several self-assessment tests and they were also evaluated by their teachers and peers. The results show that the older subjects, when compared with the younger ones, give signs of a worsening in their emotional attitudes and social adaptation. Finally, regarding the sex variable, girls were shown to have more internalizing behavior problems than boys.

Four factor analyses were conducted. The initial factor analysis of CBCL data failed to confirm the presence of the five first-order factors previously reported for the CBCL standardization sample (Achenbach, 1991b). Second, the higher-order factors of Externalizing and Internalizing behaviors, similar to the structure reported for the CBCL standardization sample (Achenbach, 1991b), were confirmed on the present sample. Third the two CDER factors of Personal Maladaption mid Social Maladaption, previously identified by Widaman, Gibbs, and Geary (1987), were also confirmed. Finally, a higher-order factor analysis of the two factor scores from the CBCL and two factor scores from the CDER was conducted to study the congruence between the CBCL Externalizing and CDER Social Maladaption dimensions, and between the CBCL Internalizing and CDER Personal Maladaption factors. Model are levels of congruence were found. Next, child characteristics, including level of mental retardation, age, and four dimensions of adaptive behavior; were used as predictors of problem behavior. No child characteristics were significantly related to the CBCL Externalizing dimension, but child age and level of mental retardation were significant predictors of the CBCL Internalizing dimension. CDER Cognitive Competence predicted CDER Social Maladaption, and child age predicted CDER Personal Maladaption. The findings are discussed in relation to previous studies of problem behaviors of children and adolescents with mental retardation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This study had three aims: (1) to determine the relations between behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, and familial impairment with violence and suicidality (i.e., severity of ideation and attempts) in a sample of adolescent females with a psychoactive substance use disorder and controls; (2) to determine whether these relations are mediated by internalizing (depression/anxiety) and externalizing (nonviolent antisocial behavior) symptomatology; and (3) to determine whether severity of alcohol/drug use involvement moderates the relations between the mediating variables with violence and suicidality, Multiple behavioral, psychiatric interview, and self-report measures were used to index behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, familiar impairment, internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, and violence and suicidality in one hundred sixty-one 14- to 18-year-old adolescent females with a psychoactive substance use disorder and in 80 controls. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the proposed relations. Results indicated that behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, and familiar impairment were related to violence, whereas only familial impairment was related to suicidality, Internalizing symptomatology mediated the relation between familial impairment and suicidality, and was related to violence, whereas externalizing symptomatology mediated the relations between behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, and familial impairment with violence, Severity of alcohol/drug use involvement did not moderate the relations between internalizing or externalizing symptomatology with suicidality or violence. Nevertheless, the relation between internalizing symptomatology and suicidality was stronger in females with a greater degree of alcohol/drug use involvement, compared with those with a milder degree of involvement. Therefore, from a prevention standpoint, behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, familiar impairment, as well as internalizing and externalizing symptoms, may serve as clinical ''points of intervention'' for altering the development of violence and suicidality in high risk and substance abusing youth.

AB The relationships among illness stress, perceived support, and child psychosocial adjustment were examined for children living with a chronically ill father. Participants included fathers, mothers, and one child from 53 families in which the father had hemophilia and, in some cases, was HIV seropositive. Objective indicators of severity of illness and subjective measures of the physical and psychological impact of illness were used as sources of children's stress. Results indicated that the impact of illness, but not the severity of illness itself, related to child psychosocial adjustment. Main effects were observed for parental support on child- and parent-reported internalizing problems and stress-buffering effects were obtained for parental support and extrafamilial support on parent-reported internalizing problems. Parental support also demonstrated a stress-buffering effect for child-reported depression. Assessment and intervention implications for behavioral clinicians and researchers are discussed.

AB Because of the centrality of peer relationship difficulties for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), we investigated behavioral (overt and covert antisocial activity), internalizing (self-reports and observed social isolation), and familial (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting beliefs) predictors of peer sociometric nominations among previously unfamiliar, ethnically diverse ADHD (N = 73) and comparison (N = 60) boys, aged 6-12 years. Authoritative maternal parenting beliefs and negatively weighted social isolation explained significant variance in positive peer regard; aggression, covert behavior, and authoritative parenting beliefs were the independent predictors of both negative peer status and peer social preference. We extended such predictions with statistical control of (1) child cognitive variables, (2) maternal psychopathology, and (3) ADHD versus comparison status. It is important to note that aggression predicted peer rejection more strongly for comparison than for ADHD boys, but authoritative parenting beliefs were stronger predictors in ADHD than in comparison youth. We discuss family-peer linkages regarding peer competence.

AB The lack of clarity in diagnostic classification and the lack of specificity of assessment devices deter accurate identification of children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). The current study was designed to assess the utility of the Personality Inventory for Children (PIC) and the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-48) in differentiating PDD-NOS from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), disorders with overlapping symptom constellations. Subjects were 44 children recruited from a tertiary-care center with the diagnosis of ADHD or PDD-NOS. Results showed significant differences between groups on PIC scales assessing internalizing behaviors, social skills, and unusual affect and behavior, There were no group differences on the externalizing or learning scales of the CPRS-48. Discriminant function analysis using preselected PIC variables yielded a correct group classification of 92.7%. The PIC appears to be a useful tool in the differential diagnosis between PDD-NOS and ADD, while the CPRS-48, a commonly used screening measure for attentional and behavioral disorders, does not.

Sixty-three mothers reported on 79 children, ages 6 to 18 years. Retest intervals were between one and 12 months. The results indicated acceptable reliability for all supraordinate categories (any disorder, any anxiety disorder, any disruptive disorder, externalizing disorders, internalizing disorders) as well as for most individual diagnoses (separation anxiety disorder, simple phobias, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity, simple phobias, and adjustment disorder). Maternal reports for any diagnosis were significantly better for intervals under 6 months than for longer retest intervals. Reliability of maternal reports was not significantly affected by child's age or gender. This study supports the expectation that a history of psychiatric disturbance in children can be obtained reliably from mothers.

AB This study examined behavior changes demonstrated over time by children who had been placed in a residential treatment center. Objective observation of behavior during such a placement is essential for continued treatment planning, including continuing in residence, transfer. or discharge. Teachers and residential treatment counselors completed Child Behavior Checklists at admission, discharge, and time points in between, for 36 patients. The results indicated excellent interjudge reliability for externalizing behavior but not for internalizing. Children who demonstrated oppositional. defiant, or generally conduct-type symptoms seemed to do most poorly in the residential treatment setting. The results suggested that the current design of residential treatment centers may not be effective in dealing with acting-out behavior problems. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB In a prospective study of 137 children (47 with cystic fibrosis, 48 with congenital heart disease, 42 with no chronic illness), four domains were examined as predictors of parent-reported behavioral problems, particularly internalizing problems, at 4 years of age: child health, child temperament, parent-child relationships, and family environment. Family environment, as measured by the Parenting Stress Index at 1, 2, and 3 years, was the most powerful predictor. This suggests that this index is useful as an early screen for children at risk for behavioral problems and that a reduction of parenting stress is an appropriate target of preventive interventions.

On all problem scales adolescents report more problems than parents. For some scales the differences between girls and their parents are higher than between boys and their parents (social withdrawl, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, attention problems, internalizing and total score). Averaged Pearson correlations of the eight subscales are in a moderate rage (r<0.50). For all problem scales an agreement of 30% in the area of high problems (>PR95) is found. If one informant scores above PR95 the Relative Risk of the other one scoring in this range too is significantly higher than one for nearly all scales.

After accounting for socioeconomic status, ethnicity and maternal attitudes, none of the Child Behavior Checklist ratings correlated significantly with maternal patient group or several indices of antepartum maternal metabolism. Child obesity, a common sequela of diabetic pregnancies, correlated positively with Internalizing Behavior problems and three narrow-band sub-scales: Somatic Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, and Social Problems. Results suggest that children of diabetic mothers are at increased risk for a variety of developmental disturbances. Screening for learning and behavioral difficulties should be made at regular pediatric visits, with follow-up evaluations warranted by positive indications, excessive weight gain, or other evolving medical concerns.

AB It is commonly assumed that the children of separated or divorced parents are disadvantaged financially and in terms of social development. A small-scale study was designed involving 14 volunteer parents who were separated from their spouses/partners and their 28 children, ranging in age from 5 to 12 years. Structured interviews examined the families' attitudes and feelings about the separation, the mental health of the parents, the emotional and behavioural reactions of the children, and the families' use of services. The results suggested that over 60% of the girls showed Internalizing, and over 60% of the boys displayed externalizing behavioural difficulties. About 40% of the children suffered psychosomatic disorders. Nearly 75% of the parents suffered depression before and after separation. Depression, itself, may act to exacerbate children's emotional and behavioural difficulties. Although all the parents had received medication for their depression, few of the children had received any help for their difficulties. The urgent need for services to help such children is discussed.

   Design: Multiple correlations to control for gender, IQ, and socioeconomic status (SES), Partial correlations between speech or facial ratings and behavior.
   Setting: A university hospital interdisciplinary cleft/craniofacial center,
   Patients: Sixty-five children with CP or CLP and no other anomalies seen at ages 6, 9, and 12 years.
   interventions: Speech ratings, facial ratings, hearing assessment, and SES ratings, were collected at ages 6, 9, and 12.
   Main Outcome Measure:The Behavior Problem Checklist was used and internalizing problems were expected.
   Results: Less severe speech problems associated with behavioral inhibition were noted at age 9 years (p<.01). Greater facial disfigurement was correlated with greater inhibition at age 12 (p<.001).
   Conclusions: Longitudinal data indicates different associations of speech and facial variables were made to behavior at different ages (9 and 12). No significant relationships were identified at age 6.

SO JOURNAL OF GENETIC PSYCHOLOGY

DT Article
AB Social adjustment correlates of individual differences in receptive nonverbal processing abilities in boys and girls were investigated. Participants were 26 boys and 13 girls, mean age 12.04 years, who were in a custodial care institution for the treatment of a wide range of psychological difficulties. They completed the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy (DANVA; Nowicki & Duke, 1994), a standardized test of receptive nonverbal processing abilities. Trained raters used institutional records to assess the number and type of problems (internalizing or externalizing) experienced by each child. Teachers completed a social adjustment scale for each child. Girls' scores on the DANVA tests of child facial expression, child and adult facial expression combined, posture, and total DANVA accuracy as well as teacher ratings of social adjustment were significantly related to the number of externalizing problems they had. No other relations were significant. The findings suggest that receptive nonverbal processing skills may be more important for social adjustment for girls than for boys.

AB Objective: To compare parent-reported problems for children in 12 cultures. Method: Child Behavior Checklists were analyzed for 13,697 children and adolescents, aged 6 through 17 years, from general population samples in Australia, Belgium, China, Germany, Greece, Israel, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Results: Comparisons of 12 cultures across ages 6 through 11 and 9 cultures across ages 6 through 17 yielded medium effect sizes for cross-cultural variations in Total Problem, Externalizing, and Internalizing scores. Puerto Rican scores were the highest, while Swedish scores were the lowest. With great cross-cultural consistency, Total and Externalizing scores declined with age, while Internalizing scores increased; boys obtained higher Total and Externalizing scores but lower Internalizing scores than girls. Cross-cultural correlations were high among the mean item scores. Conclusions: Empirically based assessment provides a robust methodology for assessing and comparing problems reported for children from diverse cultures. Age and gender Variations are cross-culturally consistent. Although clinical cutoff points should not necessarily be uniform across all cultures, empirically based assessment offers a cost-effective way to identify problems for which children from diverse cultural backgrounds may need help.

AB Variations in ratings of externalizing and internalizing symptoms may contain a trait (i.e., shared view) component when behavioral symptoms that generalize across context are perceived and an individual view component when they are misperceived or when each informant has access to different symptoms. Using a LISREL model, we estimated the trait and the informant-specific, individual view components in parental ratings of externalizing and internalizing symptoms of adolescent siblings. The model demonstrated that mothers' and fathers' ratings contained a substantial individual view component (from 21% to 50% of total rating variance, depending on rater and trait). Except for fathers' ratings of internalizing symptoms (13%), parental ratings also contained a substantial trait component (42% to 58%). Mother's, father's, and child's ratings may be averaged to estimate a trait of externalizing. To estimate an internalizing trait, it may be best to combine just the mother's rating with the child's self-rating.

AB This study analyzed the genetic and environmental influences on internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and the nature of their cooccurrence in a national Norwegian twin sample. The sample comprised 526 identical and 389 fraternal same-sexed twin pairs from five birth cohorts, aged 5-6, 8-9, 12-13, 13-14, and 14-15 years. Behavior problems were assessed by parental ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist. A model of additive genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental influences was fitted to both internalizing and externalizing behavior in four sex and age groups. The considerable covariance, r = .51 to .58, between these traits is accounted for mainly by common environmental components; this effect was most marked in the 5 to 9-year olds. Concordance rates for children scoring above 1 standard deviation from the total sample mean on the internalizing scale only, externalizing scale only, or both indicated stronger genetic influences for internalizing or externalizing problems only than for combined problems.

AB The relations of Ego control (EC), Ego resiliency (ER), and the Five-Factor Model of Personality (FFM) with behavioral and emotional problems were explored among 116 clinic-referred children. Within the EC-ER model, Ego undercontrol was most important in predicting externalizing problems, and both Ego brittleness (the relative absence of ER) and Ego undercontrol made equaI contributions to predicting internalizing problems. Within the FFM, Extraversion and Agreeableness were independent predictors of externalizing problems, whereas only Neuroticism predicted internalizing problems. When me EC-ER model was tested against the FFM, the latter model appeared to outperform the former in predicting externalizing but not internalizing problems; when clinical syndrome groups were examined, dimensions from both personality models were differentially salient for children with primary internalizing, externalizing, or comorbid problems.

AB The present article reports on an attempt to import the concept of psychopathy at the childhood level. Childhood psychopathy was assessed in 430 boys ages 12 and 13 years by using caretaker reports on a translation of an adult psychopathy assessment instrument. A systematic construct validation approach revealed that childhood psychopathy fits into the nomological network surrounding adult psychopathy. Children with psychopathic personalities, like their adult counterparts, were serious and stable offenders, impulsive, and more prone to externalizing than internalizing disorders. Childhood psychopathy also provided incremental validity in predicting serious stable antisocial behavior in adolescence over and above other known predictors and one other classification approach. These results suggest that psychopathy has a childhood manifestation that can be measured reliably. Implications and future directions are outlined.

Preadolescents with relatively greater social competence reported more frequent companionship with peers, and more positive Harter (1985) Self-Perception Profile for Children perceptions of physical appearance and scholastic and athletic competence; their parents were more likely to encourage them to interact with peers. Preadolescents lower on social competence reported more loneliness and social anxiety. Parents rated them as having more behavior problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991), especially internalizing, and were more worried about their children's friendships. Areas where preadolescents with CFA are vulnerable to poor peer relations are discussed.

Participants included 65 families in which the father had hemophilia, approximately one half of the fathers also were HIV infected. Within each family, respondents included the father, the mother, and one child. Outcome variables included both self- and parent-reported child internalizing behaviors. Results indicated that family members' illness uncertainty was intercorrelated, that child uncertainty about the father's illness predicted both anxiety and depressive symptoms in the child, and that mother's uncertainty predicted child-reported anxiety beyond the child's uncertainty.

AB Objective: To review the past 10 years of clinical and research reports on learning disorders. Method: The most common and best-researched type of learning disorder is reading disability, which is the focus of this review. A selective review of the literature from Psychological Abstracts and Index Medicus from 1985 to the present was conducted. This review focused on conceptual and methodological issues, current assessment practices, epidemiology, correlates of brain function, biological factors, predictors of reading achievement, core deficits, comorbidity, reading development and instructional approaches, treatment, and outcome. Results: Definitional issues, still unresolved, bedevil the field with the debate between those for and those against discrepancy definitions of reading disabilities, Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made. Phonological processing problems are now considered the main core deficit responsible for reading disabilities, Correlates of brain function and possible genetic factors are noted. Comorbidity with externalizing and internalizing disorders is described, and some theories for the overlap are identified. Studies on the comorbidity with internalizing disorders are lacking. Good assessment practice and promising approaches to remediation are identified. Unless a concurrent disorder is present, the use of medication for the treatment of reading disabilities should be considered experimental. Favorable outcomes are dependent on initial severity and a supportive home and school environment. Conclusions: Much progress has been made in our understanding of learning disabilities, especially in reading disabilities. Resolution of definitional and conceptual issues will greatly assist research into assessment, treatment, and long-term outcome of learning disabilities with and without concurrent psychiatric disorders. Further research into the nature, extent, and correlates of comorbid learning disabilities and their treatment is much needed.

AB Objective: To quantitatively review and critically evaluate literature examining gender differences in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: A meta-analysis of relevant research based on 18 studies meeting inclusion criteria was performed. Domains evaluated included primary symptomatology, intellectual and academic functioning, comorbid behavior problems, social behavior, and family variables. Results: Gender differences were not found in impulsivity, academic performance, social functioning, fine motor skills, parental education, or parental depression. However, compared with ADHD boys, ADHD girls displayed greater intellectual impairment, lower levels of hyperactivity, and tower rates of other externalizing behaviors; it was not possible to evaluate the extent to which referral bias affected these findings. Some gender differences were clearly mediated by the effects of referral source; among children with ADHD identified from nonreferred populations, girls with ADHD displayed lower levels of inattention, internalizing behavior, and peer aggression than boys with ADHD, while girls and boys with ADHD identified from clinic-referred samples displayed similar levels of impairment on these variables. Conclusions: The need for future research examining gender differences in ADHD is strongly indicated, with attention to methodological limitations of the current literature, including the potential confounding effects of referral bias, comorbidity, developmental patterns, diagnostic procedures, and rater source.

AB Objective: This investigation evaluated the extent and nature of posttraumatic symptomatology (PTS) in children and adolescents 9 months after an industrial fire at the imperial Foods chicken-processing plant in Hamlet, North Carolina, caused extensive loss of life. Method: Using a PTS self-report measure plus self- and teacher reports of comorbid symptoms, the authors surveyed 1,019 fourth- to ninth-grade students in the community where the fire occurred. Results: Three factors comprising PTS were identified: reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Reexperiencing and avoidance were positively correlated; hyperarousal proved weakly correlated with reexperiencing, perhaps because exposure was largely indirect. Using a T score cutoff of 65 on the reexperiencing factor as indicative of PTS, 9.7% of subjects met criteria for PTS; 11.9% met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using DSM-III-R PTSD criteria. Degree of exposure was the most powerful predictor of PTS. Race (African-American) and gender (female) posed significant risk factors for PTS. Self-reported internalizing symptoms and teacher-reported externalizing symptoms were positively predicted by intercurrent PTS, and independently of PTS, by degree of exposure. Comorbid symptoms showed interesting interactions with exposure, race, and gender. Lack of self-attributed personal efficacy predicted PTS but did not moderate the effects of race or gender on PTS risk. Conclusions: This study, which used a population-based sampling strategy, strengthens and extends findings from earlier literature on pediatric PTSD in showing that (I) PTS and comorbid internalizing and externalizing symptoms rise in direct proportion to degree of exposure; (2) gender and race show variable effects on risk for PTS and comorbid symptoms; and (3) comorbid symptoms are positively correlated with PTS and may represent primary outcomes of traumatic exposure in their own right.

AB We evaluated the ability of parents, teachers and self-reports to predict signs of maladjustment in 353 11- to 14-year-olds from the general population, over a 4-year time interval. Odds ratios were computed in order to test the ability of problem scales to predict later mental health referral and measures of parents' and children's own perceptions of the existence of major problems. Each informant made its own unique and indispensable contribution to the prediction of signs of maladjustment. Although teachers are often perceived as less able to assess internalizing problems than mothers and the children themselves, the present study showed that teachers' evaluations of internalizing problems are highly relevant if we take their ability to predict the subject's own perceptions of having problems as the criterion.

AB In this article, the authors investigated the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on behavioral problems, which were not mediated by lower birth weight, in offspring at 3 y of: age. The authors used the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 2-3 y (CBCL/2-3; Achenbach, Edelbrock and Howell) to assess behavioral problems in 1 3 77 2- to 3-y-old healthy twin pairs. Soon after the birth of twins, the authors collected pre- and perinatal information, including smoking habits of the mother during pregnancy. The question ''Did you smoke during pregnancy?'' could be answered by choosing one of three possible options: (1) never, (2) sometimes, or (3) regularly. The authors analyzed the effect of maternal smoking on the Child Behavioral Checklist total score and on several subscale scores for first- and second-born twins separately, and they adjusted for the possible confounding effects of birth weight, socioeconomic status, maternal age, and having been breast- or bottle-fed. There was a significant effect of maternal smoking on so-called externalizing behavior problems (oppositional, aggressive, overactive), but not on internalizing behavior problems (withdrawn, depressed, anxious), in both first- and second-born twins. The authors primarily attributed the enhanced externalizing problems to increased aggression. Although boys had higher externalizing (and aggression) scores than girls, the effect of maternal smoking was the same for boys and girls. The authors also discuss whether maternal smoking causes externalizing behavior problems.

AB Although many important advances have been made in our understanding of childhood aggression in recent years, a significant limitation of prior studies has been the lack of attention to the possible moderating role of gender in the links between aggression and social-psychological adjustment. To address this issue, the author evaluated the adjustment status associated with engagement in gender normative versus gender nonnormative forms of aggression for both boys and girls. Indexes of social-psychological adjustment assessed included teacher and self-reports of internalizing and externalizing difficulties (N = 1,166 children 9-12 years old). Results showed that children who engaged in gender nonnormative forms of aggression (i.e., overtly aggressive girls and relationally aggressive boys) were significantly more maladjusted than children who engaged in gender normative forms of aggression and children who were nonaggressive.

AB The predictive relations between assessments in infancy and parent- and teacher-reported behavior problems at age 7 were investigated within a low-income sample. Infancy assessments indexed family adversity, parent-infant interaction at home, infant attachment, infant anger-distress at home, gender, and cognitive functioning. Among children at age 7 identified by teachers as highly externalizing, 83% were both disorganized in their attachment behavior in infancy and below the national mean in mental development scores at 18 months, compared with 13% of nonexternalizing children. Avoidant attachment behavior in infancy was associated with later internalizing symptoms rather than with externalizing symptoms. The behavior problem data reported by mothers suggested the possibility of attachment-related biases in maternal report data. The results indicate that mild mental lag in the context of a disorganized attachment relationship constitutes 1 early step on the pathway to school-age externalizing behavior.

AB In a two-wave longitudinal study of third and sixth graders (N = 617), we obtained self-reports of depression and peer, teacher, parent, and self-reports of competence in five domains: academic, social, attractiveness, conduct, and athletic. Competency evaluations by others predicted change in self-perceived competence over time for girls, but not for boys. Depression predicted change in self-perceived competence over time for boys but not for girls. Among girls, the relative importance of parent, teacher, and peer appraisals shifted from third to sixth grade. For both boys and girls, self-perceptions of competence predicted change in depression scores over time. Furthermore, self-perceived competencies mediated the relation between competency appraisals by others and children's self-reported depression. Results are interpreted in light of a competency-based model of child depression.

AB One of the fundamental questions for developmental psychopathology concerns the etiological links between the normal and abnormal. To what extent do disorders differ quantitatively or qualitatively from variation in the normal range? Genetic research on the normal and the abnormal differs in terms of concepts, methods, statistics, and target audiences. An approach, referred to as ''DF'' analysis, provides a framework for integrating these two worlds of genetic analysis. We applied traditional correlational analyses as well as DF (DeFries & Fulker, 1985) analyses to mother and father ratings of adjustment of adolescent siblings in a 3-year longitudinal twin and step-family study. At wave 1, the sample included 720 sibling pairs (average age of 12.9 years for the younger sibling and 14.5 years for the older siblings) and, in wave 2, 395 pairs still living at home. Both correlational analyses of the entire sample and DF analyses of selected extremes suggested moderate genetic influence and modest shared environmental influence for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Similar estimates were found for unselected individual differences and selected extreme groups. A framework is proposed that focuses on quantifying the etiologies of disorders (QED) as measured on continuous dimensions.

AB Objective: To review the clinically relevant literature on gender identity disorder (GID) in children and adolescents over the past 10 years. Method: All literature referring to gender identity and children or adolescents from 1985 on was reviewed. Results: Changes in the DSM-IV nomenclature include (1) adoption of the single diagnosis of GID to apply to children, adolescents, and adults; (2) changes in the format of the criteria; and (3) placement in the section ''Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders.'' Rates of associated psychopathology in children with GID are comparable with those in children with other psychiatric disorders, particularly disorders that are internalizing in form. Biological and psychosocial factors thought to be relevant in the development of GID are reviewed. Conclusions: Research is required to elucidate the complicated interaction between biological and psychosocial factors in the development of GID and to evaluate treatment efficacy.

AB Objective: To determine the association of parent, family, and child factors with mental health services need and utilization. Method: Possible determinants of services need and utilization were assessed in a general population sample of 2,227 children aged 4 to 18 years. Results: 3.5% of the total sample had been referred for mental health services within the past year. The most potent factors associated with service need and utilization were the child's problem behaviors (both internalizing and externalizing) and academic problems and family stress. Socioeconomic factors and the child's sex were not in itself associated with help-seeking factors. Parental psychopathology, life events, and family psychopathology lowered the parents' threshold for evaluating the child's behavior as problematic but did not increase the likelihood of referral. Conclusion: Referred children are more likely to live in families under stress than are children with the same level of problems who live in well-functioning families. Clinicians and researchers who make inferences from findings in clinical samples should realize, therefore, that children from problem families are overrepresented in their samples.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether mothers' psychiatric history biases reports of their children's behavior problems, mothers' and teachers' reports of children's behavior problems were compared using a recently developed statistical approach. Method: Child Behavior Checklists and Teacher's Report Forms were completed by mothers and teachers, respectively, about 801 six-year-old children. Mother's history of major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorder was assessed by using the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. Results: According to both teachers and mothers, maternal history of major depression was associated with more internalizing problems; the association was significantly stronger when mothers were the informants. Mothers with history of any psychiatric disorder reported more externalizing problems in their children than expected, whereas teachers' reports of externalizing behaviors were unrelated to maternal psychiatric history. These findings could not be explained by variations in children's behaviors across settings. Conclusion: The generalized estimating equation models enabled simultaneous examination of whether children of depressed mothers have excess behavior problems and whether depressed mothers overreport behavior problems in their children. The results indicate that children of depressed mothers have more internalizing problems. In addition, depressed mothers overstate and overgeneralize their offspring's behavior problems. This study broadens the concerns with reporting bias beyond maternal depression to include other psychiatric problems. The results emphasize the potential for bias in family history studies that rely on informants.

AB After-school time was examined for 206 urban children in first through fourth grades. The sample varied in race/ethnicity (African American, European American, and Hispanic American children) and SES. Children spent time after school in a variety of settings, engaged in a range of activities. Mothers/guardians of lower-income children reported greater externalizing problems among children in unsupervised care (self-care or sibling care), and fewer internalizing problems among children attending after-school programs, after controlling for family and child characteristics. There were no such associations for middle-income children. Children in after-school programs spent more time interacting with peers and less time watching television than did children in parental care or other adult care. Children who spent more time after school interacting with peers and less time after school in large motor activities had fewer internalizing problems. This association was stronger for lower-income children than for middle-income children.

AB Objectives. To describe the characteristics of homeless and low-income preschool-aged children, and to identify family and environmental determinants of their behavior.
   Methods. An unmatched case-control design was used to recruit a sample of sheltered homeless families and a comparison group of low-income housed families who were never homeless in Worcester, Massachusetts. Seventy-seven sheltered homeless and 90 low-income housed mothers with preschool-age children were assessed using a comprehensive interview protocol. Information about mothers' housing, income, service use, parenting practices, and children's father was obtained. Data about children's background, health, and life events were included. Standardized instruments were administered to assess mothers' mental health and their children's behavior. Comparisons of homeless and low-income housed families were used to describe the sample of 167 preschoolers. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association of various stressors, such as homelessness, and family factors with their behavior.
   Results. Although homeless preschoolers were significantly more likely to have experienced stressful life events, undergone a fare and protection investigation, and been placed in foster care when compared with low income preschoolers, differences in adverse behaviors were minimal. Although homeless children scored higher than housed children on the internalizing, externalizing, and total problem score on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (52.5 vs 49.9, 54.8 vs 51.2, and 54.4 vs 51.1, respectively), approximately equal numbers of children from both groups scored in the clinical range. With regard to determinants of behavior, mothers' emotional status was one of the strongest independent predictors of negative behavioral outcomes on both subscales. Foster care placement and death of a child's friend were predictors of adverse internalizing behavioral outcomes on the CBCL. After controlling for housing status, parenting practices, child's age, child's history of physical abuse, and specific life stressors predicted adverse externalizing behavioral outcomes. For both subscales, housing status and behavior were only marginally associated in the multivariate model.
   Conclusions. Both homeless and low-income children experienced significant adversity in their lives, with homeless preschool children facing more stress. However, differences in behavior as measured by the CBCL were minimal. Mothers' emotional status, in addition to various stressors, strongly predict children's negative outcomes for both CBCL subscales. These findings emphasize the importance of preventive family-oriented interventions that address the needs of preschoolers and their mothers.

DT Article
ID NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION; COMPLAINTS; BOYS
AB The development and factor structure of the Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC), a new self-report measure for assessing internalizing symptomatology in children, is detailed. Development of the ISSC was driven by the lack of a children's self-report instrument designed specifically to assess the broad domain of internalizing symptomatology, as well as research findings showing a high degree of comorbidity among internalizing syndromes (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatic complaints, social withdrawal). Thorough and methodologically rigorous procedures were employed during the development of the ISSC to ensure strong content validity as well as clinical utility. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic procedures were utilized on the 54-item ISSC research protocol, resulting in a strong two factor solution for the 48 items retained. Factor 1, Negative Affect/General Distress, includes items that indicate the presence of internalizing symptoms, or in some cases, the absence of optimistic or functional emotional states. Factor 2, Positive Affect, includes items describing positive affect incompatible with internalizing symptoms, or in some cases, items that reflect the absence of internalizing symptoms. Results of the factor analyses are discussed in terms of previous research on affectivity and specific internalizing syndromes or disorders. Potential uses of the ISSC, as well as further research needed, are described. Implications of the present investigation for future assessment and classification studies in the area of child psychopathology are reviewed. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Eleven chronic hair pullers, 11 subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and 11 subjects with a non-OCD anxiety disorder were assessed with structured interviews and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Only 4 hair pullers (36%) reported both rising tension and relief with hair pulling. Each group had significantly more internalizing than externalizing symptoms on the CBCL. Seven hair pullers (64%) had a lifetime history of at least one other axis I diagnosis. The results provide further evidence that trichotillomania in referred children and adolescents is usually a chronic disorder often associated with internalizing symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity. Rising tension followed by relief with hair pulling may be an unnecessary restriction in the diagnosis of childhood trichotillomania.

AB Concerns of young adolescents with interpersonal relatedness and self-definition assessed by the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire for Adolescents, were examined in relation to measures of maladjustment (internalizing and externalizing problems) and adaptive capacities (multiple dimensions of social competence and quality of relationships with parents and peers). Participants were four hundred ninety nine 6th and 7th grade students attending a large, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, urban school. Factor analysis of the DEQ-A resulted in a factor structure similar to that obtained in previous research with older adolescents and adults. Prior findings of associations between DEQ-A factors and internalizing and externalizing problems, after controlling for levels of depressive symptoms, were also replicated in this sample. Furthermore, associations were found linking adolescents' interpersonal concerns, self-criticism and efficacy, as assessed on the DEQ-A, with measures of social competence and quality of relationships with parents and peers.

AB The cross-cultural validity of the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 2-3 (CBCL/2-3) was tested in three Dutch samples of children referred to mental health services, from the general population, and from a twin study. Six scales were derived from factor analyses and labeled Oppositional, Aggressive, and Overactive, which constituted a broadband Externalizing grouping; Withdrawn/Depressed and Anxious, which constituted a broadband Internalizing grouping; and Sleep Problems. Internal consistencies of the scales, their test-retest reliabilities, interparent agreement, discriminative power, predictive relations with problem ratings 2 years later, and relations to other instruments designed to measure general development and behavior problems were adequate, and highly comparable to psychometric properties in American samples. It was concluded that across languages and cultures behavioral/emotional problems of young preschoolers may be adequately assessed with the CBCL/2-3.

AB First through fourth graders from 22 suburban elementary schools were screened for cross-setting disruptive behavior as eligibility criteria for participation in a longitudinal secondary prevention study aimed at reducing the risk for serious externalizing behavioral disorders. Three hundred nine subjects participated in either a multicomponent competence enhancement intervention (MCEI) or an information/attention control (IAC) condition over a 2-year period. Following baseline measurements, initial intervention effects were assessed at the end of intervention Year 1, at the beginning of intervention Year 2 (fall of the next school year), and at the end of intervention Year 2. Multisource assessments were not supportive of the efficacy of the MCEI over the IAC condition. Children in both groups rated themselves as improved over time in terms of increased adaptive skills and decreased school problems and internalizing symptoms. Teacher and parent ratings of externalizing behavior did not yield evidence of positive change, but teachers noted improved problem solving and observers noted a decrease in behavioral interference in both groups over time, possibly as a result of maturation.

ID CHILD PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES; COMORBIDITY; TEACHERS; MODEL; BOYS
AB Assessed the effect of co-occurring versus not co-occurring internalizing and externalizing behavior problems on the reasons parents reported for clinical referral of their adolescent child. Reasons for referral were coded for 181 inpatient adolescents, and parent ratings of internalizing and externalizing behavior were obtained for a general population sample of 500 adolescents. Parents concurrently reported internalizing and externalizing behavior as reasons for referral less frequently (p <.0001) than would be expected given the correlation between these two domains in the general population sample. This suggests that the presence of externalizing problems may decrease parents' concern or awareness of internalizing problems, the presence of internalizing problems may decrease parents' concern or awareness of externalizing problems, or both. Implications for the clinical referral of adolescents and for informal parental efforts at helping their children with externalizing and internalizing problems are discussed.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this research was to study adolescents' perceptions of violence in their communities and schools and examine the relationship between these reports and their emotional and behavioral functioning, controlling for the effects of family violence and other sociodemographic variables.
   Methods: Respondents included 935 urban and suburban high school students who completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) as well as measures assessing their perceptions of community, school, and family violence.
   Results: This sample of high school students was exposed to high levels of violence in their communities and schools. Over 45% of the students reported witnessing severe forms of violence such as a shooting or stabbing in their communities or schools during the year prior to the study. Hierarchic regression analyses revealed that for males, exposure to community and school violence was a significant predictor of aggressive acting-out behaviors, even when controlling for the effects of family violence and other sociodemographic variables. For girls, only exposure to school violence was a significant predictor of aggression. The results for internalizing scores (depression, withdrawal) were less impressive, particularly for males.
   Conclusions: The high levels of violence exposure of adolescents in their communities and schools and the associated increase in behavior problems suggest the need for developing school and community intervention programs to treat violence and its impact.

AB Objectives: To examine the nature of psychopathology of children with alopecia areata (AA) and to investigate the frequency and quality of life events in the year before AA developed in comparison with a control group. Method: Thirty-three subjects with AA, mean age 10.5 +/- 0.3 years, were compared with 30 controls who visited a pediatrician for a mild condition. In addition, 16 preschool children with AA were compared with 17 preschool children who visited the pediatrician for a mild condition. The following measures were used: Child Psychiatric Interview, Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (CMAS), Life Events Scale for Children, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: On the CBCL, children with AA had more psychological problems, in total, than controls, and in particular, they were more anxious or depressed, withdrawn, aggressive, and delinquent. They also had more somatic problems as well as problems in social relations and in attention. Girls with AA seem to have been affected more in dimensions of total problems, anxiety/depression, and internalizing/externalizing syndromes. In terms of anxiety (CMAS), more children with AA than controls seemed to worry and to have difficulties in concentration and physiological symptoms of anxiety. In the Child Psychiatric Interview, all children with AA exhibited symptomatology of anxiety or depression or both, usually of a mild or moderate nature. Major depression was not detected through the CDI. Fewer children with AA had positive life events the year before AA than controls in a similar time period. Conclusions: Compared with controls, children with AA had more psychiatric symptoms in general and symptoms of anxiety or depression, or both, in particular. There is also evidence that lack of positive life events in the prealopecia period played a role in their lives. Psychiatric assessment, and if necessary treatment, is warranted for all children with this condition.

AB The present longitudinal study (1989-1991) of seventh-grade adolescents (173 boys, 197 girls; M age = 12.7 in 1989) living in the rural Midwest examined the influence of children's awareness of marital conflict and reported level of parental hostility on symptoms of adolescent distress. The theoretical model guiding the research indirectly linked marital conflict to adolescent perceptions of parents' hostility through the mediating effects of parents' and observers' report of hostility toward the adolescent and through adolescent awareness of the frequency of interparental conflict. Controlling for earlier levels of psychological distress, we hypothesized a direct path between adolescent report of parent hostility and adolescent maladjustment. Maximum likelihood estimation of the proposed model showed that marital conflict was significantly related to parents' and observers' reports of parent hostility toward the adolescent and to adolescent awareness of conflict frequency. Both parent hostility and adolescent awareness of the frequency of marital conflicts were significantly related to adolescent perceptions of parent hostility. When controlled for earlier distress, adolescent report of parent hostility significantly predicted the later internalizing and externalizing symptoms of these teenagers. The model predicted externalizing problems for boys but not girls. Otherwise, there were no gender differences in the postulated causal processes.

AB Sixty-nine families (father, mother, and one child) in which the father had hemophilia, approximately half of whom were HIV positive, were assessed in an examination of the relationship between parental chronic illness, family functioning, child coping strategies, and child adjustment. Latent variable path analyses with partial least-squares estimation procedures (PLS) were used to test a model of the relationship between parental chronic illness, family process variables, child coping strategies, and child internalizing behavior problems. The severity of the father's illness predicted family process variables, which predicted the coping style of the child. The use of more avoidant coping strategies was associated with more internalizing problems.

ID ATTENTION-DEFICIT DISORDERS; HYPERACTIVITY
AB From an ethnically diverse sample of 2,744 school children, 221 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [123 (4.5%) predominantly inattentive (IA), 47 (1.7%) predominantly hyperactive/impulsive (HI), and 51 (1.9%) combined type (C)] were identified using teacher ratings on a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) (DSM-IV) symptom checklist. Subjects were compared to 221 controls on teacher ratings of behavioral, academic, and social functioning. The results revealed relatively independent areas of impairment for each diagnostic group. The IA children were impaired in all areas, but were rated as displaying more appropriate behavior and fewer externalizing problems than HI or C children. The HI group displayed externalizing and social problems, but was rated as no different than controls in learning or internalizing problems. The C group demonstrated severe and pervasive difficulties across domains. These findings support the validity of the DSM-TV ADHD subtypes; all ADHD groups demonstrated impairment relative to controls, but show different patterns of behavioral characteristics.

AB A total of 200 mothers and fathers provided their opinions as to the accuracy of mothers, fathers, teachers, children's peers, and children themselves as informants of children's emotional/behavioral problems. The results showed that mothers and fathers had very similar patterns of perceptions of accuracy, although fathers' ratings showed less differentiation between informants than did mothers' ratings. Patterns were very similar for reports on children and adolescents. Overall, mothers were perceived to be more accurate in reporting internalizing problems; mothers and teachers (and fathers to a lesser extent) were perceived to be more accurate in reporting externalizing problems; mothers, fathers, and teachers were seen as more accurate in reporting children's adaptive behaviors, and mothers, fathers, and children were seen as more accurate in reporting family problems. The results are discussed in the context of multiple informants of children's and adolescents' emotional/behavioral problems.

AB A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the early development of children with d-transposition of the great arteries (N = 171) repaired by an arterial switch operation that used either predominantly total circulatory arrest or predominantly continuous low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass. The children assigned to the circulatory arrest group scored lower than those assigned to low-flow bypass on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 1 year of age. Responses to parental questionnaires completed when the children were 2.5 years old indicated that the children in the circulatory arrest group, especially those with a ventricular septal defect, also manifested poorer expressive language and were considered to display more internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. The use of circulatory arrest to protect vital organs during open heart surgery might place children at increased risk of early developmental difficulties, especially in the domains of motor and language function.

AB Objective: To study externalizing and internalizing comorbidity patterns in 6- to 12-year-old children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined subtype (n = 27), ADHD inattentive subtype (n = 26), and a normal control group (n = 33). Method: Children were assigned to groups on the basis of results of a parent structured interview, which reflected DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms. Comorbid problems were assessed via parent and child structured interviews and parent and teacher behavior ratings. Results: Logistic regression analyses and multivariate analyses of covariance revealed that (1) children in the ADHD combined group were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder and had significantly higher scores on parent and teacher ratings of externalizing problems than children in the ADHD inattentive and control groups, (2) children in the ADHD combined and ADHD inattentive groups had significantly higher scores on parent and teacher ratings of internalizing problems than children in the control group, and (3) children in the clinical groups did not differ with regard to internalizing disorders. Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that a significant comorbidity exists between ADHD combined and oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder. Contrary to previous studies that were conducted using DSM-III diagnostic criteria for ADHD, no differences were found between ADHD combined and ADHD inattentive subtypes regarding internalizing disorders.

AB The purpose of this study was to elucidate the etiological pathways towards substance use and risky sexual behavior in female adolescent substance abusers. The study had three aims: (1) to determine the relations between behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, and childhood victimization with substance use and risky sexual behavior, (2) to determine whether these relations are mediated by internalizing symptomatology, antisocial behavior, and affiliating with an adult boyfriend; and (3) to determine whether age of menarche moderates the relation between the mediating variables and substance use and risky sexual behavior. Multiple behavioral, psychiatric interview. and self-report measures were used to index behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, childhood victimization, internalizing symptomatology, antisocial behavior, affiliation with adult boyfriends, substance use, and risky sexual behavior in 125 substance abusing female adolescents and 78 controls between the ages of 14-18 years. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the etiological pathways. Results indicated that behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, and childhood victimization were related to substance use and risky sexual behavior. Age of menarche was significantly correlated with affiliation with an older boyfriend and risky sexual behavior. Antisocial behavior mediated the associations between behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity and childhood victimization with substance use and risky sexual behavior. Affiliation with an adult boyfriend was directly associated with substance use involvement and accounted for the relationship between chronological age and risky sexual behavior. Finally, late menarche enhanced the association between internalizing symptomatology and substance use involvement. The results highlight the importance of behavioral dysregulation, negative affectivity, and childhood victimization in predicting substance use and risky sexual behavior, as well as the finding that antisocial behavior and affiliation with an adult boyfriend may be etiologically important in predicting these outcomes. Therefore, from a prevention and treatment standpoint, behavioral and affective dysregulation, childhood victimization as well as antisocial behavior may serve as clinical 'gateways' for altering the developmental trajectory toward substance use and risky sexual behavior in high risk and substance abusing youth. For example, reducing dysregulation through behavior modification procedures that have been developed for conduct disordered children would appear to be a heuristic avenue of investigation emanating from the results obtained in this study.

AB Frequency of visiting with biological parents during family foster care placement in two different groups of children with differing adjustments to care was found to be generally low and to be related to both the length of time the children had been in care and the number of placements they had experienced. Those children who were visited more frequently were found to exhibit fewer externalizing and internalizing behavior problems than those visited less frequently or not at all. These behavioral correlates of visiting were, however, to depend on the type of behavior focused on and the degree of adjustment the child had made to family foster care.

AB In this study we investigated differences in child adjustment and family functioning of 33 children with leukemia and 32 healthy children, examined unique relationships between familial factors and adjustment within each group, and used demographic and family variables to predict child adjustment for both groups. Results indicated that the families of children with leukemia rated themselves as less cohesive and more conflictual than did the families of healthy children. We found no differences in child adjustment between children with leukemia and healthy children; both groups scored well within normal ranges. However, we found different associations between family functioning and child adjustment for the two groups. For the children with leukemia, greater family conflict and less encouragement of autonomy were associated with greater child externalizing symptoms, whereas lower family cohesion, less open expression, and higher levels of control within the family were associated with more child internalizing problems. For the healthy children, family personal growth was associated with better adjustment (i.e., fewer child internalizing problems). We predicted child adjustment using hierarchical. multiple regression analyses and we discuss implications of these findings for a family systems approach in pediatric psychology.

Both groups of adolescents and their parents completed questionnaires that addressed depression, behavior problems, family functioning, and drug and alcohol use. On the basis of group means of the Children's Depression Inventory (Kovacs & Beck, 1977), the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1987), and the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983), the suicidal youth were found to have a significant level of depression in addition to a variety of internalizing and externalizing behavior disorders. Similarly on the Multigating Substance Use Evaluation System (Jurkovic & Bruce, 1991), the suicidal youth were at a high risk for alcohol and drug abuse. The suicidal group reported more alcohol and drug abuse than the control group. The results indicated that suicidal African American adolescents used significant amounts of drugs and alcohol, which may be associated with suicide attempts.

AB In these two studies, the authors used children's perceptions of family relationships to examine simultaneously direct and indirect links between marital conflict and child adjustment. With data pertaining to 146 sixth and seventh graders, Study 1 supported direct and indirect effects of perceptions of marital conflict on internalizing behaviors, and indirect effects for externalizing behaviors. In Study 2, data analyzed from 451 families showed indirect effects of marital conflict and parent-to-child hostility through adolescent perceptions of such behavior, on both current distress and distress 12 months later in 3 of 4 models estimated. Direct and indirect effects were found for boys' concurrent internalizing behavior. Implications and limitations of both studies are discussed to address the need for a more sophisticated theoretical approach to examine why an association exists between marital conflict and child adjustment.

ID ALCOHOL-USE; ABUSE
AB Although statistics from various surveys differ, it is acknowledged that drug abuse is increasing among young Asian Americans. This increase is particularly noteworthy among those who reside in urban centres, where there is greater exposure to social influences (Lin, 1986). Extensive exposure of Asian adolescents to Western youth drug culture contributes to a higher risk of developing drug problems. The internalizing of Western culture puts young Asians at risk of engaging in delinquent acts that lead to drug arrests, school dropout, and a greater frequency and duration of drug use. In a nine-month tracking study of Asian youth, their drug use and cultural influences were assessed using the Adolescent Substance Battery. It is suggested that the transition to Western culture disrupts the hierarchical family structure, interdependence, and self-identity of young Asian Americans.

AB Children suffering from chronic physical illness are considered to be at increased risk for behavioural problems, There is also evidence that their siblings are at risk for behavioural problems, This study investigated parent-reported behavioural problems in chronically ill children and their siblings. There were significant positive correlations between the behaviour problem scores of the ill children and the scores of their siblings. Siblings older than the ill child had significantly higher behaviour problem scores of an internalizing nature than did the younger siblings. Sibling behaviour problem scores were similar to those of a comparison group of normal children and significantly different from those of a comparison group of psychiatrically referred children. Siblings of chronically ill children showed no greater likelihood of receiving scores in the clinical range of behaviour problems than children in the general population. Implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Examined which of several apparent risk variables were predictors of internalizing and externalizing problems in 48 girls who were referred for therapy after disclosing sexual abuse. Specifically, the effects of abuse characteristics, support from nonoffending parents, victims' coping strategies, and victims' cognitive appraisals on symptomatology were assessed. As hypothesized, results indicated that internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with different sets of predictor variables. Victims' self-reports of depression and anxiety were related to lower perceived suppport from nonoffending parents, more use of cognitive avoidance coping, and more negative appraisals of the abuse. These results were partially replicated when using parent-report measures of depression, but were not replicated for parent reports of victim anxiety. Incest was the only variable that was significantly related to parent-reported anxiety. Parent-reported aggressive behaviors were predicted by level of abuse-related stress; and aggression, social problems, and sexual problems were all related to the tendency to cope by controlling others. Social problems were also related to coping by self-distraction Regression analyses were done for each dependent variable to examine which predictors accounted for unique variance when controlling for other significant zero-order correlates. Implications of these results for understanding variability in symptom expression among sexual abuse victims are discussed.

AB Data that serve to support the convergent validity of the Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC), a new child self-report measure for assessing internalizing symptoms, are presented. The results of three studies are presented, wherein ISSC scores were correlated with three established internalizing comparison measures: the Youth Self-Report, the Children's Depression Inventory, and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. Correlations were in the desired direction and magnitude for demonstrating the convergent validity of the ISSC as a self-report measure of internalizing symptoms of children. Strong correlations were found between the ISSC and the Internalizing broad-band score of the Youth Self-Report, whereas moderate to moderately high correlations were found between the scores of the ISSC and those of the Children's Depression Inventory and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale. The ISSC appears to measure the internalizing construct in children and to have promise as a research and clinical tool for use with children ages 8 to 12. Limitations of this investigation and implications for future research in this area are discussed.

ID CHILDREN; EMOTIONALITY; STRATEGIES; STRESS; SELF
AB Fifty-five children, ages 6-8 and 10-12 years, participated in a social cognition study on expectancies for how to cope when feeling sad, angry, afraid, hurt, or ashamed A comparison sample of sexually abused children was also included. Five hypothetical vignettes, each featuring one of the preceding emotions, were designed such that controllability of outcome, intensity of emotion, and degree of affiliation between protagonists were controlled; the children were provided with coping strategies, including problem-solving, support-seeking, distancing, internalizing, and externalizing options. Children chose the ''best'' and ''worst'' coping strategies and justified their choices, as well as responded to what they would do in a similar situation. Results indicated that there were no age, gender or abuse-related differences in which strategy was selected as best or worst for any of the emotion-linked vignettes; however younger children tended to provide more simplistic justifications. Problem-solving was most often cited as the best coping strategy when feeling shamed or angry, support-seeking when feeling sad, and both problem-solving and support-seeking were equally nominated when fearful. Distancing was viewed as the best strategy when one's feelings were hurt. Children overwhelmingly chose the aggressive externalizing coping strategy as the worst option across all emotion stories, and both social and nonsocial consequences were cited as the justification for why it was the least desirable coping strategy. The results were further interpreted in light Of children's acquisition of emotion scenarios that are script-like and include evaluations of what is both socially desirable and adaptive for how to cope with emotionally aversive circumstances.

AB Objective. To determine psychiatric disorders in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and to test whether biochemical control, intellectual functioning, white matter abnormalities visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or style of parenting influence psychopathology.
   Design and Subjects. This cross-sectional study consisted of 35 PKU patients 17 to 33 years of age (mean: 22.2). From a total of 67 patients, 3 patients were selected because of other causes of possible brain damage. Then 35 patients were randomly drawn with comparison with a control sample (n = 181) from an epidemiologic study.
   Methods. We used a standardized, highly structured, face-to-face interview; intelligence quotient (IQ) test; cranial MRI (n = 26); and monitoring of plasma phenylalanine.
   Results. The overall rate of psychiatric disorders was 25.7% in PKU patients and 16.1% in controls. This difference was not statistically significant. The pattern of psychiatric disturbances was different for PKU patients and controls (Fisher's exact test): in PKU patients, externalizing disorders were reduced (PKU: not present, controls: 7.8%), whereas internalizing disorders (PKU: 25.7%, controls: 8.3%) were increased. International Classification of Diseases, version 10, diagnoses were predominantly those of the depressive category and more frequent in women (8 of 18 females and 1 of 17 males). A correlation between IQ and both biochemical control up to 12 years of age and school education of parents was confirmed. No correlation was found between the severity or pattern of psychiatric disturbances and school education of parents, biochemical control, IQ, or the extension of MRI-visible, white matter abnormalities. It was found that a restrictive controlling style of parenting is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions. Our results support a psychological perspective for the development of psychiatric symptoms in PKU. Thus, optimizing medical treatment necessary to prevent brain damage should be accompanied by psychiatric monitoring and psychological support for the families.

AB This work studies the effects of two high risk conditions (maltreatment and sociometric rejection) on social and affective child adjustment. The sample was composed by 181 subjects classified in: (a) three different categories of maltreatment condition (physical maltreatment, family violence and nonmaltreatment) according to the answers in a semistructured interview and data from social services expedients; (b) two sociometric groups (preferred and rejected), according to the received nominations. Being maltreated physically and watching family violence produced a very similar desadaptive pattern: Maltreated subjects were characterized by externalizing conduct and, in a less proportion, internalizing conduct. The subjects that watched family violence were characterized by depressive problems and externalizing conducts. The rejected subjects, as a group, showed the most desadaptive pattern.

AB This study examined the influence of children's exposure to marital conflict and children's coping responses to marital conflict on child adjustment. Forty-three mother-child dyads and 38 of the children's teachers participated in this investigation. Preadolescent children reported the marital conflict they witnessed, their coping responses to marital conflict, and their feelings of depression and global self-worth, while mothers reported their marital conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and teachers reported children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the contribution of demographic, marital conflict, and child coping variables to the prediction of child adjustment. The results indicated that aggressive marital conflict was predictive of children's feelings of low self-worth, mother's reports of child externalizing behavior problems, and teacher's reports of child internalizing behavior problems. Moreover child coping factors contributed unique variances to the prediction of child reports of child depression and teacher reports of child externalizing behavior problems after marital conflict and demographic variables were considered.

AB Behaviour problems in Romanian orphans adopted to Canada were examined through parents' interview reports of specific problems, and children's scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach, Edelbrock, & Howell, 1987) completed by their parents. Three groups of children were studied. Romanian orphanage (RO) children had spent at least 8 months in a Romanian orphanage. Parents' reports of RO children's problems were compared to parent reports from 2 comparison groups: (1) Canadian-born children (CB) who were not adopted and never institutionalised; and (2) children who would have gone to a Romanian orphanage had they not been adopted before 4 months of age (Romanian Comparison: RC). RO children scored higher than CB and RC children for Total problems and Internalizing problems on the CBCL. No significant differences were found for any group comparison on Externalizing problems. CBCL scores were positively correlated with RO children's total time in orphanage. According to parent interview, RO children had more eating problems, medical problems, and stereotyped behaviour problems than both CB and RC children. These problems were distinctive ones, rarely if ever being reported for CB or RC children. It is suggested that these distinctive RO problems arise out of a normal developmental base, and reflect either continuations of orphanage behaviours, reactions to stimuli different from those experienced in orphanage, or lack of opportunity for development or learning within orphanage.

AB Little is known about the psychosocial functioning of persons who have recovered from dysthymic disorder. Such information might be useful in identifying trait markers for dysthymia, and for guiding continuation and maintenance treatment. We explored this issue using data from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project, a large community-based study of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in a high school population. Four groups of adolescents were identified: 38 with a past history of dysthymic disorder; 217 with a past history of major depressive disorder; 142 with a past history of non-affective disorders; and 1079 with no lifetime history of psychopathology. The groups were compared on an extensive battery of psychosocial variables. The most consistent and diagnostically specific finding was that adolescents with a past history of dysthymic disorder reported having a significantly lower level of social support from friends than each of the other three groups of adolescents. Adolescents with a past history of dysthymic disorder also reported significantly higher levels of depressive, internalizing and externalizing symptoms and daily hassles than adolescents with no lifetime history of psychopathology. In addition, they reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and self-consciousness, but fewer externalizing symptoms than adolescents with a past history of non-affective disorders. These data suggest that adolescents with dysthymic disorder continue to experience significant difficulties in psychosocial functioning even after recovery. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Parents were asked about themselves and their families, their child with Prader-Willi syndrome, family supports, and family stress. Compared to reported stress levels in families of children with mixed etiologies of retardation, parents of children with Prader-Willi syndrome showed higher levels of parent and family problems, and comparable levels of pessimism. Parents of children with Prader-Willi syndrome listed other family members and friends as their main supporters; often such supporters lived outside of the respondent's town or city. Although the child's age, Ie, and degree of obesity were not related to familial stress families experienced greater stress when the child showed more behavior problems overall, more externalizing and internalizing problems, and more problems on five of the nine narrow-band domains of Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist.

AB Nosological (symptom overlap) and methodological (informant) artifact in the covariation of an empirically derived syndrome of anxious-depressed symptoms with 7 other syndromes of emotional and behavior problems was examined in reports by parents, teachers, and adolescents on a nationally representative sample of 908 adolescents. Although minor symptom overlap was observed and the effects of informant were significant, the anxious-depressed syndrome covaried significantly with all other syndromes after controlling for these effects. Indices of covariation controlling for informant effects were all significant and ranged for all syndromes except for delinquent behavior from .619 to .681, reflecting significant covariation of the anxious-depressed syndrome with both externalizing and internalizing syndromes. Covariation of the anxious-depressed syndrome and delinquent behavior was .470. Implications for research on the comorbidity-covariation of depressive syndromes during childhood and adolescence are highlighted.

AB Objective: This study prospectively evaluated the relationship between early puberty and the onset of internalizing symptoms and disorders in adolescent girls.
   Method: The sample was drawn from 1,463 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade girls who participated in a longitudinal school-based study of growth and development. Pubertal stage was determined by self-assessment of Tanner stage. Psychiatric assessments included self-report instruments and structured diagnostic interviews. Survival methods were utilized for data analysis.
   Results: Girls with onset of internalizing symptoms were on average 5 months earlier in pubertal development than those who were asymptomatic (p<.001). in addition, girls with earlier maturation (earliest quartile) were more likely to develop internalizing symptoms than were nonearly maturers (hazard ratio = 1.8, confidence interval = 1.2, 2.7). In a subsample of girls followed into high school, early-maturing girls were at marginally higher risk (p<.10) for developing internalizing disorders by the study's end. The highest risk for internalizing disorders was for those girls with both early puberty and prior internalizing symptoms (odds ratio = 3.3).
   Conclusion: Early puberty increases the risk of internalizing symptoms and perhaps internalizing disorders in adolescent girls.

ID FAMILIES; MOTHERS; BOYS
AB The present study explores the relationships between parents and teachers as raters of children's behavior using Achenbach and Edelbrock's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, 1983) and Teacher Report Form (TRF, 1984). Internalizing and externalizing behavior scores from these two instruments revealed a significant relationship between mothers' and teachers' reports for externalizing behaviors only, consistent with other studies in the literature (Achenbach, McConaughy, & Howell, 1987). When the sample was divided into abusive, distressed, and non-clinical groups, the correlation between mother and teacher on externalizing behavior remained significant for the non-clinical group only. It also may be the case that children with internalizing behaviors are misrated by either parents or teachers, even in the non-clinical group, again pointing to the need for multiple raters. From these results, it appears that familial dysfunction can contribute to rater bias and that both parents and teachers, as well as trained professionals, should be used to rate problematic behavior in children.

TI Internalizing and externalizing characteristics of sexually and/or
   physically abused children
SO INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study evaluates the behavioral consequences of childhood abuse (sexual, physical, or both), with particular focus on prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Three abuse type groups and nonabused controls were contrasted on behavioral rating scales and on structured psychiatric interview data. The participants (109 abused children and 16 normal control children) were recruited from Arkansas Children's Hospital and local agencies for abused children. As expected, proportionately more females than males were sexually abused. Overall, males were rated as more disturbed than females. Type of abuse did not consistently influence behavioral ratings. Externalizing scores were significantly higher than internalizing scores in all abused groups. PTSD was diagnosed in 50% of the abused children, with a higher rate for boys who had been sexually abused as opposed to physically abused only (58% versus 13%). The most frequent comorbid condition with PTSD was Separation Anxiety. Sexually abused boys were hospitalized for psychiatric treatment at a higher rate than were other abused children.

ID CHILDREN; ADJUSTMENT; HEALTH
AB Cross-cultural aspects of siblings' adaptation to childhood cancer were examined in two studies as part of a cooperative multi-institutional investigation in Israel and the United States. Study 1 compared the behavioral adaptation of Israeli siblings of patients with childhood cancer with matched clinically referred and normal Israeli children. Study 2 compared the behavioral adaptation of case-matched samples of Israeli and American siblings and assessed the contribution of family relations and parental coping to the siblings' behavioral adjustment. Israeli patients' siblings and normal samples scored significantly lower on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) than the clinically referred sample did, indicating fewer behavior problems, with no differences between the sibling and normal samples. The CBCL scores of the Israeli and American samples did not differ significantly on the Externalizing and Internalizing subscales and the Total Behavior Problem score. Significant correlations were found in both the Israeli and American samples between the parental coping and family relations variables and the CBCL summary scores,: indicating that greater internal family support and emotional expressiveness and lower conflict were associated with less behavior disturbance in the sibling. The authors consider cross-cultural and methodologic issues when interpreting similarities and differences among Israeli and American siblings of pediatric cancer patients.

AB Objective: To describe psychosocial characteristics of children and young adolescents who experienced the recent suicidal death of a parent or sibling. Method: Sixteen families with children aged 5 years to 14 years and who experienced the suicidal death of a relative on average within the year of research assessment were recruited from the community and evaluated with standard research instruments for levels of children's psychiatric symptoms and social adjustment. Results: Child survivors of suicide had a higher rate of internalizing symptoms and poorer school adjustment than a standard community sample. Twenty-five percent of the families had children who reported clinically significant symptoms of depression. Approximately 40% of the families included children who reported at least moderate symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Approximately 31% of families had at least one child who reported suicidal ideation, but no child reported a suicide attempt. Significant associations were identified between psychosocial features of the children and parental psychiatric symptoms and stressful life events. Conclusion: Child survivors of suicide are at risk for psychiatric symptoms and social maladjustment which require early identification and preventive intervention to minimize risk for more extensive psychosocial morbidity.

AB A developing body of research suggests that there are few sex differences in the rate and severity of problem behavior in early childhood, but clear sex differences emerge at about 4 years of age. The authors explore 2 hypotheses to further the understanding of emerging sex differences in problem behavior across the first 5 years of life. The first posits that the change in girls' problem behavior from infancy to school entry represents a channeling of early problem behavior into predominantly internalizing problems as a result of socialization. The second hypothesis is that the change in girls' early problem behavior during the preschool period results from the more rapid biological, cognitive, and social-emotional development of girls relative to boys. The authors review research on the influence of parents, teachers, and peers on girls' behavior from infancy to preschool regarding the first hypothesis, whereas they review studies of sex differences in developmental processes to test the second. They find moderate support for both hypotheses and present a comprehensive theory of girls' developmental psychopathology that integrates social and developmental influences.

AB This study focused on gender differences in childhood disorders and severity of adult psychosocial impairment among 106 females and 95 males seeking treatment for opiate addiction. Results indicated that as compared to males, female addicts reported significantly lower levels of conduct problems and higher levels of internalizing problems during childhood; these differences held even after controlling for comorbid adult psychiatric diagnosis. Findings also revealed that female addicts were at a disadvantage relative to males in terms of overall severity of psychiatric distress. Concomitantly, however, females showed less social deviance-on a range of illegal behaviors-as compared to men. Results were discussed in terms of implications for treatment planning: they underscore the need to consider gender differences in pathways to, and nature of, adult psychopathology among addicted individuals.

AB This study examined the gender differences in outcomes related to school performance, suicidal involvement, disordered eating behaviors, sexual risk taking, substance use, and delinquent behaviors of male (n = 370) and female teenagers (n = 2,681) who self-reported a history of sexual abuse. It was found that female adolescents, by and large, engaged in internalizing behaviors and males in externalizing behaviors. Male adolescents were found to be at higher risk than females in poor school performance, delinquent activities, and sexual risk taking. Female adolescents, on the other hand, showed higher risk for suicidal ideation and behavior as well as disordered eating. Females showed more frequent use of alcohol. However, male adolescents exhibited more extreme use of alcohol and more frequent and extreme use of marijuana Among index female adolescents, protective factors against adverse correlates included a higher emotional attachment to family, being religious or spiritual, presence of both parents at home, and a perception of overall health. Factors that augmented adverse correlates for them included a stressful school environment due to perceived high levels of substance use in and around school, worry of sexual abuse, maternal alcohol consumption, and physical abuse. For male adolescents, maternal education and parental concern appeared to be protective factors. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The reciprocal effects among cognitive-behavioral, environmental, and biological influences on clinic-referred children's (N = 64; 34 boys; M age 12.71 years) short-term psychological and psychiatric adjustment were studied. At clinic intake and 6 months later, standardized measures of adjustment and control-related beliefs were assessed. Before and after conflict-oriented parent-child interaction tasks the children's saliva was sampled. Adrenocortical responses (i.e., increases in salivary cortisol) to the social conflict task predicted children's internalizing problem behaviors and anxiety disorders at follow-up. Consistently high adrenocortical reactivity at intake and follow-up was associated with deflated social competence over the B-month period. Also, specific patterns of discontinuity in children's internalizing behavior problems predicted individual differences in their subsequent adrenocortical responsiveness. Specifically, rising behavior problem levels across time predicted higher and declining behavior problem levels predicted lower adrenocortical reactivity at follow-up. Findings are among the first to suggest links among internalizing behavior problems, adrenocortical responsiveness to social challenge, and clinic-referred children's short-term cognitive-behavioral and emotional adjustment.

AB This study examined differences in social functioning, peer relations, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors between youths (ages 4-18) with sickle cell disease (SCD) and demographically matched healthy peers using parent-, teacher-, and youth-report versions of the Child Behavior Checklist and Missouri Peer Relations Inventory. Youths with SCD were reported by themselves to have more social and externalizing problems compared to healthy peers. Moreover, a significantly greater percentage of youths with SCD had borderline and clinical levels of social, internalizing, and externalizing problems relative to the healthy comparison group. Illness severity variables were not associated with any of the dependent measures. Overall, although the social functioning of youths with SCD is perceived by parents and teachers to be adequate, adolescents with SCD view themselves as having more social problems than their healthy peers. Implications for future research and interventions in the area of peer relations are discussed.

AB We examined whether the interaction of resting frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry and social behavior during peer play was related to the occurrence of maladaptive behavior in preschoolers. Two independent cohorts of children were observed interacting in same-age and -gender play quartets at 4 years of age. Each child was also seen individually for a psychophysiology session during which time measures of EEG activity were recorded. We found that highly sociable children who exhibited greater relative right frontal EEG asymmetry were more likely to exhibit externalizing problems than sociable children who exhibited greater relative left frontal EEG asymmetry. We also found that shy children who exhibited greater relative right frontal EEG asymmetry were more likely to exhibit internalizing problems than shy children who exhibited left frontal EEG asymmetry. These findings suggest that the pattern of frontal EEG asymmetry in combination with social behavioral style is a significant predictor of maladaptive behavior problems during the preschool period.

ID CONDUCT PROBLEMS; CHILDHOOD; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; DISORDERS
AB Genetic influence on externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and attentional/activity problems in 5-year-olds was consistently identified across informants and assessment contexts. Effects of the shared environment were identified as well but with less consistency (i.e., only from parents, not teachers, and more from father than mother reports). Correlations between observed patterns of regulation at ages 3, 4, and 5 years and behavior problems at age 5 years were often significant, but low in magnitude and specific to teacher reports. Adaptive internalization of control at each age (e.g., frustration tolerance, capacity to attend and focus, good impulse control) predicted fewer externalizing problems. Internalization of standards, reflected in children's moral themes, understanding of reciprocity, and constructive social problem solving, also were sometimes associated with fewer problems. Significant correlations were low in magnitude and again specific to teacher reports. Externalizing problems were more prevalent for boys than girls, and regulation (i.e., internalization of control and standards) was more characteristic of girls than boys.

AB This study examined the effects of stressful environments on physiological and affective functioning among 131 maltreated school-aged children attending a summer day camp. Sixty-six nonmaltreated children also attending the camp served as a comparison group. Salivary cortisol measures were obtained daily at 10:00 a.m. and at 4:00 p.m. Depression was measured using the Child Depression Inventory. Children with scores of 19 or higher were classified as depressed. Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were determined from the Teacher Report Form of the Child Behavior Checklist. Children with t scores of 70 or higher were classified as having clinical levels of these problems. Maltreated children had slightly elevated afternoon cortisol concentrations, but their morning concentrations did not differ significantly from those of nomnaltreated children. Neither clinical levels of depression, internalizing, or externalizing problems were predictive of the elevated afternoon values. Depression among maltreated children was, however, associated with altered activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Depressed maltreated children had lower morning cortisol concentrations compared to nondepressed maltreated children and were more likely to show a rise rather than the expected decrease in cortisol from morning to afternoon. These data replicated earlier findings. There was no evidence that depressed, nonmaltreated children exhibited this change in diurnal cortisol activity.

AB Investigated the effects of self-regulation as a moderator of the relations between coping efforts and psychological symptoms of children of divorce. The interactions of two dimensions of self-regulation (task orientation and approach-flexibility) and two dimensions of coping (active and avoidant) predicting children's postdivorce symptoms were tested using a sample of 199 divorced mothers and their children, ages 8 to 12. The approach-flexibility dimension moderated the relations of both active and avoidant coping with children's self-report of anxiety. At higher levels of approach-flexibility, active coping was negatively related to anxiety, while at lower levels of approach-flexibility, active coping was unrelated to anxiety Avoidant coping was unrelated to anxiety at higher levels of approach-flexibility, whereas at lower levels of approach-flexibility, avoidant coping was positively related to anxiety. The task orientation dimension did not interact with coping, but had direct, independent effects on children's self-report of conduct problems, depression, and parent-report of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The implications for understanding children's coping with divorce and future directions for research are discussed.

AB Examined maternal-reported behavior problems of Israeli children between the ages of 2 and 4 years. Seventy-two mothers of Jewish toddlers and 72 mothers of Palestinian toddlers completed the Child Behavior Checklist/2-3 and 1992 Profile (Achenbach, 1992). No differences were found for the Total Behavior Problem score, or for Externalizing and Internalizing scores. The Palestinian children were rated as having significantly more problems associated with anxiety and depression, and boys from both groups were rated as having more somatic problems. There were also culture and sex differences in borderline and clinical levels of behavior problems. Findings are discussed in terms of the different childrearing environments, the paucity of research on the development of Palestinian children, and, therefore, the need for future research in this area.

AB Investigated psychological functioning of 45 children and adolescents (ages 5 to 17 years) and their parents presenting at a major medical center for evaluation for lung transplantation. Patients completed self-reports, and parents completed measures on their children's behavior problems and emotional distress as well as on their own symptoms of distress. In general, children and their parents reported normal functioning on standard psychological measures. Few children fell in the clinically significant range, whereas 21% of mothers and 14% of fathers reported clinically significant levels of distress. Older children reported lower levels of depressive symptoms than younger children, and patients with cystic fibrosis manifested lower levels of internalizing symptoms than those with other pulmonary diseases. Findings demonstrate the resiliency of children and their parents facing a stressful point in the child's medical status and document the usefulness of psychological screening of patients and parents to identify those in need of clinical intervention.

AB This study compared perceived relationships and interaction patterns among 44 families with externalizing( polydrug-dependent),internalizing( bulimic), or normal adolescent daughters. Data from L. S. Benjamin's (1974) structural analysis of social behavior rating scales and observational coding system were subjected to a pattern analysis of effect sizes. Results revealed that families of polydrug-dependent girls were less well attached and less autonomous than were families of daughters with bulimia who were, in turn, less attached and autonomous than controls. Observed interactions also showed that parents of drug-dependent teenagers communicated a mixed message of blaming the daughter while pseudo-affirming her. The findings were interpreted as evidence for specific disturbances in the critical elements of attachment and autonomy in both clinical disorders, with more pronounced and pervasive problems in the families of polydrug-dependent girls.

AB A multimethod assessment of features of social anxiety, which are also common in depression, was conducted with a design that allowed for evaluation of each state alone and in combination. From a community sample of 211 eight to twelve year-olds, four groups of children were defined: mixed; socially anxious; dysphoric; and control. Results provided evidence of the confounding between social anxiety and dysphoria, as the presence or absence of dysphoria exerted significant effects on the associated features of social anxiety. The mixed group was the most dysfunctional on almost all measures. General fears were more specific to social anxiety, and academic problems were more linked to dysphoria. Social anxiety and dysphoria were each associated with significant levels of fears regarding failure and criticism, low levels of self-worth, and negative self-perceptions that extended beyond the social domain. Social acceptance problems were not significantly present for the socially anxious group, but they were significant for the mixed group. Theoretical and methodological implications of the results are highlighted, and a possible temporal and theoretical relationship between social anxiety and depression in youth is put forth.

AB Objective: To examine the relation between severity of tic disorder and comorbid psychopathology in 47 prepubertal children with tic disorder who were referred for clinical evaluation of and treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional behaviors, and aggressive behaviors. Method: Parents and teachers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF) for each child. Results: Seventy-five percent of the sample was in the clinical range in at least two categories of psychopathology. When the children were divided into two groups on the basis of tic severity, significantly higher scores were obtained for children with more severe tics on the narrow-band Depressed, Uncommunicative, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Aggressive scales, and the broad-band internalizing scale oi the CBCL. The severity groups did not differ on TRF scores. Children who were more aggressive also received higher CBCL scores. Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that the severity of chronic ties is a clinical indicator of complex psychopathology in children with ADHD who are referred for psychiatric evaluation.

AB Objective: To examine the full spectrum of psychiatric comorbidity in juvenile obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in a naturalistic manner when no exclusionary criteria are used for sample selection. Method: Consecutive referrals to a specialized pediatric OCD clinic were evaluated by means of structured diagnostic interviews and rating scales. No exclusionary criteria were used for sample selection. Findings were compared with those of previously published reports of juvenile OCD. Results: Compared with previous studies, our sample of juveniles with OCD had high rates of comorbidity not only with tie, mood, and anxiety disorders but also with disruptive behavior disorders. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that in the naturalistic setting, juvenile OCD is heavily comorbid with both internalizing and externalizing disorders. The presence of such a complex comorbid state has important clinical and research implications and stresses the relevance of limiting exclusionary criteria in studies of juvenile OCD.

AB Objective: To evaluate the long-term effects of an early home-based intervention on the quantity and quality of psychiatric symptoms in adolescents. Method: The material consisted of 160 families with a baby born in 1975-1976. First, the families were classified with a weighted risk index into low- and high-risk families. Eighty families attended a 5-year-long family counseling program (10 times/year). The other half of the families served as a control group for the effects of counseling. The mental state of the adolescents was assessed at age 14 to 15 years by the Child Behavior Checklist and the Youth Self-Report. Results: The adolescents in the counseling families scored significantly fewer total symptoms on both the parent and the youth reports. The counseling reduced more effectively internalizing than externalizing symptoms. The counseling predicted better mental health in adolescence in both low- and high-risk families, Conclusions: Home-based early intervention can have positive long-term effects on the mental state of adolescents. These results can be used when programs for primary prevention in families with small children are planned.

AB Objectives. To investigate the association between childhood hay fever and emotional and behavioural disturbances.
   Design. Cross-sectional controlled clinical study. The hay fever group was compared with an age-matched control group without any atopic symptoms. Mean age for the groups was 7.8 years (SD 0.7).
   Method. The dependent variables were normalized t-scores on the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL 4-16, version 2.2; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983). In series of ANOVAs, the hay fever group (N = 43, 23 boys and 20 girls) was compared with healthy controls (N = 51, 28 boys and 23 girls).
   Results. The hay fever group had significantly higher scores on depression, withdrawal, somatic complaints and aggression. They also had a significantly higher total problem score and higher scores on the internalizing and the externalizing scales. There were no differences on the social competence scales.
   Conclusions. Children suffering from hay fever show other behavioural and emotional coping patterns than normals. Investigators should be reluctant in attributing the CBCL somatic symptom scale to psychological disturbances.

AB The present study examined dichotomies potentially relevant to parent-child and interparent agreement in the assessment of internalizing problems in youngsters. Specifically, 98 children and their parents completed the Daily Life Stressors Scale or a variant to examine child ratings of daily stress, parent ratings of their children's daily stress, and parent predictions of how their children would self-rate their stress. In addition, a distinction was made between subscores of negative affectivity and stressful life events. Results indicated moderate parent-child and interparent agreement, with the latter somewhat more influenced by a negative affectivity-stressful events dichotomy. Parent-child agreement appeared more enhanced for items involving more parental contact. Implications of these data for future research are discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results: Significantly more difficulties were found in the siblings of children with PDD compared with the other two groups. Different correlates of adjustment were present in the siblings of the disabled compared with nondisabled children, and mediating factors differed in parent and teacher reports of internalizing difficulties in siblings of children with PDD. Marital satisfaction, lack of parental depression, a cohesive family, and a warm, nonconflictual sibling relationship were protective for normal control and Down syndrome siblings but not for PDD siblings. Conclusion: Findings underline the risks for the siblings of children with PDD and suggest the importance of a transactional mechanism rather than identification of single risk or protective factors in predicting sibling adjustment. Subsequent data analysis in this longitudinal study will assist in defining these mechanisms and allow for improved intervention strategies.

TI Parental rearing practices, fearfulness, and problem behaviour in

ID METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION
AB The present study investigated the relationship between parental rearing behaviours on the one hand and 'psychopathology' (i.e. fearfulness and problem behaviour) on the other hand in a group of clinically referred children. In order to examine this issue, children completed the child version of the EMBU (i.e. an inventory for assessing their parents' rearing practices) and the Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC) (Ollendick, 1983). Parents filled in the parent version of the EMBU and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983). It was found that some subscales of both the parent and the child version of the EMBU were unreliable in terms of internal consistency. By means of a factor analytic procedure, two new EMBU scales were created: 'positive rearing behaviour' and 'negative rearing behaviour'. Results further revealed a low degree of agreement between parents and children in reports of parental rearing behaviours. No association was found between parental rearing practices and fearfulness/internalizing problem behaviour. However, a positive relationship did emerge between negative rearing practices and externalizing problem behaviours. Finally, parental rearing behaviours in children with anxiety disorders were similar to those in clinically referred children who did not suffer from a severe type of psychopathology. Children with disruptive behaviour disorders, however, exhibited an aberrant pattern of rearing practices: in these children relatively more negative and less positive upbringing behaviours were observed.

AB Twenty-six of 30 participants (87%) who took part in a medication study for treatment of ADHD were followed up 2.9 to 4.8 years (Mean = 3.9 years) later: Parent ratings on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Community (ABC-C) indicated continued problems on the acting-out subscales, and parent assessments on the Stony Brook Checklist-3R showed a high rate of difficulty on domains called ADHD, Conduct Disorder; and Separation Anxiety Disorder: A high percentage of children (69%) were taking psychotropic drugs, substantial numbers of their families had sought nonmedical treatments, children's friendships were often rudimentary and a significant minority of children had disciplinary problems in school or difficulty with the law Using Pearson correlations we identified a number of initial variables that predicted follow-up parent ratings on the ABC-C and Stony Brook The ABC-C Irritability subscale was useful in predicting both internalizing and externalizing problems at follow-up, whereas parent and teacher hyperactivity subscales failed to predict later hyperactivity. Children identified with both low intelligence and ADHD appear to have significant behavioral and emotional problems in their early adolescence, and there may be some important qualitative differences in the outcome of these youngsters as compared with that of children identified with ADHD and normal IQ.

AB In order to identify the correlates of the behavioral maladjustment of children in foster care, a group of children in foster care who had been referred for therapy was compared to a group of children who had never been in therapy during their foster care placement on several relevant variables. Referred and nonreferred children differed on several important behavioral indicators: number of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, behavioral competence, and mental age. Results of this comparison suggest that the age of the child when first placed in care, the number of different placements the child experiences during care, and the type of foster care placement (kinship vs. nonkinship) may all be related to the need for clinical services in this population. Theoretical and practical implications of these relationships are explored.

AB In the context of a school-based prevention of conduct disorder program, 7,231 first- through fourth-grade children were screened for cross-setting disruptive behavior. Frequencies of DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders and patterns of comorbidity were assessed We also examined the association of psychiatric diagnosis with child and parent characteristics to determine differential risk based on diagnostic subgroups. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) were the most frequent diagnoses. Mood and anxiety disorders were infrequent as single diagnoses. Patterns of comorbidity demonstrated that both externalizing and internalizing disorders commonly cooccurred with ADHD. More severe degrees of psychopathology and psychosocial risk accrued to the subgroup of youths with ADHD plus a comorbid externalizing disorder.

Latent class analyses were applied to determine the makeup of basic patterns of co-occurring syndromes. Results suggest that comorbidity and the type of comorbidity pattern are related to residence. Gender and ethnicity are also related to pattern. Aggression seems to be a central. aspect of the type of co-occurring patterns found among urban poor children, its presence relates to poorer functioning, particularly in conjunction with internalizing syndromes.

ID FOLLOW-UP; HIERARCHY; STYLES
AB Objective: To modify an existing instrument to provide a valid assessment of defense mechanisms in adolescents and to examine defense structure and usage as a function of age, sex, and mental health status. Method: Six hundred ninety-three subjects (187 nonclinic adolescents, 229 internalizing females, 99 incarcerated male delinquents, and 178 nonclinic adults) completed the modified Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ), which yielded 19 defense scores. Results: Factor analyses of the 19 defense scores on the adolescent sample yielded three factors: Immature, Mature, and Prosocial Defenses. These were similar to those from studies of adults. Additional factor analyses were conducted on defense scores of subjects grouped by age, sex, and mental health status. The Immature and Mature Factors were relatively consistent across groups, but the Prosocial Factor varied by group. Multivariate analyses of variance and analyses of variance on individual and composite defense scores revealed differences by age, sex, and mental health status. Conclusions: Although the modified DSQ needs further work to improve its psychometric properties, it is clearly fruitful to assess adolescent defense mechanisms. Results from extant studies of adults and males on the structure of defenses cannot be validly extrapolated to other age groups and to females.

At age 2 children and mothers had been observed Parents' coercion and fathers' negotiation correlated concurrently, and mothers' comparable behavior at child age 2 correlated longitudinally with children's manipulation, negotiation, externalizing, and social competence. For girls, parents' reported or observed coercion was associated with less competent, noncoercive peer conflict strategies, and higher internalizing Children's observed defiance and compliance at age Z predicted self-reported peer behavior and rated adjustment and social competence at age 6, with differences by child gender.

AB From teachers' rating in kindergarten through third grade, mutually exclusive groups of internalized, externalized, and mixed behavior problems were examined as pathways to three groups of psychiatric diagnosis in later adolescence: depression/anxiety, conduct/oppositional defiant, and other disorders. In looking both forward and backwards, the relation between behavior problems in the early school years, regardless of type, and psychopathology in adolescence, regardless of diagnosis, was very strong. The relations between type of early problems and specific outcomes were weak. The findings provided support for both the constructs of multifinality and equifinality; however the nature of the pathways differed somewhat by disorder. There was a substantial amount of multifinality (dispersion of outcomes) for the early internalizing pathway. There was less multifinality for the externalizing pathway, in that there was greater correspondence between early externalizing and later antisocial outcomes than for the internalizing pathway and depressed/anxious outcomes.

The infants of dysphoric mothers had lower interaction ratings and lower heart rate variability. At the preschool stage, the dysphoric dyads also had lower interaction ratings, and the dysphoric mothers rated their preschool children as being more vulnerable and having more internalizing (depressed) and externalizing problems (aggressive and destructive). Only the internalizing and externalizing problems at preschool age were significantly related to infancy stage measures, including the Profile of Mood States (mothers' depressed mood), the infants' interaction ratings, and heart rate range during interactions with a stranger and the infants' weight. These infancy variables may be early markers for later behavior problems.

Children in Grades 4, 5, 7, and 8 (N = 417) reported on their use of five coping responses when exposed to conflict they observed between the adults in their homes and between their peers. Although children reported using the same relative pattern of coping responses across situations (i.e, distancing/denial the most, support seeking the least), they used a much higher level of internalizing/worrying responses when exposed to the adult conflict situation than the peer conflict situation. Sex and development differences were not consistent across observed interpersonal conflict situations.

AB Gender differences in self-reported internalizing symptoms of children in grades 3 - 6 were investigated. Using the internalizing Symptoms Scale far Children (ISSC), and normative data from a large, nationwide sample, self-reported internalizing symptom scores of boys (n = 876) were compared to those of girls (n = 840). Total internalizing scores of girls were significantly (p < .001) larger than those of boys, indicating a higher degree of self-reported internalizing symptoms. The average scores of the girls were approximately one third of a standard deviation higher than the average scares of the boys. Using a discriminant function analysis, the ISSC item scores were found to be reasonably effective in classifying subjects by gender. Seven critical self-report items that contributed the most to the separation of subjects by gender were identified. implications of this study for psychoeducational assessment practice, early identification of internalizing problems, and subsequent intervention efforts are discussed.

AB We assessed the effects of a package consisting of self-evaluation via videotape feedback procedures on inappropriate and appropriate peer interactions of children with externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems. The children were selected from three inclusive classrooms, and all of the experimental sessions included peers who did not evidence behavioral problems. Multiple baseline and reversal designs were used to evaluate the impact of the intervention package on the diverse patterns of behavior displayed by the different groups of children. The results showed substantial increases in appropriate interactions for children with internalizing behavioral problems and substantial decreases in inappropriate interactions for children with externalizing behavioral problems. Two measures of social validity confirmed the presence of the externalizing and internalizing characteristics and offered validation for the effects of the intervention. The results are discussed in relation to the existing literature and the need for further research on social skills, generalization, and comprehensive support for children with emotional and behavioral problems.

AB Children considered to be at high risk (n = 30), moderate risk (n = 55), and low risk (n = 30) for behavioral disorders were contrasted on cognitive/achievement social competence, externalizing behavior, and school history variables. Risk status was based on a 33-item checklist known as the Critical Events Index (Walker & Severson, 1990) that is a measure of behavioral pinpoints having high salience and intensity, but relatively low frequency Multivariate and univariate analyses showed that the three at-risk groups were differentiated primarily on social competence and externalizing behavior measures. Cross-validated stepwise discriminant function analyses contrasting the High Risk and the Low Risk groups using combinations of social competence, externalizing, internalizing, and school history variables correctly identified over 85% of the High Risk group and over 78% of the Low Risk group. Discriminant function analysis based soley on externalizing behaviors created an unacceptable false negative rate for risk status. Findings are discussed within the context of teacher judgments, critical behavioral events as being ''vital signs'' of childhood psychopathology, and the need for multimethod assessments of critical events.

AB Objective: To assess the behavioural and academic improvement of children who attended a day treatment program during a defined period of time.
   Method: Forty-six children admitted consecutively to the project were assessed on admission and discharge using behavioural and academic measures. They also had intelligence and language assessments. The subjects attended the program for one academic year, on the average. The large majority presented with disruptive behaviour disorders and low academic achievement levels.
   Results: There was a significant improvement reported by the parents in externalizing (P < 0.001) and internalizing (P < 0.05) behaviour. The subjects also gained one academic year, but their levels continued to be low in terms of percentiles. Measures of academic improvement showed significant associations with cognitive measures only (subscales of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised [WISC-R] and Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised [CELF-R]).
   Conclusion: A day treatment and school program is an effective modality for treatment and remediation of children with severe psychiatric disorders. The academic underachievement may be resistant to remediation within the limited period of attendance in such a program.

AB Objective: To determine whether the psychiatric profile of children in foster care is more similar to clinical or community profiles.
   Method: Caregiver and teacher ratings of DSM-III-R externalizing and internalizing symptoms were collected for 3 groups of children: children in foster care, children assessed at a children's mental health centre, and a community sample.
   Results: Children in foster care approximated the numbers and types of symptoms of the clinical sample. Coming from a family on social assistance, having a parent with a criminal history, and being of the male gender were correlated with higher externalizing and internalizing symptom scores independent of group membership. Group membership accounted for less than 5% of the variance in psychiatric symptom scores.
   Conclusions: The high symptom burden of children in care is substantially attributable to their high-risk histories, and treatment should be designed with this in mind.

AB This study examined the initial effects of sexual abuse on 70 girls aged 3 to 5 years. They were compared to a control group of 42 nonabused nonclinical girls matched for age. Of the 70 girls in the abused group, the 42 who had experienced intrafamilial abuse were also compared to the 28 who had experienced extrafamilial abuse. Evaluation of effects was based on maternal reports and very importantly, given this young age group, on direct observation. Children from both abuse groups displayed more evidence of distress on ail measures. In particular, more sexual behaviors and more internalizing problem behaviors were reported and observed. Girls who were abused by a member of their family demonstrated some elevations in symptomatology, but generally there was not a significant difference between the two abuse groups. Poorer outcome was associated with a more noxious family environment and with repeated, more invasive abuse. The association of abuse and family characteristics that exacerbated the effects of sexual abuse on the child underscores the need for early detection and careful clinical assessment of the family as well as the child.

AB Genetic and environmental influences on problem behaviors were studied in 3-year-old twins. Fathers' and mothers' ratings of problem behaviors in twins - 236 monozygotic (MZ) girls, 210 MZ boys, 238 dizygotic (DZ) girls, 265 DZ boys, and 409 DZ opposite sex pairs - were obtained with the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 2-3 (T. M. Achenbach, 1992). Twin correlations and results from a model fitting approach showed that genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental influences accounted on average for about 64%, 9%, and 27% of the variance. Although shared environmental influences were small for most scales, they were important for Total Problems and somewhat larger for Externalizing than for Internalizing behaviors. Significant sex differences in genetic and environmental influences and evidence for sibling contrast effects were found for the Overactive scale.

AB Clinicians often identify parent-child relationships that are believed to be problematic for the child's future emotional growth, yet there are minimal outcome data on which to base anticipatory guidance. This e-year follow-up study examined the stability and child behavioral correlates of parental perceptions of increased child vulnerability and parental overprotection. Of 192 potential participants, 114 parents (93% mothers, 86% white, 75% married, 90% middle-upper socioeconomic status) with children age 4 to 7 years successfully completed the Parent Protection Scale, Child Vulnerability Scale, Child Behavior Checklist 4-18, and the Parental Bonding Instrument. The e-year stability of high parental overprotection was 37%; for high parental perception of child vulnerability, it was 31%. High perceived vulnerability at enrollment was significantly associated with both internalizing (somatic complaints, anxious/depressed) and externalizing (aggressive) behaviors at follow-up. A history of overprotection in the parent's childhood was not associated with current parental report of overprotective behaviors toward the child.

AB Twenty 6- to 17-year-old children with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) were compared to 20 age- and sex-matched siblings on a wide range of neuropsychological and behavioral dimensions. In familial cases, diagnostic status was confirmed by gene linkage with greater than 98% accuracy. Visual examinations that included assessments of visual evoked responses (VER) were performed on subjects with NF1. Forty-two percent of NF1 subjects had abnormal VER and underwent magnetic resonance imagery or computed tomography scans of the brain. On a variety of skills, subjects with NF1 performed more poorly than unaffected siblings. Children with NF1 were found to be less competent on measures of cognitive, language, and motor development, visual-spatial judgment, visual-motor integration, and academic achievement. Learning disabilities were common in children with NF1. Parents and teachers reported that NF1 subjects had internalizing problems and difficulty interacting with peers. A behavioral phenotype for NF1 and recommendations for preventative interventions are proposed.

AB The present study addresses the issue of differential heritability with increasing severity of parent-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist. The sample includes 526 identical and 389 fraternal same-sexed twin pairs from five national birth cohorts, aged 5-6, 8-9, and 12-15 years. Heritability (h(2)), common environment (c(2)), and changes in these parameters as a function of proband score were analyzed by multiple regression models (Cherny et al., 1992). Internalizing and externalizing behavior showed significant heritability. A small increment in h(2) and a reduction of c(2) with increasing severity of externalizing behavior were independent of sex and age. For internalizing behavior h(2) increased and c(2) declined with increasing severity for the 5-6 and 8-9 year olds. Logarithmic transformation of scores lowered h(2) and increased c(2), particularly for externalizing behavior. The changes in heritability with severity were nonsignificant for the transformed variables.

AB A model that linked parental formal religiosity to children's academic competence and socioemotional adjustment during early adolescence was tested. The sample included 90 9- to 12-year-old African American youths and their married parents living in the rural South. The theoretical constructs in the model were measured through a multimethod, multi-informant design. Rural African American community members participated in the development of the self-report instruments and observational research methods. Greater parental religiosity led to more cohesive family relationships, lower levels of interparental conflict, and fewer externalizing and internalizing problems in the adolescents. Formal religiosity also indirectly influenced youth self-regulation through its positive relationship with family cohesion and negative relationship with interparental conflict.

AB Research on the effects of parental warmth and control on children's social and emotional development has been predominantly based on studies investigating between-family differences in parental behavior. More recently, behavior genetics research focusing on within-family differences has highlighted differential parental warmth and control as potential sources of sibling differences in behavior. The aim of this study was to test hypotheses, based on findings from several twin and adoption studies, that parental warmth is child specific and covaries with parents' perceptions of sibling behavioral differences, but parental control is similar for both siblings. The sample included 112 mothers and 98 fathers in middle-class families with two sibling children (1-10 years old). Parents' perceptions of their own negative affect and harsh control (physical and verbal) toward each sibling child, and their perceptions of their childrens' externalizing-type and internalizing-type behaviors, were measured. Although parental negative affect was child specific and covaried with perceptions of child externalizing-type behaviors, parental control was unrelated to perceptions of the siblings' behaviors. The contribution of both parent and child characteristics to parent-child transactions, and the value of within-family designs, are discussed.

TI Behavioral outcomes after pediatric closed head injury: Relationships
   with age, severity, and lesion size
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FOLLOW-UP; CHILDREN; SEQUELAE; MILD
AB This study investigated the behavioral outcomes and adaptive functioning of 138 children with mild to severe closed head injury in the 6- to 16-year age range. Each child was evaluated with the Personality Inventory for Children-Revised. A subset of this sample (n = 77) received the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Results revealed little evidence for group differences based on severity of closed head injury on scales associated with psychopathology on the Personality Inventory for Children-Revised. However, children with severe closed head injury were viewed as experiencing more difficulties than children with mild-moderate closed head injury on those components of the Personality Inventory for Children-Revised most closely associated with cognitive functions. In addition, on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, severely injured children had lower scores on the Communication and Socialization scales than children with mild-moderate injury, Relationships between the size of frontal and extrafrontal lesions from concurrent magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral outcomes were not apparent. This study suggests that outcome measures assessing adaptive behavior and cognitive functions are more sensitive to severity of closed head injury than parent-based scales of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.

LA English
DT Article
ID TEACHERS; DISORDER
AB In this study, gender differences in the referral of children to mental health services were investigated. A total of 135 first-, second-, and third-grade teachers read vignettes describing girls and boys with either externalizing or internalizing problems, and then evaluated the child described in each vignette concerning possible referral for mental hearth services. Results oi this study identified three factors that help explain gender differences in referral. First, teachers are more likely to believe that boys need referral because boys tend to have the types of problems (externalizing) that teachers regard as being more in need of referral. Second, teachers are generally less Likely to regard a child with problems as needing referral if that child is doing well academically (a pattern more common for girls). Third, teachers are less likely to believe that girls need referral because they are more optimistic that girls with problems will improve as they mature and that internalizing problems (the type girls tend io have) will improve through maturation. The implications of these findings for teacher training are discussed.

   children
SO PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS
LA English
DT Article
ID NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY; ANXIETY; DEPRESSION
AB As part of the validation research process for a new self-report social-emotional test for children, internalizing social-emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, somatic complaints, positive and negative affectivity) of a group of elementary-age gifted students (n = 65) were contrasted with those of a carefully matched (by gender and age) comparison group of non-gifted students (n = 65). Subjects completed the Internalizing Symptoms Scale for Children (ISSC) (Merrell & Walters, 1996), a self-report measure of internalizing symptoms, affect, and cognition. The gifted students reported significantly fewer internalizing symptoms than did the comparison group. An analysis of critical items separating the two groups indicated that the gifted students differed most substantially from their non-gifted peers on ISSC items that relate to self-efficacy and perceived self-importance. Although these types of self-perceptions are considered to be a peripheral rather than a central component of specific internalizing disorders, it is hypothesized that their positive presence in children may act as a ''buffering'' factor, possibly insulating children from insults to their social-emotional functioning that may lead to the development of internalizing forms of psychopathology. The results of this investigation are discussed in terms of their relationship to conflicting previous research in this area, to future research needs in the study of social-emotional symptoms and development of gifted children, and in terms of the construct validity evidence for the ISSC.

DT Article
AB In order to substantiate the need for a ''new'' moral education, the present debate on education refers to the stereotype of a ''crisis in political values and political orientation among the East-German youth''. In this, it is assumed that the adolescents internalized the values taught in the GDR. The author inquires into those attitudes by which students reacted to these contents without internalizing them. If, again, the attempt is made to teach students to appreciate material values, then this not only denies the normative idea embedded in the bourgeois order, but also, in a peculiar manner, links up with the educational concept which prevailed in the GDR.

AB The distribution and correlates of hypomanic personality traits were examined in a representative sample of 1709 adolescents. Hypomanic traits were assessed with an abbreviated version of Eckblad and Chapman's (1986) Hypomanic Personality Scale. Hypomanic traits were normally distributed and were slightly but significantly higher among females. Test-retest stability over a mean 14-month interval was 0.54. High scores were associated with elevated lifetime rates of mood, disruptive behavior and substance use disorders, Among subjects with no history of mood disorder, hypomanic traits were associated with a broad range of indices of psychosocial dysfunction, both concurrently and at 1-year follow-up. In addition, hypomanic personality traits predicted increased levels of impairment, in a number of areas, including depressive and internalizing symptomatology, over the course of the follow-up. Finally, among subjects with a past history of major depression, hypomanic traits were associated with a higher level of depression at the initial assessment, greater symptomatology and impairment during their worst episode, and higher rates of attempted suicide, comorbid disruptive behavior disorders and recurrent major depressive episodes.

DE attachment; behaviour problems; child care; cognitive development;

ID SECURITY; MOTHER; PEERS; LIFE
AB The possible implications of the experience of non parental care on cognitive development and on behaviour problems are considered in interaction with individual and contextual variables. A sample of 47 Swiss children who experienced varying kinds of care arrangements were studied longitudinally between I and 5 years of age. The effects of the experience of care were related to mothers' reports of behavioral problems (CBCL, with subscales of internalizing and of externalizing problems) at age 5, and to cognitive developmental quotients (at 1, 2 and 5 years). Several variables were considered for their potential interaction with the experience of care, such as the pattern of attachment to the mother (observed at 21 months of age in the ''Strange Situation''), characteristics of the experience of care (duration and type of care), its quality (relationship with non parental caregivers), the socio-economic status of the family, etc. The effect of non parental cave on behaviour problems (5 years) happened to be mediated by the the pattern of attachment to the mother: insecurely attached children had some risk to be reported as having externalizing problems, but this didn't occur when they had an extended experience of non parental care, and when non parental care was mainly family-based. The effect of non parental care on cognitive development was mediated by the quality of care: children with a positive contact with the caregivers had greater cognitive gains between 2 and 5 years; the relationship with the care-givers itself was influenced by the quality of the relationship with the mother. The limited size and origin of the sample restricts generalization, however these data might contribute to the notion that non parental care can have varying effects depending of the type of care, the quality of the relation with the caregivers, the age and personal traits of the child.

AB Chronic daily headache in children and adolescents has not been well described. We analyzed data for 37 children and adolescents who presented with chronic daily headache to our Pediatric Headache Clinic over a 2-year period. These youngsters had five distinct headache patterns; 40% of them had the ''comorbid'' pattern, 35% were classified with new daily persistent headache, 15% with transformed migraine, 5% with chronic tension-type headache, and 5% could not be classified.
   There were no significant differences by diagnosis in externalizing and internalizing behaviors, type A behaviors, disability, pain severity, days missed from school, and number of coping skills employed.
   Children and adolescents with chronic daily headache have distinct clinical patterns, but for the most part, have similar disability. Differences between adult and childhood chronic daily headache are emphasized.

AB Presented a multisite treatment-outcome study designed to investigate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral group therapy for clinically referred, socially incompetent children. The treatment was aimed at both externalizing and internalizing 8- to 12-year-old children. Seventy-two children referred to outpatient mental health centers for peer relationship problems received 20 weekly sessions of group treatment. Each treatment group consisted of 6 children. Thirty children acted as a waiting list control group. Treatment outcome was assessed by teacher and parent reports on social behavior, sociometrics, and self-reported social anxiety and negative self-evaluation. The results reveal that, after treatment, children exhibited more appropriate social behavior. An increase in peer acceptance and an increase in the number of friendships were found. These effects were sustained at 4- to 5-month follow-up assessments. Post hoc multivariate analyses of variance revealed no differential treatment effects for sex or type of behavior problems.

Children rated their parents, and parents rated themselves on the parental variables of warmth/acceptance and psychological autonomy/control. Similar constructs were rated by independent observers of family interaction generated via a revealed differences discussion task. Parents of children with anxiety disorders were rated by observers as less granting of psychological autonomy than controls. In addition, children with anxiety disorders rated both their mothers and fathers as less accepting than control children rated their parents. Results are discussed in terms of socialization, family systems, and attachment theories regarding the tolerance and acceptance of different and/or negative emotions within families. The possible relation of family interaction styles to the internalizing disorders in childhood is explored.

AB Two studies examined whether physical marital violence and other forms of marital aggression (e.g., threats, throwing objects) correlate with children's behavior problems in families marked by recent spousal violence. Study 1 included 55 families seeking marital therapy. Study 2 included 199 families at battered women's shelters. In the marital therapy sample, both physical marital violence and other forms of marital aggression correlated positively with children's externalizing problems. In the women's shelter sample, physical violence and other forms of marital aggression correlated positively with children's externalizing and internalizing problems. After accounting for the frequency of physical marital violence, forms of marital aggression other than physical violence still related to children's externalizing problems in the marital therapy sample and to children's internalizing problems in the women's shelter sample.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of DSM-III disorders among children who had been selected for study based on their maternal family history of alcoholism (either multigenerational alcoholism in the case of the high-risk group or no alcohol dependence in first- and second-degree relatives in the case of the control children). Method: Thirty-four boys and 42 girls with a mean age of 11.3 years (range 8 to 18) were evaluated. An equal number of children comprised the high- and low-risk groups and were gender- and age-matched using a yoked control design. Results: The highrisk children manifested more psychiatric diagnoses overall, and significantly more internalizing disorders than controls. The relative odds of a high-risk child's having a diagnosed disorder were increased when the child lived with a biological mother and a custodial father (biological, step, or adoptive) who were both alcoholic. This relationship was exacerbated by the child's being older than 13 years of age. Conclusions: Vertical transmission of maternal alcoholism is manifested in childhood and adolescence by the presence of increased psychopathology. This psychopathology occurred in offspring of alcoholics screened for major comorbidity, suggesting that it is unlikely that the increased psychopathology is due to cotransmission of affective or other psychopathology. The elevated risk of psychopathology in association with having an alcoholic mother was not further increased by the child's being older than 13 years of age, ii the father (custodial or only biological) was not alcoholic.

AB We compared clinical syndromes, expressed concerns, and personality styles of adolescent inpatients with substance use disorders (SUD; n = 44) vs. without substance use disorders (non-SUD; n = 61) using the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory. The two groups did not differ with regard to age, sex, ethnicity, functional severity, or the frequency of other major psychiatric disorders, and were drawn from the same overall sample population. SUD subjects showed significantly higher levels of delinquent predisposition and lower levels of anxiety. Consistent with these syndromal findings, we found that SUD subjects were characterized by higher levels of unruliness and social insensitivity and lower levels of submissiveness. Our findings suggest that, in severely disturbed adolescents who require psychiatric hospitalization, externalizing phenomena are closely associated with SUD. Our findings also suggest that internalizing problems also exist in SUD, although not at levels greater than that observed in non-SUD inpatients.

TI Israeli preschoolers under scud missile attacks - A developmental
   perspective on risk-modifying factors

AB Background: The devastating effects of traumatic events on children are modulated by risk and protective factors. This study examines the differential effects of traumatic displacement of preschool children and their families following Scud missile attacks on Israel during the Persian Gulf War.
   Methods: Three groups participated in the study: families displaced after their houses were damaged, undisplaced families from the same neighborhood (without home damage), and families from a distant city that was threatened but not directly attacked. Data concerning the traumatic event, the child (personality, internalizing, externalizing, and stress symptoms), the mother (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), and the family (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales) were gathered 6 months after the end of the war.
   Results: Displaced children and mothers showed higher externalizing and stress symptom levels compared with undisplaced and threatened subjects. Destruction of the house and displacement, but not mere distance from the missile impact, explained symptomatic behavior. Inadequate family cohesion predicted symptomatic reaction for 3- and 4-year-old children but not for older ones.
   Conclusions: Both human and nonhuman factors contribute to the preschool child's adaptive mechanisms that regulate environmental stressful stimuli. These risk-modifying factors become more autonomous of caretakers with increasing age.

AB Seventy adolescent mother-child dyads were assessed longitudinally to determine relationships among prenatal maternal knowledge and attitudes about parenting, evaluated in the 3rd trimester; postnatal maternal perceptions of parenting stress and child temperament as well as maternal interactional style, evaluated when children were 6 months of age; and intellectual, linguistic, and behavioral development at 3 years of age. Mothers who were more cognitively prepared for parenting had children who displayed better intellectual development and fewer internalizing and externalizing behavioral difficulties. Mothers who were less cognitively prepared for parenting prenatally perceived their parenting role as more stressful and their children as more difficult. Although maternal interactional style did not act as a mediator, perceptions at 6 months were found to mediate the relationship between prenatal cognitive readiness and child intelligence and internalizing behaviors.
