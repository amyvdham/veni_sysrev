AB Disordered eating and weight problems are associated with experiencing childhood abuse. While weight-related abuse (WRA; teasing and verbal abuse specific to one's weight) uniquely predicts disordered eating and mood problems in adulthood, the link between WRA and adult outcomes is largely unexplored. Relationships between perpetrators and victims (e.g., family member vs. stranger) have demonstrated an impact on outcomes in research on sexual abuse, and may elucidate important aspects of the relationship between psychopathology and abuse. Thus, we investigated the effect of the perpetrator's relationship to the victim on disordered eating symptoms in a population of young adults (N=371) oversampled for current overweight and obesity. Parent perpetration of WRA was the strongest predictor of both depression and abuse-related emotional impact ratings. In contrast, friend and classmate perpetration of WRA were the sole predictors of binge eating and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Results highlight the importance of investigating the impact of multiple types of perpetrators of WRA, as well as the need to examine family and other close relationships in the treatment of disordered eating and internalizing symptoms.

AB This study describes the development and evaluation of a new measure, the Teacher Responses to Anxiety in Children (TRAC) questionnaire in 74 primary school teachers. TRAC presents 9 hypothetical scenarios in which a child displays generalized anxiety/worry, social anxiety or separation anxiety symptoms. Teachers rate each scenario on six subscales that reflect different ways of responding to child anxiety. Overall, TRAC showed good internal reliability, with factor analytic results suggesting that it assesses three factors: Autonomy-Promoting, Anxiety-Promoting and Reward responses. Male teachers were significantly more likely than female teachers to use Anxiety-Promoting responses. More experienced teachers reported significantly more reinforcement of anxious avoidance than less experienced teachers, and teaching assistants reported significantly fewer overprotective responses. Teaching staff reported significantly more Autonomy-Promoting responses in social anxiety or generalised anxiety/worry scenarios compared to separation anxiety scenarios. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for teacher training in the management of child anxiety.

AB Objectives: There is a growing body of evidence revealing emotion regulation difficulties are a common factor in the development and maintenance of mental health problems in the general population, however relatively little is known of the emotion regulation strategies used by people with intellectual disabilities.
   Method: A qualitative approach was used to explore the emotion regulation strategies used by adults with a mild intellectual disability in interpersonal experiences. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 participants with the transcripts analyzed using Thematic Analysis.
   Results: Three main-themes, each with two sub-themes were identified; regulatory talk (sub-themes of 'self-talk' and 'talking about emotions in beneficial'), avoidance (sub-themes of 'avoidance is bad' and 'avoidance can be good') and cognitive strategies (sub-themes of 'cognitive distraction' and 'cognitive reappraisal').
   Conclusions: The main-themes and sub-themes suggest people with intellectual disabilities can use a range of strategies in different contexts. Research and clinical implications are discussed.

AB Objectives: This study analyzes the implications of today's highly altered maternal parenting behaviors on children's development and psychological health.
   Methods: The relationship between maternal parenting behaviors (support, psychological control, and anxious monitoring) and delayed identity development or identity diffusion as well as internalizing or externalizing symptomatology was investigated in a sample of 732 youths (301 adolescents, 351 young adults, and 80 patients). Cluster analysis identified two types of maternal parenting behaviors: authoritative maternal behavior and dysfunctional maternal behavior.
   Results: As expected, patients exhibited a high degree of dysfunctional maternal parenting behavior (low support, high psychological control), delayed identity development as well as elevated identity diffusion and symptomatology. Authoritative maternal parenting emerged as a protective factor in the prediction of identity diffusion and symptomatology. All three groups described a high degree of anxious maternal monitoring.
   Conclusions: The implications of changed maternal parenting behaviors on identity diffusion and symptomatology are discussed in light of societal changes and changing criteria of personality disorders in the new DSM-5.

AB Background and objectives: A better understanding of the relationships between empathy and internalizing disorders is needed to plan therapeutic interventions for children and adolescents. Several studies have revealed positive relations of internalizing symptoms to personal distress and affective empathy. However, there is a lack of studies that take into account the multidimensional nature of anxiety in its relation to empathy.Design: Structural equation modeling was used to test the moderated mediation model of the relations between empathy, depression and anxiety dimensions and the moderating role of gender on these associations in inpatient adolescents.Method: A total of 403 inpatient adolescents aged 12-17 years completed the Basic Empathy Scale, the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II.Results: Affective empathy was positively related to all the anxiety dimensions - most strongly to separation/panic and humiliation/rejection anxiety, whereas cognitive empathy was negatively related to social and separation/panic anxiety. Relations between affective and cognitive empathy and anxiety were partly mediated by depressive symptoms. No evidence of a moderating role of gender has been found.Conclusions: Our results suggest that processes associated with empathy may play a role in the development or maintenance of anxiety symptoms.

AB SYNOPSISObjective. This paper aimed to examine the contributions of a second assessment time point of attachment security, along with assessments of maternal behavior (sensitivity and autonomy support), to the prediction of children's behavior problems. Design. Maternal behavior and mother-child attachment were assessed in 73 mother-child dyads when children were between 15months and 26months old. Children's internalizing and externalizing problems were reported by their teachers in kindergarten and first grade. Results. Each assessment time point of attachment security, as well as maternal behavior, explained comparable portions of the variance in children's anxious/depressed behavior, jointly predicting more than three times the variance explained by either measure of attachment alone. Conclusion. Researchers should consider a multidimensional approach to the assessment of the quality of mother-child relationships, at least when attempting to explain the development of child internalizing problems.

AB The goal of this study was to examine the moderating role of youth sleep disturbance on the relationship between youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms and parent psychological distress. Participants were 225 youth (ages 8-17) and parent dyads attending a primary care clinic appointment. Participants completed questionnaires that assessed parent psychological distress, youth internalizing symptoms, youth externalizing symptoms, and youth sleep disturbance. Moderation analyses were conducted to examine whether youth sleep disturbance moderated the relationship between youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms and parent psychological distress. The interaction between youth internalizing symptoms and youth sleep disturbance was significantly related to parent psychological distress, such that having increased sleep disturbance amplified the positive relationship between internalizing symptoms and parent psychological distress. The moderation model explained 52% of the variance in parent psychological distress. The interaction between youth externalizing symptoms and youth sleep disturbance was also significantly related to parent psychological distress, such that increased sleep disturbance amplified the positive relationship between externalizing symptoms and parent psychological distress. This model accounted for 53% of the variance in parent psychological distress. Greater youth sleep disturbance strengthens the positive relationship between youth internalizing/externalizing symptoms and parent psychological distress. Accordingly, reducing youth sleep disturbance may serve as an appropriate intervention target in families experiencing increased parent psychological distress.

AB This study examined trajectories of psychopathology in a sample of low-income urban youth and tested exposure to community violence as a predictor of these trajectories. Self-report and parent-report survey measures of psychological problems and exposure to community violence were collected annually over 3 years from a sample of 364 fifth- to ninth-grade low-income urban youth (64% female; 95% youth of color). Linear growth models showed that youth experienced declines in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms across adolescence. Exposure to community violence was more strongly associated with externalizing symptoms than with internalizing symptoms but predicted declines in both types of symptoms. Results also indicated that youth reported more internalizing and externalizing symptoms than their parents reported for them. Exposure to community violence may explain unique trajectories of mental health problems among low-income urban youth. In addition, youth efforts to adopt a tough facade in the face of community violence could lead to higher rates of externalizing problems relative to internalizing problems, whereas desensitization processes may better explain reductions in both types of symptoms over time. Finally, youth report may be more valid than parent report in the context of urban poverty.

AB Internalizing disorders are common in individuals with ASD. Psychosocial interventions targeting these disorders in the ASD population have burgeoned in the last decade. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, modified for ASD, is the most frequently investigated model, although other interventions, including behaviour therapy, third-wave interventions, models targeting transdiagnostic constructs, and alternative interventions and treatment delivery methods are now emerging. This review provides a summary of the efficacy of these interventions in treating internalizing disorders in youth and adults with ASD. The barriers to accessing these treatments, which are experienced by many individuals with ASD and their families, as well as future research directions, are also discussed.

AB Previous prevention programmes have largely focused on the emotion regulation strategy of cognitive reappraisal. The present study is a feasibility trial that evaluates a prevention programme that teaches cognitive reappraisal, acceptance and problem-solving strategies. Ninety-six Year 10 high school students were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control condition. All participants completed scales evaluating emotion regulation difficulties, depression, anxiety and anger at baseline, post-intervention and at 6-month follow-up. In addition, the intervention condition completed a workshop evaluation questionnaire at post-intervention that included qualitative items. Mixed models for repeated measures and content analysis were used to analyse the data. Results suggested there were no statistical differences between the conditions although effect sizes suggested a small advantage favouring the control condition. On the qualitative evaluation, however, most participants reported important benefits in relation to improved emotion regulation abilities. These contrasting results are discussed and suggestions made for future research.

AB This study examined whether classroom quality is related to preschoolers' social-emotional functioning (social competence and behavior problems) and explored whether urbanicity (variation in geographic region: rural, small city, or large urban living) moderates this relation. Participants included 102 children (51% female) who were approximately 4.5 years old (M = 53.57 months, SD = 5.42). Fifty-one percent of children were enrolled in Head Start. Linear regression models indicated that classroom quality was moderately related to social competence and not significantly associated with behavior problems for the full sample; however, urbanicity moderated relations between quality and social competence and behavior problems. Specifically, higher classroom quality was significantly related to fewer externalizing behaviors and marginally related to fewer internalizing behaviors for children in rural communities, but not for children in small or large urban settings. Similarly, higher quality was associated with stronger social competence for children in small urban cities, but not for children in large urban cities. Discussion addresses the importance of the geographic regions families reside in as a context for children's development, and how early educational experiences may be particularly important for children living in rural and small urban communities.

AB Objective: Many children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience co-occurring neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, and those who do often exhibit higher levels of impairment than children with ADHD alone. This study provides a latent class analysis (LCA) approach to categorizing children with ADHD into comorbidity groups, evaluating condition expression and treatment patterns in each group. Methods: Parent-reported data from a large probability-based national sample of children diagnosed with ADHD (2014 National Survey of the Diagnosis and Treatment of ADHD and Tourette Syndrome) were used for an LCA to identify groups of children with similar groupings of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric comorbidities among children with current ADHD (n = 2495). Differences between classes were compared using multivariate logistic regressions. Results: LCA placed children who were indicated to have ADHD into 4 classes: (low comorbidity [LCM] [64.5%], predominantly developmental disorders [PDD] [13.7%], predominantly internalizing disorders [PID] [18.5%], and high comorbidity [HCM] [3.3%]). Children belonging to the HCM class were most likely to have a combined ADHD subtype and the highest number of impaired domains. Children belonging to the PDD class were most likely to be receiving school services, whereas children in the PID class were more likely to be taking medication than those belonging to the LCM class who were least likely to receive psychosocial treatments. Conclusion: Latent classes based on co-occurring psychiatric conditions predicted use of varied treatments. These findings contribute to the characterization of the ADHD phenotype and may help clinicians identify how services could be best organized and coordinated in treating ADHD.

AB Objective: Prevention of child behavior problems may reduce later mental health problems. We compared the effectiveness, at the population level, of an efficacious targeted prevention program alone or following a universal parenting program. Methods: Three-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial. One thousand three hundred fifty-three primary caregivers and healthy 8-month-old babies recruited from July 2010 to January 2011 from well-child centers (randomization unit). Primary outcome: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) externalizing and internalizing scales* at child ages 3 and 4.5 years. Secondary outcomes: Parenting Behavior Checklist* and over-involved/protective parenting (primary caregiver report). Secondary caregivers completed starred measures at age 3. Results: Retention was 76% and 77% at ages 3 and 4.5 years, respectively. At 3 years, intention-to-treat analyses found no statistically significant differences (adjusted mean difference [95% confidence interval (CI); p-value]) for externalizing (targeted vs usual care -0.2 [-1.7 to 1.2; p = .76]; combined vs usual care 0.4 [-1.1 to 1.9; p = .60]) or internalizing behavior problems (targeted vs usual care 0.2 [-1.2 to 1.6; p = .76]; combined vs usual care 0.4 [-1.1 to 2.0; p = .58]). Primary outcomes were similar at 4.5 years. At 3 years, primary and secondary caregivers reported less over-involved/protective parenting in both the combined and targeted versus usual care arm; secondary caregivers also reported less harsh discipline in the combined and targeted versus usual care arm. Mean program costs per family were A$218 (targeted arm) and A$682 (combined arm). Conclusion: When translated to the population level by existing staff, pre-existing programs seemed ineffective in improving child behavior, alone or in combination, but improved parenting.

AB Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment may have devastating consequences on children's development. The aim of this research was to examine the predictive associations between exposure to violence at home (witnessing violence against the mother and/or direct victimization by the parents) and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. A total of 613 Spanish adolescents (13-18 years) took part in this study. Results indicate that psychological victimization by the parents predicted an increase in anxious/depressive symptoms, aggressive and rule-breaking behavior, and substance abuse at Time 2. In addition, rule-breaking behavior predicted an increase in adolescents' substance abuse at Time 2. Concerning gender, psychological victimization predicted an increase in anxiety/depression, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and substance abuse in boys; whereas in girls, psychological victimization only predicted an increase in anxiety/depression.

AB Background/Aim. The family functioning and characteristics are the major risk factors in the genesis and persistence of mental disorders in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of functioning of family with mentally ill children and adolescents. Methods. This study explored 47 families with a child/adolescent suffering from mental disorders and 47 families of age matched healthy children/adolescents. The socio-demographic questionnaire, Social Adaptation Self-evaluation scale (SASS) and Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES III) (Olson, 1983) were completed by parents. Results. For all three FACES III dimensions multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed significant differences between groups (Wilks lambda = 887; F = 3.839; df = 3; p = 0.012). Univariate analysis results showed significant differences for cohesiveness F = 6.99 p = 0.001 and adaptability F = 10.07 p = 0.001. The analysis of the social adaption (SASS) assessment showed that the mean score for clinical vs. non-clinical group was 39.66 +/- 6.82 vs. 38.06 +/- 8.44 without significant difference between groups (p = 0.32). The families of mentally ill children showed frequently lower socioeconomic status and education level, higher number of children per family, and broken home. Conclusion. The results suggested that cohesiveness and adaptability were significantly more prominent among families with mentaly ill children, but adaptation was similar to families with healthy children. It would be useful to evaluate adaptability, cohesiveness and adaptation of primary families when planning prevention and rehabillitation of mentally ill children and adolescent.

AB Sexual abuse of males is common. While a wide body of literature examines the behavioral, emotional, and social consequences associated with being sexually abused, comparatively few studies have focused on males. This study addresses this gap by examining the influence of family and peer context on long- term behavioral outcomes in a nationally representative, longitudinal, multi-informant sample of sexually abused boys 5 years after initial involvement in the child welfare system (N = 171). Cumulative family risk conferred greater risk for internalizing and externalizing problems over time while social skills had a buffering effect. Peer rejection had a more prominent role in influencing internalizing outcomes; however, this influence did not extend to externalizing problems. These findings lend support to the growing body of research underscoring the dynamic and complex relationship between behavioral problems across development. As prevention and intervention efforts for males are developed, it is critical to consider sexual abuse victimization and the multi-systemic risk and resilience processes.

AB OBJECTIVE: In the last decade, using social network sites (SNSs) has grown and become an integral part of daily routine for adolescents. As known, ADHD is a major public health problem for all addiction types, including the Internet and SNSs addiction. Our aim was to examine the effect of ADHD, impulsivity types, using motivations, internalizing and externalizing symptoms on Facebook (FB) overuse and FB addiction among adolescents.
   METHODS: Participants were recruited from ADHD and non-ADHD adolescents who were applied to the child and adolescent psychiatry and have an active FB account. We used FB Use and Motivations Form, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), Bergen FB Addiction Scale (BFAS) and Conners-Wells' Adolescent Self-Report Scale-Long form (CASS: L).
   RESULTS: Our results indicated that ADHD adolescents have more fake FB accounts, have their own accounts for longer time, are using FB for more motivation types and FB overuse is more frequent than in non-ADHD counterparts. According to the degree of FB use, we have shown that adolescents with FB overuse behaviour have more externalizing symptoms and have higher CASS: L and Barrat impulsivity scores than others. Risk factors for FB overuse are: having a fake FB account and having higher ADHD index scores; risk factors for FB addiction are: higher attentional impulsivity, higher conduct problems scores and higher ADHD index scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have improved our understanding about the risk factors of a new behavioural addiction type among adolescents.

The relationship of existing differences with psychosocial difficulties of having a parent with schizophrenia was evaluated.
   METHOD: The sample of the study consisted of 35 HR and 30 control offspring aged 7-16 years. All parents were assessed using the SCID-I by a psychiatrist and offspring using the K-SADS-PL by a child psychiatrist. Information about the early developmental stages and academic difficulties of children were obtained through interviews with healthy parents. Emotional and behavioural problem levels of children were determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV Questionnaire (SNAP-IV), the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), and the Child Depression Inventory (CDI). All assessments were adjusted for socio-demographic variables.
   RESULTS: The rates of generalized anxiety disorders, delayed walking, delayed speech and reading difficulties, the levels of conduct problems (CP), depression, and school phobia were significantly higher in HR offspring than in control. When adjusted for socio-demographic variables, the presence of delayed speech and reading difficulties and only CP levels continued to be significantly higher in HR group (p < .05). These differences were not associated with gender of ill parent, duration of parental illness, and hospitalization in affected group (p > .05).
   CONCLUSION: Internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression are considered as a psychosocial result of having a schizophrenic parent. The higher rates of speech delay, reading difficulties, and CP level might be genetically associated with schizophrenia.

AB Child sexual abuse can have long-term negative impacts across psychological, physical, and interpersonal domains. Some of the common issues for survivors of sexual abuse include shame and self-blame, attachment-based difficulties, avoidant coping strategies, and reduced capacity for self-compassion. Compassion-focused therapy is a transdiagnostic intervention that specifically responds to these concerns. Compassion-focused therapy was originally developed for clients who experience high levels of shame and self-criticism and aims to strengthen the soothing and affiliative system through the cultivation of compassion. This article will highlight the theoretical alignment between some of the common issues and impacts associated with experiences of sexual abuse, with the core underlying principles of compassion-focused therapy. This includes (a) the capacity of the therapy's evolutionary framework to reduce perceptions of self-blame, (b) the cultivation of compassion to respond to feelings of shame, (c) acknowledgment of the role of early attachment experiences and facilitation of corrective affiliative experiences, (d) regulation of the threat-based system following trauma, and (e) provision of an alternative to avoidant-based coping by responding to distress with compassion. It is proposed that the theoretical framework and core focus and aims of compassion-focused therapy are highly applicable for survivors of sexual abuse and therefore holds significant promise as a treatment option for this client group.

AB The present study's first aim is to verify whether depressive symptoms, measured at 87-hours and at 3-months post-partum, are associated with maternal mind-mindedness (the proclivity to treat infants as individuals with minds) and children's behavior (at 17months, T3). The second aim is to investigate, at T3, whether maternal mind-mindedness mediates the relationship between depressive symptoms and children's behavior. 46 mother-infant dyads participated in the study. No correlations are found among early depressive symptoms, mind-mindedness, and children's behaviors. At T3, impaired mind-mindedness mediates the effects of cognitive depressive symptoms on children's internalizing behaviors. Somatic symptoms, conjointly with impaired mind-mindedness, predicted externalizing behaviors.

AB A shared consensus among researchers deals with the positive association between the ability to effectively regulate and manage one's emotion and the engagement in empathic behavior and morally desirable actions. This study was designed to investigate how dispositional reliance on suppression and reappraisal differently impacted on the cognitive and affective components of empathy and on social conduct, distinguishing among prosocial, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors. Two hundred nineteen middle adolescents were enrolled and fulfilled self-reports assessing emotion regulation strategies, empathy, and social behaviors. The results suggest that there are important distinctions among the emotion regulation strategies and the components of empathy as they relate to one another and to prosocial behavior and problem conduct. Specifically, cognitive reappraisal was related to prosocial behavior through empathic concern. While internalizing behavior was associated with emotion regulation strategies, externalizing behavior was only related to perspective-taking ability. Delimitations and practical implications were discussed.

AB Polyvictimization (PV) has been shown to be associated with psychosocial and behavioral impairment in community and high risk populations, including youth involved in juvenile justice. However, the mechanisms accounting for these adverse outcomes have not been empirically delineated. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociation are documented sequelae of PV and are associated with a wide range of behavioral/emotional problems. This study used a cross-sectional research design and bootstrapped multiple mediation analyses with self-report measures completed by a large sample of justice-involved youth (N=809, ages 12-19years old, 27% female, 46.5% youth of color) to test the hypothesis that PTSD and dissociation symptoms mediate the relationship between PV and problems with anger, depression/anxiety, alcohol/drug use, and somatic complaints after controlling for the effects of exposure to violence and adversities related to juvenile justice involvement. As hypothesized, PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship of PV with all outcomes except alcohol/drug use problems (which had an unmediated direct association with PV). Partially supporting study hypotheses, dissociation symptoms mediated the relationship between PV and internalizing problems (i.e., depression anxiety; suicide ideation). Implications are discussed for prospective research demarcating the mechanisms linking PV and adverse outcomes in juvenile justice and other high risk populations.

AB Limited research has examined the relation between exposure to stressors and internalizing symptoms among Latino adolescents, including factors that account for this relation. This study examined whether sleep played a role in the relation between exposure to neighborhood-(i.e., neighborhood disadvantage) and individual-level (i.e., negative life events) stressors and symptoms of anxiety and depression among a sample of 144 low-income, Latino adolescents (54% males, mean age = 16.25, SD = 1.46) attending a charter high school in a large, Midwestern city. The bias corrected bootstrap method was used to evaluate indirect effects. Significant findings indicated an indirect effect via sleep problems in the link between negative life events and anxiety. Alternative models were also explored. Results suggest that sleep problems are important to consider for interventions among Latino youth, particularly those exposed to neighborhood and individual stressors, as this may also have implications for reducing internalizing symptoms among this population.

AB Objective: The current study examined the association between asthma and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a clinical pediatric sample. Methods: Demographic and neuropsychological data for children with a billing diagnosis of ADHD were extracted from a clinical database. Families completed standard rating scales. Seventy-one patients with a co-morbid asthma diagnosis were identified and matched by age to a group of 71 patients with only ADHD. Results: Children with asthma and ADHD were more likely to display clinically elevated levels of hyperactivity, externalizing behaviors, anxiety, and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors compared to children with ADHD alone. Boys with asthma and ADHD had more symptoms than boys with only ADHD of somatization and emotional internalizing, while girls with asthma and ADHD had more symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity, conduct problems, anxiety, and emotional internalizing compared to girls with only ADHD. Conclusions: Findings suggest that in children with ADHD, co-morbid asthma is associated with increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms, with distinct gender differences present. Increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms seen in children with both asthma and ADHD may be due to the burden of their medical condition. No difference was found on cognitive variables, suggesting chronic hypoxia may be less influential in explaining these differences. Future research should determine the specific mechanisms of these differences.

AB Several etiopathogenetic models have been conceptualized for the onset of Internet Addiction (IA). However, no study had evaluated the possible predictive effect of early emotion regulation strategies on the development of IA in adolescence. In a sample of N = 142 adolescents with Internet Addiction, this twelve-year longitudinal study aimed at verifying whether and how emotion regulation strategies (self-focused versus other-focused) at two years of age were predictive of school-age children's internalizing/externalizing symptoms, which in turn fostered Internet Addiction (compulsive use of the Web versus distressed use) in adolescence. Our results confirmed our hypotheses demonstrating that early emotion regulation has an impact on the emotional-behavioral functioning in middle childhood (8 years of age), which in turn has an influence on the onset of IA in adolescence. Moreover, our results showed a strong, direct statistical link between the characteristics of emotion regulation strategies in infancy and IA in adolescence. These results indicate that a common root of unbalanced emotion regulation could lead to two different manifestations of Internet Addiction in youths and could be useful in the assessment and treatment of adolescents with IA.

AB The interplay between children's cortisol reactivity to challenge and cumulative cortisol exposure is not well understood. Examining the role of cortisol reactivity in early childhood may elucidate biological mechanisms that contribute to children's chronic physiological stress and behavioral dysregulation. In a sample of 65 preschool-aged children, we examined the relation between children's salivary cortisol reactivity to challenging tasks and their hair cortisol concentration (HCC). While both are biomarkers of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, salivary cortisol reactivity reflects an acute cortisol response to a stressor and HCC reflects cumulative cortisol exposure. In addition, we examined the relations of these stress biomarkers with internalizing and externalizing problems. Salivary cortisol reactivity was associated with higher HCC and with increased externalizing behaviors. Child HCC also was positively correlated with parent HCC. Results highlight the contributions of salivary cortisol reactivity to children's cumulative cortisol exposure, which may add to their biological risk for health problems later. The observed association between externalizing problems and salivary cortisol reactivity indicates concordances between dysregulated behavioral reactions and dysregulated cortisol responses to challenges. The finding that salivary cortisol reactivity to challenge in early childhood plays a role in children's cumulative cortisol exposure and behavioral development suggests pathways through which cortisol reactivity may influence long-term physical and mental health.

AB The purpose of this series of three cross-sectional studies was to identify typical syndromes of self-reported externalizing and internalizing problems, and examine their overlap, among adolescent girls and young women in Swedish special residential homes for young people (N=713). The associations with some family background factors were also investigated. Data came from a research register at the Swedish National Board of Institutional Care and concerned structured interviews with all girls admitted to these homes from 1997 to 2001. An advanced clustering procedure was applied and significant syndrome structures were retrieved in both the externalizing and internalizing area. Among the nine externalizing syndromes were a low-problem syndrome and two multiple-problem syndromes, one combining aggressive behavior, alcohol use/abuse and criminality, and the other combining drug abuse with property/drug offenses. Among the seven internalizing syndromes were a low-problem syndrome, an anxiety/depression syndrome and a generalized internalizing syndrome with particularly high rates of physical and sexual abuse. Results supported the theoretical assumption, made within a holistic-interactionistic paradigm, that adjustment problems would co-occur in a limited number of syndromes. When the overlap between externalizing and internalizing syndromes was considered, good adjustment was generalized between the two areas, whereas there appeared to be an increased risk of having an internalizing syndrome among girls with externalizing syndromes related to aggressive behavior. It is of great importance to consider the full problem pattern of girls with externalizing adjustment problems, including internalizing problems and histories of physical and sexual abuse, when considering subgroups in need of different treatment regimes.

AB This paper deals with parental goals for children, that is, goals parents want their children to attain by the time they reach adulthood. Presenting an adaption of the German Aspirations Index to assess parental goals for children (AI-PG), factorial structure and psychometric properties in a nonclinical sample of German parents of children between 10 and 15 years of age were investigated. Parents (N-T1 = 948; N-T2 = 670) rated the importance of different parental goals for children. The AI-PG structure was first examined in a subsample of mothers using confirmatory factor analyses. Main results provided support for the hypothesized hierarchical factorial structure. Accordingly, the given 21 items can be assigned to seven first-order factors that reflect goal-contents, and two second-order factors that reflect goals' motivational orientation as either intrinsic or extrinsic. The questionnaire shows good psychometric properties (i.e., homogeneity, model-based reliability, and stability). Multiple-group analyses confirmed measurement invariance across informants (mothers and fathers), gender of target children (daughters and sons), and measurement time points. Small but significant relationships of the scales with need-threatened environment, parenting practices, and child internalizing behavior problems added to the scale's construct validity. Results are discussed in terms of the fruitfulness of a concept of parental goals for children within self-determination theory.

AB The internalizing spectrum of psychiatric disordersdepression and anxietyare common, highly comorbid, and challenging to treat. Individuals with childhood onset depression have a particularly poor prognosis. There is compelling evidence that individuals with depression display reduced resting-state EEG activity at sensors overlying the left prefrontal cortex, even during periods of remission, but it remains unknown whether this asymmetry is evident among individuals with a comorbid anxiety disorder. Here, we demonstrate that women with a history of childhood onset depression and no anxiety disorder (n = 37) show reduced left lateral frontal activity compared to psychiatrically healthy controls (n=69). In contrast, women with a history of childhood onset depression and pathological levels of anxious apprehension (n=18)as indexed by a current generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or separation anxiety disorder diagnosiswere statistically indistinguishable from healthy controls. Collectively, these observations suggest that anxious apprehension can mask the relationship between prefrontal EEG asymmetry and depression. These findings have implications for understanding (a) prefrontal EEG asymmetry as a neurophysiological marker of depression, (b) the comorbidity of depression and anxiety, and (c) failures to replicate the relationship between prefrontal EEG asymmetry and depression. More broadly, they set the stage for developing refined interventions for internalizing psychopathology.

AB High amounts of early child care have sometimes been linked to higher levels of behaviour problems, while high-quality child care has more often been related to fewer behaviour problems and more social competence. The current study investigated whether the level of centre emotional and behavioural support (child care quality) interacted with the amount of child care in predicting children's socio-emotional behaviour. Participants were 417 children (mean age = 27 months) from 61 Dutch daycare centres. The amount of daycare ranged from 1 to 5 days per week (M = 2.3 days). Multi-level analyses showed that, independent of the amount of daycare, high levels of centre emotional and behavioural support were related to more caregiver-rated social competence 1 year later. In addition, children spending 3.5 days or more in highly supportive daycare centres showed the lowest levels of parent-rated externalizing behaviour 1 year later. The findings emphasize (a) that the combined effects of the amount and quality of child care are important and (b) that high-quality early child care is related to children's socio-emotional development. Further policy, practice, and research implications are discussed.

AB This study explored whether variations in parenting provided by mothers with substance-abuse disorders are related to behaviour problems in their young children and whether specific parenting practices are associated with specific types of behaviour problems. Mother-reported and observational assessments were used to examine contributions of parenting behaviour and home environment to internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems in 150 preschool children of mothers receiving methadone-maintenance treatment for heroin addiction. In multivariate analyses, mother-reported child externalizing behaviour was related to greater maternal harshness and to mother history of illicit drug use during pregnancy but not other features of substance use and treatment history. Observer-coded child internalizing behaviour was related to less maternal sensitivity and less provision of learning activities in the home. Additionally, mother report of her own psychopathology symptoms was related to mother-reported, but not observer-coded, child internalizing and externalizing problems. Findings suggest that women in substance abuse treatment should receive parenting interventions and that interventions should focus on increasing maternal sensitivity, reducing harshness, and providing children with cognitively stimulating environments. Findings also suggest that the need for attention to ongoing mental health problems of women in substance abuse treatment-both for their own well-being and the well-being of their children.

AB Access to Malaysian government schools is prohibited for refugee children, and hidden refugee schools only reach a minority of Burmese students in Malaysia. This study used a participatory culture-specific consultation (PCSC) approach to examine the perspectives of Burmese refugee teachers on Burmese refugee student socioemotional issues and classroom management using interviews, observations, a preliminary refugee teacher focus group (N = 10: 4 men, 6 women; M age = 26 years), and a primary focus group with refugee teachers who were Burmese refugees (N = 9: 6 men, 3 women; M age = 30 years). First, themes suggested that societal pressures have an effect on the classroom environment. Second, refugee student behavior and emotions ranged from externalizing to internalizing. Third, refugee teachers relied on traditional Burmese methods for managing serious misbehavior. Fourth, with mild misbehaviors, teachers employed more modern, student-centered methods. Results inform culture-specific consultation designed to meet refugee education needs.

AB This study contributes to current research on the behavior problems of children in foster care by analyzing a more comprehensive set of concurrent child history and contextual predictors. Kinship home status and sibling status (i.e., whether the sibling is a biological sibling to the foster child) were evaluated as moderators of significant associations. Data were collected at the baseline of a foster parent training intervention program prior to any intervention services using parent phone interviews (N = 310, 51.6% male, M age = 7.57 years). Two linear hierarchical regressions were used to evaluate each set of predictors' association with behavior problems as well as each individual predictor's contribution. Results indicated that as a set, the contextual variables predicted a significant and unique amount of variability in the child's internalizing and externalizing behavior scores, whereas the child history variables did not. Specifically, the child's placement in a non-kinship home, being in a non-ethnically matched child-parent pair, higher parent stress scores, a greater number of prior group home placements, and higher internalizing behavior scores for the child predicted higher child externalizing scores. Higher parent stress scores, higher focal sibling externalizing behavior scores, and higher externalizing behavior scores for the child predicted higher internalizing scores for the child. The association between focal sibling externalizing behavior scores and child internalizing scores was moderated by kinship home status, such that there was a stronger association between the focal sibling's externalizing score and the child's internalizing score if the child was in a kinship compared to a non-kinship home. Implications for intervention services are discussed, particularly the importance of assessing the child's foster home environment when addressing the child's behavior problems.

AB The relative impact of parenting on socio-emotional development of children has rarely been examined in a longitudinal context. This study examined the association between perceived parenting styles and socio-emotional functioning from childhood to adolescence. We hypothesized that optimal parenting associated with improvement in socio-emotional functioning from childhood into early adulthood, especially for those with more behavioral problems in childhood. Children between ages 7 and 9 years were recruited for the Singapore Cohort Study of Risk Factors for Myopia (SCORM). Nine years later, 700 out of 1052 subjects were followed up (67%). During childhood, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), while young adults completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI). Perceived optimal parental care resulted in less internalizing and externalizing problems in early adulthood in comparison to non-optimal parental care styles. Perceived optimal paternal parenting, but not maternal parenting, in interaction with childhood externalizing problems predicted externalizing symptoms in early adulthood. No significant interactions were found between perceived parenting styles and internalizing problems. In conclusion, perceived parental care associates with the quality of socio-emotional development, while optimal parenting by the father is especially important for children with more externalizing problems in childhood.

AB Previous research suggested that separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is overrepresented among birth-assigned male children clinic-referred for gender dysphoria (GD). The present study examined maternally reported separation anxiety of birth-assigned male children assessed in a specialty gender identity service (N = 360). SAD was determined in relation to DSM-III and DSM-IV criteria, respectively. A dimensional metric of separation anxiety was examined in relation to several additional factors: age, ethnicity, parental marital status and social class, IQ, gender nonconformity, behavioral and emotional problems, and poor peer relations. When defined in a liberal fashion, 55.8% were classified as having SAD. When using a more conservative criterion, 5.3% were classified as having SAD, which was significantly greater than the estimated general population prevalence for boys, but not for girls. Dimensionally, separation anxiety was associated with having parents who were not married or cohabitating as well as with elevations in gender nonconformity; however, the association with gender nonconformity was no longer significant when statistically controlling for internalizing problems. Thus, SAD appears to be common among birth-assigned males clinic-referred for GD when defined in a liberal fashion, and more common than in boys, but not girls, from the general population even when more stringent criteria were applied. Also, the degree of separation anxiety appears to be linked to generic risk factors (i.e., parental marital status, internalizing problems). As such, although separation anxiety is common among birth-assigned male children clinic-referred for GD, it seems unlikely to hold unique significance for this population based on the current data.

AB Academic and behavioral (externalizing and internalizing problems) outcomes associated with trajectories of breadth of participation in organized activities were examined in a sample of 548 children. Four previously modeled trajectories from Kindergarten to Grade 4 were compared: no participation, increasing breadth, decreasing breadth, high and stable breadth. Potential confounding variables (i.e. sex, academic and behavioral indicators in Kindergarten, and mother's education) were included as covariates in the analyses, and the children's disruptive behavior status was tested as a moderator. Following the inclusion of the covariates, the children assigned to the high trajectory displayed lower internalizing problems than the children assigned to the no participation and decreasing trajectories. Children's disruptive behavior status did not moderate the associations between breadth of participation trajectories and outcomes. It thus appears that participation in a wider range of organized activities during childhood may help prevent subsequent internalizing problems.

AB Emotion regulation difficulties influence the etiology and maintenance of binge eating and eating disorders, but differential associations between emotion dysregulation and objective binge eating (OBE) components have not been examined. We compared emotion dysregulation dimensions in women with OBEs (n = 27), overeating only (n = 25), loss of control (LOC) only (n = 32), or no pathological eating (n = 137). Women with OBEs had significantly more difficulty with overall emotion dysregulation, access to strategies, and impulse control when upset than other groups. Women with OBEs and women with overeating did not differ on poor emotional clarity, whereas women with OBEs and women with LOC did not differ on non-acceptance of emotions. The combination of overeating and LOC eating is associated with the greatest emotion dysregulation, but certain emotion regulation facets may differentially relate to overeating and LOC. Identifying emotion-related treatment targets for core eating disorder symptoms is important.

AB There is a limited understanding as to how specific genes impact addiction risk. Applying a developmental framework and research domain criteria (RDoC) to identify etiological pathways from genetic markers to addiction may have utility. Prior research has largely focused on externalizing pathways to substance use. Although internalizing mechanisms have received less attention, there is strong support that addiction is a longer term consequence of using substances to cope with internalizing as well as externalizing problems. This study tests whether temperament and depression mediate the association between specific genetic variants and substance use. The sample consisted of 426 adolescents from the Michigan Longitudinal Study (70.9% boys, 84.0% White). Four specific genetic variants were examined: SLC6A4 (5HTTLPR), BDNF (rs6265), NPY (rs3037354), and CRHBP (rs7728378). Childhood resiliency and behavioral control were examined as potential mediators, in addition to early adolescent depression, using a multiple-mediator path model. Resiliency and depression were supported as mediators in the association between genetic risk and later substance use. Important differences emerged across substances of abuse. Indirect effects via depression were not significant with the inclusion of aggression. Early difficulties with emotional coping may represent nonspecific neurobiological underpinnings for an internalizing pathway to addiction.

AB Objective: Psychiatric symptomatology during childhood predicts persistent mental illness later in life. While neuroimaging methodologies are routinely applied crosssectionally to the study of child and adolescent psychopathology, the nature of the relationship between childhood symptoms and the underlying neurodevelopmental processes remains unclear. The authors used a prospective populationbased cohort to delineate the longitudinal relationship between childhood psychiatric problems and brain development.
   Method: A total of 845 children participated in the study. Psychiatric symptoms were measured with the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist at ages 6 and 10. MRI data were collected at ages 8 and 10. Cross-lagged panel models and linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the associations between psychiatric symptom ratings and quantitative anatomic and white matter microstructural measures over time.
   Results: Higher ratings for externalizing and internalizing symptoms at baseline predicted smaller increases in both subcortical gray matter volume and global fractional anisotropy over time. Thereverse relationship did not hold; thus, baseline measures of gray matter and white matter were not significantly related to changes in symptom ratings over time.
   Conclusions: Children presenting with behavioral problems at an early age show differential subcortical and white matter development. Most neuroimaging models tend to explain brain differences observed in psychopathology as an underlying (causal) neurobiological substrate. However, the present work suggests that future neuroimaging studies showing effects that are pathogenic in nature should additionally explore the possibility of the downstream effects of psychopathology on the brain.

AB Reduced autobiographical memory specificity (AMS) has robust associations with psychopathology. As such, understanding the development of AMS (or its inverse, overgeneral autobiographical memory) and how it may be unique from other aspects of memory performance is important. In particular, it is unclear whether child AMS is distinct from autobiographical memory performance in other contexts, such as during mother-child reminiscing, and whether reduced AMS during early childhood is associated with emotional adjustment as found later in development. In this study, associations between children's AMS and memory performance during mother-child reminiscing were evaluated. Moreover, the contributions of each type of child memory performance to child internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined. Participants included 95 mother-child dyads drawn from a diverse, low-income community. Children's ages ranged from 3.5 years to 6years. Dyads participated in a joint reminiscing task about 4 past events, children participated in assessments of AMS, and mothers rated children's emotional adjustment. Path analysis results indicated that children's AMS was not significantly related to children's unique memory contributions during reminiscing. Child AMS was negatively associated with emotional symptoms, whereas child memory during reminiscing was not.

AB An examination of cultural protective factors that foster substance use abstinence among low-income, early adolescent, African American girls may be helpful in understanding how to promote resilience and reduce negative health outcomes. This study examined the relations between Africentric cultural values, ethnic identity, and substance use abstinence among 196 low-income African American early adolescent girls (age 11-14 years). Results of logistic regressions revealed that Africentric values were negatively linked to cigarette and alcohol abstinence. Results also showed a significant positive interaction between Africentric cultural values and ethnic identity exploration that contributed to increased cigarette and alcohol abstinence. Implications for research and practice with African American early adolescent girls are discussed.

AB Although the assessment of empathy has moved from general empathy to differentiating between cognitive and affective empathy, no instruments have assessed somatic (motor) empathy, and none have separated positive from negative affect empathy. The main objective of this study was to develop a 30-item self-report cognitive, affective, and somatic empathy scale (CASES) with positive and negative affect components for use with children and adolescents. A community sample of 428 male and female 11-year-olds completed the CASES together with validity questionnaires and were assessed on IQ. Caregivers reported on callous-unemotional traits, behavior problems, social adversity, and paternal criminality. Confirmatory factor analysis provided support for a 3-factor cognitiveaffectivesomatic structure of CASES and support for a broader 6-factor model of empathy. Configural and metric factor invariance across genders was established. Good internal consistency was obtained for the main scales. Criterion validity was established by lower empathy in callous-unemotional children. Incremental and predictive validity was documented by empathy at baseline predicting 12months later to callous-unemotional traits after controlling for baseline callous-unemotional traits. Discriminant validity was documented by empathy being unrelated to internalizing behavior problems and differentially related to proactive and reactive forms of aggression. Construct validity was documented by lower empathy being associated with lower IQ, being male, more externalizing behavior problems, and criminality in the biological parent. Results provide initial support for a brief but multidimensional empathy scale with good sampling and face validity that can be used with children and adolescents.

AB The prevalence of pediatric obesity is increasing worldwide, which is particularly concerning given its negative impact on adjustment (e.g., quality of life, psychopathological symptoms) and physical health (e.g., high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems). It is important to understand the factors that may improve children's/adolescents' adjustment to overweight/obesity. This study aims to assess the indirect effect of family cohesion on children's/adolescents' internalizing/externalizing symptoms through body esteem and social life. The sample comprises 182 treatment-seeking children/adolescents with overweight/obesity and their mothers. Mothers completed a measure of family cohesion (Family Environment Scale), and children/adolescents completed measures of body esteem, social life (Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Kids), and internalizing/externalizing symptoms (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Path analyses indicated a significant indirect effect between family cohesion and internalizing symptoms through children's/adolescents' body esteem and social life. Higher levels of family cohesion were linked to higher levels of body esteem, which were linked to higher levels of social life that, in turn, were associated with lower levels of internalizing symptoms. The results suggest the importance of body esteem and social life in explaining the link between family cohesion and children's/adolescents' internalizing symptoms. The results also suggest that belonging to a more cohesive family may improve the mental health of children/adolescents with overweight/obesity.

AB Using 6 cycles (grade 5 through grade 10) of data obtained from a large prospective sample of Canadian school children (N = 700; 52.6% girls), we replicated previous findings concerning the empirical definition of peer victimization (i.e., being bullied) and examined static and dynamic intrapersonal factors associated with its emergence and experiential continuity through mid-adolescence. Latent class analyses consistently revealed a low victimization and an elevated victimization class across time, supporting previous work suggesting peer victimization was defined by degree rather than by type (e.g., physical). Using latent transition analyses (LTA), we found that child sex, parent-perceived pubertal development, and internalizing symptoms influenced the probability of transitioning from the low to the elevated victimization class across time. Higher-order extensions within the LTA modeling framework revealed a lasting effect of grade 5 victimization status on grade 10 victimization status and a large effect of chronic victimization on later parent-reported youth internalizing symptoms (net of prior parent-reported internalizing symptoms) in later adolescence (grade 11). Implications of the current findings for the experience of peer victimization, as well as the application of latent transition analysis as a useful approach for peer victimization research, are discussed.

AB Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) has been defined by a constellation of caregiver-reported symptoms that includes daydreaming, difficulty initiating and sustaining effort, lethargy, and physical underactivity. These symptoms have been observed in both typically developing children and in some children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-especially those with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Symptoms of SCT (typically identified via rating scales) appear separable from DSM inattentive ADHD symptoms, but have also been associated with internalizing symptoms. To date, however, few studies have examined associations among ratings of SCT and speeded performance-based measures. The present study examined associations among SCT, processing speed, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 566 clinically referred children (65% male), while also considering how these associations change with age. Findings revealed small but significant age-related differences in the strength of associations between the "Daydreamy" element of SCT and processing speed (as measured by the WISC-IV Processing Speed Index-PSI), with stronger associations observed in younger children. Importantly, this difference in strength of association was not accounted for by the change in WISC-IV test forms for PSI subtests between 6-7 year-olds and 8-16 year-olds. Conversely, the association between SCT and internalizing symptoms remained generally consistent across the age range. Findings contribute to further characterization of the "slowness" of responding seen in SCT and may have implications for behavioral intervention.

AB Individual differences in a child's sensitivity to stress may influence whether youth exposed to trauma develop symptoms of psychopathology. We examined the interaction between HPA-axis reactivity to an acute stressor and exposure to different types of childhood trauma as predictors of mental health symptoms in a sample of youth. Youth (n = 121, ages 9-16; 47% female) completed a standardized stress task, including 5 post-stress salivary cortisol samples. Parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist as a measure of child internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the past month, and completed the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI) as a measure of their child's trauma exposure. More emotional abuse and non-intentional trauma were associated with greater internalizing symptoms. Youth exposed to physical abuse who demonstrated slower HPA-axis reactivity had elevated internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Youth exposed to emotional abuse or non-intentional traumatic events who demonstrated faster HPA-axis reactivity had elevated internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Profiles of exaggerated or attenuated HPA-axis reactivity to acute stress may be risk factors for psychopathology in children facing different stressful social environments.

AB Study Objectives: To examine the association between the age of onset and duration of parent-reported symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and behavioral problems at age 2.
   Methods: Parent-reported SDB symptoms were assessed quarterly between 3 months and 2 years among 583 Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Edmonton-site participants. Parent-reported SDB symptoms were clustered into phenotypes using group-based trajectory analysis based on age of onset and duration of symptoms. Home-based polysomnography (PSG) was completed at 1 year. The Child Behavior Checklist preschool-version (Mean T-score 50, standard deviation 10 points) assessed total, externalizing (attention), and internalizing (anxiety, depression) behaviors at 2 years.
   Results: Four phenotypes were identified: no SDB (64.7%), early-onset SDB (15.7%, peak symptoms at 9 months), late-onset (14.2%, peak symptoms at 18 months), and persistent SDB symptoms (5.3%, peak symptoms from 3 through 24 months). Persistent SDB (9.5 points, 95% CI 1.7, 17.2; p = .02) predicted the greatest magnitude of effect of total behavior problems, compared with children without SDB. Children with early-onset SDB (3.5 points, 95% CI 1.6, 5.4; p <= .001) and late-onset SDB (6.1 points 95% CI 4.0, 8.3; p <= .001) had increased total behavioral problems than children without SDB to 2 years. Additional analyses showed that the SDB phenotypes' trajectories were important for internalizing but not for externalizing behavior problems. There were no significant associations between home-PSG and parent-reported behavior problems.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that the age of onset and duration of parent-reported SDB symptoms prior to age 2 have adverse consequences for overall behavior problems.

   CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS
AB Previous studies in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shown elevated evening cortisol; however, few studies have examined diurnal rhythm in adolescents with ASD. Adolescence is a time of significant physical and psychological change, and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may put adolescents with ASD at increased risk for internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression. The extent to which cortisol levels are associated with age, puberty and symptom profile was examined in 113 youth (ages 7-17) with ASD and typical development. Salivary samples were collected over 3 days in the home, 4 times per day (waking, 30-min post-waking, afternoon, evening). Results showed youth with ASD had higher evening cortisol and a blunted diurnal slope relative to TD youth. Pubertal development and age were significant predictors of evening cortisol, and adolescents with ASD had higher evening cortisol levels compared to children with ASD. The study extends previous reports of elevated evening cortisol in children with ASD to reveal high levels in adolescence as well. Adolescents with ASD also show a significantly blunted diurnal slope, which may be associated with risk of internalizing symptoms. Findings suggest elevated evening cortisol persists across development in youth with ASD, thus emphasizing a need to identify potential negative effects of excess cortisol exposure on health in ASD individuals. Autism Res2018, 11: 110-120. (c) 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
   Lay SummaryElevations in stress hormone, cortisol, during the evening may indicate increased stress from changes throughout the day in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study shows that age and pubertal development are also related to increases in evening cortisol, and this maladaptive elevation in cortisol in ASD is not going away with age. These cortisol elevations may also be associated with other psychological symptoms and warrant further investigation in adolescents with ASD.

AB We examined phenotypes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on trajectories of intellectual development from early (ages 2-3 1/2) to middle (ages 5-8) childhood in a recent clinically ascertained cohort. Participants included 102 children (82 males) initially diagnosed with ASD from the Autism Phenome Project longitudinal sample. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify distinct IQ trajectories. Baseline and developmental course differences among groups were assessed using univariate techniques and repeated measures regression models, respectively. A four class model best represented the data. Using the highest posterior probability, participants were assigned to High Challenges (25.5%), Stable Low (17.6%), Changers (35.3%), and Lesser Challenges (21.6%) groups. The High Challenges and Stable Low groups exhibited persistently low IQ, although, the High Challenges group experienced declines while the Stable Low group's scores remained more constant. Changers showed IQ improvement of >2 standard deviations. The Lesser Challenges group had IQs in the average range at both times that were about 1 standard deviation higher at T2. In summation, 75% of the participants experienced some relative improvements in intellectual and/or other areas of functioning between ages 2 and 8 years. The Changers group demonstrated the most significant IQ change that was accompanied by adaptive communication improvement and declining externalizing symptoms. Only the Lesser Challenges group showed a significant reduction in ASD symptom severity, such that by age 8, 14% of them no longer met ADOS-2 criteria for ASD. All groups showed reductions in internalizing symptoms. Intervention history was not associated with group status. Autism Res2018, 11: 121-132. (c) 2017 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
   Lay SummaryWe examined how the IQs of children with autism spectrum disorder change between ages 2 and 8, and identified four patterns. Two groups exhibited persistently lower IQs. One group showed IQ increases of greater than 30 points with improved communicate abilities and declining disruptive behaviors. The final group had IQs in the average or better range at both time points, and 14% of them lost their diagnoses. Over half of the children experienced improved intellectual functioning between ages 2 and 8, whereas about 25% showed declines. Findings were not associated with intervention history.

AB Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been empirically linked to a host of negative health outcomes, both physical and psychosocial. Exposures to ACEs make individuals more susceptible to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, and depression. Many of these conditions do not appear until sometime in adolescence or adulthood and have been linked to premature death. Objective: This study explores the association between the number and type of exposure to ACEs in women (mothers) who experienced intimate partner violence and health outcomes. Specifically, it explores the association between maternal ACEs and maternal perceived health and maternal mental and behavioral health. This study also explores the association between ACEs and child behavior. Methods: This analysis is part of a 7-year prospective study. A cohort of 300 mother-child pairs was assessed at baseline and every 4 months after reaching out for shelter or justice services for the very first time after being in an abusive intimate relationship. Results: Data document individual mothers' ACE scores and show a trend at 12 months, 24 months, and is most significant at 36 months. Additionally, at 36 months, higher ACE scores were significantly associated with all child behavioral subscales (anxiety, depression, aggressive behavior, attention problems, internalizing, externalizing). Conclusion: The women in this study reported ACE scores consistently higher than national rates. Our data highlight the added benefit of using ACE criteria as a global prevention strategy to identify those most at risk for delayed mental and behavioral health issues and to intervene with supportive strategies and guided referrals as indicated.

AB Background: Overweight and perceived overweight are common among adolescents. The nature of the relationship between overweight/perceived overweight and mental health problems is still unclear.Aims: The aim of this study was to examine whether actual overweight, perceived overweight or both are associated with internalizing and externalizing disorders among adolescents.Methods: Data were collected by two similar school surveys in all Finnish-speaking secondary schools in Tampere (population 200,000) in the academic years 2002-2003 and 2012-2013. A total of 2775 acceptable responses were received. All the analyses were carried out separately for girls and boys. Mean age of the respondents was 15.6 years.Results: In multivariate analyses perceived overweight, not actual weight, was significantly associated with higher risk of self-reported depression (OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.9-6.3, p<.001) and self-reported conduct disorder (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.6-3.3, p<.001) in girls and with higher risk of self-reported depression (OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.65-6.4, p=.001) and self-reported social phobia (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.6, p=.05) in boys.Conclusion: Perceived overweight rather than actual weight status is associated with both internalizing and externalizing mental health problems in adolescents.

AB The purpose of this prospective multi-center cross-sectional study was to identify key biopsychosocial factors that impact quality of life (QOL) of youth with congenital heart disease (CHD). Patient-parent pairs were recruited at a regular hospital follow-up visit. Patient- and parent-proxy-reported QOL were assessed using the Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory (PCQLI). Wallander's and Varni's disability-stress coping model guided factor selection, which included disease factors, educational impairment, psychosocial stress, child psychological and parent/family factors. Measures utilized for these factors included the Pediatric Inventory for Parents, Self-Perception Profile for Children/Adolescents, Child Behavior Checklist, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Child PTSD Symptom Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. Ordinary least squares regression was applied to test the theoretical model, with backwards stepwise elimination process. The models accounted for a substantial amount of variance in QOL (Patient-reported PCQLI R (2) = 0.58, p < 0.001; Parent-proxy-reported PCQLI R (2) = 0.60, p < 0.001). For patient-reported QOL, disease factors, educational impairment, poor self-esteem, anxiety, patient posttraumatic stress, and parent posttraumatic stress were associated with lower QOL. For parent-proxy-report QOL, disease factors, educational impairment, greater parental medical stress, poorer child self-esteem, more child internalizing problems, and parent posttraumatic stress were associated with lower QOL. The results highlight that biopsychosocial factors account for over half the variance in QOL in CHD survivors. Assessing and treating psychological issues in the child and the parent may have a significant positive impact on QOL.

   CHILDHOOD; SAMPLE
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with neurocognitive and behavioral problems in young children; however, this association is less studied in adolescents. Evidence suggests that obesity plays a key role in the development of SDB, although its relative association with neurobehavioral functioning remains unclear. We examined whether SDB and obesity are associated with neurocognitive and behavioral problems in adolescents.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 421 adolescents (17.0 +/- 2.2y, 53.9% male) from the Penn State Child Cohort, a general population sample, underwent a 9-h polysomnography, clinical history, physical examination, neurocognitive evaluation and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan, and completed the Child or Adult Behavior Checklist. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 2, primary snoring (PS) as AHI < 2+snoring and no-SDB as AHI < 2 without snoring. Body weight measures included body mass index (BMI) percentile, waist circumference (WC) and DXA-measured total adipose tissue (TAT).
   RESULTS: WC and TAT were significantly associated with impaired vigilance, processing speed, working memory, and control interference and greater internalizing and externalizing behaviors, while BMI percentile was marginally associated. SDB per se (PS, AHI or OSA) was not significantly associated with impaired neurocognitive outcomes or greater behavioral problems. However, TAT was significantly associated with impaired vigilance and greater internalizing and externalizing behaviors and, to a lesser extent, slower processing speed and greater control interference, only in adolescents with OSA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Central obesity, an etiopathogenic mechanism of OSA, is more strongly associated with neurocognitive and behavioral problems in adolescents than SDB alone. Deficits in low-order (vigilance) and high-order (executive) functions and behavioral problems observed in adolescents with OSA are primarily associated with increased central adiposity, a finding not entirely captured with less precise measures of obesity. These data support that OSA and its associated neurocognitive and behavioral morbidity are related to underlying metabolic dysfunction as early as adolescence.

AB Higher levels of parenting stress and lower levels of parental competency have been shown to adversely affect a variety of child outcomes such as both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Behavioral parent training programs simultaneously decrease parenting stress while increasing parental competency. Recent research has focused on possible mechanisms of change that influence the efficacy of behavioral parent training programs. The present study examined parental competency, specifically parental efficacy and satisfaction, as mechanisms of change in the relationship between attendance in the Parenting Our Children to Excellence (PACE) program and long-term levels of parenting stress. Six hundred and ten parents participated in the PACE parenting program and measures were collected at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. Path analysis was utilized to test parental competency as a mediator between engagement in PACE and follow-up parenting stress. Parental satisfaction, one factor of parental competency, was found to be a significant mediator between engagement in PACE and follow-up parenting stress. This study has important implications in further identifying mechanisms of change within behavioral parent training programs.

AB Youth in foster care have often been exposed to in-home violence and violence exposure is associated with higher mental health concerns. This study used multiple regression mediation analyses with bootstrapping to identify specific current foster caregiver-adolescent relationship factors and their mediating qualities between in-home violence exposure and adolescent internalizing, externalizing, and trauma symptoms. Using a national dataset of adolescents in foster care (n = 175), the results of this study suggested that an adolescent's perception of feeling emotionally secure in their relationship with their caregiver mediated the relationships between exposure to violence and youth internalizing, externalizing, and trauma symptoms. Additionally, current foster caregiver involvement and structure mediated the associations between exposure to violence and adolescent internalizing and externalizing outcomes, but not trauma symptoms. Further discussion of the results is included. Findings have important implications for mental health interventions aimed towards youth in foster care.

AB Binge eating disorder (BED) represents one of the most problematic clinical conditions among youths. Research has shown that the developmental stage of adolescence is a critical stage for the onset of eating disorders (EDs), with a peak prevalence of BED at the age of 16-17 years. Several studies among adults with BED have underlined that it is associated with a broad spectrum of negative consequences, including higher concern about shape and weight, difficulties in social functioning, and emotional-behavioral problems. This review aimed to examine studies focused on the prevalence of BED in the adolescent population, its impact in terms of physical, social, and psychological outcomes, and possible strategies of psychological intervention. The review of international literature was made on paper material and electronic databases ProQuest, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo, and the Scopus index were used to verify the scientific relevance of the papers. Epidemiological research that examined the prevalence of BED in adolescent samples in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition showed a prevalence ranging from 1% to 4%. More recently, only a few studies have investigated the prevalence of BED, in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, reporting a prevalence of similar to 1%-5%. Studies that focused on the possible impact that BED may have on physical, psychological, and social functioning showed that adolescents with BED have an increased risk of developing various adverse consequences, including obesity, social problems, substance use, suicidality, and other psychological difficulties, especially in the internalizing area. Despite the evidence, to date, reviews on possible and effective psychological treatment for BED among young population are rare and focused primarily on adolescent females.

AB Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined cross-informant agreement concerning mental health outcomes for maltreated children. This study provides important information to individuals working with maltreated children (e.g., clinicians, child welfare practitioners) who must make critical decisions related to safety, mental health, and permanency. Method: We retrieved 29 studies that collected mental health data for maltreated children using standardized instruments. We were able to examine 4 informant pairs and 7 mental health outcomes. Results: Agreement across children's mental health outcomes was highest for child-caregiver pairs (small to large, significant effect sizes), followed by child-teacher and caregiver-teacher (small to medium, significant effect sizes) and then caregiver-caregiver (small, nonsignificant effect sizes) pairs. Agreement generally was highest for overt behaviors. Conclusions: It is important to include children as informants, gather teacher and caregiver data when assessing child internalizing difficulties, and examine specific maltreatment outcomes (e.g., traumatic stress). Clinically, it is critical to understand why different informants perceive a child's functioning in different ways for purposes of prognosis and treatment planning for the child and his or her family. It is also critical to triangulate data sources when assessing for maltreatment impact and to consider data points that both converge and diverge when making appropriate safety and treatment plans.

AB Background: To examine the potential mediating role of parenting behaviors in the longitudinal, bidirectional relationships between maternal depression and child internalizing symptoms (i.e. depression and anxiety).
   Methods: We analyzed data from 4,581 mother-child dyads from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, assessed when the child was 3, 5, and 9 years old. Data included maternal depression diagnosis, child internalizing symptoms, and parenting behaviors (i.e. psychological aggression, nonviolent discipline, and physical assault). Data were analyzed using cross-lagged panel models.
   Results: Results indicated bidirectional relationships between maternal depression and child internalizing symptoms over childhood. Mediation analyses suggested that maternal depression led to subsequent increased psychological aggression toward their child, which in turn led to increased child internalizing symptoms. Nonviolent discipline and physical assault did not mediate this relationship. However, greater use of nonviolent discipline at age 5 among all parents predicted higher child internalizing symptoms at age 9. No parenting behaviors were both predicted by earlier child internalizing symptoms and predictive of subsequent maternal depression.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a bidirectional relationship between child and maternal internalizing psychopathology that is partially explained by depressed mothers' greater use of psychological aggression toward their children. It is important to note that the size of these effects were small, suggesting that the relationship between parent and child psychopathology is likely additionally explained by factors not assessed in the current study. Nonetheless, these results have implications for prevention and intervention strategies targeting child anxiety and depression.

AB Although social difficulties have been identified as sequelae of children's experiences with interparental conflict and insecurity, little is known about the specific mechanisms underlying their vulnerability to social problems. Guided by emotional security theory, this study tested the hypothesis that children's emotional insecurity mediates associations between interparental conflict and their social difficulties by undermining their affiliative goals in best friendships. Participants included 235 families with the first of 5 measurement occasions over a 10-year period occurring when children were in kindergarten (mean age = 6 years). Findings from the lagged latent difference score analyses indicated that intensification of multi-method assessment of interparental conflict during the early school years predicted subsequent increases in children's emotional insecurity 5 years later in adolescence. In the latter part of the cascade, rises in emotional insecurity predicted decreases in adolescent friendship affiliation, which, in turn, were specifically associated with declines in social competence. The specificity of this cascade of changing processes in predicting social problems was supported by the robustness of the findings after the inclusion of static measures of each construct as predictors, parent-child relationship insecurity as a covariate, and increases in children's internalizing symptoms as an alternative outcome.

AB To access outcome following hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), survivors without cerebral palsy were invited for formal developmental assessment. Children aged >42 months were assessed using the NEPSY-2, Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 (Movement ABC-2), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and the Child Behavior Checklist. Children aged < 42 months were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSITD-3). One hundred forty-six children attended for assessments [Grade 1 (112), Grade 2 (33), and Grade 3 (1)]. BSITD-3 did not identify significant rates of impairment on cognitive, motor, or language subtests. A significant proportion of children scored < 3rd percentile on the adaptive behavior scale. In older age groups, difficulties were seen in 16/24 NEPSY-2 subtests and on timed assessments using Movement ABC-2. Difficulties arose especially in the "control" aspects of cognition and behavior. Behavioral difficulties were common with internalizing problems predominating. There was a graded effect with grade 2 cases differing significantly from grade 1 cases.
   Conclusion: Following HIE, children may experience attention, memory, and behavior difficulties which are not always evident at a young age. The adaptive behavior questionnaire may be a useful tool to select children requiring developmental surveillance beyond 2 years of age.

AB Objective: This study examined individual and social factors associated with sexual risk behavior among African American girls seeking outpatient mental health services across 2 years and key developmental transitions. Method: African American females 12-16 years old (M = 14.5; SD = 1.15; n = 266) were recruited from eight outpatient mental health clinics and completed interviewer-administered and computer-assisted measures at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Analyses tested individual attributes (externalizing and internalizing problems) and family context (maternal acceptance-rejection, mother-daughter communication about sex) at baseline, peer influences (peer support of substance use, girlfriend dating behavior) and partner relationship characteristics (rejection sensitivity, partner risk communication frequency and openness) at 12 months, and girls' sexual behavior at 24 months. Results: At baseline, 32% of girls reported having had vaginal/anal sex compared with 60% at 24 months. Data analyses revealed robust associations between externalizing problems and maternal acceptance-rejection and mother-daughter risk communication during early adolescence, peer support of substance use and girlfriend dating behavior 1 year later, and girls' sexual risk taking 2 years later. Conclusion: Findings support a social-personal framework (SPF) of sexual risk for African American girls seeking mental health care, underscoring the potential benefits of early intervention to reduce externalizing problems while strengthening mother-daughter communication and relationships to prevent subsequent sexual risk and associated negative outcomes.

AB Objective: The aim of this article was to assess the effects of child sexual abuse (CSA) on emotion regulation (ER) in adolescents and to evaluate the relationships between non suicidal self-injury (NSSI), emotional eating, insomnia and emotion disregulation (ED).
   Method: Fifty two adolescents, aged 10-18 years, without who weren't diagnosed a psychiatric disease before abuse and completed 6-months of follow-up after abuse included the study. Control group consisted of 33 healthy voluntary participants without any known psychiatric disorders. Patients and volunteers who participated in the study were assessed with the Inventory of Statements About Self-injury (ISAS), Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia severity index (ISI), and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS).
   Results: In our study, PSQI scores, DERS total scores and DEBQ emotional eating subscores were significantly higher in the CSA victims (In orderly; p = 0,034, p < 0.001, p = 0,023). 55.7% of the CSA victims reported self-injurious behavior, while 15.5% of healthy voluntary participants reporting self-injurious behavior. The CSA victims reporting NSSI had higher DERS scores than CSA victims without NSSI. (p = 0.024). The CSA victims with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and CSA victims without PTSD had a positive correlation between DEBQ emotional eating subscores and DERS total scores (In orderly: r = 0.762, p = 0.031; r = 0.872, p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the PSQI scores and DERS scores in the CSA victims with PTSD (r = 0.827, p = 0.023).
   Conclusion: Further studies are needed to assess the relationship between self-injury, emotional eating, insomnia and ED, and to determine how sexual abuse effect the ER in a clinical sample of CSA.

AB ObjectiveUnderstanding social and environmental factors that contribute to parental help-seeking intentions is an important step in addressing service underutilization for children in need of treatment. This study examined factors that contribute to parents' intentions to seek formal and informal help for child psychopathology (anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]).
   MethodA total of 251 parents (N = 128 mothers, N = 123 fathers; 49% Black, 51% White) read 3 vignettes describing children with anxiety, ADHD, and no diagnosis. Measures of problem recognition, perceived barriers, and formal (pediatricians, psychologists, teachers) and informal (religious leaders, family/friends, self-help) help seeking were completed. Four separate hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine parental help-seeking likelihood from formal and informal sources for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Predictors were socioeconomic status, parent race, age, and sex, parent problem recognition (via study vignettes), and perceived barriers to mental health service utilization.
   ResultMothers were more likely than fathers to seek help from pediatricians, psychologists, teachers, and religious leaders for child anxiety and pediatricians, religious leaders, and self-help resources for child ADHD. Black parents were more likely to seek help from religious leaders and White parents were more likely to use self-help resources. Problem recognition was associated with greater intentions to seek help from almost all formal and informal sources (except from friends/family).
   ConclusionUnderstanding factors that contribute to parental help seeking for child psychopathology is critical for increasing service utilization and reducing the negative effects of mental health problems. This study highlights the importance of decreasing help-seeking barriers and increasing problem recognition to improve health equity. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Genome-wide association studies in adults have identified numerous genetic variants related to psychiatric disorders and related traits, such as schizophrenia and educational attainment. However, the effects of these genetic variants on behaviour in the general population remain to be fully understood, particularly in younger populations. We investigated whether polygenic scores of five psychiatric disorders and educational attainment are related to emotional and behaviour problems during early childhood. Methods: From the Generation R Study, we included participants with available genotype data and behavioural problems measured with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at the age of 3 (n = 1,902), 6 (n = 2,202) and 10 years old (n = 1,843). Polygenic scores were calculated for five psychiatric disorders and educational attainment. These polygenic scores were tested for an association with the broadband internalizing and externalizing problem scales and the specific CBCL syndrome scale scores. Results: Analysis of the CBCL broadband scales showed that the schizophrenia polygenic score was associated with significantly higher internalizing scores at 3, 6 and 10 years and higher externalizing scores at age 3 and 6. The educational attainment polygenic score was associated with lower externalizing scores at all time points and lower internalizing scores at age 3. No associations were observed for the polygenic scores of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Secondary analyses of specific syndrome scores showed that the schizophrenia polygenic score was strongly related to the Thought Problems scores. A negative association was observed between the educational attainment polygenic score and Attention Problems scores across all age groups. Conclusions: Polygenic scores for adult psychiatric disorders and educational attainment are associated with variation in emotional and behavioural problems already at a very early age.

AB Sharing a classroom environment with other victimized peers has been shown to mitigate the adverse effects of peer victimization on children's social and psychological adjustment. By extension, this study hypothesized that classroom reductions in the proportion of victims would be harmful for children who remain victimized. Data were collected at the end of 2 subsequent school years from 4,466 fourth- to sixth-graders (mean age = 11 years), as part of the implementation of the Finnish anti-bullying program KiVa (an acronym for Kiusaamista Vastaan, against bullying). Multiple regression analyses were conducted on a subsample of 170 stable victims (children reporting being victimized at least 2-3 times a month at both time points) to test whether a decrease in the proportion of victims in their classrooms had an effect on their adjustment at Time 2. Stable victims felt more depressed, more socially anxious and were less liked at Time 2 in classrooms where the proportion of victims had decreased in 1 year compared to stable victims in classrooms where it had increased or remained the same. These effects were not moderated by the intervention status of the classroom. Paradoxically, an improved social environment can be detrimental for some children. These findings point to the necessity to maintain anti-bullying intervention efforts especially when successful.

AB Internalizing problems are among the most common chronic psychological dysfunctions in childhood, yet the factors contributing to their emergence and persistence in preschool-aged children are still less understood. The contribution of specific individual variables (e.g. temperament), and that of proximal environmental factors, such as family environment, recently gained attention. The present study investigated the joint contributions of child and maternal temperament (specifically, Negative Affectivity and Effortful Control), respectively family functioning, to the development of internalizing problems in a sample of 50 Romanian preschoolers. We assessed these variables of interest with maternal reports. Both child Negative Affectivity and Effortful Control significantly contributed to internalizing problems. Maternal temperamental factors moderated the relation between child Effortful Control and internalizing problems. Maladaptive family functioning appeared to be a partial mediator of the relation between maternal Negative Affectivity and child internalizing behaviours.

AB The aims of the current study were (1) to replicate findings regarding the mediator role of emotion regulation (ER) between attachment and empathy; (2) to extend current knowledge by testing the moderator effect of ER on the relationship between attachment and empathy; and (3) to test an integrative moderated mediation model in which attachment was hypothesized to moderate its indirect effect on empathy. The sample included 212 preschoolers aged three- to five-years old. Attachment, ER, and empathic perspective-taking were assessed by employing child interviews. The results confirmed that more secure attachment patterns foster higher ER awareness, which in turn is associated with higher levels of empathy; the strongest relationship between attachment and empathy occurs at below-average ER awareness; and the strength of the indirect effect of attachment on empathy through ER decreases as attachment security increases. These findings have implications for designing and implementing preventive interventions for preschoolers.

AB Introduction: Cigarette use is associated with substance use and mental health problems among youth, but associations are unknown for non-cigarette tobacco product use, as well as the increasingly common poly-tobacco use.
   Methods: The current study examined co-occurrence of substance use and mental health problems across tobacco products among 13,617 youth aged 12-17 years from Wave 1 (2013-2014) of the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study. Participants self-reported ever cigarette, e-cigarette, smokeless tobacco, traditional cigar, cigarillo, filtered cigar, hookah, and other tobacco product use; alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs; and lifetime substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results: In multivariable regression analyses, use of each tobacco product was associated with substance use, particularly cigarillos and marijuana (AOR = 18.9, 95% CI: 15.3-23.4). Cigarette (AOR = 14.7, 95% CI: 11.8-18.2) and cigarillo (AOR = 8.1, 95% CI: 6.3-10.3) use were strongly associated with substance use problems and tobacco users were more likely to report internalizing (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.4-1.8) and externalizing (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.3-1.6) problems. Female tobacco users were more likely to have internalizing problems than male tobacco users. Poly-tobacco users were more likely than exclusive users to use substances (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 2.7-4.3) and have mental health (AOR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0-1.5) and substance use (AOR = 4.7, 95% CI: 3.4-6.6) problems.
   Conclusions: Regardless of the tobacco product used, findings reveal high co-occurrence of substance use and mental health problems among youth tobacco users, especially poly-tobacco users. These findings suggest the need to address comorbidities among high risk youth in prevention and treatment settings.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to provide a conceptual test of how social inhibition, sense of belonging and internalizing problems are related, and whether sense of belonging moderates or mediates the relation between social inhibition and internalizing problems.
   Methods: Data were used from two waves of the Dutch internet cohort LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies of the Social Sciences; N = 511, M age = 52.09 years). Social inhibition was measured using the DS14 in 2012, sense of belonging (i.e., feeling cut off and having people to really talk to) was measured with the General Social Exclusion Index in 2012 and internalizing problems with the MHI-5 in 2015.
   Results: Social inhibition was related to a lower sense of belonging and more internalizing problems. A low sense of belonging was related to more internalizing problems. Results indicated no moderation. However, evidence was found for partial mediation. That is, feeling cut off and having people to really talk to explained part of the link between social inhibition and internalizing problems. All analyses were controlled for sex, age and income.
   Limitations: The items used to measure sense of belonging only cover part of the construct. The study was not fully prospective, as such, no conclusions can be drawn regarding causality.
   Conclusions: Low sense of belonging is a key factor to consider when aiming at understanding individual differences in internalizing psychopathology related to social inhibition.

AB Background: Trauma exposure is associated with adverse psychological outcomes including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Adolescence is increasingly recognized as a period of vulnerability for the onset of these types of psychological symptoms. The current study explored the mediating roles of experiential avoidance and mindfulness processes in the association between retrospective reports of childhood trauma and current internalizing and OC symptoms in adolescents.
   Method: A group of at-risk adolescents (N = 51) and a group of college students (N = 400) reported on childhood trauma, experiential avoidance, mindfulness, anxiety, depressive, and OC symptoms. Mediation analyses were performed to examine the mechanistic roles of avoidance and mindfulness in the association between trauma and internalizing and OC-specific symptoms.
   Results: In the group of at-risk adolescents, experiential avoidance and mindfulness both significantly mediated the association between childhood trauma and OC symptoms. In the college student sample, experiential avoidance mediated the association between trauma and OC symptoms. Experiential avoidance, as well as the observe, act with awareness, and nonjudgmental facets of mindfulness all significantly mediated the association between trauma and internalizing symptoms.
   Limitations: The group of at-risk adolescents was small, and the college student group was demographically homogeneous. All data was self-report and cross-sectional.
   Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that experiential avoidance and mindfulness processes may be the mechanisms through which the association between trauma and obsessive-compulsive and trauma and internalizing symptoms exist in adolescents. These findings provide potential targets for clinical intervention to improve outcomes for adolescents who have experienced trauma.

AB Background: The possibility of using biological measures to predict the trajectory of symptoms among adolescent psychiatric inpatients has important implications. This study aimed to examine emotion regulation ability (measured via self-report) and a hypothesized proxy in resting-state functional connectivity [RSFC] between the amygdala and frontal brain regions as baseline predictors of internalizing symptom recovery during inpatient care.
   Methods: 196 adolescents (61% female; Mage = 15.20; SD = 1.48) completed the Achenbach Brief Problem Monitor (BPM) each week during their inpatient care. RSFC (n = 45) and self-report data of emotion regulation (n = 196) were collected at baseline.
   Results: The average internalizing symptom score at admission was high (alpha(0) = 66.52), exceeding the BPM's clinical cut off score of 65. On average, internalizing symptom scores declined significantly, by 0.40 points per week (p = 0.004). While self-reported emotion regulation was associated with admission levels of internalizing problems, it did not predict change in symptoms. RSFC between left amygdala and left superior frontal gyrus was significantly associated with the intercept-higher connectivity was associated with higher internalizing at admission-and the slope-higher connectivity was associated with a more positive slope (i.e., less decline in symptoms). RSFC between the right amygdala and the left superior frontal gyrus was significantly, positively correlated with the slope parameter.
   Conclusions: Results indicate the potential of biologically-based measures that can be developed further for personalized care in adolescent psychiatry.

AB Background: Existing systematic reviews provide evidence that music therapy is an effective intervention in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychopathology. The objective of the present review was to systematically review and quantify the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression and anxiety) in children and adolescents using a meta-analytical approach.
   Methods: Databases and journals were systematically screened for studies eligible for inclusion in meta-analysis on the effects of music-based interventions in reducing internalizing symptoms. A random-effect meta-analysis using standardized mean differences (SMD) was conducted.
   Results: Five studies were included. Analysis of data from (randomized) controlled trials, yielded a significant main effect (Hedge's g = -0.73; 95% CI [-1.42;-0.04], Z = 2.08, p = 0.04, k = 5), indicating a greater reduction of internalizing symptoms in youth receiving music-based interventions (n = 100) compared to different control group interventions (n = 95).
   Limitations: The existing evidence is limited to studies of low power and methodological quality. Included studies were highly heterogeneous with respect to the nature of the intervention, the measurements applied, the samples studied, and the study design.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that music-based interventions may be efficient in reducing the severity of internalizing symptoms in children and adolescents. While these results are encouraging with respect to the application of music-based intervention, rigorous research is necessary to replicate existing findings and provide a broader base of evidence. More research adopting well controlled study designs of high methodological quality is needed.

AB This study aimed to further explore emotional correlates to CU traits by considering for the first time a multidimensional measure of emotion awareness concerning self-perception about own emotional processes. 668 pre-adolescent students (338 girls; mean age = 12.89 years, SD = 0.92 years) took part to the study. Over and above levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems, a negative link between CU traits and emotion awareness emerged. Specifically, unemotional was the facet of CU traits to be uniquely associated to three out of five dimensions of emotion awareness that were specifically focused on emotional processes concerning own emotions (i.e., differentiating emotions, verbal sharing of emotions, not hiding emotions). As for the proneness to attend and analyze others' emotions, a negative association emerged with the callousness dimension of CU traits. These results further confirmed that youths high in CU traits present specific emotional processing; moreover these results further highlighted the importance to consider self-perception about own emotional functioning in youths high in CU traits.

AB Background: Self-esteem is fundamentally linked to mental health, but its' role in trajectories of psychiatric problems is unclear. In particular, few studies have addressed the role of self-esteem in the development of attention problems. Hence, we examined the role of global self-esteem in the development of symptoms of anxiety/depression and attention problems, simultaneously, in a clinical sample of adolescents while accounting for gender, therapy, and medication.
   Methods: Longitudinal data were obtained from a sample of 201 adolescents-aged 13-18-referred to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Trondheim, Norway. In the baseline study, self-esteem, and symptoms of anxiety/depression and attention problems were measured by means of self-report. Participants were reassessed 3 years later, with a participation rate of 77% in the clinical sample.
   Results: Analyses showed that high self-esteem at baseline predicted fewer symptoms of both anxiety/depression and attention problems 3 years later after controlling for prior symptom levels, gender, therapy (or not), and medication.
   Conclusions: Results highlight the relevance of global self-esteem in the clinical practice, not only with regard to emotional problems, but also to attention problems. Implications for clinicians, parents, and others are discussed.

AB Background: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious health risk behavior that forms the basis of a tentative diagnosis in DSM-5, NSSI Disorder (NSSID). To date, established treatments specific to NSSI or NSSID are scarce. As a first step in evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a novel treatment for adolescents with NSSID, we conducted an open trial of emotion regulation individual therapy for adolescents (ERITA): a 12-week, behavioral treatment aimed at directly targeting both NSSI and its proposed underlying mechanism of emotion regulation difficulties.
   Methods: Seventeen girls (aged 13-17; mean = 15.31) with NSSID were enrolled in a study adopting an uncontrolled open trial design with self-report and clinician-rated assessments of NSSI and other self-destructive behaviors, emotion regulation difficulties, borderline personality features, and global functioning administered at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Measures of NSSI and emotion regulation difficulties were also administered weekly during treatment.
   Results: Ratings of treatment credibility and expectancy and the treatment completion rate (88%) were satisfactory, and both therapeutic alliance and treatment attendance were strong. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significant improvements associated with large effect sizes in past-month NSSI frequency, emotion regulation difficulties, self-destructive behaviors, and global functioning, as well as a medium effect size in past-month NSSI versatility, from pre- to post-treatment. Further, all of these improvements were either maintained or further improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Finally, change in emotion regulation difficulties mediated improvements in NSSI over the course of treatment.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of this treatment for adolescents with NSSID.

AB Alcohol use, particularly binge drinking (BD), is a major public health concern among adolescents. Recent national data show that the gender gap in alcohol use is lessening, and BD among girls is rising. Considering the increase in BD among adolescent girls, as well as females' increased risk of experiencing more severe biopsychosocial negative effects and consequences from BD, the current review sought to examine gender differences in risk factors for BD. The review highlights gender differences in (1) developmental-related neurobiological vulnerability to BD, (2) psychiatric comorbidity and risk phenotypes for BD, and (3) social-related risk factors for BD among adolescents, as well as considerations for BD prevention and intervention. Most of the information gleaned thus far has come from preclinical research. However, it is expected that, with recent advances in clinical imaging technology, neurobiological effects observed in lower mammals will be confirmed in humans and vice versa. A synthesis of the literature highlights that males and females experience unique neurobiological paths of development, and although there is debate regarding the specific nature of these differences, literature suggests that these differences in turn influence gender differences in psychiatric comorbidity and risk for BD. For one, girls are more susceptible to stress, depression, and other internalizing behaviors and, in turn, these symptoms contribute to their risk for BD. On the other hand, males, given gender differences across the lifespan as well as gender differences in development, are driven by an externalizing phenotype for risk of BD, in part, due to unique paths of neurobiological development that occur across adolescence. With respect to social domains, although social and peer influences are important for both adolescent males and females, there are gender differences. For example, girls may be more sensitive to pressure from peers to fit in and impress others, while male gender role stereotypes regarding BD may be more of a risk factor for boys. Given these unique differences in male and female risk for BD, further research exploring risk factors, as well as tailoring intervention and prevention, is necessary. Although recent research has tailored substance use intervention to target males and females, more literature on gender considerations in treatment for prevention and intervention of BD in particular is warranted.

AB Background: Most multi-problem young adults (18-27 years old) have been exposed to childhood maltreatment and/or have been involved in juvenile delinquency and, therefore, could have had Child Protection Service (CPS) interference during childhood. The extent to which their childhood problems persist and evolve into young adulthood may differ substantially among cases. This might indicate heterogeneous profiles of CPS risk factors. These profiles may identify combinations of closely interrelated childhood problems which may warrant specific approaches for problem recognition and intervention in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to retrospectively identify distinct statistical classes based on CPS data of multi-problem young adults in The Netherlands and to explore whether these classes were related to current psychological dysfunctioning and delinquent behaviour.
   Methods: Age at first CPS interference, numbers and types of investigations, age at first offence, mention of child maltreatment, and family supervision order measures (Dutch: ondertoezichtstelling; OTS) were extracted from the CPS records of 390 multi-problem young adult males aged 18-27 (mean age 21.7). A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted and one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc t-tests examined whether LCA class membership was related to current self-reported psychological dysfunctioning and delinquent behaviour.
   Results: Four latent classes were identified: (1) late CPS/penal investigation group (44.9%), (2) early CPS/multiple investigation group (30.8%), (3) late CPS interference without investigation group (14.6%), and (4) early CPS/family investigation group (9.7%). The early CPS/family investigation group reported the highest mean anxiousness/depression and substance use scores in young adulthood. No differences were found between class membership and current delinquent behaviour.
   Conclusions: This study extends the concept that distinct pathways are present in multi-problem young adults who underwent CPS interference in their youth. Insight into the distinct combinations of CPS risk factors in the identified subgroups may guide interventions to tailor their treatment to the specific needs of these children. Specifically, treatment of internalizing problems in children with an early onset of severe family problems and for which CPS interference is carried out should receive priority from both policy makers and clinical practice.

AB Objective: Using a short-term longitudinal design, this study examined the concurrent and longitudinal relationships among familial socioeconomic status (SES; i.e., family income and maternal and paternal education levels), marital conflict (i.e., constructive and destructive marital conflict), parenting practices (i.e., positive and negative parenting practices), child social competence (i.e., social skills), and child behavioral adjustment (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems) in a comprehensive model.
   Methods: The sample included a total of 1604 preschoolers aged 5 years at Time 1 and first graders aged 6 years at Time 2 (51.5% male). Parents completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their SES, marital conflict, parenting practices, and their children's behavioral adjustment. Teachers also evaluated the children's social competence.
   Results: The path analysis results revealed that Time 1 family income and maternal and paternal education levels were respectively related to Time 1 social skills and Time 2 internalizing and externalizing problems, both directly and indirectly, through their influence on destructive and constructive marital conflict, as well as negative and positive parenting practices. Notably, after controlling for Time 1 behavioral problems as mediating mechanisms in the link between family factors (i.e., SES, marital conflict, and parenting practices) and behavioral adjustment, Time 1 social skills significantly and inversely influenced both the internalization and externalization of problems at Time 2.
   Conclusions: The merit of examining SES, marital conflict, and parenting practices as multidimensional constructs is discussed in relation to an understanding of processes and pathways within families that affect child mental health functioning. The results suggest social competence, which is influenced by the multidimensional constructs of family factors, may prove protective in reducing the risk of child maladjustment, especially for children who are socioeco-nomically disadvantaged.

AB Introduction: Adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by HIV due to a range of social and structural factors. As they transition to adulthood, they are recipients of increasing blame for HIV infection and 'improper' sex, as well as increasing scrutiny, restrictions and surveillance. This study used a qualitative and participatory approach to explore the messaging and restrictions imposed on adolescent girls living with HIV in Zambia.
   Methods: Thirty-four in-depth interviews and four participatory workshops were carried out with 24 adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 years old living with HIV in Lusaka, Zambia. Key themes explored included experiences living with HIV, finding out about HIV status, disclosure, experiences with antiretroviral treatment, and support needs. Data were organized, coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach to thematic analysis. This analysis uses data on participants' experiences of living with HIV and their interactions with their parents, guardians and healthcare providers.
   Results: Family and healthcare providers, partly in a quest to protect both the health of adolescent girls living with HIV and also to protect them from blaming discourse, imposed restrictions on their behaviour around three main topics: don't disclose your HIV status, don't have sex, and don't miss your medicines. These restrictions were often delivered using tactics of fear, and usually disconnected from other options. Participants responded to these messages in several ways, including internalizing the messages, changing their behaviour either to comply with or resist the restrictions, by remaining silent and anxious when restrictions were broken, and developing concerns around their own health and sexual and reproductive aspirations. Participants also sometimes experiencing stigma when restrictions could not be maintained.
   Conclusions: Restrictive messages were delivered to adolescent girls living with HIV through the broader social discourses of stigma, religion, and global and local narratives about HIV. Programmes aiming to support adolescent girls living with HIV need to work together with parents and healthcare providers to reflect on the impact of sanctioning messages, and to encourage more enabling and empowering messaging for adolescent girls living with HIV.

AB This study uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with smartphone devices to examine community adolescents' perceptions regarding both the intensity of and variability in their daily sadness/depression, anxiety, and somatic problems over the period of one week. Participants were 90 high-school students (M-age = 14.61, SD = 1.64; range 12-18). The sample was divided according to gender (61.1% girls), migratory status (68.5% Spanish nationals and 31.5% Latin American immigrants), and level of psychological symptoms (17% risk group). Sadness/depression, anxiety, and somatic problems were examined using a smartphone app, five times per day, semi-randomly, for seven days (35 possible moments). A high proportion of adolescents did not report feelings of sadness (80.0%) or worry (79.3%) or physical symptoms on a daily basis (84.9%). Girls and the risk group reported greater intensity levels for the three analyzed problems than did boys and the normal group, respectively (p < .001 in all cases). Migratory status was not associated with any significant differences in the analyzed problems over the one-week period (p > .05 in all cases). Day-to-day fluctuations in mood during the week were statistically significant but not meaningful (b = 0.0004, 95% CI [0.0001, 0.0008], p = .001).

AB Maternal trauma is a complex risk factor that has been linked to adverse child outcomes, yet the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. This study, which included adoptive and biological families, examined the heritable and environmental mechanisms by which maternal trauma and associated depressive symptoms are linked to child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Path analyses were used to analyze data from 541 adoptive mother-adopted child (AM-AC) dyads and 126 biological mother-biological child (BM-BC) dyads; the two family types were linked through the same biological mother. Rearing mother's trauma was associated with child internalizing and externalizing behaviors in AM-AC and BM-BC dyads, and this association was mediated by rearing mothers' depressive symptoms, with the exception of biological child externalizing behavior, for which biological mother trauma had a direct influence only. Significant associations between maternal trauma and child behavior in dyads that share only environment (i.e., AM-AC dyads) suggest an environmental mechanism of influence for maternal trauma. Significant associations were also observed between maternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing and externalizing behavior in dyads that were only genetically related, with no shared environment (i.e., BM-AC dyads), suggesting a heritable pathway of influence via maternal depressive symptoms.

AB The present study examined the effect of various dimensions of child maltreatment (i.e., developmental timing of maltreatment, number of maltreatment subtypes, and chronicity of maltreatment) on methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1), and investigated the associations between NR3C1 methylation and child outcomes. Participants included 534 children who attended a research summer camp program for school-aged maltreated (53.4%) and nonmaltreated (46.6%) children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Results show that children with early onset maltreatment evidence significant hypermethylation compared to nonmaltreated children. Moreover, more maltreatment subtypes experienced and more chronic maltreatment are both related to greater NR3C1 hypermethylation. Findings also indicate that hypermethylation of NR3C1 is linked with a number of negative child outcomes including greater emotional lability-negativity, higher levels of ego undercontrol, more externalizing behavior, and greater depressive symptoms. Together, results highlight the role of methylation of NR3C1 in the effects of child maltreatment on the development of emotion dysregulation and psychopathology.

AB The present study tested the role of FKBP5 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) genetic variation in an internalizing pathway from child maltreatment to emerging adult problem drinking among a sample of African American youth (N = 280) followed prospectively from ages 11 to 20. Specifically, whether childhood internalizing symptoms and emerging adult tension reduction alcohol expectancies sequentially mediate the effect of child maltreatment on emerging adult problem drinking and whether FKBP5 moderates these associations were investigated. The results indicate that individuals with at least one copy of the FKBP5 CATT haplotype (minor alleles) are more vulnerable to traversing the hypothesized internalizing pathway of risk than individuals without this genotypic profile. Taken together our findings highlight the importance of FKBP5 genetic variation in the context of early adversity; support the role of two prospective sequential mediators of an internalizing pathway to problematic drinking, namely, childhood internalizing symptoms and emerging adult tension reduction alcohol expectancies; and identify a subgroup of maltreated children most susceptible to progressing along this less common pathway of risk.

AB Early life stress (ELS) is a significant risk factor for the emergence of internalizing problems in adolescence. Beginning in adolescence, females are twice as likely as males to experience internalizing disorders. The present study was designed to examine sex differences in the association between ELS and internalizing problems in early pubertal adolescents, and whether and how corticolimbic function and connectivity may underlie these associations. Fifty-nine early pubertal males and 78 early pubertal females, ages 9-13 years (all Tanner Stage 3 or below) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they performed an emotion label task that robustly interrogates corticolimbic function. Participants were also interviewed about their experience of ELS. Females exhibited a positive association between ELS and internalizing problems, whereas males exhibited no such association. Whole-brain and amygdala region of interest analyses indicated that whereas females exhibited a positive association between ELS and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during implicit emotion regulation, males showed no such association. Activation in these regions was positively associated with internalizing problems in females but not males; however, activation in these regions did not mediate the association between ELS and internalizing problems. Finally, both boys and girls exhibited an association between ELS and increased negative connectivity between the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala. Using a carefully characterized sample of early pubertal adolescents, the current study highlights important sex differences in the development of corticolimbic circuitry during a critical period of brain development. These sex differences may play a significant role in subsequent risk for internalizing problems.

AB Youth with obesity are at increased risk of psychosocial symptoms; however, little is known regarding the impact of paediatric weight management (PWM) on psychosocial health. The aim of the study was to investigate changes in psychosocial health among children who completed a 7-week PWM program. Participants aged 5 to 16 years with a BMI >= 85th percentile completed a 7-week, family-centred PWM program focused on health behaviour education, exercise and mentored goal setting. The Paediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC) was assessed via parent report to evaluate psychosocial symptoms before and after the program, and subscales were calculated for internalizing (PSC-IS), externalizing (PSC-ES) and attention symptoms (PSC-AS). At baseline, positive screen rates for psychosocial symptoms among the 317 patients included 16.1% for PSC, 14.1% for PSC-ES, 18.6% for PSC-IS and 12.3% for PSC-AS. Among program completers, total PSC scores improved in those with normal (p = 0.010) and elevated p < .001 psychosocial symptoms at baseline. Youth with positive screens for elevated PSC subscales improved their subscale scores, on average, and the majority reduced scores to below elevated levels for PSC (54.2%), PSC-ES (64.7%), PSC-IS (78.3%) and PSC-AS (64.7%). Improvements in PSC remained significant after adjusting for BMI changes during treatment, but BMI differed across PSC-change groups, including BMI increases among participants with PSC deterioration (0.33 +/- 0.64 kg m(-2)) (P = 0.035) and BMI decreases among patients with no reliable PSC change (-0.26 +/- 1.04 kg m(-2)) (P = 0.038) or reliable PSC improvement (-0.22 +/- 0.74 kg m(-2)) (P = 0.025). Youth with positive screens for psychosocial symptoms can improve emotional and behavioural functioning during short-term PWM. Future research is needed to elucidate mechanisms and long-term outcome durability.

AB ObjectiveTo (a) estimate the level of child internalizing problems in a sample of Ukrainian school-age children and (b) examine the relationships between child internalizing psychopathology and parenting practices, depression, alcohol use, and sociodemographics.
   BackgroundMost research on child internalizing behaviors has used samples from high-income countries, but there is a lack of information about children's behaviors and associated risk and protective factors from low- and middle-income countries such as Ukraine. An ecological-transactional model framework was used in this study to examine maternal and family-level factors associated with child internalizing behavior problems.
   MethodData were gathered from a community-based sample of Ukrainian mothers and children between 9 and 16years of age (n=251) using face-to-face interviews. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship among the independent variables (e.g., alcohol use, depression, and parenting behaviors) and children's internalizing behaviors.
   ResultsOlder children, especially boys, reported fewer internalizing problems. Increased internalizing symptomatology was associated with mothers' older age, higher level of depression, lower use of positive parenting, and poor child monitoring and supervision.
   ConclusionThese results raise awareness about the importance of child familial backgrounds while trying to address child mental health problems in Ukraine.
   ImplicationsFamily practitioners may want to help mothers learn and apply positive parenting and effective supervision and monitoring skills to help reduce their children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Additionally, helping to decrease maternal depression may have a positive trickle-down effect on their children's internalizing behaviors.

AB Objective: The present study extended recent work on communal narcissism to a sample of at-risk adolescents. Although narcissism is widely considered an agentic personality construct, Gebauer and colleagues (Gebauer, Sedikides, Verplanken, & Maio, 2012) demonstrated the existence and utility of a communal narcissism construct in adults. The extent to which this variant of narcissism applies to adolescents is not yet known. Because communal narcissism (e.g., feeling that one is the most helpful, is a great influence on others, will bring about world peace) may actually be aversive to others, we investigated the associated self-and peer perceptions of adolescent communal narcissism.
   Method: Participants were 136 adolescents (104 males, 32 females; 52.2% White, 42.2% Black, 5.6% Other) aged 16-19, who were attending a 22-week residential program together. Participants completed self-report measures of narcissism and interpersonal behavior, as well as a peer nomination procedure.
   Results: Self-reported communal narcissism was significantly related to self-reported pro-social behavior but was associated with peer-reported aggression, similar to the findings for nonpathological narcissism, which is considered agentic.
   Conclusions: Adolescent communal narcissism appears to be tied to negative peer perceptions. The implications for understanding the interpersonal consequences of adolescent grandiosity in communal domains are discussed.

AB Objective: Depressed parents have negatively distorted views of the personalities and behaviors of their children. Our goal was to evaluate how other internalizing symptoms and personality traits relate to perceptions of child temperament using data from mothers and fathers as well as a novel statistical method for modeling multi-informant data.
   Method: We applied the trifactor model (Bauer et al., 2013) to data collected from the parents of 273 children (aged 3-5 years).
   Results: Internalizing symptoms and personality traits were related to both mothers' and fathers' perceptions of their children. Effects varied somewhat across dimensions of child temperament.
   Conclusions: These results support concerns that psychological characteristics influence parental perceptions of their children. This research also provides insights about psychological predictors of potential parental biases.

AB Objective: In the last two decades there has been a significant transformation regarding the use of new technologies. Despite growing acknowledgement concerning the different activities and functions of digital technologies, there remains a lack of understanding on how technology overuse may negatively impact both physical and psychosocial well-being. Although researchers have begun to explore the meaning and implications of excessive Internet use in non-clinical populations of children and adolescents, there is still little consistent knowledge on the topic.
   This study aimed to extend existing knowledge on the excessive use of the Internet among school-aged adolescents, focusing on its association with recurrent somatic symptoms, depressive risk and behavioral and emotional problems.
   Method: Two hundred and forty adolescents (51.9% females) aged between 10 and 15, participated in this study. Data was collected using the Children's Somatization Inventory, the Internet Addiction Test, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Youth Self Report and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Structural Equation Model analysis was used to analyse the data.
   Results: Approximately 21.8% of participants reported excessive Internet use based on Young's criteria. Higher levels of Internet use were associated with somatic and depressive symptoms as well as emotional and behavioral problems. Depressive Symptoms predicted both Internet Addiction (b = 0.304, p < 0.001) and Internalizing (b = 0.542, p < 0.001) and Externalizing problems (b = 0.484, p < 0.001). Internet Addiction also significantly predicted both Internalizing (b = 0.162, p = 0.02) and Externalizing problems (b = 0.183, p = 0.02). Finally, Structural Equation Modeling showed that the indirect effect of Depressive Symptoms (via Internet Addiction) on Internalizing or Externalizing problems were significant.
   Conclusions: Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and to identify the mechanisms linking Internet use, somatic symptoms and adaptive functioning.

AB The present study demonstrates the interplay between interparental relationship satisfaction and child plasticity in the origins of internalizing problems in 99 community mothers, fathers, and children. Our cumulative measure of plasticity integrated genetics (5-HTTLPR polymorphism), psychophysiology (skin conductance level), and observed behavior (inhibition, sadness, joy). The interaction between plasticity and interparental relationship satisfaction reflected differential susceptibility. Compared with low-plasticity peers, high-plasticity children had more internalizing problems from 5.5 to 12 years when the interparental relationship at 4.5 years was acrimonious, but fewer problems when it was harmonious. Further, almost half of the children in this sample were "differentially affected" by the interaction such that greater plasticity was associated with fewer internalizing problems when their parents had a harmonious relationship, a key feature of differential susceptibility.

AB The cortisol awakening response (CAR) has been associated with depression and a broader range of internalizing problems. Emerging adulthood is characterized by numerous stressful transitional life events. Furthermore, the functioning of the neurobiological stress system changes across development. These considerations underscore the importance of evaluating the physiological stress system in emerging adults in identifying the extent to which cortisol levels vary with risk and protective factors for mental health. The present study evaluated the association between internalizing symptoms and perceived life satisfaction with CAR in 32 young adults. Three saliva samples were collected to measure cortisol levels upon awakening and participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Results show a significant positive correlation between area under the curve for CAR with internalizing symptoms (DASS total) and the DASS-depression subscale, but not with life satisfaction. Study limitations, implications, and future directions for these finding were discussed.

AB Early substance use (i.e., before age 14) is a known risk factor for substance use disorder, but scarce research has examined gender differences in pathways to early substance use. This study applies a developmental traumatology perspective to examine the relations between child physical and sexual abuse and early substance use among youths investigated by child protective services (CPS), a population with high risk for substance use disorder. Drawing from the first National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW), a sample of 11-13 year olds (n = 467 girls, n = 329 boys) was examined. Multiple group path analysis assessed gender differences in the relations between physical and sexual abuse severity and early substance use and indirect effects via internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and posttraumatic stress. Focal measures included the child-reported Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (physical abuse severity), the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (posttraumatic stress), the Youth Self-Report (internalizing and externalizing problems), and the NSCAW's caseworker-alleged abuse (sexual abuse severity) and child substance abuse modules (any current alcohol, marijuana, hard drug, inhalant, or nonmedical prescription drug use). Significant indirect effects of physical abuse severity to early substance use were found through externalizing behavior problems in girls only = 0.068; 95% CI = 0.029, 0.130; p = 0.004), with a significantly stronger relation between externalizing problems and early substance use in girls. Results suggest gender differences in the sequelae of trauma as they relate to early onset substance use and the need to integrate mental health and substance use services.

AB In this study it was aimed to investigate the relationship between disordered eating attitude and early maladaptive schemas, emotion regulation difficulties, and perceived parenting styles in young women. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the mediation effect of early maladaptive schemas and emotion regulation difficulties in the relationship between the perceived parenting styles and eating attitudes. The sample of this study consists of 773 female university students aged between 17-35. Eating Attitudes-Test (EAT-40), Young Schema Questionnaire- Short Form 3 (YSQ-SF3), Young Parenting Inventory (YPI) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were used. First, the sample was classified into two groups as "high risk group for developing eating disorder" (n = 92) and "low risk group for developing eating disorder" (ri = 80) according to the scores obtained from Eating Attitude Test. Analysis has shown that the high risk group perceive both their mother and father negatively, possess more severe early maladaptive schemas and face more difficulties in the emotion regulation except for awareness sub-dimension than the low risk group. In addition, with the whole sample (N = 773), it has been found that the emotional deprivition, self-sacrifice, unrelenting standards (high standards) schemas of early maladaptive schemas and difficulties of emotion regulation total score have served as disordered eating attitude predictors. Besides, it is understood from the analysis that these variables have a mediating role in the relationship between negative perceived maternal parenting and eating attitudes. It is considered that these findings will be a guide to prepare intervention studies.

AB Objective: Hypersensitivity to carbon dioxide (COD enriched air may be a promising risk marker for anxiety disorders. Among adult and adolescent samples, heterogeneity in distress response to the CO2 challenge task indexes 3 underlying classes of individuals, which distinguish between sustained and acute threat response as markers for internalizing disorders, broadly, and anxiety disorders, specifically. The present study examines latent classes in children's response to the CO2 challenge task to clarify the association of CO2 hypersensitivity with anxiety and internalizing symptomatology in childhood.
   Method: Healthy children from a community twin sample (N = 538; age 9 13 years) rated anxious distress every 2 minutes while breathing air enriched to 7.5% CO2 for 8 minutes. Latent growth mixture modeling evaluated potential classes of individuals with characteristic trajectories of distress during the task to clarify the association with internalizing disorder symptoms and related traits (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, irritability).
   Results: Although all participants reported increased distress during the task, interindividual heterogeneity in distress indexed 3 underlying classes: a consistently low class ("low"), a consistently high class ("high"), and participants who demonstrated markedly increased-acute distress ("acute"). Compared to the low class, the high class reported greater internalizing psychopathology, whereas membership in the acute class was associated with experiencing a panic-like event during the task.
   Conclusion: As in older individuals, 3 distinct trajectories emerged to capture interindividual heterogeneity in children's distress during the CO2 challenge task. These classes were distinguished by clinical validators that reinforce the association of CO2 hypersensitivity and internalizing disorder phenotypes in children.

AB This study analyzed the relationship between daily hassles and psychological symptoms (externalizing and internalizing symptomatology) and school, social and family adaptation in childhood. The participants were 552 (53.4% boys and 46.6% girls), aged between 10-12 years (M=10.91). Patients receiving treatment in mental health services and a community group were compared. Self-report questionnaires were administered: Children's Hassles Scale (CHS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Cas), Modified Depression Scale (MDS), School Adaptation Scale and Family Adaptation Scale. The average of daily hassles was 11, with six of them experiencing distress. Daily hassles were related to an increased presence of symptoms and lower levels of adaptation (p<.01). The association between daily hassles and depressive symptoms were stronger in the clinical group than in the community one. Daily hassles explain from 21 to 39 percent of variance in symptomatology and from 5 to 41 percent in adaptation. Daily hassles are relevant for planning prevention and intervention strategies in childhood.

AB This study analyzed the influence of adolescents' perception of parenting behaviors on externalizing and internalizing disorders. The controlled variables (and their possible effects) were: sex of parents and children, age, family structure, and the perception of economic problems within the family. The participants were 284 adolescents (156 female and 128 male) ranging between 11 and 19 years of age. Multiple regression analyses results showed that the punitiveness of parents was related to internalizing and externalizing disorders, while low monitoring was associated to externalizing disorders only. Withdrawal of paternal affection was related to internalizing disorders. Other predictive variables were the perception of economic problems, sex, and age of children and the existence of a reconstituted family. In non-reconstituted households, the paternal monitoring was related to fewer externalizing disorders and maternal induction with fewer internalizing disorders. The importance of fostering positive parenting behaviors as well as working with families who are in a process of separation or reconstitution is discussed.

AB With this prospective population-based study, we showed that infant neuromotor development, including muscle tone and senses, predicted internalizing problems but not externalizing problems through age 10 years. BACKGROUND:Research of adults and school-aged children suggest a neurodevelopmental basis for psychiatric disorders. We examined whether infant neuromotor development predicted internalizing and externalizing problems in young children.
   METHODS:In Generation R, a population-based cohort in the Netherlands (2002-2006), trained research assistants evaluated the neuromotor development of 4006 infants aged 2 to 5 months by using an adapted version of Touwen's Neurodevelopmental Examination (tone, responses, and senses and other observations). We defined nonoptimal neuromotor development as scores in the highest tertile. Mothers and fathers rated their children's behavior at ages 1.5, 3, 6, and 10 years with the Child Behavior Checklist (n = 3474, response: 86.7%). The associations were tested with generalized linear mixed models.
   RESULTS:Overall, neuromotor development predicted internalizing scores, but no association was observed with externalizing scores. Nonoptimal muscle tone was associated with higher internalizing scores (mothers' report: = .07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01 to 0.13; fathers' report: = .09, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.16). In particular, nonoptimal low muscle tone was associated with higher internalizing scores (mothers' report: = .11; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.18; fathers' report: = .13; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.22). We also observed an association between senses and other observations with internalizing scores. There was no relationship between high muscle tone or reflexes and internalizing scores.
   CONCLUSIONS:Common emotional problems in childhood have a neurodevelopmental basis in infancy. Neuromotor assessment in infancy may help identify vulnerability to early internalizing symptoms and offer the opportunity for targeted interventions.

AB This study examined whether children follow unique victimization trajectories during elementary school and whether these paths predict differential psychological and physical health outcomes during high school. Participants included 1,073 children from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Peer victimization was assessed in the 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 9th grades, and psychological and physical health outcomes (e.g., depression, loneliness, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, physical health markers, and health habits) were measured in the 9th grade. Growth mixture modeling revealed three groups: non-victims (n = 886), persistent victims (n = 52), and escaped victims (n = 70). Generally, persistent victims experienced poorer physical functioning and health, higher levels of psychological maladjustments, and poorer health habits (i.e., sleep problems, disordered eating) compared to non-victims. Using case-control matching, escaped victims and non-victims did not differ on health behaviors and most physical health measures, with the exception of adiposity. Escaped victims experienced higher levels of psychological issues than non-victims comparable to those observed in persistent victims. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of both victimization experiences and health outcomes following aversive peer experiences.

AB BackgroundAs predicted by self-medication theories that drinking is motivated by a desire to ameliorate emotional distress, some studies find internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) increase risk of adolescent drinking; however, such a risk effect has not been supported consistently. Our prior work examined externalizing symptoms as a potential moderator of the association between internalizing symptoms and adolescent alcohol use to explain some of the inconsistencies in the literature. We found that internalizing symptoms were protective against early adolescent alcohol use particularly for youth elevated on externalizing symptoms (a 2-way interaction). Our sample has now been followed for several additional assessments that extend into young adulthood, and the current study tests whether the protective effect of internalizing symptoms may change as youth age into young adulthood, and whether this age-moderating effect varied across different clusters of internalizing symptoms (social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression). Internalizing symptoms were hypothesized to shift from a protective factor to a risk factor with age, particularly for youth elevated on externalizing symptoms.
   MethodsA community sample of 387 adolescents was followed for 9 annual assessments (mean age=12.1years at the first assessment and 55% female). Multilevel cross-lagged 2-part zero-inflated Poisson models were used to test hypotheses.
   ResultsThe most robust moderating effects were for levels of alcohol use, such that the protective effect of all internalizing symptom clusters was most evident in the context of moderate to high levels of externalizing problems. A risk effect of internalizing symptoms was evident at low levels of externalizing symptoms. With age, the risk and protective effects of internalizing symptoms were evident at less extreme levels of externalizing behavior. With respect to alcohol-related problems, findings did not support age moderation for generalized anxiety or depression, but it was supported for social anxiety.
   ConclusionsFindings highlight the importance of considering the role of emotional distress from a developmental perspective and in the context of externalizing behavior problems.

AB This study examines illness-specific family burden as a mediator of the association between late effects of childhood cancer and survivors' emotional and behavioral outcomes. Childhood cancer survivors (n = 65; ages 10-17) two or more years off-treatment completed measures assessing internalizing and PTSD symptoms. Parents reported on illness-specific family burden, late effects severity, and survivor internalizing/externalizing problems. Providers documented the number of late effects. Illness-specific family burden was correlated with provider-reported late effects (r = .29, p < .05) and parent report of severe late effects (r = .56, p < .01). Results supported an indirect effect of illness-specific family burden on number of late effects and parent-reported survivor internalizing problems, p < .05. Indirect effects were not found in models predicting PTSD and externalizing problems. Illness-specific family burden is an important intervention target for reducing internalizing problems in childhood cancer survivors with late effects.

AB We report results of an exploratory validation study of the Student Risk Screening Scale-Internalizing and Externalizing (SRSS-IE) applied with the first sample of middle and high school students from nine middle and three high schools from three states. The Student Risk Screening Scale (SRSS) was modified to broaden the scope of this user-friendly systematic screening tool to detect secondary-age students with internalizing behavior patterns. Building on initial evidence establishing reliability and validity of the SRSS-IE at the middle school level, we used classical test theory to explore reliability of SRSS-IE spring screening scores for use with sixth- through 12th-grade students. Specifically, we analyzed item-level data, internal consistency estimates, and factor structure using exploratory factor analysis. Results suggested five of the seven proposed items be retained, yielding the SRSS-IE12. Peer rejection (one of the originally developed items by Drummond) loaded on the internalizing construct, providing preliminary evidence suggesting two factors: SRSS-E7 (the original tool) and SRSS-I6 for use with secondary students, with peer rejection loading on both subscales but only added once when formulating the total score (SRSS-IE12). We present limitations and direction for future inquiry.

AB Clinically meaningful behavior problems are thought to be present beginning in the early toddler years, yet few studies have investigated correlates of behavior problems assessed before age 2 years. The current study investigated the direct and interactive contributions of early infant and caregiver characteristics thought to play an important role in the ontogeny of behavior problems. Specifically, the study examined: (a) the links between infant temperamental reactivity and toddler behavioral symptoms, (b) whether maternal sensitivity moderated associations between temperamental reactivity and behavioral symptoms, (c) whether variability in temperamental reactivity was explained by exposure to maternal stressful life events (SLEs) in utero, and (d) whether child sex moderated these pathways. Data were collected from 322 low-income, Mexican American families. Mother reports of SLEs were obtained between 23 and 40 weeks gestation; temperamental negativity and surgency at 6 weeks and 12 months; and internalizing and externalizing behaviors at 18 months. Maternal sensitivity during structured mother-infant interaction tasks at a 12-month visit was assessed by objective raters. Results indicated that significant paths linked maternal prenatal SLEs with 6-week negativity, 6-week negativity with 12-month negativity, and 12-month negativity with 18-month behavioral symptoms. Sex-specific effects were also observed. Maternal SLEs were directly associated with internalizing behaviors for girls only. Surgency and maternal sensitivity moderated the associations of negativity with subsequent externalizing behaviors for girls only. Results suggest that ecological stressors associated with sociodemographic risk factors such as low-income and ethnic minority status begin to exert cascades of influence on children's developmental outcomes even before birth.

AB Family processes and parenting practices help explain developmental differences between children in low-versus higher-income households. There are, however, few studies addressing the question of: what are the key family processes and parenting practices for promoting low-income children's growth? We address this question in the present study, following conceptual work framing family processes and parenting practices as investments in children. Using secondary analyses of longitudinal data on low-income children from birth to age 15 (n = 528), we estimate several potential family investments in achievement and socioemotional outcomes during early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. For achievement outcomes, family investments in learning stimulation were consistently the strongest predictors. For socioemotional outcomes, investments in an orderly household and close parental supervision were the most consistent and strongest predictors, even more so than sensitive parenting.

AB The main objective of the present research was to analyze the relations between stressful life events and the externalizing and internalizing spectra of psychopathology using meta-analytical procedures. After removing the duplicates, a total of 373 papers were found in a literature search using several bibliographic databases, such as the PsycINFO, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. Twenty-seven studies were selected for the meta-analytical analysis after applying different inclusion and exclusion criteria in different phases. The statistical procedure was performed using a random/mixed-effects model based on the correlations found in the studies. Significant positive correlations were found in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. A transactional effect was then found in the present study. Stressful life events could be a cause, but also a consequence, of psychopathological spectra. The level of controllability of the life events did not affect the results. Special attention should be given to the usage of stressful life events in gene-environment interaction and correlation studies, and also for clinical purposes.

AB A goal of clinical trials is to identify unique baseline characteristics that can inform treatment planning. One such target is emotion dysregulation (ED), which contributes to the maintenance of co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) and may be a potential moderator of treatment response. We examined the moderating impact of ED severity on treatment outcomes in an urban, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and racially/ethnically diverse sample with complex trauma and severe SUDs. Participants with cooccurring PTSD and SUD (PTSD + SUD) were randomized to Concurrent Treatment with Prolonged Exposure (COPE, n = 39), Relapse Prevention Therapy (RPT, n = 43), or an active monitoring control group (AMCG, n = 28). Baseline ED severity moderated treatment outcomes such that high ED was associated with greater reduction in PTSD severity among those who received COPE relative to RPT and AMCG. In contrast, low ED was associated with greater reduction in substance use among those in RPT relative to COPE and AMCG. Implications for individualizing and optimizing treatment selection for PTSD + SUD are discussed.

AB Our study investigated the associations among two expressions of perceived parental psychological control (dependency-oriented parental control [DPC] and achievement-oriented parental control [APC]), identity, and internalizing difficulties among college-attending emerging adults. In particular, our aim was to examine the potential role of identity in the pathways linking both DPC and APC to internalizing difficulties. Our participants included 495 Italian college students (49% males), between 19 and 28 years of age (mean = 23.37 years, standard deviation = 2.35). Our findings highlighted the existence of associations between APC, identity, and internalizing difficulties. Specifically, APC was negatively related to identity that, in turn, was related to both anxiety and depressive symptoms. Moreover, APC showed direct effects on internalizing difficulties, whereas DPC had neither direct nor indirect effects on the outcomes. Overall, our findings highlighted the importance of examining the different contribution of the two forms of parental psychological control to emerging adults' internalizing difficulties via identity.

AB This study examines attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits as moderators of the association between conduct problems (CP) and young adult functioning. Young adults (n = 283; M-age = 20.82 years; 53.4% female), oversampled for attention and behavior problems, provided self-ratings of ADHD, CP, and CU, and adaptive functioning and psychopathology. ADHD and CU simultaneously moderated relationships between CP and family functioning, tobacco use, and internalizing symptoms. In addition, ADHD moderated the relation between CP and job functioning, and main effects of ADHD in the expected direction were found for educational performance and drug use. CU was associated with poorer educational outcomes. Interestingly, no ADHD, CU, or CP effects were observed for reported alcohol use. Our results highlight the importance of considering ADHD and CU in understanding the impact of CP on young adult functioning and psychopathology, and point to the importance of continued work on this topic.

AB In this article, we summarize findings from the Stony Brook Temperament Study, which seeks to elucidate the early antecedents and pathways to later depressive and anxiety disorders. The study focuses on parents' internalizing disorders and children's early temperament as distal risk factors that operate, in part, through biobehavioral reward and threat systems. We summarize findings linking parents' emotional disorders and observations of children's early temperament to subsequent neural measures of children's affective processing. Next, we review findings showing that children's temperament and affective processing predict subsequent depression and anxiety. We also show that many of these associations are moderated by environmental factors, such as parenting and stress. Finally, we relate our findings to literature on the relationships of early temperament and affective processing to anxiety and depression in youth.

AB We examined whether psychological suzhi mediated the associations between attachment (paternal, maternal, and peer) and young adolescents' behavior (internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial) in a longitudinal study. Psychological suzhi reflects the positive psychological traits that facilitate adolescents' positive adaptation to the school and social environment. Five hundred and ninety-five junior high school students (48% male; aged 11-15 years, M = 12.86 years, SD = 0.71) completed measures of attachment and psychological suzhi at Times 1 and 2 (a six-month interval), while students' parents completed measures of adolescents' behavior at Time 3 (another six months later). We observed significant longitudinal correlations between attachment, psychological suzhi, and behavior. Prospective analyses using bootstrapping demonstrated significant indirect effects of attachment on adolescent behavior via psychological suzhi. These findings highlighted the importance of attachment and psychological suzhi as protective factors in the developmental course of early adolescents' behavior.

AB Introduction: Family factors are directly associated with the psychosocial adjustment of children with chronic illnesses such as asthma (Kaugars, Klinnert, & Bender, 2004). Research indicates that negative family factors may also contribute to child disease severity via bio-behavioral mechanisms of effect. For instance, children from more conflicted families often experience greater internalizing symptoms that subsequently impact their asthma severity (Wood et al., 2006). These pathways have yet to be examined with a comprehensive focus on strength-based family factors. This study examined whether factors such as family cohesion, problem-solving abilities, and communication influence asthma severity via their effects on child depression and anxiety symptoms. Method: Participants were 215 children (136 males and 79 females), ages 5 to 12 years old, and their families. Primary caregiver, child, and teacher ratings of child and family functioning in addition to objective measures of parent-child interactions and asthma severity were collected. Results: Using structural equation modeling, the authors identified significant indirect associations between family factors and child asthma severity via child depressive symptoms; however, these associations were not present in models with child anxiety symptoms. Discussion: Results suggest an indirect effect of family functioning on children's lung function, with differential roles of anxiety and depression in these pathways. This article also highlights the importance of incorporating multirater multimethod measures to understand children's experiences in pediatric asthma.

AB Generalized anxiety and depression symptoms may be associated with poorer social outcomes among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without intellectual disability. The goal of this study was to examine whether generalized anxiety and depression symptoms were associated with social competence after accounting for IQ, age, and gender in typically developing children and in children with ASD. Results indicated that for the TD group, generalized anxiety and depression accounted for 38% of the variance in social competence and for children with ASD, they accounted for 29% of the variance in social competence. However, only depression accounted for a significant amount of the variance. The findings underscore the importance of assessing the social impact of internalizing symptoms in children with ASD.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is an internationally popular tool for assessing of psychological and psychosocial development; however, recent research has suggested it lacks measurement invariance in several situations. We expand on this discussion by examining the measurement variance of its two popular models across longitudinal measurements. We examined the fits of both models, conducted tests of invariance across time, and measured the change over time for each factor. We found that both models provide good fits and, furthermore, that strong measurement invariance was upheld across all measurement points for both models. Additionally, we found that problem scores increased and prosocial behavior scores decreased over time. We conclude that both models provide good fits of the data and have measurement invariance over time, but that more research is required regarding its measurement invariance across cultures.

AB Evidence from general population studies shows the contribution of various temperament traits to the development of child psychopathology. Little is known about which traits are associated with internalizing and externalizing problems in young clinically referred children. The current study assessed temperament and internalizing and externalizing problems in 216 referred children (M = 4.35 years, SD 0.89, 81% boys). A comparison was made with an age and gender matched general population sample. Referred children showed less effortful control than general population children. Less effortful control and more negative affectivity were associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems across groups. Surgency, and specifically temperamental impulsivity, was more strongly associated with externalizing problems in referred children compared to general population. Less soothability, less inhibitory control and more frustration predicted (sub)clinical levels of comborbid internalizing and externalizing problems in referred children. The results can be used in diagnostic and treatment procedures in early childhood.

AB ObjectivesPerfectionism is recognized as a significant risk factor for psychopathology. Emerging research links attachment to perfectionism in adult and college-age samples. The Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) has been used in adults and adolescents with a variety of factor structures found. This study sought to establish the factor structure in a general adolescent sample prior to testing for associations between perfectionism, attachment, and psychopathology in the same sample.
   DesignA cross-sectional survey design was used. Confirmatory factor analysis, and correlational and regression analyses were employed.
   MethodsA total of 290 adolescents, aged 12-18years, were recruited from a state secondary school. All completed the FMPS along with brief measures of attachment and psychopathology.
   ResultExploratory and confirmatory factor analyses failed to replicate previously published models, and a new six-item, 1-factor model representing perfectionism was found instead. This new variable was then used to establish a role for perfectionism and attachment anxiety in predicting internalizing problems. Perfectionism also correlated with conduct problems and hyperactivity.
   ConclusionThis study established a novel factor structure for the FMPS, allowing proof of principle of the role of perfectionism in a relationship with attachment and psychopathology, which after replication, may inform new interventions for perfectionism. Caution is noted about the use of extant perfectionism measures that are not properly developmentally informed and which do not capture the dynamic nature of adolescence and adolescent perfectionism.

AB Obesity has serious psychosocial consequences for youth and family members and has reached epidemic levels in Portugal.
   This study had two goals: (1) to investigate differences in family cohesion, mothers' quality of life (QoL), and externalizing/internalizing symptoms between children/adolescents with healthy-weight and overweight/obesity; (2) to assess the mediating role of maternal QoL and children/adolescents' externalizing/internalizing symptoms in the association between family cohesion and weight.
   Children/adolescents with healthy-weight (n = 134) and with overweight/obesity (n = 163) and their mothers participated in the study. Mothers completed measures of family cohesion (FC) and QoL and children/adolescents completed measures of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. This study used a cross-sectional design.
   Children/adolescents with overweight/obesity reported higher levels of externalizing and internalizing symptoms than children/adolescents with healthy-weight. Mothers of children/adolescents with overweight/obesity reported lower levels of FC and QoL than mothers of children/adolescents with healthy-weight. Mothers' QoL and children/adolescents' externalizing symptoms sequentially mediated the relationship between FC and weight status. Specifically, an increase in FC and QoL resulted in a decreased likelihood of the child/adolescent reporting overweight or obesity, whereas an increase in externalizing symptoms resulted in a higher likelihood of the child/adolescent reporting overweight or obesity.
   This study identifies mechanisms that might account for the link between FC and weight, suggesting the importance of mothers' QoL and children's externalizing symptoms. Moreover, it provides a better understanding of the psychosocial outcomes related to pediatric obesity, highlighting the relevance of working with the parents to promote weight reduction in youths.

AB Peer bullying is associated with internalizing problems for children and adolescents. However, less is known about how these same behaviors are related to student well-being when they occur within the context of the sibling relationship and how supportive behavior may benefit those experiencing bullying.
   The purpose of this study was to examine the unique associations among peer and sibling bullying and internalizing problems, and the role of peer and sibling social support in relation to social-emotional outcomes.
   Data on students' experiences of peer and sibling bullying, perceptions of social support and internalizing symptoms were collected from a sample of 372 elementary school students using the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (OBVQ; Olweus 1996), a modified version of the OBVQ created to assess bullying by siblings, the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS; Malecki et al. 2000), and three subscales from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, Self-Report of Personality (Reynolds and Kamphaus 2004).
   Results indicated that Sibling Bullying was significantly related to internalizing problems above and beyond Peer Bullying alone. Additionally, social support from peers moderated the association between Sibling Bullying and Depression; and social support from siblings moderated the association between Peer Bullying and Social Stress. Gender differences in study findings were also uncovered.
   Results of this study suggest that bullying behaviors are detrimental to student social-emotional well-being, regardless of whom the perpetrator may be, and that being bullied by siblings is associated with similar outcomes as traditional bullying.

AB Personality is generally considered to be biologically founded in temperament, and temperamental qualities have proven to be relatively stable across childhood and into adulthood (Caspi, Roberts & Shiner, ). Temperament predicts important developmental outcomes such as academic performance (Muris, ), and social functioning (Eisenberg, Fabes, Guthrie & Reiser, ), and it has also been found to be strongly related to the etiology and maintenance of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children (Muris, Meesters & Blijlevens, ; Nigg, ). To allow for the possibility of making early interventions, identification of potential risk factors (such as temperamental dispositions) is of great importance (Rettew & McKee, ). As temperament is multidimensional and has many different manifestations, parents and teachers are valuable sources in providing information about children's temperament (Rothbart & Bates, ; Tackett, Slobodskaya, Mar etal., ), and caregiver questionnaires are frequently used in child personality research. However, such questionnaires are only useful if their reliability and validity have been established. The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Temperament in Middle Childhood Questionnaire (TMCQ; Simonds, Kieras, Rueda & Rothbart, ), which focuses specifically on the ages between 7 and 11 years. The TMCQ is the least validated of the Rothbart measures, and although reliability data have been presented, together with some validity data, for a computerized self-report version of the questionnaire (Simonds & Rothbart, ), information about the reliability and validity for the caregiver version is scant. In the present paper, we report such data for a Swedish sample.

AB To better understand adolescents experiencing peer victimization, ostracism, and emotional health problems, this study aimed to describe a cohort of middle school students identified as having school peer-related social difficulties as 2 groups: those with mental health diagnoses (MHDs; n = 17) and those without diagnoses (n = 8). Participants were administered a test battery to examine communication ability, social responsiveness, social activity, ostracism, victimization, and emotional health. Results showed that adolescents with MHDs, relative to those without, scored significantly lower on measures of communication ability, social responsiveness, and social activity but similarly on measures of victimization, ostracism, and internalizing/externalizing factors. Results suggest that adolescents with and without MHDs can endure ostracism and peer victimization to a similar extent. Because ostracism and victimization have serious morbidity in adolescents, physicians and caregivers must look for signs in all adolescents, irrespective of MHD. Recommendations for appropriate primary care management are discussed.

AB Purpose of Review This review provides an overview of food allergy among children and adolescents in the context of its impact on psychosocial functioning, and quality of life (QoL).
   Recent Findings The prevalence of food allergy is increasing. The burden of day to day management of food allergy is significant and can have a negative impact on QoL for both parents of those with food allergy, and the children themselves. This can impact social functioning, academic functioning, and mental health. Children with food allergy experience more bullying than peers. Greater internalizing of symptoms has been identified in adolescents with food allergy. Typical developmental considerations in the transition from adolescence to adulthood can be impacted significantly.
   Summary Those caring for children with food allergy should consider the impact of food allergy on the individual and family level within the context of social and emotional development.

AB BACKGROUNDStudies have shown a relationship between students' health and their academic achievements, but whether health of classmates and schoolmates impacts individual students' school achievement is less known. We studied these effects on students in lower secondary school in Finland.
   METHODSStudents (seventh grade, age 12-13 years, N = 7779, 123 schools, 565 classes) participated in a classroom survey measuring health (externalizing and internalizing problems, daily health complaints, and long-term illness) and academic achievement. Academic achievement when leaving school (15-16 years) was obtained from the Finnish national application register on upper secondary education. Three-level (student, class, and school) multilevel regression analyses were executed.
   RESULTSAll health variables predicted academic achievement at leaving school at the student level and externalizing and internalizing problems at the class level; better health predicted better achievement. Students' health at the school level was not related to academic achievement. The effect of class-level health on academic achievement was as strong as the effect of student-level health.
   CONCLUSIONBoth student and classmates' health at the beginning of lower secondary school contribute to academic achievement when leaving school.

AB Research has shown a link between emotion regulation (ER) repertoire, the range of ER strategies an individual employs and the degree to which they rely on them, and well-being. However, this advancement is hindered by the lack of a single measurement tool capable of assessing multiple ER strategies on a common scale. The current paper reports on two studies utilizing the Regulation of Emotion Systems Survey (RESS), a new self-report measure allowing for variable- and person-centered analyses of six common ER strategies (Distraction, Rumination, Reappraisal, Suppression, Engagement, Arousal Control). Study 1 (n = 1582) included scale development, validation, and Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). Results showed the RESS is a valid, reliable, and effective measure. Three profiles were identified (Average, Suppression Propensity, Engagement Propensity). The Average group reported greater psychosocial functioning than the Suppression group. Study 2 (n = 100) LPA indicated 4 profiles (Average, Suppression Propensity, Engagement Propensity, Multi-strategy) and assessed the effects of emotionality. The Average group reported lower emotional awareness than the Engagement and Multi-Strategy groups. Profiles did not differ on frequency or intensity of emotions. Findings demonstrated the utility of the RESS and confirm the importance of ER repertoires to better understand connections between ER and well-being. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The social-emotional functions associated with Machiavellianism have been widely examined. However, most research on Machiavellianism is cross-sectional design, and has been conducted in adult populations. Using a sample of adolescents (n = 454), the current study employed a longitudinal design to examine how Machiavellianism relates to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The results indicated that (a) a significant increase in Machiavellianism scores and a significant decrease in difficulties scores were observed over the course of a year; (b) Machiavellianism shows significant positive associations, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, with nearly all categories of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems; (c) time 1 hyperactivity was a significant predictor of time 2 (one year later) Machiavellianism; and (d) over the course of a year, Machiavellian ism still has a significant impact on subsequent conduct problems. The implications of these findings are interpreted and discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Youth with a history of child maltreatment use substances and develop substance use disorders at rates above national averages. Thus far, no research has examined pathways from maltreatment to age of substance use initiation for maltreated youth. We examined the longitudinal impact of maltreatment in early childhood on age of alcohol and marijuana use initiation, and whether internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 8 mediates the link between maltreatment and age of substance use initiation.
   Materials and methods: Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) at ages 4, 8, 12, and 18. Maltreatment was assessed through reviews of administrative records and youth self reports. Behavior problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist. Age of substance use initiation was assessed with the Young Adult version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children.
   Results: Path analyses indicated mediated effects from a history of maltreatment to age at first alcohol and marijuana use through externalizing behaviors. Considering type of maltreatment, direct effects were found from physical abuse to age of alcohol initiation, and mediated effects were found from sexual abuse and neglect to initial age of alcohol and marijuana use through externalizing behaviors. Direct effects for marijuana use initiation and indirect effects through internalizing behavior problems were not significant for either substance.
   Conclusions: Externalizing behavior is one pathway from childhood maltreatment to age of substance use initiation. Services for maltreated youth should incorporate substance use prevention, particularly among those with early externalizing problems.

AB Objective: Dropout from the ongoing treatment is defined as premature termination of the treatment against the clinician's advice. Dropout may lead to insufficient treatment, endurance of the disorder and worse quality of life. The aim of the present study is to investigate relationship of dropout with a list of possible predictive factors including; diagnosis, treatment modality, previous contact with services and child and family-related sociodemographic characteristics related to the child and their families. Methods: The sample consisted of a total of 954 children and adolescents, aged 6-18 years, attended to Bezmialem University Hospital, child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic between July 2015 and May 2016. A semi-structured clinical examination was used to endorse clinical diagnosis. Results: Dropout rate in the total sample was 52.0% (29.0% for early; 23.0% for late drop out). Almost 70% of the subjects, who were treated with a combination of medication and psychotherapy continued with their treatment. Diagnosis of an externalizing disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were significantly higher in the late dropout group, while internalizing disorder was higher in those who engaged with treatment. Mother's higher education attainment showed positive relationship with service engagement. Previous psychiatric diagnosis in the child was an independent protective factor for discontinuation of treatment (OR=1.251,CI= 1.05-1.49, p=0.011). In terms of the treatment modalities, most of those who were treated with medication only dropped out late (74.6%), however pharmacological treatment on its own also appeared to be an independent predictor of dropout (OR=0.586, CI=0.47-0.72, p<0.001). Discussion: Dropout rates were higher than previous studies. Motivation to contact the service and treatment modality offered to the patient can predict their service engagement. Further local studies are needed to address factors related to dropout and the role of the current mental health system and lack of resources in poor service engagement needs to be clarified.

AB The present study evaluated the activities of heart rate variability (HRV) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in response to the presentation of affective pictures correlated with posttraumatic growth (PTG) among adults exposed to the Tianjin explosion incident. The participants who were directly involved in the Tianjin explosions were divided into control, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTG group according to the scores of PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and PTG Inventory survey. All participants received exposure to affective images. Electrocardiogram recording took place during the process for the purpose of analyzing HRV. Meanwhile, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure DLPFC activity through hemodynamic response. Our results indicated that, while performing the negative and positive picture stimulating, PTG increased both in low and high frequency components of HRV compared with the control group, but PTSD was not observed in this phenomenon. Moreover, the fNIRS data revealed that PTG had an increased activation in the left DLPFC compared to the control in the condition of negative pictures stimulating, wheras PTSD showed a higher activation in the right DLPFC while receiving positive pictures stimulating. To our knowledge, this is the first study which provides the differences between PTSD and PTG in emotional regulation.

AB Adversity in early childhood exerts an enduring impact on mental and physical health, academic achievement, lifetime productivity, and the probability of interfacing with the criminal justice system. More science is needed to understand how the brain is affected by early life stress (ELS), which produces excessive activation of stress response systems broadly throughout the child's body (toxic stress). Our research examines the importance of sex, timing and type of stress exposure, and critical periods for intervention in various brain systems across species. Neglect (the absence of sensitive and responsive caregiving) or disrupted interaction with offspring induces robust, lasting consequences in mice, monkeys, and humans. Complementary assessment of internalizing disorders and brain imaging in children suggests that early adversity can interfere with white matter development in key brain regions, which may increase risk for emotional difficulties in the long term. Neural circuits that are most plastic during ELS exposure in monkeys sustain the greatest change in gene expression, offering a mechanism whereby stress timing might lead to markedly different long-term behaviors. Rodent models reveal that disrupted maternal-infant interactions yield metabolic and behavioral outcomes often differing by sex. Moreover, ELS may further accelerate or delay critical periods of development, which reflect GABA circuit maturation, BDNF, and circadian Clock genes. Such factors are associated with several mental disorders and may contribute to a premature closure of plastic windows for intervention following ELS. Together, complementary cross-species studies are elucidating principles of adaptation to adversity in early childhood with molecular, cellular, and whole organism resolution.

AB Risk for substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with poor response inhibition and heightened reward sensitivity. During adolescence, incentives improve performance on response inhibition tasks and increase recruitment of cortical control areas (Geier et al., 2010) associated with SUD (Chung et al., 2011). However, it is unknown whether incentives moderate the relationship between response inhibition and trait-level psychopathology and personality features of substance use risk. We examined these associations in the current project using a rewarded antisaccade (AS) task (Geier et al., 2010) in youth at risk for substance use. Participants were 116 adolescents and young adults (ages 12-21) from the University of Pittsburgh site of the National Consortium on Adolescent Neurodevelopment and Alcohol [NCANDA] study, with neuroimaging data collected at baseline and 1 year follow up visits. Building upon previous work using this task in normative developmental samples (Geier et al., 2010) and adolescents with SUD (Chung et al., 2011), we examined both trial-wise BOLD responses and those associated with individual task-epochs (cue presentation, response preparation, and response) and associated them with multiple substance use risk factors (externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, family history of substance use, and trait impulsivity). Results showed that externalizing psychopathology and high levels of trait impulsivity (positive urgency, SUPPS-P) were associated with general decreases in antisaccade performance. Accompanying this main effect of poor performance, positive urgency was associated with reduced recruitment of the frontal eye fields (FEF) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in both a priori regions of interest and at the voxelwise level. Consistent with previous work, monetary incentive improved antisaccade behavioral performance and was associated with increased activation in the striatum and cortical control areas. However, incentives did not moderate the association between response inhibition behavioral performance and any trait-level psychopathology and personality factor of substance use risk. Reward interactions were observed for BOLD responses at the task-epoch level, however, they were inconsistent across substance use risk types. The results from this study may suggest poor response inhibition and heightened reward sensitivity are not overlapping neurocognitive features of substance use risk. Alternatively, more subtle, common longitudinal processes might jointly explain reward sensitivity and response inhibition deficits in substance use risk.

AB There are growing concerns about the impact of digital technologies on children's emotional well-being, particularly regarding fear, anxiety, and depression. The 2 mental health categories of anxiety and depression will be discussed together because there is significant symptom overlap and comorbidity. Early research has explored the impact of traditional media (eg, television, movies) on children's acute fears, which can result in anxieties and related sleep disturbances that are difficult to remedy. More recent research deals with the interactive nature of newer media, especially social media, and their impacts on anxiety and depression. Key topics of inquiry include the following: anxiety and depression associated with technology-based negative social comparison, anxiety resulting from lack of emotionregulation skills because of substituted digital media use, social anxiety from avoidance of social interaction because of substituted digital media use, anxiety because of worries about being inadequately connected, and anxiety, depression, and suicide as the result of cyberbullying and related behavior. A growing body of research confirms the relationship between digital media and depression. Although there is evidence that greater electronic media use is associated with depressive symptoms, there is also evidence that the social nature of digital communication may be harnessed in some situations to improve mood and to promote health-enhancing strategies. Much more research is needed to explore these possibilities.

AB Objective: To determine whether there is an association between parent and sibling obesity status and obesity status in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: We examined predictors of obesity in children with ASD with body mass index data for the proband, 1 sibling, and 2 parents using data from the multisite Simons Simplex Collection. Results: In a stepwise logistic regression model, proband obesity status was associated with obesity status of the sibling (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-3.70), mother (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.59-2.77), and father (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.15-1.98). Proband obesity was also related to somatic complaints (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.006-2.53), mood stabilizers (OR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.19-2.72), internalizing problems (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.14-2.30), age (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01), and some adaptive functioning domains (OR 0.987; 95% CI, 0.977-0.997). Race, ethnicity, income, sex, and maternal education were not significant predictors. Conclusion: Familial factors were generally the strongest predictors of obesity rather than medication use, demographics, or psychological characteristics. Results support a family-centered approach to treatment of obesity in children with ASD.

AB Objective: To investigate whether infant temperament and childhood internalizing, externalizing, and inattention symptoms increase the likelihood of daytime urinary incontinence or nocturnal enuresis at 10 years and adolescence (11.9-17.8 years). Method: Data were from a longitudinal cohort of 1119 healthy Chilean children. We assessed behavioral symptoms at infancy, 5 years, and 10 years and their relationship with subsequent daytime urinary incontinence and nocturnal enuresis. Results: Daytime urinary incontinence and nocturnal enuresis occurred in, respectively, 3.3% and 11.4% at 10 years and 1.1% and 2.7% at adolescence. Difficult infant temperament was associated with increased odds of 10-year daytime urinary incontinence. Inattention at 5 years was associated with increased odds for nocturnal enuresis at 10 years and adolescence. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 5 years were associated with increased odds of 10-year daytime urinary incontinence and nocturnal enuresis. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 10 years were associated with adolescent nocturnal enuresis. Conclusion: Temperament and internal/externalizing symptoms may be risk factors for school-age and adolescent urinary incontinence.

AB This narrative review is based on a literature search of PubMed and PsycINFO for research on preterm newborn pain published during the last ten years. The high prevalence of painful procedures being performed with preterm newborns without analgesia (79%), with a median of 75 painful procedures being received during hospitalization and as many as 51 painful procedures per day highlights the importance of this problem. This review covers the pain assessments that have been developed, the short-term effects of the painful procedures, the longer-term developmental outcomes and the pharmacological and alternative therapies that have been researched. The most immediate effects reported for repeated painful procedures include increased heart rate, oxidative stress and cortisol as well as decreased vagal activity. Lower body weight and head circumference have been noted at 32 weeks gestation. Blunted cortisol reactivity to stressors has been reported for three-month-olds and thinner gray matter in 21 of 66 cerebral regions and motor and cognitive developmental delays have been noted as early as eight months. Longer-term outcomes have been reported at school age including less cortical thickness, lower vagal activity, delayed visual perceptual development, lower IQs and internalizing behavior. Pharmacological interventions and their side effects and non-pharmacological therapies are also reviewed including sucrose, milk and nonnutritive sucking which have been effective but thought to negatively affect breast-feeding. Full-body interventions have included tucking, swaddling, kangaroo care and massage therapy. Although these have been effective for alleviating immediate pain during invasive procedures, research is lacking on the routine use of these therapies for reducing long-term pain effects. Further, additional randomized controlled replication studies are needed.

AB The extent to which maternal depressive symptoms in the first 6 months of life is linked with internalizing and externalizing behaviors in childhood through specific insensitive maternal behaviors (unresponsive and overtly negative behaviors) was examined in a sample of 259 mother-infant dyads. In addition, the extent to which these paths were moderated by infant negative emotionality was also examined. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed prenatally and when infants were 6 months and 2 years old. Maternal unresponsive and overtly negative behaviors and infant negative emotionality were observed when infants were 6 months old. Mothers reported on infant's internalizing and externalizing behaviors when infants were 2 years old. Maternal depressive symptoms were directly associated with higher internalizing behaviors; this path was not mediated by maternal behaviors. Depressive symptoms were unrelated to externalizing symptoms. Infant negative emotionality did not moderate these effects, but was related positively to overtly negative maternal behaviors, and temperament interacted with maternal depressive symptoms to predict unresponsive maternal behaviors. Results suggest that early maternal depressive symptoms, infant negative emotionality, and negative maternal behavior pose risk for infants' later internalizing behaviors, but the proposed moderated mediation model was not supported.

DE Juvenile sex offender; Treatment; Child molester; Peer abuser;
   Developmental risk factors
ID ADOLESCENTS; RECIDIVISM
AB Specialized treatment programs exist for juvenile sex offenders (JSOs) on the basis that JSOs are a homogeneous group. However, several studies have shown support for the heterogeneity of JSOs on the observed differences in victim age preferences within this group; those that offend against children (child molesters), and those that offend against peers or adults (peer abusers). To better meet the individual needs of treatment and rehabilitation, there must be an understanding of the developmental risk factors associated with each sub-type of JSOs. This paper reviewed 13 published studies on the differences in developmental risk factors between juvenile child molesters and peer abusers. The review found that child abusers were more likely to be submissive, have lower self-esteem and to show internalizing behaviour problems, whereas peer abusers were more aggressive, antisocial and were more likely to show externalizing behaviour problems. Although inconsistencies in results were observed across some studies, the results from this review suggest the need to separate JSO treatment approaches depending on victim age preference. Child molesters may benefit more from individual-based treatment programs (i.e. cognitive behavioural therapy) whereas peer abusers may benefit from a community-based approach to treatment such as multi-systematic therapy.

AB Youth exposed to violence, many of whom are from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, are at high risk for externalizing problems such as aggressive and oppositional behavior, conduct problems, and delinquency. Most interventions target youth with already high levels of such problems, while selective prevention efforts have received less attention. It is important for researchers, policy makers and practitioners to understand how such problems develop and change over time, and how selective prevention may impact externalizing problems. In this study, we examined one-year trajectories of externalizing problems in 883 low-income, ethnic minority youth exposed to violence who participated in randomized controlled trials testing a prevention program for high-risk youth called the Strengthening Families Program. We found three trajectories of externalizing problems: Low Externalizing (43% of the sample had consistently low levels of externalizing symptoms), Persisters (39% of the sample had consistently high levels of externalizing symptoms), and Improvers (18% of the sample had initially high levels of externalizing symptoms that decreased over time). There were demographic differences between the three trajectories with individuals in the Low Externalizing trajectory more likely to be female and younger than those in the other two trajectories and Persisters and Improvers had significantly more problems with baseline internalizing symptoms, family conflict, and parenting behavior compared to the Low Externalizing trajectory. Logistic regressions then tested several predictors of membership in the Persisters trajectory compared to the Improvers trajectory, controlling for all covariates simultaneously. Only baseline parenting behavior and intervention group membership significantly predicted trajectory membership, and these were small and unreliable effects. Thus, children with varying levels of violence exposure, co-occurring emotional/behavioral problems and family issues, and varying demographics (e.g., age and gender) may do equally well over time, but engagement in this type of intervention may increase the likelihood that high levels of externalizing problems are ameliorated over time.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an animal-assisted psychotherapy (AAP) programme on clinical symptoms, personal adjustment, and adaptive skills in a group of adolescents in residential care who had experienced childhood trauma and who presented mental health problems and difficulties adapting to the care home environment. The 87 participants (M-age=15.17, SD=1.53) were divided into two groups: a treatment group (25 girls and 27 boys; M-age=15.00, SD=1.55) and a control group (9 girls and 26 boys; M-age=15.42, SD=1.50). The programme consisted of 34 sessions involving both group (23 sessions) and individual (11 sessions) AAP. The Behaviour Assessment System for Children was used to evaluate clinical and adaptive dimensions of behaviour and personality. The results indicated that, in comparison with controls, the young people who took part in the AAP programme reported a significant improvement on two measures of internalizing symptoms, namely, depression and sense of inadequacy. Although no significant differences were observed in relation to externalizing symptoms, the adolescents who received the AAP programme showed improved social skills in terms of their ability to interact satisfactorily with peers and adults in the care home environment, as well as a more positive attitude towards teachers at school. These results suggest that AAP may be a promising treatment for young people who have experienced childhood trauma and who subsequently find it difficult to adapt to the residential care setting.

AB This longitudinal study investigated patterns of developmental problems across depression, aggression, and academic achievement during adolescence, using two measurement points two years apart (N = 1665; age T1: M = 13.14; female = 49.6%). Latent Profile Analyses and Latent Transition Analyses yielded four main findings: A three-type solution provided the best fit to the data: an asymptomatic type (i.e., low problem scores in all three domains), a depressed type (i.e., high scores in depression), an aggressive type (i.e., high scores in aggression). Profile types were invariant over the two data waves but differed between girls and boys, revealing gender specific patterns of comorbidity. Stabilities over time were high for the asymptomatic type and for types that represented problems in one domain, but moderate for comorbid types. Differences in demographic variables (i.e., age, socio-economic status) and individual characteristics (i.e., self-esteem, dysfunctional cognitions, cognitive capabilities) predicted profile type memberships and longitudinal transitions between types.

AB The present study examined how teachers' interpersonal behaviors (control, affiliation) and complementarity tendencies (i.e., return low control with high control and high affiliation with similar affiliation) were related to children's task behaviors (engagement, performance). Furthermore, we investigated whether the strength of these associations depended on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Our sample included 48 teachers and 179 kindergartners (94 boys; mean age = 66.75 months) who were selected to represent a variation of externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Independent observers rated teachers' interpersonal behaviors and children's task behaviors. Teacher control was negatively related to both children's task engagement and performance, whereas teacher affiliation was not associated with children's task behaviors. Furthermore, associations between teachers' complementarity tendencies on control and children's task performance depended on the level of control that children displayed themselves. To conclude, teachers should be made aware that controlling behaviors could be detrimental for children's task behaviors.

AB A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the efficacy of the Cool Little Kids program implemented for parents of temperamentally inhibited Hong Kong Chinese preschool-aged children. This early intervention program was designed to help inhibited children alleviate shy and anxious behaviors in social situations by training parents on adaptive parenting skills. Parents of 57 inhibited children (mean age=3.91, 35 boys) were randomly assigned to an intervention group and a waitlist control group. Children were assessed by teachers on Chinese shyness, social initiative, and internalizing problems before and after the intervention to evaluate the program effects. As hypothesized, relative to the control group, children from the intervention group reduced significantly with a large effect size detected (Cohen's f=.40) in anxious shyness but not regulated shyness. However, the same children did not significantly improve on social initiative with peers nor decrease in internalizing problems. These results were discussed with some plausible explanations. The randomized controlled trial supported wider dissemination of this preventive intervention for alleviating anxious shyness in early childhood. The positive parental receptivity also demonstrated the feasibility of a larger-scale implementation. A future community-wide program rollout for Chinese families in Hong Kong is warranted.
   Highlights
   This paper investigates if parenting intervention can help reduce anxious shyness among Hong Kong Chinese children. A randomized controlled trial evidenced the efficacy of the Cool Little Kids program in alleviating Chinese children's shyness. Wider dissemination of this early intervention program in the Hong Kong Chinese community is supported by this paper.

AB Background: The co-occurrence of alcohol use and externalizing/internalizing problems threatens adolescents' mental health. Research on whether alcohol use and these problems are causal and the direction of the potential causal relationships is needed to understand the mechanisms of the co-occurrence.
   Methods: A Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted in which the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) rs671 polymorphism was used as an instrumental variable for alcohol use phenotypes. In total, 1,608 Chinese adolescents (mean age 14.11 +/- 1.83 years) were genotyped for the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism. Three externalizing problems (aggression, delinquency, and attention problems) were measured with the Youth Self-Report inventory, and 2 internalizing problems (depression and anxiety) were measured with the self-reported Children's Depression Inventory and the Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.
   Results: Alcohol use was positively associated with all 3 externalizing and 2 internalizing problems, and the ALDH2 polymorphism had a significant effect on alcohol use. Aggression and attention problems were also significantly affected by the ALDH2 polymorphism, whereas no significant association was observed between the ALDH2 polymorphism and delinquency, anxiety, or depression.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that alcohol use is a cause of adolescent aggression and attention problems but not adolescent delinquency, anxiety, or depression.

AB Objective: Young children with congenital visual impairment (VI) are at increased risk of behavioral vulnerabilities. Studies on 'at risk' populations suggest that frontal EEG asymmetry may be associated with behavioral risk. We investigated frontal asymmetry at 1 year (Time 1), behavior at 2 years (Time 2) and their longitudinal associations within a sample of infants with VI. Frontal asymmetry in the VI sample at 1 year was also compared cross-sectionally to an age-matched typically sighted (TS) group.& para;& para;Methods: At Time 1,22 infants with VI and 10 TS infants underwent 128-channel EEG recording. Frontal asymmetry ratios were calculated from power spectral density values in the alpha frequency band. At Time 2, Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist data was obtained for the VI sample.& para;& para;Results: 63.6% of the VI sample and 50% of the TS sample showed left frontal asymmetry; no significant difference in frontal asymmetry was found between the two groups. 22.7% of the VI sample had subclinical to clinical range 'internalizing' behavior difficulties. Greater left frontal asymmetry at one year was significantly associated with greater emotionally reactive scores at two years within the VI sample (r = 0.50, p = 0.02).& para;& para;Conclusions: Left frontal asymmetry correlates with later behavior risk within this vulnerable population.& para;& para;Significance: These findings make an important first contribution regarding the utility of frontal EEG asymmetry as a method to investigate risk in infants with VI.

AB Play observations with a total of 400 toddlers and preschoolers were videotaped and rated for Intensity and Quality of play with their parents. Parents were asked about perceived stress and personality characteristics (Big 5). Child's motor, cognitive skills, temperament, and internalizing behaviors were assessed. Study 1 investigated the robustness of play across child age and gender, and examined differences between fathers and mothers. Study 2 explored the vulnerability of play with fathers of children born preterm (PT-fathers) and fathers who had experienced adverse childhoods (AC-fathers). Study 3 investigated child internalizing behaviors. Intensity of play was maintained almost independently of child age and gender. It was similar for AC- and PT-fathers, and similar to maternal Intensity. In contrast, paternal Quality of play was higher with boys and independent of fathers' personality and perceived parenting stress whereas maternal Quality of play was higher with girls and linked to mothers' perceived parenting competence, acceptability of the child, and neuroticism. AC-fathers scored significantly low on Quality, as did PT-fathers, but the Quality of their play became better with growing child age, birth weight, and cognitive (but not motor and temperament) scores. Finally, child internalizing behaviors were negatively related to paternal Quality of play.

ID DIMENSIONS
AB The diverse set of studies in this special issue on fathers' play includes empirical research from several countries, observational measures of play, and multiple children's outcomes, including language, negativity, social competence, aggression and internalizing problems. The chief conclusion across studies is that the role of paternal play is important in various domains of child development. This is encouraging, yet also disturbing given the results of the State of the World's Fathers: Time for Action report 2017, revealing the low amount of care fathers provide to their children worldwide, relative to mothers. In this commentary, the measurement and conceptualization of play are discussed, as well as cultural considerations regarding the meaning and consequences of play. The findings of the studies are integrated in order to guide future research, addressing what domains of child development appear to be influenced by what types of paternal play, and discussing the contexts that affect paternal play. Lastly, the collective results are related to recent efforts to increase fathers' involvement and implications for interventions are discussed.

AB There is substantial evidence that personality traits, such as self-criticism and dependency, predict the development of depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as depressive episodes. However, it is unknown whether self-criticism and dependency predict the first onset of depressive and anxiety disorders, and unclear how to characterize dynamic mechanisms by which these traits, stressful life events, and psychopathology influence one another over time. In this study, 550 female adolescents were assessed at baseline, 528 and 513 of whom were assessed again at Waves 2 and 3, respectively, over the course of 18 months. Self-criticism and dependency were assessed with self-report inventories, depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed with diagnostic interviews, and stressful life events were assessed via semistructured interview. Logistic regression analyses showed that self-criticism and dependency significantly predicted the first onset of nearly all depressive and anxiety disorders (significant polychoric rs ranged from .15-.42). Subsequent path analyses focused on prediction of depression, and supported several conceptual models of personality-stress-psychopathology relationships. In particular, Personality x Stress interactions were evident for both dependency and self-criticism. These interactions took the form of dual vulnerability, such that stressful life events predicted an increased probability of a later depressive disorder only at low levels of each trait. Results suggest the traits of self-criticism and dependency are important to consider in understanding who is at risk for depressive and anxiety disorders.

AB Introduction: There are few studies on the potential benefits of green space quantity and quality for child well-being. The authors hypothesized that more and better quality residential green space would be favorable for well-being and that these associations could be subject to effect modification across childhood.
   Method: Multilevel linear regression adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic confounders was used to track change in well-being (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Total Difficulties Score and "internalizing" and "externalizing" subscales) across five separate occasions among a cohort of 4,968 Australian children aged 4-5 years beginning in 2004. Well-being was assessed with respect to objectively measured green space quantity and parent-reported green space quality, with interaction terms fitted with age to assess for potential effect modification. Data were analyzed in 2015.
   Results: Non-linear dose-response associations were observed for favorable well-being in relation to larger quantities of green space and also green space judged to be higher in quality. Favorable perceptions of green space quality were associated with larger quantities of green space regardless of neighborhood socioeconomic circumstances. Benefits for well-being appeared to top out at 21%-40% green space coverage and were reasonably consistent across childhood. Inequality in well-being (especially the internalizing subscale) emerged as children aged in relation to green space quality.
   Conclusions: Approximately 21%-40% of residential land-use allocated to green space may be an optimal amount for promoting child well-being, but the quality of this green space increases in importance as children age. Am J Prev Med 2017; 53(5): 616-624. Preventive Medicine

AB The present investigation examined the role of anxiety symptom severity in the relation between emotional nonacceptance and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a diverse sample of trauma-exposed adolescents admitted for acute psychiatric care at an inpatient state hospital (N = 50; 52.0% women; 44% white; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [0.51] years; range, 12-17 years). Anxiety symptom severity partially accounted for the association between emotional nonacceptance and PTSD total symptoms, and fully accounted for the association between emotional nonacceptance and PTSD symptom cluster severity, even after controlling for covariates. Reverse model testing provided confidence in the direction of hypothesized effects. These findings add to a body of literature underscoring the detrimental effect of nonaccepting reactions to negative emotions in the context of PTSD and provide preliminary support for a possible underlying role of anxiety symptom severity in the association between emotional nonacceptance and PTSD symptoms.

AB This study examined the construction of the maternal identity among Jewish Israeli women whose children are raised by their father in a sociocultural context that valorizes the maternal role in the lives of women. Interpretive interactionist analysis of in-depth interviews with 13 nonresidential mothers identified the discursive strategies that they used to negotiate a troubled maternal identity due to their nonnormative position. The mothers deflected guilt and responsibility for the fact that they do not live with their children. Further, they exhibited two dynamics of maternal identity construction: internalizing the critical discourse and constructing a nonresidential identity as a good enough mother. The findings support the view that hegemonic social discourses affect the construction of maternal identity by nonresidential mothers. At the same time, they are also indicative of the creation of an alternative discourse that portrays a nonresidential maternal identity as positive.

AB The current study examined the role negative self-statements have on the comorbidity between anxious symptomatology and ADHD-combined presentation (ADHD-C) and ADHD-predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I). A total of 114 children and adolescents with ADHD (M age = 10.15; SD = 2.30; range = 7-16) from a clinic-referred sample were grouped based on a semistructured diagnostic interview and consensus approach (ADHD-C, n = 62; ADHD-I, n = 52). Negative self statements were measured using the Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale and the total score from the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children was used to measure anxious symptomatology. Findings indicated youth 'diagnosed with ADHD-C, compared to those diagnosed with ADHD-I, had more frequent personal failure (Cohen's d =.40) and hostile intent negative self-statements (Cohen's d =.47). The association of ADHD subtype and negative self-statements was moderated by anxiety; negative self-statements of personal failure were highest in anxious ADHD-C children ([beta=.31). A second sample of 137 children and adolescents (M age = 10.61; SD = 2.26; range = 7-16) from a larger clinic-referred sample was utilized to replicate our results dimensionally. Results indicated that both hyperactivity/impulsivity (beta= .23, p <.01) and the interaction of hyperactivity/impulsivity and anxiety (beta= .17, p < .05) were significant predictors of negative self statements regarding personal failure, while holding child age, child gender, oppositional symptoms, and inattention constant. In all, negative self-statements should be considered in the treatment and assessment of ADHD with particular attention paid to ADHD subtype and internalizing comorbidity.

AB When psychopathology is considered as a developmental phenomenon, the data on child psychotherapy must be of interest to all therapists. The aim of this study was to assess the results of psychodynamic psychotherapy in a child with internalizing symptoms using data obtained from the patient, her mother, her teacher and her psychotherapist. A systematic single case study was performed. The data were obtained using the following tools: interviews, the Rorschach Method, the Child Behaviour Check List for Children and Adolescents, the Teachers Report Form and questionnaires completed by the patient's mother and therapist. The psychotherapeutic treatment lasted for 40 sessions and the patient was 8 years old at the start of therapy. She presented with head and stomach aches after the sudden death of her father, as well as difficulty adapting to her new school. The Rorschach results indicated improvement in cognitive triad variables, interpersonal relations and expressing affection. Data from the patient, mother and therapist converged to yield the clinical picture of a more spontaneous girl, dealing better with her feelings and more socially integrated. This points to the importance of using mixed methods to assess psychotherapies and of consulting multiple informants.

AB Background: Originating in the 1960s, the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) comprises a family of instruments for assessing problems and strengths for ages 11/2-90+ years.
   Purpose: To provide an overview of the ASEBA, related research, and future directions for empirically based assessment and taxonomy.
   Content: Standardized, multi-informant ratings of transdiagnostic dimensions of behavioral, emotional, social, and thought problems are hierarchically scored on narrow-spectrum syndrome scales, broad-spectrum internalizing and externalizing scales, and a total problems (general psychopathology) scale. DSM-oriented and strengths scales are also scored. The instruments and scales have been iteratively developed from assessments of clinical and population samples of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Items, instruments, scales, and norms are tailored to different kinds of informants for ages 11/2-5, 6-18, 18-59, and 60-90+ years. To take account of differences between informants' ratings, parallel instruments are completed by parents, teachers, youths, adult probands, and adult collaterals. Syndromes and Internalizing/Externalizing scales derived from factor analyses of each instrument capture variations in patterns of problems that reflect different informants' perspectives. Confirmatory factor analyses have supported the syndrome structures in dozens of societies. Software displays scale scores in relation to user-selected multicultural norms for the age and gender of the person being assessed, according to ratings by each type of informant. Multicultural norms are derived from population samples in 57 societies on every inhabited continent. Ongoing and future research includes multicultural assessment of elders; advancing transdiagnostic progress and outcomes assessment; and testing higher order structures of psychopathology.

AB The developmental significance of youths' racial identities during adolescence is well established. It is less clear how puberty, a normative process, influences the relationship between racial identity and adjustment outcomes during adolescence. This study examined whether puberty moderates the relationship between racial identity dimensions and internalizing and externalizing outcomes, and whether the effects of puberty and racial identity on internalizing and externalizing outcomes vary by child sex. Data are drawn from African American families (N = 176; 48% female) who participated in Waves 4 and 5 of Phase III of the NICHD SECCYD. Results indicated that fifth-grade boys who felt more positively about being African American and were less advanced in their pubertal development evidenced less internalizing problems 1 year later, after adjusting for previous internalizing levels; however, for boys further in their pubertal development, having higher private regard was associated with more, rather than less, internalizing problems. Additionally, fifth-grade boys and girls who were less advanced in their pubertal development and believed that society views African Americans in a more positive light (higher public regard levels) engaged in more externalizing behaviors 1 year later, after adjusting for previous externalizing levels. Findings offer new insights into the independent and synergistic linkages between racial identity and pubertal development in their relation to internalizing and externalizing outcomes among African American youth.

AB Early onset and long-term smoking are associated with physical and psychological health problems. The aim of the presented analysis was to investigate risk and influencing factors for different smoking status in a big sample of European adolescents. In the context of the "saving and empowering young lives in Europe" (SEYLE) study we surveyed 12,328 adolescents at the age of 13-17 from 11 countries. The survey took place in a school-based context using a questionnaire. Overall 58% reported the onset of ever-smoking under the age of 14 and 30.9% smoke on a daily basis. Multinomial logistic regression model showed significant positive associations between adolescent smoking and internalizing problems (suicidal behavior, direct self-injurious behavior, anxiety), externalizing problems (conduct problems, hyperactivity, substance consumption) and family problems (parental substance consumption, broken home). Our data show that smoking among adolescents is still a major public health problem and adolescents who smoke are at higher risk for mental problems. Further, adolescent smoking is associated with broken home families and parental behaviors. Therefore, early preventive measures are necessary not only for adolescents, but also for their parents.

AB The current longitudinal study examined the association of temperamental inhibition (assessed by behavioral observation and parental reports) at three years old with reward and punishment bias (measured by a spatial cueing task) and mothers' and teachers' reports of internalizing behaviors and social competence at five years old in 153 Chinese children. As predicted, behavioral inhibition positively predicted later mother-rated internalizing behaviors. In addition, punishment bias moderated this relation such that children with higher punishment bias showed a positive inhibition-internalizing link. Furthermore, inhibition negatively predicted both mother-rated and teacher-rated social competence. However, novel findings were that reward bias moderated the relation between inhibition and teacher-rated social competence, such that inhibited children showed an increased risk of low competence when they had lower reward bias.

AB BackgroundEvidence suggests that language and social, emotional and behavioural (SEB) difficulties are associated in children and adolescents. When these associations emerge and whether they differ by language or SEB difficulty profile is unclear. This knowledge is crucial to guide prevention and intervention programmes for children with language and SEB difficulties.
   AimsTo determine whether receptive and expressive language skills are associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviours in slow-to-talk toddlers.
   Methods & ProceduresIn a community-based prospective study of 200 slow-to-talk children, language was measured at 24 and 36 months using Preschool Language Scale 4th Edition and at 48 months using Clinical Evaluation of Language FundamentalsPreschool 2nd Edition. Internalizing and externalizing behaviours were measured by parent report at each age. Longitudinal data were analysed using repeated-measures regression, with up to three observations per child. Robust standard errors were used to account for non-independence of measures within participants. The shape of the associations were examined by fitting quadratic and cubic terms. The effects of confounders on the associations were examined.
   Outcomes & ResultsReceptive language had a negative linear association with internalizing behaviours after adjusting for confounders ( = -0.16, 95% [CI = -0.26, -0.07], p = .001); and a negative curved association with externalizing behaviours after adjusting for biological confounders ((quadratic) = 0.08 [0.01, 0.15], p = .03, (cubic) = -0.04 [-0.07, -0.02], p = .001), attenuating after adjusting for environmental confounders ((quadratic) = 0.06 [-0.01, 0.13], p = .09, (cubic) = -0.03 [-0.06, -0.003], p = .03). The curvature suggests that the negative association with externalizing behaviours only existed for children with either very low or very high receptive language scores. After controlling for confounders, there was no evidence that expressive language scores were associated with internalizing ( = -0.08, 95% [CI = -0.17, 0.01], p = .10) or externalizing behaviours ( = 0.03, 95% [CI = -0.09, 0.18], p = .61). Tests of interaction revealed no evidence of a differential association by age.
   Conclusions & ImplicationsIn 24-48-month-old slow-to-talk children, lower receptive language scores were associated with higher internalizing behaviours. The magnitude of the association was small. For children with very poor receptive language scores, lower receptive language skills were associated with higher externalizing behaviours. Young children with low receptive language abilities may be at risk of internalizing difficulties; those with very low receptive language skills may be at particular risk of externalizing difficulties. This has clinical implications for interventions for young children with receptive language difficulties.

AB Objective: Sample entropy (SampEn) gives an estimate of signal complexity in cardiac time series and can give information beyond linear heart rate variability. Lower cardiac SampEn is associated with psychopathology in adults. Emotional dysregulation is widely present in adult psychopathology and a forerunner to later mental problems in children. Therefore, this study investigated whether SampEn relates to emotional dysregulation in children.
   Methods: Participants were 32 children between 9 and 13 years with internalizing difficulties and 25 controls. Parents filled out the "Emotional Problems" subscale in the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire and the "Lability/Negativity" scale in the Emotion Regulation Checklist. SampEn, root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), normalized power of high frequency (HFnu) components of the cardiac signal and pre ejection period (PEP) were computed at rest. The study investigated the predictive power of SampEn, RMSSD and HFnu on the measures of emotional dysregulation. It also tested whether RMSSD or PEP were related to SampEn.
   Results: SampEn was a significant predictor of both measures of emotional dysregulation, while RMSSD and HFnu were not. RMSSD and PEP were both significant predictors of SampEn.
   Conclusions: SampEn is a potential marker of dysregulation in the underlying neurovisceral processes vital for emotion regulation, and an important complementary measure to linear cardiac indices, explaining more of the variance in emotional dysregulation than RMSSD and HFnu in this study. Lower SampEn can also be linked to both higher vagal and sympathetic activation via RMSSD and PEP.

AB In contrast to historical conceptualizations that framed psychological disorders as distinct, categorical conditions, it is now widely understood that co- and multi-morbidities between disorders are extensive. As a result, there has been a call to better understand the dimensional liabilities that are common to and influence the development of multiple psychopathologies, as supported and exemplified by the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. We use a latent variable SEM approach to examine the degree to which working memory deficits represent a cognitive liability associated with the development of common and discrete dimensions of psychopathology. In a sample of 415 community recruited children aged 8-12 (n = 170 girls), we fit a bi-factor model to parent reports of behavior from the DISC-4 and BASC-2, and included a latent working memory factor as a predictor of the internalizing, externalizing, and general "p-factor." We found that both the general "p-factor" and externalizing (but not internalizing) latent factor were significantly associated with working memory. When a bi-factor model of externalizing symptomology was fit to further explore this relationship, working memory was only correlated with the general externalizing dimension; correlation with specific inattention, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional factors did not survive once the general externalizing dimension was taken into consideration. These findings held regardless of the sex of the child. Our results suggest that working memory deficits represent both a common cognitive liability for mental health disorders, and a specific liability for externalizing disorders.

AB Although children with a greater number of autistic traits are likely to have other mental health problems, research on the association between earlier autistic traits in preschool children and later emotional/behavioral outcomes is scarce. Using data from 189 Japanese community-based children, this study examined whether autistic traits at age 5 were related to emotional/behavioral outcomes at age 7. The results showed that prior autistic traits were subsequently associated with all emotional/behavioral domains. After controlling for baseline emotional/behavioral scores autistic traits continued to predict later emotional symptoms and peer problems. This study highlights that in addition to clinical ASD, it is also important to focus on subthreshold autistic traits in preschool children for better subsequent emotional/behavioral outcomes.

AB The aim of this study was to compare mothers' and fathers' ratings of their young children's problems and prosocial behaviors using the Korean version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Furthermore, the present study examined whether parental depressive symptoms were linked to agreement between mothers' and fathers' ratings of their young children's behavior. The sample consisted of 302 parents whose 5-year-old children attended childcare centers in Korea. The parents completed the Korean version of the SDQ and the Center for the Epidemiological Studies of Depression short form. The results revealed that both the mothers' and fathers' reports moderately correlated for both boys and girls, with greater correlations for externalizing problems than for internalizing problems. Whereas there were no significant differences between mothers' and fathers' reports of their children's problems, mothers reported significantly more prosocial behaviors than fathers did, regardless of the child's gender. Polynomial regression showed that mothers' reports were more strongly associated with fathers' report of their children's prosocial behavior when mothers reported lower levels of depressive symptoms. The findings provide empirical evidence that mothers and fathers reported more similarities than differences in assessing child problems. Further analyses suggest considering maternal depressive symptoms when interpreting interparental agreement on their children's prosocial behaviors.

AB Studies have shown that child development is negatively affected by prenatal depression. A dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the pregnant woman, passed to the fetus, is one discussed key mechanism. Studies, investigating primary-school age children, have found effects on antisocial behavior. Effects on internalizing symptoms were not found, but the analysis did not distinguish between anxiety and depression symptoms. Additionally, until now, no objective test data operationalizing social-emotional competencies have been included. The present study examined: 1.Whether the effects on child externalizing symptoms could be replicated; 2. If there are specific effects on child internalizing symptoms, separated for anxiety and depression; and 3. Are child clinical symptoms reflected in reductions in social-emotional competencies. A sample of 61 prenatally depressed and 143 prenatally not-depressed women and their 6-9 year old children were compared, controlling for key confounders in both the perinatal period and in middle childhood. Children of prenatally depressed mothers had more antisocial behavior and depression symptoms reported by their mothers. The prediction of antisocial behavior scores tended to be more significant for boys than for girls. Child anxiety symptoms were primarily explained by current maternal depressive symptoms. Children of prenatally depressed mothers also showed a reduction in social-emotional competencies, specifically regarding the ability to interpret complex social situations. This study showed that, even in a non-clinical sample, there are distinct effects of prenatal depression on child externalizing and internalizing symptoms which are accompanied by reductions in specific social-emotional competencies. These results emphasize that treatment for depressed pregnant women and/or early support for affected families is worthwhile. Additional work is required to identify the underlying biological mechanisms.

AB Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a developmental disorder characterized by serious and persistent social impairment, especially stressful interactions with parents. Although previous studies demonstrated associations between parent mental health and children's ODD symptoms, less attention has been paid to integrating both parent and child risk factors. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the associations among parent emotion regulation, child emotion regulation, parental depression, and child depression in Chinese children with ODD. A total of 234 children with ODD ranging in age from 6 to 13 years, along with their fathers or mothers, completed questionnaires. Results indicated that: (1) Parent emotion regulation, parental depression and child emotion regulation were significantly correlated with children's depressive symptoms. (2) Parent emotion regulation was related to children's depression indirectly through parental depression and child emotion regulation. (3) Child emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between parent emotion regulation and child depression, and also fully mediated the relationship between parental and child depression. These findings highlight the need to improve parent emotion regulation and pay attention to parental mental health, because both risk factors may exacerbate their children's emotion regulation difficulties and further associate the high level of depressive symptoms among children with ODD.

AB Although the effects of parenting styles have received much consideration in the research literature, less attention has been given to outcomes in emerging adults. Also, regional differences among areas of the United States may influence parents to use varying degrees of parenting practices such as affection and discipline. The current study investigated the differences in parenting in two geographically close yet distinct regions of the United States and the associated psychological outcomes in emerging adults. The sample was derived from two datasets: one consisting of participants predominantly from Southern states and one predominantly from Florida. The participants reported on maternal and paternal perceived parenting styles and discipline tactics as well as their own internalizing problems. Most notably, authoritative style of both parents shared a direct relationship with authoritarian style in the Southern sample, whereas this was an inverse relationship in the Florida sample. Maternal authoritarian parenting shared a negative relationship with internalizing symptoms in the Mississippi sample, whereas this relationship was positive in the Florida sample. Additionally, paternal permissive parenting shared a negative relationship with internalizing symptoms in the Florida sample, whereas no relationship was found in the Mississippi sample. For both samples, paternal, not maternal, corporal punishment and maternal, not paternal, psychological aggression were related positively to emerging adult internalizing problems. Overall, it was found that both parenting characteristics as well as associated outcomes differed by region, suggesting the need for increased awareness and sensitivity to these differences.

AB Migrant youth face cultural challenges upon initial adjustment into the United States. Although there is considerable empirical evidence that trauma impacts interpersonal relations, there is a dearth of research examining the association between adverse events and the initial social and cultural exchange experience, and whether this is associated with psychological adjustment. This study examined self-report data for 87 newly arrived migrant-origin students in Grades 5-10 from Latin American, Caribbean, Asian, and African backgrounds attending a public alternative school in the Southeastern United States. Data were collected as part of a community-based partnership. The relation between cumulative trauma exposure and internalizing symptoms was fully mediated by acculturative stress (p < .05), suggesting prior trauma exposure negatively affected these students' capacity to navigate a new cultural milieu, which in turn is directly associated with internalizing symptoms. Behavioral health care practitioners can use screening procedures early in the academic year to detect which migrant students may be experiencing difficult cultural transitions.

AB Families in the United States are increasingly diverse, which has given rise to questions about the consequences these new family forms have for children's outcomes. This study uses a life course perspective to examine the association between family transitions, nontraditional family structures (with particular attention to same-sex parent families), and children's psychosocial well-being. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort was used to examine children's externalizing well-being, internalizing well-being, and interpersonal skills. Results indicate that nontraditional family structures are associated with poorer psychosocial well-being, but this is largely accounted for by changes and transitions experienced in the creation of new families. The findings provide a critical look at the assumptions embedded in arguments focused solely on family structure, and joins other research in calling attention to the importance of family processes for understanding the well-being of children.

AB The objective was to examine pathways from child sexual abuse (CSA) and maternal mentalizing to child internalizing and externalizing difficulties and to test a model of MRF as a moderator of the relationships between CSA and child difficulties. The sample was comprised of 154 mothers and children aged 2-12 where 64 children had experienced CSA. To assess parental mentalizing the Parental Development Interview was rated with the Parental Reflective Functioning Scale. Child internalizing and externalizing difficulties were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results indicate that there were significant inverse relationships between maternal mentalizing and child internalizing and externalizing difficulties. When maternal mentalizing was considered together with CSA, only maternal mentalizing was a significant predictor of child difficulties. Furthermore, maternal mentalizing moderated the relationship between CSA and child internalizing difficulties. These findings provide evidence of the importance of the parents' mentalizing stance for psychiatric symptoms of children aged 2-12, as well as children's recovery from CSA. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This study examines academic self-efficacy and gender as predictors of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescence. In addition, the role of gender was considered as a moderator in the relationship between academic self-efficacy and internalizing/externalizing difficulties. Participants were 4,318 predominantly African American, low-income high school students who completed self-report measures on the constructs of interest. Academic self-efficacy and gender were both significant predictors of risk for internalizing problems, whereas only academic self-efficacy predicted risk for externalizing (hyperactivity/distractibility) problems. Gender did not predict externalizing difficulties, nor did gender serve as a moderator in any analysis. Implications include focusing on academic self-efficacy in the development of strategies for prevention and intervention of internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Previous work has established that caregiver and child temperamental characteristics are associated with child compliance. Given the critical role that parents play in this process, and that children of teen mothers are at risk for poorer developmental outcomes, it is important to understand the development of compliance in the context of at-risk parenting such as adolescent motherhood. The current study examined child compliance (Wave 5; W5) as a mediator of the association between adolescent mothers' social competence (Wave 4; W4) and children's behavioral and academic outcomes (Wave 6; W6), and whether this mediation varied depending on children's effortful control (W4) in a sample of 204 Mexican-origin adolescent mothers (M-age at W4=19.94, SD=.99) and their children (M-age at W4=36.21 months, SD=.45). Adolescent mothers reported on their own social competence and their children's effortful control and externalizing problems; compliance was assessed using observational methods; and academic readiness was assessed using standardized developmental assessments. Findings based on structural equation modeling revealed that adolescent mothers' social competence was positively related to children's compliance among children with high effortful control, but not among those with low effortful control. Moreover, child compliance mediated the longitudinal association between adolescent mothers' social competence and child externalizing problems and academic readiness. Discussion focuses on the importance of considering the role of child temperament in understanding how adolescent mothers' social competence is subsequently associated with children's social and academic adjustment.

AB The effect of parental conflict on children's psychological adjustment is variable. Coping self-efficacy refers to a person's perceived ability to self-motivate and access the required cognitive resources to take control of, or exert their coping efforts in a stressful situation. This study investigated the mediating role of children's coping self-efficacy beliefs between parental conflict and children's psychological adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, anxiety, and prosocial behavior). The participants were 663 school students in grade 5 (M=10.17 years, SD=.53) and grade 7 (M=12.11 years, SD=.52). The ethnic composition of the sample was approximately 72% White, 20% Asian, 4% Middle Eastern, and 4% from other ethnic groups. Coping self-efficacy for avoiding maladaptive cognitions mediated the effect of parental conflict on children's internalizing symptoms longitudinally. The higher the level of parental conflict, the lower the level of children's coping self-efficacy for avoiding maladaptive cognitions and in turn the higher their levels of internalizing. These findings support the mediational role of children's coping self-efficacy beliefs in the context of parental conflict. It is proposed that these beliefs should be considered in designing and implementing preventative interventions for children in the context of parental conflict.

AB In this study we investigated longitudinal associations among parenting, children's temperamental negative affectivity, and internalizing and externalizing behavior. Second, we tested whether findings confirmed the diathesis-stress model or differential susceptibility theory when conducting stringent interaction tests. The sample included 129 children and their families. Parenting quality (age 5) was measured by parent-child interaction observations. Parents evaluated child negative affectivity (age 7) and teachers reported on problem behavior (age 12). Multiple regression analyses revealed an interaction effect of negative affectivity and parenting on externalizing behavior. Visual inspection suggested for better and for worse' effects of parenting for children with negative affectivity. However, more stringent tests failed to show convincing evidence for differential susceptibility theory. For internalizing behavior, negative affectivity may render children vulnerable regardless of parenting. Our results point at the importance of further testing interaction effects to distinguish between differential susceptibility theory and the diathesis-stress model.

AB Elevated maternal cortisol concentrations have the potential to alter fetal development in a sex-specific manner. Female brains are known to show adaptive behavioral and anatomical flexibility in response to early-life exposure to cortisol, but it is not known how these sex-specific effects manifest at the whole-brain structural networks. A prospective longitudinal study of 49mother child dyads was conducted with serial assessments of maternal cortisol levels from 15 to 37 gestational weeks. We modeled the structural network of typically developing children ( aged 6-9 years) and examined its global connectome properties, rich-club organization, and modular architecture. Network segregation was susceptible only for girls to variations in exposure to maternal cortisol during pregnancy. Girls generated more connections than boys to maintain topologically capable and efficient neural circuits, and this increase in neural cost was associated with higher levels of internalizing problems. Maternal cortisol concentrations at 31 gestational weeks gestation were most strongly associated with altered neural connectivity in girls, suggesting a sensitive period for the maternal cortisol-offspring brain associations. Our data suggest that girls exhibit an adaptive response by increasing the neural network connectivity necessary for maintaining homeostasis and efficient brain function across the lifespan.

AB Youths' attachment representations with their parents were tested as moderators of the relation between peer-reported anxious solitude and self-compassion and self-criticism trajectories from fifth to seventh grades. Participants were 213 youth, 57% girls, M=10.65years of age. Growth curves revealed that attachment representations with both parents moderated the relation between AS and self-processes such that AS youth with (a) dual secure attachments demonstrated the most adaptive self-processes, (b) one secure attachment demonstrated intermediately adaptive self-processes, and (c) dual insecure attachments demonstrated the least adaptive self-processes over time. AS youth with dual insecure attachments are of most concern because they demonstrated elevated and increasing self-criticism over time, given evidence for relations between self-criticism and internalizing psychopathology.

AB While many studies have identified a significant relation between child maltreatment and adolescent substance use, the developmental pathways linking this relation remain sparsely explored. The current study examines posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms, mother-child relationships, and internalizing and externalizing problems as potential longitudinal pathways through which child maltreatment influences adolescent substance use. Structural equation modeling was conducted on 883 adolescents drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). The pathways of PTS symptoms linked physical and sexual abuse to substance use, and the pathways of mother-child relationships linked emotional abuse and neglect to substance use. None of the four types of maltreatment affected substance use via internalizing or externalizing problems. The findings suggest that intervention efforts aimed at addressing posttraumatic stress symptoms and improving mother-child relationship quality may be beneficial in reducing substance use among adolescents with child maltreatment histories.

AB Using parallel-process latent growth curve modeling, we examine developmental trajectories of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and identify early risk factors for behavior problems among 329 child welfare involved children followed from age 2 years to 5 years. Data are drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II. On average, internalizing behavior problems remained stable, while externalizing behavior problems decreased over time. Higher initial levels of internalizing behavior problems were associated with higher initial levels of externalizing behavior problems. Rates of change also had positive cross-domain relationships. Child neglect, exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), insecure caregiver-child attachment, and caregiver mental health problems were associated with higher initial levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Exposure to IPV, out-of-home care, and caregiver drug use predicted rates of change in behavior problems. Our findings highlight the importance of comprehensive assessment and treatment for co-occurring internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in young children involved in the child welfare system. Results also indicate the need for identifying and addressing early risk factors to prevent early onset and continued development of behavior problems in high-risk children.

Participants were 552, 53.4% boys and 46.6% girls, aged between 10-12 years. Patients receiving treatment inmental health services and a community group were compared. At least one SLE in the past two years is experienced by 88.2% of children. SLE were significantly higher in the clinical group than in the community group. SLE are related to the increased presence of symptoms and lower levels of adaptation. The association between family SLE and hyperactivity symptoms is stronger in the clinical group than in the community group. Having experienced SLE and being a patient predict both symptomatology and adaptation. (C) 2017 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB Reduced gray matter volume (GMV) is widely implicated in psychopathology, but scholars have found mostly overlapping areas of GMV reduction across disorders rather than unique neural signatures, potentially due to pervasive comorbidity. GMV reductions may be associated with broader psychopathology dimensions rather than specific disorders. We used an empirically supported bifactor model consisting of common psychopathology and internalizing- and externalizing-specific factors to evaluate whether latent psychopathology dimensions yield a clearer, more parsimonious pattern of GMV reduction in prefrontal and limbic/paralimbic areas implicated in individual disorders. A community sample of children (N = 254, ages 6-10) was used to evaluate whether GMV reductions could constitute early neural risk factors. The common psychopathology factor was associated with reduced GMV in prefrontal areas (dorsal, orbitofrontal, ventrolateral). The internalizing-specific factor was related to reduced GMV in limbic/paralimbic areas (hippocampus, amygdala, insula). No significant associations were found between GMV and the externalizing-specific factor after accounting for common psychopathology.

AB The person-centred typological approach to personality makes the distinction between overcontrolled and undercontrolled personality types. This review systematically searched for research on the utility of these personality types in adult mental health. A total of 43 papers were included, which were divided broadly into cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies and studies with clinical populations. Three personality types have been largely replicated in both normal and clinical populations: resilients, overcontrollers and undercontrollers. These types show utility in predicting long-term functioning and mental health, understanding heterogeneous personalities within clinical subgroups and have implications for treatment. Some disagreement on the number of personality types deemed replicable across samples and differing methodologies do exist, with some finding a dimensional approach to personality to have greater predictive utility. These personality types have been shown to be important in a number of mental health problems such as eating disorders, which may prove helpful in developing new psychological interventions. These studies point to the importance of overcontrolled personality types as well as undercontrolled in mental health. More research is needed with a greater range of clinical populations.

AB Adopted persons face special challenges in the development of identity, as aspects of their histories may be unknown, making it difficult to construct a coherent narrative linking past, present, and future. Extensive literature on adjustment outcomes for adopted persons indicates an elevated risk for adjustment problems. In this study, a low-risk sample of adopted youth is involved to examine, longitudinally, connections between adoptive identity and adjustment. Participants included 145 adopted youth who participated in Waves 2 (W2: adolescence: mean age = 15.7) and 3 (W3: emerging adulthood: mean age = 25.0) of a longitudinal study with a nationwide sample. Children were placed with same-race adoptive families (over 95% White) as infants through domestic private adoption agencies in the U.S. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed by the Youth Self Report (W2) and the Adult Self Report (W3). Adoptive identity was assessed by ratings of 6 dimensions coded from interviews which, using cluster analysis, revealed 4 adoptive identity subgroups: unexamined, limited, unsettled, and integrated. Factorial ANCOVA examined mean differences in W3 internalizing problems across identity clusters while controlling for W2 internalizing. The main effect for adoptive identity cluster was significant: F(3, 840.72) = 3.724, p = .011. Adopted adolescents in the unsettled group had significantly higher levels of internalizing problems in emerging adulthood than persons in the unexamined and limited categories. A similar ANCOVA for W3 externalizing behavior was not significant. Identity profiles high in negative affect may be at particular risk of increased levels of internalizing problems.

AB Objective: We examined the associations between sports participation and 3 aspects of psychosocial health in children, ie, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and prosocial behavior. Methods: Cross-sectional data from 2062 Dutch fourth and fifth graders were obtained using a sports participation questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: Fewer internalizing problems, fewer externalizing problems, and better prosocial behavior were found for sports club members. We also found fewer internalizing problems as frequency of sports participation increased. All associations were more prominent for boys. Conclusions: Given the positive associations between psychosocial health and sports participation, school administrators and policymakers should develop programs that encourage children to participate in organized sports activities.

AB The present study aimed to test whether monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene polymorphism was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on externalizing and internalizing problems and social competence among Chinese children. Participants were 290 children and their parents in China. MAOA genotypes were ascertained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Mothers reported their parenting stress and engagement in parent-child activities when the child was 6months old. Children's behavioral problems and social competence were rated by mothers and fathers at 48months old. The results showed that MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal parenting stress in predicting boys' internalizing problems. Also, MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal engagement in parent-child activities in predicting boys' social competence. The analyses of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk for (a) high internalizing problems under high maternal parenting stress and (b) low social competence if mothers displayed a low level of maternal engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results suggested that the MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model among Chinese boys.
   Highlights
   We evaluated whether MAOA gene was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on behavioral problems and social competence among 4-year-old Chinese children. The results of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk of high internalizing problems or low social competence with high maternal parenting stress or low engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results indicated that MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model rather than the differential susceptibility model.

DE Prenatal anxiety effects

   DISORDERS; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES; WOMEN; RISK
AB This review is based on literature on prenatal anxiety effects that was found on Pubmed and PsycINFO for the years 2010-2016. Prenatal anxiety is thought to have distinct features, although it has been measured both by specific prenatal anxiety symptoms as well as by standardized anxiety scales. Its prevalence has ranged from 21 to 25% and it has been predicted by a number of pregnancy-related variables such as unintended pregnancy, demographic variables such as low acculturation and income and psychosocial factors including pessimism and partner tension. Prenatal anxiety effects on pregnancy include increased cortisol levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines, obstetric problems and cesarean section. Effects on the neonate include lower gestational age, prematurity, less insulin-like growth factor in cord blood, less exclusive breast-feeding and less self-regulation during the heelstick procedure. Prenatal anxiety effects continue into infancy and childhood both on physiological development and emotional/mental development. Among the physiological effects are lower vagal activity across the first two years, and lower immunity, more illnesses and reduced gray matter in childhood. Prenatal anxiety effects on emotional/mental development include greater negative emotionality and in infants, lower mental development scores and internalizing problems. Anxiety disorders occur during childhood and elevated cortisol and internalizing behaviors occur during adolescence. Interventions for prenatal anxiety are virtually nonexistent, although stroking (massaging) the infant has moderated the pregnancy - specific anxiety effects on internalizing behaviors in the offspring. The limitations of this literature include the homogeneity of samples, the frequent use of anxiety measures that are not specific to pregnancy, and the reliance on self-report. Nonetheless, the literature highlights the negative, long-term effects of prenatal anxiety and the need for screening and early interventions.

AB While chronic early stress increases child susceptibility to psychopathology, risk and resilience trajectories are shaped by maternal social influences whose role requires much further research in longitudinal studies. We examined the social transmission of risk by assessing paths leading from war-exposure to child symptoms as mediated by 3 sources of maternal social influence; stress physiology, synchronous parenting, and psychiatric disorder. Mothers and children living in a zone of continuous war were assessed in early childhood (1.5-5 years) and the current study revisited families in late (9-11years) childhood (N = 177; N = 101 war-exposed; N = 76 controls). At both time-points, maternal and child's salivary cortisol (SC), social behavior, and externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed. In late childhood, hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were also measured and mother and child underwent psychiatric diagnosis. The social transmission model was tested against 2 alternative models; 1 proposing direct impact of war on children without maternal mediation, the other predicting late-childhood symptoms from early childhood variables, not change trajectories. Path analysis controlling for early childhood variables supported our conceptual model. Whereas maternal psychopathology was directly linked with child symptoms, defining direct mediation, the impact of maternal stress hormones was indirect and passed through stress contagion mechanisms involving coupling between maternal and child's HCC and SC. Similarly, maternal synchrony linked with child social engagement as the pathway to reduced symptomatology. Findings underscore the critical role of maternal stress physiology, attuned behavior, and well-being in shaping child psychopathology amid adversity and specify direct and indirect paths by which mothers stand between war and the child.

AB Objective: To examine the health care costs associated with ADHD within a nationally representative sample of children. Method: Data were from Waves 1 to 3 (4-9 years) of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N = 4,983). ADHD was defined by previous diagnosis and a measure of ADHD symptoms (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]). Participant data were linked to administrative data on health care costs. Analyses controlled for demographic factors and internalizing and externalizing comorbidities. Results: Costs associated with health care attendances and medications were higher for children with parent-reported ADHD at each age. Cost differences were highest at 8 to 9 years for both health care attendances and medications. Persistent symptoms were associated with higher costs (p < .001). Excess population health care costs amounted to Aus$25 to Aus$30 million over 6 years, from 4 to 9 years of age. Conclusion: ADHD is associated with significant health care costs from early in life. Understanding the costs associated with ADHD is an important first step in helping to plan for service-system changes.

AB Mounting research supports that co-rumination, the tendency to seek peer support by engaging in extensive negatively focused discussion, is a risk factor for adolescent psychopathology. It is unclear, though, how this interpersonal tendency develops. Parental responses to adolescents' negative affect likely shape how youth utilize peer relationships to regulate distress, as they shift to reliance on peer support during this developmental stage. For example, nonsupportive parental responses may fail to instill healthy regulation strategies, resulting in ineffective forms of peer support, such as co-rumination. Conversely, high levels of supportive parental responses to adolescents' negative affect may motivate youth to also express more negative affect with peers, leading to co-rumination. Eighty-nine healthy adolescents (9-17) and their mothers completed surveys and a support-seeking interaction. Only supportive maternal responses, including maternal affection, were associated with adolescents' co-rumination. These analyses indicate that some forms of parental support are associated with adolescents' tendency to co-ruminate.

AB This study examined gender differences in how internalizing and externalizing symptoms affect adolescents' decisions about smoking in Chile, where girls smoke at some of the highest rates in the world. In multivariate logistic regression analyses with 607 adolescents, internalizing symptoms, such as depressed mood and anxiety, predicted smoking among girls more than boys, with girls who were low in internalizing symptoms being more likely to smoke than those who were high in internalizing symptoms. In Chile's high-risk context, internalizing symptoms may be indirectly protective for girls by decreasing their exposure to peer pressure and related influences that encourage cigarette use.

AB Objective To examine the relative contributions of neuropsychological (attention and executive function), family (cohesion and conflict), and health (body mass index, lesion level, gross motor function) domains on social skills over time in youth with spina bifida (SB). Methods In all, 140 youth with SB (T1 mean age = 11.43 years) and their families participated in the study at baseline with an additional visit 2 years later. Study variables were assessed with multiple methods (questionnaire, medical chart review, observation, neuropsychological tests) and reporters (parents, teachers). Multivariate hierarchical linear regressions determined the predictive power of the three domains for T2 social skills. Results Neuropsychological variables accounted for significant variance in mother-and father-reported T2 social skills. Neither family nor health variables contributed significantly to later social skills when other domains were included in the model. Conclusions Neuropsychological factors are particularly important for social skill development in youth with SB. Findings can inform screening and intervention practices.

AB Involvement in bullying and sexual harassment in adolescence is associated with a variety of internalizing, externalizing, and health-risk behaviors. Yet, the two behaviors are often studied independently. The current study examined how bullying and sexual harassment co-occur and whether social connections protected youth from risk patterns. The data for this study come from the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 121,311; 50% female, 74% White, 26% received free or reduced-price lunch; M (age) = 14.9, SD = 1.3). Students reported on bullying and sexual harassment victimization and perpetration. Using latent class analysis, youth were classified into five patterns: High-Risk of All Forms of Victimization and Perpetration (7%), Relational and Cyberbullying Victimization (17%), Sexual Harassment Victimization and Perpetration (8%), Physical Bullying Perpetration (6%), and Low-Risk (62%). Compared to the low-risk class, the four other classes had lower levels of social connections, particularly with teachers and parents. Older youth (9th and 11th grade students) were at greater risk for the sexual harassment pattern, while younger youth (8th grade students) were at greater risk for bullying patterns. The results indicate that efforts to reduce bullying should also address sexual harassment and social connections with adults.

AB We provide the first validation data on the Spanish version of the Brief Problem Monitor-Parent form (BPM-P), a recently developed abbreviated version of the 120-item Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6 to 18 (CBCL/6-18) in young schoolchildren. Parents of a community sample of 521 children aged 6-8 answered the CBCL/6-18 yearly, and the 19 BPM-P items were examined; parents also provided different measures of psychopathology. Confirmatory factor analysis of the expected 3-factor model (attention, externalizing, and internalizing) showed adequate fit (root mean square error of approximation, RMSEA <= .057), and measurement invariance across sex and age was observed. Internal consistency for the derived scores was satisfactory (omega >= .83). Concurrent validity with the equivalent scale scores of the original full CBCL/6-18 (r >= .84) and convergent validity with parents' ratings of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores (r >= .52) were good. BPM-P scores at age 7 showed good predictive accuracy for discriminating the use of mental health services (OR >= 1.12), functional impairment (B <= -1.25), and the presence of the corresponding disorders diagnosed with an independent clinical interview, both cross-sectionally at age 7 and longitudinally at age 8 (OR >= 1.24). The BPM-P provides reliable and valid scores as a very brief follow-up and screening tool for assessing behavioral and emotional problems in young schoolchildren.
   Public Significance Statement
   This study provides evidence on validity and reliability of the Brief Problem Monitor-Parent (BPM-P) scores in 6- to 8-year-old children. Given the shortness of the questionnaire, it can be used with psychometric guarantees as a brief follow-up and screening tool for monitoring children's functioning and responses to interventions in young schoolchildren.

AB ObjectivesAlthough rumination can have a negative influence on the family environment and the quality of parent-child interactions, there is little research on the role of parental rumination in predicting adverse child outcomes over time. This longitudinal study examined whether mothers' and fathers' brooding rumination would each uniquely predict emotional symptoms in preschool children.
   MethodsThe initial sample consisted of 160 families (including 50 mothers with past depression, 33 fathers with past depression, and 7 fathers with current depression according to the Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-IV). Families were seen at two times separated by 16months. Children's mean age at the entry into the study was 3.9years (SD=0.8). Each parent independently completed the Ruminative Response Scale, the Child Behavior Checklist, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale.
   ResultsFathers' brooding rumination significantly predicted children's emotional symptoms over 16months when controlling for child emotional symptoms, couple adjustment, parents' depressive symptoms, mothers' brooding and reflective rumination, and fathers' reflective rumination at baseline. Unexpectedly, mothers' brooding rumination did not significantly predict child emotional symptoms over time. Correlational analyses showed significant associations between parents' rumination and lower levels of couple adjustment.
   ConclusionsFindings suggest that fathers' brooding rumination may play a unique role in their children's emotional outcomes. If these findings are replicated, studies should examine the processes by which these links occur and their implications for clinical interventions.

AB Background: Acute central nervous system (ACNS) infections such as meningitis, encephalitis and cerebellitis still cause morbidity and mortality among children. The aim of this study was to verify whether neuropsychological impairment may develop in ACNS survivors.
   Methods: The study included pediatric patients affected by ACNS disorders, aged 3-16 years admitted to the Bambino Gesu Children Hospital, Rome from June 2013 till June 2015. The patients and their parents underwent a psychological interview and neuropsychological tests during the first week of hospital admission and 1 year after, during a follow-up control. Wilcoxon signed rank tests for paired data were conducted to verify if the results were statistically importance. Patients underwent a cognitive profile test through the Leiter international performance scale - revised, motor skills evaluation through the test of visual-motor integration and a psychopathological evaluation by the child behavior checklist. The K-SADS-PL test was administered in children 6-11 years old to check psychopathological disorders.
   Results: Forty-four patients were included in the study. At the 1 year follow-up, "anxiety problems" (dependency, fears, worries, nervousness) developed in 47% of patients, "somatic problems" (aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting) in 29% and "affective problems" (crying, self-harming, worthlessness, guilt, tiredness, sadness) in 29%. Visual perception was statistically increased at the 1 year follow-up in our patient cohort (p = 0.0297), mainly among the meningitides group (p = 0.0189). Motor-coordination also increased at the follow-up check in the study participants (p = 0.0076), especially in the group affected by cerebellitis (p = 0.0302).
   Conclusions: Neuropsychological disorders are often difficult to recognize in the early stage. They must, however, be promptly identified through specific and standardized neuropsychological examinations in order to avoid long term sequelae in adulthood.

AB Background: Several studies have proven that the experiences of being bullied or bullying others are associated with poor mental health among adolescent youths. Our study aims to investigate the relationship between the experience of the bully/victim and mental health among preadolescents and adolescents.
   Methods: Subjects were the Japanese fifth and sixth grade elementary school students (preadolescents: mean age = 11.3 years; n = 338) and junior high school students (adolescents: mean age = 13.8 years; n = 486). A self-report questionnaire was administered containing items concerning the experience of being a bully/victim and the Youth Self Report (YSR).
   Results: Four groups relating to the experience of being a bully/victim were formed: "Victim Only," "Bully Only," "Victim and Bully," and "Neither." Approximately 65% of preadolescents and approximately 25% of adolescents engaged in bullying behaviors. Of these, the rate of participants in the "Bully Only" group was low, and that in the "Victim and Bully" group was high. Regarding the relationship between the experience of being a bully/victim and mental health, both preadolescents and adolescents of the "Victim Only" group had significantly higher scores on the YSR's internalizing problems compared with the "Neither" group. Moreover, both preadolescents and adolescents of the "Bully Only" group had significantly higher scores on the YSR's externalizing problems compared with the "Neither" group. Regarding the relationship between the experience of being a bully/victim and suicidal ideation for both preadolescent and adolescent girls, the relative risks of suicidal ideation were significantly higher in the "Victim and Bully" group than in the "Neither" group.
   Conclusions: Preadolescents indicated a higher rate of bullying behaviors than adolescents. In both preadolescents and adolescents, different effect patterns on mental health were found for the "Victim Only," "Bully Only," and "Victim and Bully" groups. The prevention and intervention methods for mental health should be tailored according to the type of experience associated with being a bully/victim and according to the developmental stages of preadolescence or adolescence.

AB Individual differences in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to stress (measured via salivary cortisol) have been widely implicated in the etiology of internalizing problems such as depression and anxiety. Literature suggests that stress during early childhood is an important source of contextual risk although its effects may be moderated by polymorphisms of neurotransmitter genes. The COMT val158met is one such polymorphism, and literature documents its link to internalizing problems. To extend these findings, and to better understand the role of this polymorphism in developmental risk, we investigated links between the val158met polymorphism and early-age cortisol response. Additionally, we investigated whether cortisol reactivity mediated the link between COMT and emerging internalizing symptoms. The study was conducted in a community sample of 409 preschoolers. Saliva samples were collected pre-stress task (baseline) and every 10 min post-stress task for one-hour to asses cortisol response. Child anxious and depressive symptoms were tabulated based on parent-reports. Markers of early childhood stress included marital discord, socio-economic status and the UCLA Life Stress Interview. Findings indicated that the val158met polymorphism is associated with childhood cortisol response (p < 0.05). A gene-environment interaction between val158met and life stress also predicted child anxiety symptoms (p < 0.01). Finally, cortisol response mediated the main-effect of val158met on child anxiety symptoms (pathway ps < 0.05). Analyses suggest that COMT val158met moderates the influence of early life stress on preschool-age symptoms of anxiety. Additionally, cortisol reactivity acts as a mechanistic mediator of the main-effect of COMT genotype on child anxious symptoms.

Child-caregiver dyads (N = 250; 50% girls; 46% Latino/a) completed a series of laboratory assessments yielding independent measures of intrusive parenting at age 4, PNS regulation at age 6, and child behavior problems at age 8. Results indicated that intrusive parenting was related to more internalizing problems among boys who showed low RSA reactivity (Le., PNS withdrawal from pre-startle to startle challenge), but RSA reactivity did not moderate this relation among girls. Interestingly, RSA recovery (i.e., PNS activation from startle challenge to post-startle) moderated these relations differently for boys and girls. For girls with relatively low RSA post-startle (i.e., less recovery), intrusive parenting was positively related to both internalizing and externalizing problems. However, the reverse was true for boys, such that there was a significant positive relation between intrusive parenting and later externalizing problems among boys who evidenced relatively high RSA post-startle (Le., more recovery). Findings provide evidence for the moderation of intrusive caregiving effects by children's PNS regulation while highlighting the differential patterning of these relations across distinct phases of the regulatory response and as a function of child sex.

AB Parent and teacher ratings of child behaviors are often discrepant, and these discrepancies may be correlated with parenting stress. The present study explored whether various parenting stress factors are associated with discrepancies between parent and teacher ratings of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as well as internalizing symptoms in preschool children. We recruited 299 Taiwanese preschool children (aged 4-6 years) from the community or via clinical referrals. A structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships among three factors derived from the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form and informant discrepancies on symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, ODD, and internalizing behaviors. Scores reported by parents were higher for each of the symptoms examined than those reported by teachers, and the degree of agreement between informants ranged from low to moderate. The parental distress factor of parenting stress was associated only with parent ratings, whereas other factors of parenting stress D parent-child dysfunctional interaction and parents' stress resulted from their child's temperament D were correlated with both parent and teacher ratings. Only parental distress factor predicted informant discrepancies for all behavioral symptoms assessed. Our findings suggest that parental distress should be considered when parent rating scores show significant discrepancies from that of teacher rating scores.

AB Adolescence is a critical period of rapid biological and social development and early signs of adult mental disorders emerge during this life stage. Previous studies suggest that mentalizing failures, specifically difficulties in reflective functioning (RF) are linked with psychological symptoms. However, relatively little is known about the association between RF and psychological adaptation in typical development. In this study, the relationship between RF, internalizing and externalizing symptoms were investigated in 95 adolescents using the revised Reflective Functioning Scale-Adolescent version. Results indicate that RF is associated with more self-reported internalizing symptoms. Moreover, the relationship between RF and externalizing symptoms are accounted for by the co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in typically developing adolescents. The implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future studies are presented.

AB Bullying is a pervasive and widely studied problem. Less is known about the emotion correlates that accompany being a bully, being a victim of bullying, and experiencing both bullying and victimization for African American elementary-school-age students. The current study examined differences in emotion dysregulation and internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety) across levels of bullying and victimization. Children (N = 336, M-age = 9.58 years, 42.3% boys, 100% African American) were recruited from two inner-city elementary schools and completed self-and peer-reports of bullying and self-reports of victimization, emotion dysregulation, and internalizing symptoms. Results indicated that emotion dysregulation and anxiety symptoms were predicted by an interaction between self-reported bullying and victimization. For children low in victimization, higher levels of self-reported bullying predicted an increase in emotion dysregulation and anxiety symptoms. However, for children high in victimization, bullying was not predictive of these outcomes. Depressive symptoms were predicted by self- and peer-reported bullying and self-reported victimization. Understanding underlying emotional correlates of bullying and victimization within this context have important implications for prevention programs.

AB This study examines the role of several resilience resources in the relationship between lifetime victimization and mental health problems among adolescents in care. The sample comprised 127 adolescents (53.% females, aged 12-17 years) from residential care facilities in Catalonia, Spain. The Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire, the Youth Self-Report, and the Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire were used to assess victimization, psychological symptoms, and resilience respectively. Results indicated that poly-victimization was associated with fewer resources, and with an increased risk of mental health problems. Self-resources mediated the relationship between victimization and internalizing and externalizing symptoms; community support mediated the relationship between victimization and internalizing symptoms. Self, school and peer support moderated the relationship between victimization and externalizing symptoms. Adolescents with fewer self-resources and less school support reported more externalizing symptoms, as did those with more peer support. However, poly-victimized youths reported symptoms within the clinical range, regardless of their level of resources. The findings stress the importance of preventing poly-victimization and of empowering poly-victimized adolescents, who appear to present low levels of resources. Researchers and clinicians should continue to study the poly-victimization/ psychopathology relationship, and also design interventions and prevention programs which incorporate the most relevant resilience resources.

AB Child abuse is a major public health problem. In order to establish the prevalence of abuse exposure among children, measures need to be age-appropriate, sensitive, reliable and valid. This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire Abuse Short Form (ACE-ASF). The ACE-ASF is an 8-item, retrospective self-report questionnaire measuring lifetime physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Data from a nationally representative sample of 15-year-old, school-going adolescents (n = 1733, 55.5% female) from the Romanian Health Behavior in School-Based Children Study 2014 (HBSC) were analyzed. The factorial structure of the ACE-ASF was tested with Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and confirmed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Measurement invariance was examined across sex, and internal reliability and concurrent criterion validity were established. Violence exposure was high: 39.7% physical, 32.2% emotional and 13.1% sexual abuse. EFA established a two factor structure: physical/emotional abuse and sexual abuse. CFA confirmed this model fitted the data well [chi 2(df) = 60.526(19); RMSEA = 0.036; CFI/TLI = 0.990/0.986]. Metric invariance was supported across sexes. Internal consistency was good (0.83) for the sexual abuse scale and poor (0.57) for the physical/emotional abuse scale. Concurrent criterion validity confirmed hypothesized relationships between childhood abuse and health-related quality of life, life satisfaction, self-perceived health, bullying victimization and perpetration, externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and multiple health complaints. Results support the ACE-ASF as a valid measure of physical, emotional and sexual abuse in school-aged adolescents. However, the ACE-ASF combines spanking with other types of physical abuse when this should be assessed separately instead. Future research is needed to replicate findings in different youth populations and across age groups.

AB Sexual victimization has been one of the most frequently studied forms of child victimization. Its effects are common and diverse; however, not all children and youth exposed to sexual victimization eventually develop adjustment problems. A total of 1105 children and youth (590 male and 515 female) aged between 12 and 17 from northeastern Spain were assessed regarding their experiences of sexual victimization, symptoms of psychopathology, and protective factors. The results showed that all forms of sexual victimization were associated with higher levels of emotional and behavioral problems. However, the presence of a low Negative Cognition, high Social Skills and high Confidence seem to act buffering internalizing problems. Additionally, a significant interaction between Sexual Victimization and low Negative Cognition was observed (p < 0.5), so that, low Negative Cognition was related to a lower risk of being in the clinical range for internalizing problems. Likewise, high scores on Empathy/Tolerance, Connectedness to School, Connectedness to Family and low Negative Cognition acted as promotive factors in relation to externalizing symptoms, in this case without any interaction effect. The strong relationship found with emotional and behavioral problems highlights the importance of continuing the research on the protective factors underlying resilience in the relationship between sexual victimization and psychopathological symptoms. The findings also support the multi-dimensional and specific nature of resilience and identify some of the protective factors that should be regarded as key intervention targets in adolescents with a history of sexual victimization.

AB Children exposed to intimate partner violence are at increased risk for concomitant exposure to maltreatment of companion animals. There is emerging evidence that childhood exposure to maltreatment of companion animals is associated with psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. However, few studies have explored developmental factors that might help to explain pathways from animal maltreatment exposure to children's maladjustment. The present study addresses this gap in the literature by examining relations between children's exposure to animal maltreatment, callous/unemotional traits (i.e., callousness, uncaring traits, and unemotional traits), and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. A sample of 291 ethnically diverse children (55% Latino or Hispanic) between the ages of 7 and 12 was recruited from community based domestic violence services. A meditational path model indicated that child exposure to animal maltreatment was associated with callousness (beta = 0.14), which in turn was associated with greater internalizing (beta = 0.32) and externalizing problems (beta = 0.47). The effect of animal maltreatment exposure on externalizing problems was mediated through callousness. Results suggest that callous/unemotional traits are a potential mechanism through which childhood exposure to animal maltreatment influences subsequent behavior problems. Future research is needed to evaluate the extent to which exposure to animal maltreatment affects children's adjustment over time in the context of other co-occurring adverse childhood experiences.

AB ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to document how often youth in foster care have contact with their legal parents, test factors associated with the amount of contact, and determine if contact was associated with relationships with caregivers and youth mental health symptoms.
   BackgroundBecause parental reunification is the case plan goal for most youth in foster care, it is important to maintain contact with parents. Federal policy emphasizes the importance of parent-child contact for youth in foster care; however, little is known about how often visitation actually occurs.
   MethodThis study involved a nationally representative study of youth aged 6 to 17 years in the child welfare system (N = 452). Youth reported their amount of contact with parents, and levels of emotional security and involvement with current caregivers. Caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Multinomial logistic regression and analyses of covariance were conducted to determine linkages associated with parental contact, relationships with caregivers, and youth mental health.
   ResultsMost youth had at least weekly contact with mothers; however, more than half reported never having contact with fathers. Youths' age, race, type of maltreatment, and placement were associated with how often contact occurred. Findings also revealed statistically lower internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems of youth who had daily contact with mothers compared with youth with no contact.
   ConclusionWhen parent-child contact is safely possible, more frequent contact with mothers is associated with beneficial youth outcomes.
   ImplicationsApplying a translational family science approach, implications for engaging mothers and fathers in visitation are discussed.

AB Peer victimization is a widespread phenomenon especially prevalent in early adolescence. This study investigates the prevalence of peer victimization and its association with mental health problems and impact on everyday life, and the possible mediating effect of parental and peer support. Data are based on a cross-sectional health survey (N = 9,707) among adolescents (10-13 years) and their parents (N = 8,210). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure mental health problems, as well as impact on everyday life. Approximately, 17.6% of boys and 15.3% of girls reported being peer victimized. Both genders had higher symptoms of emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity than non-peer victimized adolescents. Boys had higher symptoms of emotional problems than girls. All symptom scales were strongly associated with perceived impact on everyday life. Peer and parental support buffer mental health problems among the victimized. Study indicates the importance of interventions strengthening peer support among victimized early adolescents.

AB The aims of the present study were (a) to examine whether Dutch and Indian early adolescents differ concerning sibling and parent-child relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problems, and (b) to compare the associations between sibling and parent-child relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problems for Indian and Dutch early adolescents. Our sample consisted of 274 Dutch (mean age = 10.9 years) and 236 Indian early adolescents (mean age = 10.8 years). Questionnaires were administered in the final grades of 15 Dutch primary schools and six Indian English-language middle schools. Indian early adolescents reported more sibling warmth and parental negative interaction than Dutch early adolescents. However, associations between sibling and parent-child relationship quality and externalizing and internalizing problems were similar. Our study indicates that cross-cultural differences may exist in quality of sibling and parent-child relationships, but not in their impact on externalizing and internalizing problems. More cross-cultural research concerning family relationship quality and its impact on early adolescent psychosocial development is needed to confirm our findings.

AB This study used a large community sample of women sexual assault survivors to prospectively assess 17 theorized predictors across four types of sexual assault revictimization: unwanted contact, coercion, substance-involved assault (SIA), and force. Results indicated that predictors varied across types of revictimization: Unwanted contact and coercion appeared more common in social contexts more hostile toward survivors, whereas forcible assaults and SIAs occurred in circumstances where survivors were vulnerable to being targeted by perpetrators. Overall, the strongest predictors were social environments hostile to survivors, race, childhood sexual abuse, decreased refusal assertiveness, and having more sexual partners. We discuss implications for intervention and research.

AB Racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes and access have been consistently documented for a wide variety of physical and behavioral health conditions. Health inequities are most pronounced in areas with high levels of racial and ethnic segregation, where children and adolescents are also more likely to face economic inequality, which places them at high risk for exposure to neighborhood violence and traumatic loss. Community violence exposure (CVE) has been increasingly recognized as a prominent contributor to negative physical and mental health outcomes. CVE has been linked to children's risk for negative psychological outcomes, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, externalizing behavior, and internalizing symptoms, as well as obesity, asthma, and health-risk behaviors. Providers of pediatric care have opportunities to address CVE and related health disparities by developing trauma-informed systems that routinely screen for CVE, provide basic support for affected families, and link those in need to trauma-focused intervention.

As expected, patients were characterized by high identity stress and high levels of mother's intrusive psychological control accompanied by low support. Patients' levels of both internalizing and externalizing symptomatology were high. The impact of the clinical status and mother's dysfunctional rearing behavior on externalizing and internalizing symptoms was strong. Coping behavior did not buffer the effect of identity stress on symptomatology.

AB Objective To identify factors contributing to cognitive impairment in children with lupus nephritis.
   Study design A cross-sectional analysis of a large multicenter national cohort of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using standardized measures to determine baseline neuropsychiatric function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with lupus nephritis (n = 34), and to compare baseline function with that in children with other forms of glomerular CKD (gCKD; n = 171). We used inverse probability weighting via a logistic model for propensity score analysis to achieve balance between children with lupus nephritis and those with other glomerular causes of CKD, adjusting for known confounders. We used linear regression models to compare neurocognitive outcomes between exposure groups, adjusting for current prednisone use and testing for an interaction between current prednisone use and lupus nephritis, and to test for an association between cognitive function and HRQoL.
   Results Current prednisone use was independently associated with worse attention (P <.01) and better adaptive skills (P =.04), and there was a significant interaction between current prednisone use and lupus nephritis for internalizing problems, with worse parent-reported internalizing problems in children with lupus nephritis on prednisone (P =.047). Better parent-reported HRQoL was associated with better visual memory (P=.01), and better child-reported HRQoL was associated with better attention (P <.01) and inhibitory control (P <.01). Both parent and child HRQoL were associated with better measures of executive function (P=.02 and <.001, respectively).
   Conclusion Children with lupus nephritis have comparable or better cognitive function than their peers with other gCKDs, which is reassuring given the multiorgan and lifelong complications associated with lupus.

AB Aim To determine the effect of late preterm birth and treatment at the intensive care unit (ICU) on school-age children's emotional and behavioral problems and quality of life (QoL).
   Methods Emotional and behavioral problems and QoL were investigated in 6-12-year-olds who were born late preterm at the University Hospital Center Split in the period from January 2002 to March 2008. The study included 126 late preterm children treated in ICU (LP-ICU group), 127 late preterm children not treated in ICU (LP-non-ICU group), and 131 full-term children treated in ICU (FT-ICU group). Emotional and behavioral difficulties were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist. QoL was evaluated with the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children Measure of Function questionnaire. The data was collected via telephone interview with mothers during 2014.
   Results Late preterm children had a nearly 5-fold risk for internalizing problems in comparison with FT-ICU children (OR 4.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.37-9.56 and OR 4.82, 95% CI 2.25-10.37 in LP-ICU and LP-non-ICU children, respectively). They also had a greater risk for externalizing problems (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.44-6.61 and OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.14-6.28, respectively) and total problems (OR 6.29, 95% CI 2.86-13.83 and OR 7.38, 95% CI 3.08-17.69, respectively) and a considerably increased risk for lower QoL (OR 12.79, 95% CI 5.56-29.41 and OR 5.05, 95% CI 2.04-12.48, respectively).
   Conclusion Children born late preterm had a greater risk for emotional and behavioral problems and lower QoL during childhood than their full-term born peers and they experienced serious health problems upon birth.

AB BACKGROUND: Selective mutism (SM) is a rare disease in children coded by DSM-5 as an anxiety disorder. Despite the disabling nature of the disease, there is still no specific treatment.
   AIM: The aims of this study were to verify the efficacy of six-month standard psychomotor treatment and the positive changes in lifestyle, in a population of children affected by SM.
   DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial registered in the European Clinical Trials Registry (EuDract 2015-001161-36).
   SETTING: University third level Centre (Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Clinic).
   POPULATION: Study population was composed by 67 children in group A (psychomotricity treatment) (35 M, mean age 7.84+1.15) and 71 children in group B (behavioral and educational counseling) (37 M, mean age 7.75 +/- 1.36).
   METHODS: Psychomotor treatment was administered by trained child therapists in residential settings three times per week. Each child was treated for the whole period by the same therapist and all the therapists shared the same protocol. The standard psychomotor session length is of 45 minutes. At T0 and after 6 months (T1) of treatments, patients underwent a behavioral and SM severity assessment. To verify the effects of the psychomotor management, the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire (CBCL) and Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ) were administered to the parents.
   RESULTS: After 6 months of psychomotor treatment SM children showed a significant reduction among CBCL scores such as in social relations, anxious/depressed, social problems and total problems (P<0.001), Withdrawn (P=0.007) and Internalizing problems (P=0.020). Regarding SM severity according to SMQ assessment, children of group A showed a reduction of SM symptoms in all situations (school, P=0.003; family, P=0.018; and social, P=0.030 situations) and in SMQ total score (P<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest the positive effect of the psychomotor treatment in rehabilitative program for children affected by selective mutism, even if further studies are needed.
   CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: The present study identifies in psychomotricity a safe and efficacy therapy for pediatric selective mutism.

AB Objective: Though previous research has identified the high burden of mental health and addiction (MHA) concerns among precariously housed youth, earlier studies have not examined differences in MHA concerns among housing insecure Canadian youth across sectors. This study examines this issue using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Short Screener (GAIN-SS) in a cross-sectoral sample of Canadian youth. Method: A total of 2605 youth ages 12 to 24 seeking services across sectors completed the GAIN-SS and a sociodemographic form. The analyses described demographic variables and sector of presentation, then evaluated internalizing, externalizing, substance use, and crime/violence concerns based on housing status. Results: While many precariously housed youth presented through the housing/outreach/support sector, 33.6% presented to other sectors. Housing groups endorsed comparably high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, precariously housed youth reported higher rates of problematic substance use (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.25, 1.88; p < 0.01) and crime/violence issues (OR = 1.95; 95% CI 1.54, 2.46; p < 0.01). Precariously housed youth were 48% more likely to endorse concurrent disorders (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.21, 1.82; p < 0.01), which was largely driven by the high rate of concurrent disorders among precariously housed females. Conclusions: Since precariously housed youth with multiple clinical needs presented across sectors, attention must be given to screening for both housing stability and MHA and building stronger cross-sectoral partnerships. The findings should encourage systematic screening, MHA training and capacity building within housing sectors as well as integrated services across all youth-serving organizations.

AB Guided by the main tenets of contemporary models of the developmental origins of health and disease, this study evaluated whether individual differences in reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) moderate the effect of prenatal exposure to trauma on internalizing and externalizing behaviors during infancy. Participants were a community sample of 182 mothers (M age = 25 years, 43% Caucasian, 33% Black/African American, 24% Biracial/Other) and their infants (59% girls; M age = 11.8 months). Each mother completed questionnaires that assessed IPV experienced during pregnancy and also reported on her infant's behavior problems. Infant saliva samples (later assayed for cortisol and sAA) were collected before and after a frustrating task (i.e., arm restraint). Results revealed that the association between in utero IPV and infant internalizing behaviors was most pronounced for infants with asymmetrical HPA-SNS (i.e., high-cortisol and low-sAA) reactivity to frustration, and least pronounced for infants with symmetrical HPA-SNS (i.e., low-cortisol and low-sAA or high-cortisol and high-sAA) reactivity to frustration. Higher levels of externalizing behavior, in contrast, were associated with higher levels of prenatal IPV but unrelated to either cortisol or sAA reactivity to stress. Findings replicate documented associations between maternal IPV exposure during pregnancy and offspring risk. Moreover, findings advance our understanding of individual differences in the developmental origins of health and disease and provide additional evidence that assessing multiple stress biomarkers contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of individual vulnerability to adversity.

AB Co-rumination has been related to both high quality friendship and depressive symptoms. However, little is known regarding the extent to which co-rumination may be detrimental, its distinction from rumination and potential gender differences in co-rumination. This study used a modified version of Rose's Co-rumination Questionnaire (Rose, 2002) to examine the behaviour of daily co-rumination with daily stress and negative affect among adolescents. Results demonstrated that co-rumination did not have a main effect in predicting negative affect, but did evidence a significant interaction with life stress. Additionally, co-rumination demonstrated incremental utility above that of rumination. Finally, gender differences were not supported. In conclusion, this investigation revealed that co-rumination exacerbates the effects of life stress and is predictive of increased internalising symptoms.

AB Objective: This study explored the feasibility of stepped care trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (SC-TF-CBT) relative to TF-CBT with children (aged 8-12). Method: Children (N = 33) with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were randomly assigned (2: 1) to SC-TF-CBT or TF-CBT. SC-TF-CBT consisted of Step 1, parent-led therapist-assisted treatment, and Step 2 (nine TF-CBT sessions). TF-CBT consisted of 12 therapist-directed sessions. Baseline, post-Step 1, posttreatment, and 3-month follow-up assessments occurred. Cost-related data were collected throughout the treatment. Results: In all, 64% (intent-to-treat) to 82% (completers) responded to Step 1. Group x Time interactions were not statistically significant for PTSS (p = .888), severity (p = .576), and internalizing (p = .862)/externalizing (p = .974) symptoms, indicating comparable improvements in outcomes across both conditions. There were no significant differences in parental treatment credibility (p = .440), expectations (p = .664), and satisfaction (p = .768). SC-TF-CBT total costs were significantly lower than TF-CBT (Effect Size [ES] = 1.61, confidence interval [CI] = [0.65, 2.59], p < .0001). Conclusion: Step 1 may be a viable service delivery approach although further research is needed.

AB Introduction: This study investigated associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and child behaviors at ages 9-11 years and examine interaction by race and gender.
   Methods: The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Children and Young Adults surveys are U.S.-based, ongoing longitudinal studies, initiated in 1979 and 1986, respectively. Mothers (n = 2,952) reported pregnancy and child (n = 5,660) developmental information at multiple time points. Child total, internalizing, and externalizing problems at ages 9-11 years were assessed using the Behavior Problems Index (BPI), collected biennially until 2012. Associations between prepregnancy BMI and child BPI outcomes were examined, as well as two-and three-way interactions by race and gender. Analyses were conducted in 2017.
   Results: Boys whose mothers had higher prepregnancy weights exhibited higher total BPI and externalizing scores at ages 9-11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers. Boys with severely obese mothers had higher total BPI (mean difference=7.99, 95% CI=3.53, 12.46) and externalizing (mean difference=5.77, 95% CI=1.50, 10.04) scores. Prepregnancy underweight was associated with boys' higher total BPI (mean difference=2.34, 95% CI=0.02, 4.66) and externalizing (mean difference=3.30, 95% CI=0.69, 5.91); these associations were not significant in sensitivity analyses. No associations emerged for girls or internalizing problems. Two-way interactions by race and three-way interactions by race and gender were not significant.
   Conclusions: Maternal prepregnancy weight was associated with BPI level among boys. Boys with severely obese mothers exhibited markedly higher behavioral problems at ages 9-11 years versus those with normal-weight mothers, regardless of race. Maintaining healthy prepregnancy weight may be important for preventing boys' deleterious behavior outcomes in middle childhood. (C) 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

TI Predictors of non-suicidal and suicidal self-injurious behaviours, among

AB Background: The complex intersections between non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) behaviours; like cutting, burning or self-hitting, and suicide attempts, are an important domain of enquiry among vulnerable adolescents and young adults. A cross-sectional survey in urban schools and colleges assessed the rates of self-injurious behaviour among Indian adolescents and young adults. Predictors of NSSI and of self-injurious behaviours with associated suicidal intent, were also examined.
   Participants and methods: The sample comprised 1571 male and female students, from 19 private and government aided high schools, pre-university colleges and undergraduate colleges in an urban city in South India. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation which assesses the methods, characteristics and functions of self-injurious acts in the past 12 months. The measures of psychopathology included the Youth Self-Report and the Young-Adult Self-Report.
   Results and conclusion: The results indicated that rate of NSSI was 33.8%, with minor forms of self-injury reported more often (19.4%) than the moderate/severe forms (14.6%). A smaller proportion (6.8%) reported self-injurious acts with associated suicidal intent. Certain self-injury characteristics and levels of internalizing and externalizing problems differentiated self-injuring youth with and without suicidal intent. Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of any self-injurious behaviour and of self-injury associated with suicidal intent. The implications for assessment and intervention frameworks for self-injuring youth are discussed.

AB Emotions are generated and regulated in the context of close relationships, such as mother-child relationships. Children's emotional development is primarily directed by mother-child emotional processes. In the current review, we examine the advances in understanding how mother-child relationships impact emotion development. In particular, we explore novel and advanced techniques in measurement and design, autonomic psychophysiology, the structure of emotion socialization, and modeling of parent-child dynamics. As these innovations continue to progress, we expect that theoretical models of emotional development will be further refined.

AB Bullying is a major problem in schools and a large number of studies have demonstrated that victims have a high excess risk of poor mental health. It may however also affect those who are not directly victimized by peers. The present study investigates whether peer victimization among classmates is linked to internalizing problems, self-esteem, and life satisfaction at the individual level, when the student's own victimization has been taken into account. The data were derived from the first wave of the Swedish part of Youth in Europe Study (YES!), including information on 4319 students in grade 8 (14-15 years of age) distributed across 242 classes. Results from multilevel analyses show a significant association between classes with a high proportion of students being victimized and higher levels of internalizing problems, lower self-esteem, and lower life satisfaction at the student level. This association holds when the student's own victimization has been taken into account. This suggests that peer victimization negatively affects those who are directly exposed, as well as their classmates. We conclude that efficient methods and interventions to reduce bullying in school are likely to benefit not only those who are victimized, but all students.

AB Parent Training (PT) is not as effective for parents with histories of internalizing symptoms as it is for other parents. This study aimed to determine which dimensions of parenting, notably parenting efficacy, positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, and poor supervision, mediate the association between parent lifetime internalizing symptoms and post-PT child emotional and behavioral difficulties. One hundred fourteen parents (82% biological mothers) of children aged 9-12 years received PT at an urban children's mental health clinic. Parents reported their lifetime internalizing symptoms, pre- and post-PT parenting skills, and pre- and post-PT child difficulties. Positive parenting fully mediated the relation between parent lifetime internalizing symptoms and elevated child post-PT emotional and behavioral difficulties. Specifically, parents higher in internalizing symptoms reported lower positive parenting post-PT, which in turn predicted more child difficulties post-PT. Findings suggest that fostering positive parenting in PT may be particularly important for parents with histories of internalizing symptoms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite growing trends in adolescent female aggression, much adolescent aggression research has focused on males to the exclusion of their female counterparts. Using relational-cultural and social role theories, the current study identifies the risk and promotive factors associated with adolescent female aggression. Using data from the Rural Adaptation Project (a 5 year longitudinal panel study of youth from two rural, ethnically diverse, low income counties in North Carolina), a 2-level hierarchical linear model was estimated (N = 3580). Internalizing symptoms, association with delinquent friends, peer pressure, and parent-child conflict emerged as risk factors whereas teacher support was a significant promotive factor. Results suggest that interventions should focus on negative relationships in both the parent and peer domains and underscore the need for mental health services for aggressive girls.

AB Objective: Many young children in foster care suffer from emotional and behavior problems due to neglect and abuse. These problems can lead to difficulties in school, and functioning in school is linked to long-term health and development. Early intervention to reduce emotional and behavioral issues can help children successfully transition to school, which can improve long-term outcomes. However, communities need information on relative costs and benefits associated with programs to make informed choices. The objective of this study was to assess cost effectiveness, over 12 months, of the Kids in Transition to School (KITS) intervention compared to usual services available to children in a foster care control group (FCC).
   Method: Randomized controlled trial of 192 children in foster care entering kindergarten who were randomized to KITS (n = 102) or FCC (n = 90). KITS includes school readiness groups and parent training over 4 months. Main outcomes were days free from internalizing symptoms (IFD), days free from externalizing behavior (EFD), intervention costs, public agency costs, and incremental cost effectiveness.
   Results: KITS significantly increased IFD and EFD compared to FCC. Average total cost of the intervention was $932 per family. The intervention did not significantly impact usual services. Average incremental cost effectiveness was $64 per IFD and $63 per EFD.
   Conclusions: The cost of KITS is comparable to, or less than, similar programs, and the intervention is likely to provide significant emotional and behavioral benefit and improvement in school readiness for young children in foster care.

AB Children involved in the child welfare system display elevated or clinically significant behavioral problems. However, there is a dearth of literature on the behavioral problems of American Indian children following child welfare involvement. Grounded in Patterson's Family Adjustment and Adaptation Response theory, this study fills that gap. Baseline, 18-month, and 36-month follow-up data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being were utilized. The sample (n = 3498) consisted of American Indian, African American, and Caucasian children ages 2-16 at baseline (M = 8.13 years old, SD = 3.85) and 51.7% were female. Nearest neighbor propensity score matching analyses were used to estimate the effect of race on clinically significant internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. Findings suggest that although externalizing behavioral problems do not differ based on race after controlling for other important factors, internalizing behavioral problems do differ. American Indian children are more likely to display clinically significant internalizing behavioral problems.

AB Background: Individuals with sensory regulation disorders present with many difficulties in terms of managing emotions, behavior, and motor control. Children with such difficulties are often referred to psychiatric clinics for assessment of their behavioral and emotional problems. Few studies have investigated the role of environmental factors on sensory dysfunctions, and none have specifically studied its association with child attachment in a clinical sample.
   Objective: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the association between sensory regulation and child attachment among preschoolers referred to a psychiatric clinic.
   Method: A sample of 60 preschoolers and their mothers were recruited through a child psychiatric clinic. Child attachment was assessed with the gold standard separation-reunion procedure for preschoolers. Parents completed the sensory profile, which assesses the presence of child hypersensitivity (sensitivity and avoidant scale) and hyposensitivity (sensory seeking and registration scale).
   Results: Data showed that 57% of the children were presented with clinical symptoms of sensory regulation. In addition, 53% of the children were classified insecure behaviorally disorganized or insecure disorganized controlling. In particular, results revealed that children classified as insecure disorganized controlling were significantly more likely to show hypersensitivity avoidance and sensory-seeking behaviors.
   Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of the parent-child relationship for children with sensory regulation difficulties.

AB Objective: Using diary and longitudinal data, the current study examined the relations between Mexican-origin youths' ethnic discrimination, daily sleep and stress processes, and internalizing symptoms. Method: Adolescents (N = 113; 49.6% female, M-age = 15.73 years) participated in an initial in-home interview and reported on ethnic discrimination and internalizing symptoms. They then completed a 3-day diary study and reported on their daily stress and sleep behaviors (i.e., sleep quality, sleep duration). Adolescents' internalizing symptoms were reassessed 2 years after the initial assessment. Results: Discrimination related to greater daily stress and lower sleep quality. Daily stress was, in turn, marginally related to concurrent internalizing symptoms, but not longitudinal changes in symptoms. Sleep duration was unrelated to discrimination experiences and concurrent and long-term internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: Discrimination disrupts daily processes that include overall stress levels and sleep quality. Daily stress processes may help explain the link between discrimination and Mexican-origin adolescents' concurrent internalizing symptoms. Research examining daily processes provides insight into psychological and behavioral implications of discrimination experiences of adolescents.

AB Background: Comorbid internalizing mental disorders in alcohol use disorders (AUD) can be understood as putative independent risk factors for AUD or as expressions of underlying shared psychopathology vulner-abilities. However, it remains unclear whether: 1) specific latent internalizing psychopathology risk-profiles predict AUD-incidence and 2) specific latent internalizing comorbidity-profiles in AUD predict AUD-stability.
   Aims: To investigate baseline latent internalizing psychopathology risk profiles as predictors of subsequent AUD-incidence and-stability in adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: Data from the prospective-longitudinal EDSP study (baseline ago 14 21 years) were used. The study design included up to three follow-up assessments in up to ten years. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed with the DIA-X/M-CIDI. To investigate risk-profiles and their associations with AUD-outcomes, latent class analysis with auxiliary outcome variables was applied.
   Results: AUD-incidence: a 4-class model (N = 1683) was identified (classes: normative-male [45.9%], normative-female [44.2%], internalizing [5.3%), nicotine dependence [4.5%]). Compared to the normative-female class, all other classes were associated with a higher risk of subsequent incident alcohol dependence (p < 0.05). AUD-stability: a 3-class model (N = 1940) was identified with only one class (11.6%) with high probabilities for baseline AUD. This class was further characterized by elevated substance use disorder (SUD) probabilities and predicted any subsequent AUD (OR 8.5, 95% CI 5.4-13.3).
   Conclusions: An internalizing vulnerability may constitute a pathway to AUD incidence in adolescence and young adulthood. In contrast, no indication for a role of internalizing comorbidity profiles in AUD-stability was found, which may indicate a limited importance of such profiles - in contrast to SUD-related profiles - in AUD stability.

AB Background: We attempt to develop a relatively comprehensive structural model of risk factors for drug abuse (DA) in Swedish men that illustrates developmental and mediational processes.
   Methods: We examined 20 risk factors for DA in 48,369 men undergoing conscription examinations in 1969-70 followed until 2011 when 2.34% (n = 1134) of them had DA ascertained in medical, criminal and pharmacy registries. Risk factors were organized into four developmental tiers reflecting i) birth, ii) childhood/early adolescence, iii) late adolescence, and iv) young adulthood. Structural equational model fitting was performed using Mplus.
   Results: The best fitting model explained 47.8% of the variance in DA. The most prominent predictors, in order, were: early adolescent externalizing behavior, early adult criminal behavior, early adolescent internalizing behavior, early adult unemployment, early adult alcohol use disorder, and late adolescent drug use. Two major inter-connecting pathways emerged reflecting i) genetic/familial risk and ii) family dysfunction and psychosocial adversity. Generated on a first and tested on a second random half of the sample, a model from these variables predicted DA with an ROC area under the curve of 83.6%. Fifty-nine percent of DA cases arose from subjects in the top decile of risk.
   Conclusions: DA in men is a highly multifactorial syndrome with risk arising from familial-genetic, psychosocial, behavioral and psychological factors acting and interacting over development. Among the multiple predisposing factors for DA, a range of psychosocial adversities, externalizing psychopathology and lack of social constraints in early adulthood are predominant.

   REACTIVITY
AB Psychopathy refers to a heterogeneous set of harmful dark traits and behaviors, including superficial charm, callousness, irresponsibility, and antisocial behavior. The triarchic psychopathy model (TriPM) posits that psychopathy is the combination of 3 traits: boldness, disinhibition, and meanness. However, little research has examined the concurrent and developmental correlates of these traits. We developed TriPM scales from the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised using an empirical-derived approach in a high-risk sample of 561 young adults (ages 17-25; 70.2% male). Concurrent correlates and developmental precursors of each scale were examined longitudinally using cross-informant reports from 3 critical developmental periods (ages 3-5; 9-11; 15-17). Using this approach, we identified consistent developmental precursors and concurrent correlates of boldness, including lower reactive control, fewer internalizing traits, and greater resiliency. Additionally, starting in adolescence we found that disinhibition was related to lower reactive control, more externalizing problems, substance use, and internalizing traits. Finally, although meanness demonstrated some expected concurrent relationships with criterion variables in early adulthood (e.g., lower adaptive functioning), we identified few consistent developmental precursors of meanness. Thus, a NEO-based approach to measuring the TriPM was successful in delineating boldness, disinhibition, and, to a lesser extent, meanness cross-sectionally during early adulthood. However, only boldness showed relative stability from developmental precursors in early childhood to our TriPM scale in early adulthood.
   General Scientific Summary
   Within the triarchic psychopathy model (TriPM), psychopathy has been conceptualized as being composed of 3 traits: boldness, disinhibition, and meanness. Using a 5 factor personality-derived measure of the TriPM, we found continuity in the nomological network of boldness across development, including both prospective and concurrent associations with fewer internalizing problems and greater resiliency. Beginning in adolescence and into adulthood, disinhibition was related to more externalizing problems and substance use. However, prospective associations with meanness were inconsistent, suggesting limitations either in using personality measures of the TriPM, or in the meanness construct itself.

AB This study examined associations between cumulative contextual risk in childhood and depression diagnosis in early adulthood, testing two adolescent mediating mechanisms, alcohol use and perceived social support from family and friends, while accounting for the stability of internalizing problems over time and examining possible gender moderation. Multiple group mediation analyses were conducted using parent- and adolescent-report as well as hospital records data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (N = 6963). Our analyses demonstrated that the association between cumulative contextual risk in childhood and depression diagnosis in adulthood is mediated by adolescent alcohol use and perceived social support both for boys and girls. The findings highlight potentially malleable mediating mechanisms associated with depression in vulnerable youth that could be targets in selective depression preventive interventions.

AB The aims of the present study were to explore the impact of parental characteristics (behavioural control and psychological control) on adolescents' expression of externalizing and internalizing behaviours. To address the aim of the study, participants completed quantitative measures; the study included 538 adolescents and their mothers and fathers. Overall, 513 mothers and 464 fathers participated in the study. Adolescents completed the Children's Report on Parent Behaviour Inventory (CRPBI), while parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist Parent Report (Short Form; CBCL). Results of the study showed that only maternal and paternal psychological control predicted externalizing and internalizing behaviours. The conclusions have practical applications, as they can provide novel approaches in parent training programmes. Furthermore, results are discussed in relation to the connection with earlier studies and the theoretical contribution. (C) 2017 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB This study examined whether the New Beginnings Program (NBP), a parenting preventive intervention for divorced mothers that was designed to reduce children's postdivorce mental health problems, reduced painful feelings about divorce in young adults whose families had participated 15 years earlier. This study also explored whether NBP participation reduced the relations between young adults' painful feelings about divorce and their concurrent internalizing, externalizing, and substance use problems. Participants (M = 25.6 years; 50% female; 88% Caucasian) were from 240 families that had been recruited into a randomized experimental trial (NBP vs. literature control). Data from the pretest and 15-year follow-up were used. NBP participants reported less feelings of seeing life through a filter of divorce (e.g., thinking about how the divorce causes continued struggles for them) than those in the control condition. Program effects on maternal blame and acceptance of the divorce were moderated by pretest risk, a composite of divorce-related stressors and externalizing problems. NBP participants with elevated risk at program entry had lower levels of maternal blame. Program participation was associated with higher acceptance for those with elevated risk at program entry but lower acceptance for those with low risk at program entry. Program participation decreased the relations between maternal blame, acceptance of the divorce and filter of divorce and some, but not all, of the adjustment outcomes. These findings suggest that programs designed to help families after divorce have benefits in terms of long-term feelings about parental divorce as well as their relations with adjustment problems.

AB When married parents go through a divorce, they may have concerns in 6 areas that are associated with postdivorce family adjustment. These include concerns about malice, power, custody, child rejection, esteem, and finances. The Parting Parent Concern Inventory assesses these concerns. It was developed in a series of preliminary studies, and this report focuses on results from 2 subsequent validation studies including 643 divorced parents with at least 1 child from their former marriage under the age of 18. Participants completed Internet assessments of their concerns and 14 different convergent validity criterion variables regarding aspects of child internalizing behavior, coparenting relationships, settlement outcomes, and personal well-being. Across both studies, the new measure of concerns fit an expected 6-dimensional factor structure. A total of 25 convergent validity correlations were tested, and all were significant. The distinctiveness of each concern scale was supported by the fact that all but 1 convergent association remained significant after controlling for variance explained by other concern scales. These results provide preliminary validation support for the new instrument.

AB This study, involving a community-based sample of 45 predominantly white primary caregivers of 45 trans and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) children between 6 and 12 years of age, provides descriptive data on children's gender presentations, peer relations, and well-being. Most (n = 31; 69%) of the children were cross-gender identified (CGI). That is, 17 of 28 children assigned male at birth explicitly and consistently identified as girls, and 14 of 17 children assigned female at birth explicitly and consistently identified as boys. The 14 remaining children appeared to have nonbinary gender identities (e.g., "boy-girl") or to identify with the sex and gender they were assigned at birth but were gender-nonconforming, or their gender identities were uncertain. This subgroup was labeled non-CGI. Most of the children were in the normal range for internalizing (64%), externalizing (67%), and total behavior problems (62%), yet a sizable minority were in the borderline-clinical/clinical range for these symptoms. Children in the CGI group had fewer internalizing and total problems than children in the non-CGI group. Child's degree of gender conformity, caregiver's level of anxiety, and child's peer relations were correlated with children's well-being; children in the CGI group were reported to have better peer relations than children in the non-CGI group. Caregivers' rates of depression and anxiety appeared to be similar to normative samples, although anxiety may have been slightly elevated. Findings from this study add to a small but growing body of literature that documents the well-being of TGNC children growing up in supportive and affirming familial environments.

AB Clinical assessment of anxiety in adolescents often involves multiple informants, and parental internalizing symptoms have been found to influence parent ratings of adolescents' anxiety symptoms. We investigated how parental internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) were related to adolescent and parent reports of adolescents' anxiety symptoms in a population-based cross-sectional survey. The sample comprised 337 adolescent-mother-father triads (N = 1,011) drawn from the Tracking Opportunities and Problems in Childhood and Adolescence (TOPP) study. Adolescents (43.9% boys) were 4- and 15-years old. Adolescent and parent ratings of adolescent anxiety symptoms (The Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory for Children) were moderately and significantly correlated (mother-adolescent r = .30; father-adolescent r = .25). Parents also self-rated internalizing symptoms (Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25). Regression models showed higher maternal and paternal depression symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms, were associated with higher parent-rated adolescent anxiety symptoms. Higher maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as paternal depression symptoms, but not paternal anxiety symptoms, were associated with lower parent-adolescent agreement on adolescent anxiety symptoms (i.e., parent-rating higher relative to adolescent-rating). When adolescents rate considerably lower anxiety compared with how their parents rate them, considering parental depression as a possible reason may be key to understanding adolescents' treatment needs.

AB Many individuals in the general population experience psychotic-like experiences in the absence of a psychotic disorder. The degree of psychological distress associated with these experiences is a key predictor of clinical outcomes. One factor that may influence the degree of distress from psychotic-like experiences is emotion regulation. Although it has been demonstrated that emotion regulation deficits are present in psychotic disorders, the association between emotion regulation and subclinical psychotic-like experiences is not well understood. Here, we examined the associations between frequency of and distress from psychotic-like experiences and several key components of emotion regulation: difficulties with emotion regulation; emotion regulation self efficacy; and emotion regulation strategy use. Difficulties with emotion regulation and maladaptive patterns of emotion regulation strategy use were associated with the frequency of both positive and negative psychotic-like experiences. In addition, results suggest that habitual acceptance use and reappraisal self-efficacy may serve as protective factors against the distress associated with psychotic-like experiences.

AB This study analyzes how a child's clinical condition modifies the relationship of father involvement, parental (fathers and mothers) acceptance and the child's psychological adjustment, including the internalizing and externalizing problems. The cohort studied was composed of 226 subjects (61.94% males) with a mean age of 14.08 years, of which 113 children were from an incidental clinical sample and 113 from the general population. Both groups were matched by sex, age and family status, and the data show that the same structure of parent child relationships that predict the child's psychological adjustment can be accepted for both the clinical and non-clinical groups of children. However, the intensity of the relationships between the variables father involvement, parental acceptance and the child's outcomes differed in function of the child's clinical status. Specifically, in the clinically-referred sample compared to non-clinical sample father involvement had a stronger effect on the children's internalizing (but not the externalizing) problems and on their global psychological adjustment via their perceived maternal acceptance. The role of father involvement in the family relationships of clinical children is discussed. This study provides important evidence to support the need for enhanced paternal participation in the intervention programs for families.

AB This study used an emotional go/no-go task to explore inhibitory spillover (how intentional cognitive inhibition `spills over' to inhibit neural responses to affective stimuli) within 23 adolescents. Adolescents were shown emotional faces and asked to press a button depending on the gender of the face. When asked to inhibit with irrelevant affective stimuli present, adolescents recruited prefrontal cognitive control regions (rIFG, ACC) and ventral affective areas (insula, amygdala). In support of the inhibitory spillover hypothesis, increased activation of the rIFG and down-regulation of the amygdala occurred during negative, but not positive, inhibition trials compared with go trials. Functional connectivity analysis revealed coupling of the rIFG pars opercularis and ventral affective areas during negative no-go trials. Age was negatively associated with activation in frontal and temporal regions associated with inhibition and sensory integration. Internalizing symptoms were positively associated with increased bilateral IFG, ACC, putamen and pallidum. This is the first study to test the inhibitory spillover emotional go/no-go task within adolescents, who may have difficulties with inhibitory control, and to tie it to internalizing symptoms.

AB The research carried out in the last years outlined that childbirth could be considered as a sufficient stressor for the insurgence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms with important consequences for the child care.
   In a longitudinal perspective, this study focused on PTS symptoms after childbirth to understand their impact on maternal parenting stress and children's adjustment. First, we investigated whether childbirth-related PTS symptoms, at 87 h and 3 months postpartum, were associated with parenting stress and children's adjustment at 18 months. Second, we explored, at 18 months, the predictive effects of postpartum PTS symptoms on children's adjustment and verified the mediational effect of parenting stress this association.
   Eighty-eight women participated and completed the following questionnaires: PPQ (for assessing maternal PTS symptoms at 87 h, 3 and 18 months postpartum), PSI-SF (for maternal parenting stress at 18 months) and CBCL (for children's adjustment at 18 months).
   Findings outlined that more PTS symptoms at 3 months are associated with greater levels of parental distress and they predicted children's adjustment at 18 monthmps. Moreover, maternal parenting stress explained the predictive effects of childbirth-related PTS sytoms on children's adjustment. More precisely parental distress partially mediated the association between PTS symptoms and children's internalizing behaviors, while the perception of the difficult child fully mediated the effects of PTS symptoms on externalizing behaviors.
   This study was consistent with the idea that women may experience childbirth-related chronic distress and child adjustment was connected to different sources of parenting stress.

   To test associations between food insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, and behavior problems among younger and older rural low-income children.
   Cross-sectional data from 370 low-income rural families across 13 states was analyzed using structural equation modeling and multiple group analyses. Mothers' education level, household income, marital/partner status, and participation in SNAP served as covariates.
   Among younger children, maternal depressive symptoms older children, maternal depressive symptoms completely mediated the relation between foodpartially mediated the relation between food insecurity and child externalizing behaviors, while among insecurity and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
   Stress manifested directly from, or indirectly through, maternal depressive symptoms and from food insecurity was related to behavior problems among younger and older rural children; however, the relations varied by age of children. Programs and policies that prevent or lessen both food insecurity and maternal depression may help to lessen problem behaviors among on rural children. Longitudinal studies are needed to rigorously examine causation and directionality among food insecurity, maternal depression and rural child behavior problems, while accounting for influences of child, caregiver and family characteristics.

AB Purpose of Review Since 1980, posttraumatic stress (PTS) disorder has been controversial because of its origin as a social construct, its discriminating trauma definition, and the Procrustean array of symptoms/clusters chosen for inclusion/ exclusion. This review summarizes the history of traumarelated nosology and proposed changes, within current categorical models (trauma definitions, symptoms/clusters, subtypes/ specifiers, disorders) and new models.
   Recent Findings Considering that trauma is a risk factor for virtually all mental disorders (particularly depressive, anxiety, dissociative, personality), the multi-finality of trauma (some survivors are resilient, and some develop PTS and/or non-PTS symptoms), and the various symptoms that trauma survivors express (mood, cognitive, perceptual, somatic), it is difficult to classify PTS.
   Summary Because the human mind best comprehends categories, reliable classification generally necessitates using a categorical nosology but PTS defies categories (internalizing and/or externalizing, fear-based and/or numbing symptoms), the authors conclude that PTS-like DSM-5' s panic attacks specifier-is currently best conceptualized as a specifier for other mental disorders.

AB This study investigated heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories of internalizing symptoms among 541 children who were involved with the child welfare system and examined child maltreatment characteristics, including types, level of harm, and timing, as predictors of internalizing trajectory patterns. Secondary longitudinal research was conducted using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being-I, collected from 1999 to 2007 in the United States. Three distinct trajectory groups were identified: high decreasing; low increasing; and low stable Sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and more severe levels of harm from maltreatment predicted membership in two maladaptive groups compared to the low stable group. The findings of the study suggest the importance of providing a thorough assessment of the type and severity of maltreatment experiences and continued monitoring of internalizing symptoms for children with child welfare involvement.

AB Very little research has been conducted on the role of childhood adversity in child-to-parent violence. Childhood adversity places youth at risk for internalizing behaviors (i.e. anxiety and depression) and externalizing behaviors (i.e. aggression). The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between childhood adversity, child mother attachment, and internalizing behaviors among a sample of 80 youth who have been arrested for domestic battery against a mother. This study reported high prevalence rates of childhood adversity (mean score of 10 out of 17 events). Multiple regression analysis indicated that insecure attachment predicted depression among females (F(6, 73) = 4.87, p < 0.001), and previous experience with child maltreatment and/or witness to parental violence predicted anxiety among females (F(6, 73) = 3.08, p < 0.01). This study is the first study to explore childhood adversity among a sample of perpetrators of child-to-mother violence and notably adds to our understanding of the multiple pathways connecting childhood adversity, child mother attachment, and depression and anxiety among a difficult to treat youth population.

AB Background: Maternal depression impacts on several detrimental outcomes during a child's life course, and could increase their risk of victimization. This longitudinal study examined the association between antenatal maternal depression, postnatal trajectories, and current maternal depression and offspring bullying victimization at 11 years.
   Methods: We included 3,441 11-year-old adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Cohort Study. Antenatal maternal depression, postnatal trajectories, and current maternal depression data were assessed during the follow-up waves. Bullying victimization was self-reported by the adolescents. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the association between maternal depression and offspring bullying victimization.
   Results: The most prevalent type of bullying was verbal victimization (37.9%). We observed a positive association between antenatal maternal depression, postnatal trajectories, and current maternal depression and physical bullying victimization. Maternal mood symptoms during pregnancy were associated with physical (OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.11-1.53), verbal (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.12-1.49), and any victimization (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 1.05-1.41). Severe current maternal depression was associated with physical (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.10-1.62), social manipulation (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.08-1.53), attacks on property (OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.08-1.57) and any victimization (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.12-1.56). Regarding maternal depression trajectories, the "chronic-high" group was associated with higher risk of social manipulation, attacks on property and any victimization, than the "low" group.
   Conclusions: Our results strengthen the evidence of association between maternal depression and offspring bullying victimization, and physical victimization appears to be the main component. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to elucidate the theoretical pathways for this longitudinal association.

AB Background: Separation anxiety disorder is the most prevalent childhood anxiety condition, but no study assessed children for separation anxiety at preschool age and followed them longitudinally and directly until mid-childhood/early adolescence.
   Methods: Multi-informant (children, teachers, family), multipoint (at age 8, 10, 12, 13) assessments of 1,290 children of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, who had been categorized between age 1.5 and 6 into four specific separation anxiety trajectories (1, low-persistent; 2, low-increasing; 3, high-decreasing, and the less common: 4, high-increasing) by growth mixture modeling. Participants in the high-increasing trajectory were compared to participants in the other three trajectories for: (a) child's internalizing and externalizing problem behavior; (b) physical health; (c) academic achievement; (d) maternal anxiety.
   Results: Multivariate analyses of variance/covariance at separate time points showed the high-increasing trajectory mostly associated with: (a) higher internalizing, but not externalizing, behavior; (b) worse academic achievement (most consistently by comparisons to the normative low-persistent trajectory; (c) higher rates of maternal panic/agoraphobic anxiety; (d) worse physical health (most consistently by comparisons to the low-persistent trajectory). The high-increasing trajectory had twofold to threefold higher incidences of physical illnesses than the normative low-persistent group; this was specific for headaches at age 12 years, chronic asthma at age 10 and 13, and having received asthma-related medication during the past 12 months.
   Conclusions: High-increasing separation anxiety in preschool maintains longitudinal relationships to independent health and academic outcomes, at least until preadolescence. This knowledge can inform the deployment of clinical resources at the earlier signs of the more impairing manifestations.

AB Poor physiological self-regulation has been proposed as a potential biological vulnerability for adolescent suicidality. This study tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of parasympathetic stress responses on future suicide ideation. In addition, drawing from multilevel developmental psychopathology theories, the interplay between parasympathetic regulation and friendship support, conceptualized as an external source of regulation, was examined. At baseline, 132 adolescent females (M age = 14.59, SD = 1.39) with a history of mental health concerns participated in an in vivo interpersonal stressor (a laboratory speech task) and completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms and perceived support within a close same-age female friendship. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured before and during the speech task. Suicide ideation was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 9 months follow-up. The results revealed that females with greater relative RSA decreases to the laboratory stressor were at higher risk for reporting suicide ideation over the subsequent 9 months. Moreover, parasympathetic responses moderated the effect of friendship support on suicide ideation; among females with mild changes or higher relative increases in RSA, but not more pronounced RSA decreases, friendship support reduced risk for future suicide ideation. Findings highlight the crucial role of physiological and external regulation sources as protective factors for youth suicidality.

AB Longitudinal bidirectional effects between parents and children are usually studied in samples of typically developing children, but remain understudied in families with a child with autism spectrum disorder. This three-wave longitudinal study examined how parents and children with autism spectrum disorder influence one another, relying on parent reports of parenting behaviors and children's problem behaviors across 9 years, in a sample of 139 youngsters (M age Time 1 = 10.2 years, 83% boys). Cross-lagged analyses indicated that children's externalizing problems at Time 1 predicted negative controlling parenting 6 years later (Time 2) that in turn predicted externalizing problems 3 years later (Time 3). Negative parental control at Time 1 also increased the risk for internalizing problems at Time 2. It was surprising that externalizing problems at Time 2 also predicted positive parental involvement at Time 3. Thus, although results indicate that externalizing problems generally elicit maladaptive reactions in parents, this study also suggests that parents adjust their way of reacting to externalizing child problems as their child reaches adolescence/emerging adulthood. Implications for future research on parenting dynamics in families with a child with autism spectrum disorder are discussed.

AB Prenatal exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) has been associated with different neurodevelopmental outcomes across different cohorts. A phenotypic approach may address some of these differences by incorporating information across scales and accounting for the complex correlational structure of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additionally, Bayesian hierarchical modeling can account for confounding by collinear co exposures. We use this framework to examine associations between prenatal exposure to OPs and behavior, executive functioning, and IQ assessed at age 6-9 years in a cohort of 404 mother/infant pairs recruited during pregnancy. We derived phenotypes of neurodevelopment with a factor analysis, and estimated associations between OP metabolites and these phenotypes in Bayesian hierarchical models for exposure mixtures. We report seven factors: 1) Impulsivity and Externalizing, 2) Executive Functioning, 3) Internalizing, 4) Perceptual Reasoning, 5) Adaptability, 6) Processing Speed, and 7) Verbal Intelligence. These, along with the Working Memory Index, were standardized and scaled so that positive values reflected positive attributes and negative values represented adverse outcomes. Standardized dimethylphosphate metabolites were negatively associated with Internalizing factor scores ((beta) over cap - 0.13, 95% CI - 0.26, 0.00) but positively associated with Executive Functioning factor scores ((beta) over cap 0.18, 95% CI 0.04, 0.31). Standardized diethylphosphate metabolites were negatively associated with the Working Memory Index ((beta) over cap - 0.17, 95% CI - 0.33, - 0.03). Associations with factor scores were generally stronger and more precise than associations with individual instrument-specific items. Factor analysis of outcomes may provide some advantages in etiological studies of childhood neurodevelopment by incorporating information across scales to reduce dimensionality and improve precision.

AB The present study aimed to advance insight into similarities and dissimilarities between teachers' and students' views of closeness and conflict in their dyadic relationship, and personal teacher and student attributes that contribute to these views. In total, 464 students (50.2% girls) and 62 teachers (67.5% females) from grades 4 to 6 participated in this study. Teachers filled out questionnaires about their background characteristics, self-efficacy (TSES), and student-teacher relationship perceptions (STRS) and students answered questions about their demographics and the student-teacher relationship quality (SPARTS). Peer-nominations were used to measure students' internalizing and externalizing behavior. Tests for measurement invariance suggested that the conflict and closeness constructs both approximated similarity across students and teachers. Multilevel structural equation models furthermore indicated that students' relationship perceptions, and conflict in particular, were predicted by their own gender, socioeconomic status, and internalizing and externalizing behavior. Additionally, teaching experience negatively predicted students' perceived conflicts. Teachers' relationship perceptions were both predicted by their own characteristics (teaching experience) and student features (gender, socioeconomic status, and externalizing behavior). These predictors explained between 39% and 61% of the variance in student- and teacher-perceived closeness and conflict. Last, teachers' general self efficacy was positively associated with mean levels of closeness, and negatively associated with mean levels of conflict across student-teacher dyads.

AB Objective: To examine the effect of universal, school based, resilience-focused interventions on mental health problems in children and adolescents.
   Method: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of universal, school-based interventions that included strategies to strengthen a minimum of 3 internal resilience protective factors, and included an outcome measure of mental health problems in children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 years. Six databases were searched from 1995 to 2015. Results were pooled in meta-analyses by mental health outcome (anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, hyperactivity, conduct problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress), for all trials (5-18 years). Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (child: 5-10 years; adolescent: 11-18 years), length of follow-up (short: post <= 12 months; long: >12 months), and gender (narrative).
   Results: A total of 57 included trials were identified from 5,984 records, with 49 contributing to meta-analyses. For all trials, resilience-focused interventions were effective relative to a control in reducing 4 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress. For child trials (meta-analyses for 6 outcomes), interventions were effective for anxiety symptoms and general psychological distress. For adolescent trials (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. For short-term follow-up, interventions were effective for 2 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For long-term follow-up (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems.
   Conclusion: The findings may suggest most promise for using universal resilience-focused interventions at least for short-term reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms for children and adolescents, particularly if a cognitive-behavioral therapy based approach is used. The limited number of trials providing data amenable for meta-analysis for some outcomes and subgroups, the variability of interventions, study quality, and bias mean that it is not possible to draw more specific conclusions. Identifying what intervention qualities (such as number and type of protective factor) achieve the greatest positive effect per mental health problem outcome remains an important area for future research.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of clinical and psychological factors on the self-concept of children and adolescents with epilepsy.
   Methods: Children and adolescents with epilepsy (n=60; age range=9-17 years) completed questionnaires about their epilepsy-related variables, self-concept, depressive symptoms, anxiety, family functions, and behavioral problems. The T-test and one-way analysis of variance were used to examine the variables affecting the total self-concept scores. To determine the independent variables by adjusting the significant variables, a stepwise regression analysis was performed.
   Results: In the correlational analysis, age, depressive symptoms, anxiety, social problems, attention problems, and internalizing problems had significantly negative correlations with self-concept. On the other hand, IQ and family functions showed positive correlations with selfconcept. Age (beta=-0.177, p=0.015), depressive symptoms (beta=-0.487, p< 0.001), anxiety (beta=-0.298, p=0.008), and attention problems (beta=-0.138, p=0.048) were analyzed as independent factors to assess their impact on self-concept, and were found to account for 78.3% of the variance in self-concept by stepwise regression analysis.
   Conclusion: Parents and clinicians should pay attention to improving the self-concept of children and adolescents with epilepsy, especially if they have problems with depression, anxiety, or attention.

AB The present study examined psychological and psychopathological correlates of psychological inflexibility as measured by the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y) in two independent samples of nonclinical Dutch adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years (Ns being 184 and 157). Participants completed a survey containing the AFQ-Y and scales assessing mindfulness, thought suppression, self-compassion, self-worth, self-efficacy, and internalizing/externalizing symptoms. In both samples, the AFQ-Y was found to be a reliable measure of psychological inflexibility that correlated in a theoretically meaningful way with other psychological constructs. Most importantly, AFQ-Y scores correlated positively with internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and in most cases, these associations remained significant when controlling for other measures. These findings suggest that psychological inflexibility is an important factor in youth psychopathology that needs to be further investigated in future research.

AB The interrelationship between stigma and help-seeking is under-researched among children and adolescents. This study explored stigma in relation to pathways to care among young people putatively in an early stage of increased risk of developing psychotic disorders. "Pathways to care" was defined as help-seeking and support from informal and formal resources, and increased risk was determined through the presence of persistent psychotic-like experiences and internalizing/externalizing psychopathology. Twenty-nine qualitative interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. We defined the superordinate theme in these data as "conditional disclosure," a concept reflecting the rules and prerequisites that influenced how/whether participants sought help. Through parallels between these findings and established stigma theory, we examined how these conditions could be interpreted as influenced by stigma. Our findings demonstrate the influence of stigma on young people's perceptions of a range of pre-clinical symptoms, and on how they seek support for these symptoms.

AB The main aim of the current study was to test the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis across internalizing and externalizing problems in Chinese adolescents. The participants consisted of 2,158 adolescents aged 11-19 years from three middle schools, and they completed a number of measures assessing a wide range of automatic thoughts and syndromes related to internalizing and externalizing problems. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that thoughts about social threats, personal failure and hostility were the strongest predictors of anxiety, depression, and externalizing problems, respectively. Age was a statistically significant, albeit modest, moderator of the relationship between automatic thoughts about social threat and anxiety. The current study provides support for the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis in internalizing and externalizing problems in a Chinese sample.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) was introduced in 1980s in the field of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies indicate that symptoms of SCT are separate from symptoms of ADHD and independently associated with multiple domains of functioning in clinical groups and in typical development. We assessed whether similar pattern would apply to higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Children with higher functioning ASD (N = 55; 5-15 years) were divided into the ASD+High SCT (n = 17), the ASD+Medium SCT (n = 18) and the ASD+Low SCT (n = 20) groups based on parent-rated daydreaming and slowness on the Five to Fifteen questionnaire (FTF). The groups were compared on SCT-related impairments found in previous studies: social skills, academic functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and processing speed. Assessment methods were the FTF, the Development and Well-Being Assessment, and the Coding subtest of the WISC-III. The ADHD symptoms were statistically controlled due to the overlap between SCT and ADHD. The ASD+High SCT and ASD+Medium SCT groups were significantly more likely to have the most pronounced social impairments, and the ASD+High SCT group had significantly higher rate of internalizing disorders compared to the ASD+Low SCT group. Our results suggest that children with higher functioning ASD and high or medium levels of SCT symptoms could be at higher risk for psychosocial impairments than children with higher functioning ASD with low levels of SCT symptoms. Co-occurring ADHD symptoms do not explain the finding. Recognizing SCT symptoms in higher functioning ASD would be important to targeting preventive support.

   ADOLESCENTS; CHILDHOOD; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB Specific phobias (SPs) are characterized by excessive fear or anxiety regarding an object or situation. SPs often result in a host of negative outcomes in childhood and beyond. Children with SPs are broadly assumed to show dispositional over-regulation and fearfulness relative to children without SPs, but there are few attempts to distinguish dispositional patterns among children with SPs. In the present study, we examined trajectories of differing temperamental profiles for youth receiving a CBT-based treatment for their SP. Participants were 117 treatment seeking youth (M Age = 8.77 years, Age Range = 6-15 years; 54.7% girls) who met criteria for a SP and their mothers. Three temperament profiles emerged and were conceptually similar to previously supported profiles: well-adjusted; inhibited; and under-controlled. While all groups showed similarly robust reductions in SP severity following treatment, differences among the three groups emerged in terms of broader internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and global outlook. The well-adjusted group was higher in functioning initially than the other two groups. The inhibited group had initial disadvantages in initial internalizing symptoms. The under-controlled group showed greatest comorbidity risks and had initial disadvantages in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These distinct clusters represent considerable heterogeneity within a clinical sample of youth with SP who are often assumed to have homogenous behavior tendencies of inhibition and fearfulness. Findings suggest that considering patterns of temperament among children with phobias could assist treatment planning and inform ongoing refinements to improve treatment response.

AB The negative effects of displacement and poverty on child mental health are well-known, yet research on prevention interventions in low- and middle-income countries, especially fragile states, remains limited. We examined the effectiveness of a parenting skills intervention on mental health outcomes among Burmese migrant and displaced children living in 20 communities in Thailand. Participants were primary caregivers and children aged 7 to 15 years (n = 479 families). Families were randomly assigned to receive an adapted version of the Strengthening Families Program (n = 240) or a wait-list control condition (n = 239). Assessments were conducted at baseline and 1-month post-intervention for both conditions and at 6 months for treatment group only. One month after the program, children in the treatment condition showed significant reductions in externalizing problems (caregiver effect size (ES) -0.22, p = 0.02; child report ES -0.11, p = 0.02) and child attention problems compared with controls (caregiver report ES -0.23, p = 0.03). There was no significant treatment effect on children's internalizing problems (ES -0.06; p = 0.31). Children reported a significant increase in prosocial protective factors relative to controls (ES 0.20, p < 0.01). Results suggest that an evidence-based parenting skills intervention adapted for a displaced and migrant Burmese population facing high levels of adversity can have positive effects on children's externalizing symptoms and protective psychosocial factors.

AB We investigated academic and behavioral outcomes of internationally adopted children and the associations between these outcomes and age at adoption, time spent in the adoptive family, and parenting. At two time points (T1 and T2, similar to 15 months apart), we examined early academic skills (school readiness), and parent-reported behavioral adjustment (internalizing and externalizing behavior) and adaptive functioning of a sample of 75 children (45.9% boys, mean age = 5.17 years) adopted from Russia into US families. We also collected parents' self-assessments of their parenting at T1. Children who were adopted at a younger age showed higher levels of early academic skills. Correlations between age at adoption and other outcomes were overall small and mostly non-significant. However, adoptees' academic and behavioral progress differed notably in several respects. Specifically, adoptees improved in early academic skills over time, whereas, as a group, their adaptive functioning and behavioral adjustment remained stable within the normal range. Early academic skills were not related to behavioral adjustment at each time point and over time. The time spent in the adoptive family was positively related to early academic skills at T2. Whereas outcomes showed little to no relation to parenting as reported by mother and father separately, higher discrepancies between mothers' and fathers' reports of positive parenting were related to higher levels of behavioral symptoms and lower levels of adaptive skills at T2. These differential results may be explained in part by drawing upon the notion of dissociated domains of psychological and sociocultural adaptation and acculturation, outlined in the immigration literature. These results also bring to light the possible importance of between-parent consistency in parenting for adoptees' behavioral outcomes.

AB This study investigated the multigenerational impact of mothers' own exposure to physical maltreatment on internalizing symptoms in her child after accounting for her parenting practices, depression, and the child's own exposure to stressful life events. Children (n = 101, ages 5-16), predominantly African American, were recruited into this cross sectional study using ethnographic mapping and targeted sampling for high-risk neighborhoods. Mothers reported retrospectively on their own exposure to physical maltreatment in childhood, their parenting practices, as well as current depressive symptoms. Maternal report of her child's exposure to stressful life events and child behavior was also collected. Maternal childhood exposure to physical maltreatment was significantly associated with her child's internalizing symptoms (p = .004); this effect remained after accounting for child sex, maternal depressive symptoms, harsh parenting practices, and the child's own exposure to stressful life events. Formal tests of mediation through these pathways were non-significant. Findings suggest mothers' experience of childhood maltreatment contributes uniquely to children's internalizing symptoms, potentially through previously uncharacterized pathways. Examination of additional behavioral, psychosocial and biological pathways may help better describe the multi-generational effects of child maltreatment.

AB Children's difficulties managing emotions are contributors to their behavior problems, and parents' emotion regulation difficulties are also likely contributors to their children's regulatory challenges and behavioral difficulties. This study examined the associations among mothers' emotion regulation, children's emotion regulation, and children's behavior problems. Children's emotion regulation difficulties were hypothesized to mediate the association between maternal difficulties with emotion regulation and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. A sample of 454 mothers completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Emotion Regulation Checklist, and the Child Behavior Checklist for their children aged 3-7. Children's emotion regulation difficulties accounted for the indirect association between mothers' lower emotion awareness and both internalizing and externalizing problems. On the other hand, children's emotional negativity accounted for the indirect association between mothers' difficulties with emotion regulation and behavior problems. Future directions for research and clinical intervention focused on promoting parental and child emotion regulation are discussed.

AB Using life-course longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS), we examined ethnic differences in rates of psychiatric disorder among New Zealand adolescents, comparing New Zealand MAori to their European peers. The CHDS includes a large birth cohort of New Zealand children who have been regularly assessed throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Ethnicity (New Zealand MAori vs. non-MAori) was assessed at age 14 years. Internalizing and externalizing disorders were assessed at age 15, 16, and 18 years. A diverse range of risk factors were included to test if differences in mental health difficulties were explained by greater exposure to early life-course challenges. We found significant differences in rates of mental disorder during adolescence between New Zealand MAori and non-MAori, but these differences were largely explained by early developmental challenges and adolescent peer affiliations. Differences across the two ethnic groups in rates of internalizing disorders were explained by the increased exposure amongst MAori to socioeconomic disadvantage during childhood, while differences in externalizing disorders were explained by greater exposure amongst MAori to childhood family adversity and deviant peer affiliation during adolescence. The findings point to the significant influence of cumulative early life-course risk factors in accounting for the ethnic differences between MAori and non-MAori in the development of adolescent internalizing and externalizing disorders.

AB Researches on associations between phthalates exposure and child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are inconsistent. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of urinary phthalates with ADHD, co-occurring oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), related symptoms and behavior problems among Chinese children. We enrolled 225 ADHD cases and 225 healthy controls aged 6-13 years old in Liuzhou, China. Each child provided repeated urine samples at 4 visits. Eight phthalate metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Child ADHD symptoms and related behaviors were assessed using Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Version IV scale and child behavior checklist. Higher urinary concentrations of mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate (MEHP) were dose-dependently associated with ADHD [odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 2.35 to 3.04 for the highest vs. the lowest tertile] and co-occurring ODD (ORs ranged from 3.27 to 4.44 for the highest vs. the lowest tertile) in the multivariable logistic regression models (all p for trend <= 0.01), which were consistent with positive trends of increased scores of inattention domain, hyperactive domain and ODD symptoms (all p for trend <= 0.01). Besides, the monomethyl phthalate (MMP) concentration was associated with higher scores of inattention domain and ODD symptoms (both p < 0.05). Additionally, the MEHHP, MEOHP and MEHP concentrations were related to child attention problems, aggressive behaviors and externalizing behaviors (all p < 0.05). We also observed positive associations of the MEHP concentration with depressed behaviors and internalizing behaviors (all p < 0.05). Our results indicate that child exposure to phthalates may contribute to ADHD, ODD and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about the role of stress reactivity in the emergence of psychopathology across early childhood. In this longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that child cortisol reactivity at age 3 moderates associations between early parenting and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms from age 3 to age 6. One hundred and sixty children were assessed at age 3, and 135 children were reassessed at age 6. At age 3, we exposed children to stress-inducing laboratory tasks, during which we obtained four salivary cortisol samples, and parental hostility was assessed using an observational parent-child interaction task. At ages 3 and 6, child psychiatric symptoms were assessed using a clinical interview with parents. The results indicated that the combination of high child cortisol reactivity and high observed parental hostility at age 3 was associated with greater concurrent externalizing symptoms at age 3 and predicted increases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms from age 3 to age 6. Findings highlight that increased stress reactivity, within the context of hostile parenting, plays a role in the emergence of psychopathology from preschool to school entry.

AB This study used four waves of data from a longitudinal study of 749 Mexican origin youths to test a developmental cascades model linking contextual adversity in the family and peer domains in late childhood to a sequence of unfolding processes hypothesized to predict problem substance use and risky sexual activity (greater number of sex partners) in late adolescence. Externalizing and internalizing problems were tested as divergent pathways, with youth-reported and mother-reported symptoms examined in separate models. Youth gender, nativity, and cultural orientation were tested as moderators. Family risk, peer social rejection, and their interaction were prospectively related to externalizing symptoms and deviant peer involvement, although family risk showed stronger effects on parent-reported externalizing and peer social rejection showed stronger effects on youth-reported externalizing. Externalizing symptoms and deviant peers were related, in turn, to risk taking in late adolescence, including problem alcohol-substance use and number of sexual partners. Peer social rejection predicted youth-reported internalizing symptoms, and internalizing was related, in turn, to problem alcohol and substance use in late adolescence. Tests of moderation showed some of these developmental cascades were stronger for adolescents who were female, less oriented to mainstream cultural values, and more oriented to Mexican American cultural values.

AB The current study examines the relation between distress tolerance, perceived stress, and internalizing symptoms across adolescence. Participants included 331 youth, ages 10 to 14 at the first wave of the study, assessed annually over 5 years. A latent growth curve approach was used to test three research questions, including whether perceived stress would increase across adolescence, whether distress tolerance (as measured by a behavioral task) would predict changes in perceived stress, and whether changes in perceived stress would mediate the relation between distress tolerance and internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that, consistent with previous findings, rates of perceived stress do increase across adolescence. Further, findings indicate that distress intolerance at baseline predicted increases in perceived stress, which in turn drove increases in internalizing symptoms. These findings point to the critical role of distress tolerance in bringing about changes in depression and anxiety symptoms and suggest support for utilizing a negative reinforcement framework to understand the emergence of internalizing symptomology.

AB This study examined the independent and interactive contributions of maternal depression and youth stress responses to trajectories of youth depression in adolescence. Youths (n = 165, M age = 12.43, SD = 1.18) and their maternal caregivers participated in a 4-year longitudinal study. Mothers and youths were administered diagnostic interviews assessing depression, and youths provided reports of their responses to peer stress. Consistent with an interactive model, adaptive responses to stress (high effortful engagement and low involuntary disengagement) buffered the effect of maternal depression on initial levels and trajectories of youth depression, with gender differences emerging. Consistent with a dual-risk model, maternal depression and maladaptive responses to stress (high effortful disengagement and involuntary engagement) contributed additive risks such that youths displayed the highest levels of depression when they were exposed to maternal depression and showed maladaptive stress responses. This research provides novel evidence that responses to stress contribute to individual differences in depression among offspring of depressed mothers, and suggests that responses to stress are an important target for efforts to promote resilience in at-risk youth.

AB Alcohol use disorders and internalizing disorders are highly comorbid, but how this comorbidity unfolds over development is not well understood. The present study investigated effects of internalizing symptoms in late childhood on speed of transition between three alcohol involvement milestones: first drink, first binge, and onset of first alcohol dependence symptom. Greater early internalizing symptoms were expected to predict a later age of first drink, a slower transition from first drink to first binge, and a faster transition from first binge to first dependence symptom. The effects of age and moderating effects of gender were also examined. Data were from a longitudinal study of children of alcoholics and matched controls (N = 454) followed from late childhood to midlife. Generally, stage-specific hypotheses were not supported; rather, greater internalizing symptoms predicted an earlier age of first drink and a faster transition through the full interval from first drink to first dependence symptom. Regarding gender moderation, internalizing significantly predicted a faster transition between each milestone as well as through the full interval among women but not men. These results suggest that early internalizing problems confer risk for a rapid transition through all stages of alcohol involvement, and this risk may be limited to women.

AB The link between parental depressive history and parenting styles is well established, as is the association of parenting with child psychopathology. However, little research has examined whether a depressive history in one parent predicts the parenting style of the other parent. As well, relatively little research has tested transactional models of the parenting-child psychopathology relationship in the context of parents' depressive histories. In this study, mothers and fathers of 392 children were assessed for a lifetime history of major depression when their children were 3 years old. They then completed measures of permissiveness and authoritarianism and their child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms when children were 3, 6, and 9 years old. The results showed that a depressive history in one parent predicted the other parent's permissiveness. Analyses then showed that child externalizing symptoms at age 3 predicted maternal permissiveness and authoritarianism and paternal permissiveness at age 6. Maternal permissiveness at age 6 predicted child externalizing symptoms at age 9. No relationships in either direction were found between parenting styles and child internalizing symptoms. The results highlight the importance of considering both parents' depressive histories when understanding parenting styles, and support transactional models of parenting styles and child externalizing symptoms.

AB The Program for the Evaluation of the Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS), a social skills intervention for high functioning adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has been proven efficacious in randomized control trials. However, the effectiveness of the PEERS program in community settings has not been studied. The present small-scale pilot study examined the effectiveness of the PEERS program in a community setting. Five adolescents and their caregivers participated in the PEERS intervention. Results indicated that the adolescents showed significant improvement in their social engagement, social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and knowledge of PEERS skills and concepts from pre- to post-intervention. Furthermore, adolescents showed significant reductions in their internalizing and autistic symptoms from pre- to post-intervention. The findings from this small-scale pilot study support the effectiveness of the PEERS program in community-based settings.

AB Numerous studies suggested an association between childhood adversities and later increased risk for mental illness. However, most studies have used adults' retrospective self-reports for assessing adverse childhood experiences. Mechanisms underlying the association between childhood adversities and later psychopathology are not yet well understood. In the Mannheim Study of Children at Risk, we prospectively examined the impact of early psychosocial risks on psychopathology in early adulthood. In addition, we tested the mediating role of childhood affective and behavioral dysregulation. In a total of 384 infants from the Rhine-Neckar region of Germany born between 1986 and 1988, the presence of 11 adverse family factors was assessed by use of a standardized parent interview conducted when the child was 3 months old. At the child's age of 8, 11, and 15 years, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL-Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) was formed by summing up the scores of the syndrome scales of aggressive, inattentive, and anxious/depressed behavior. At the age of 25 years, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) was conducted with n = 307 participants to obtain psychiatric diagnoses for the period of young adulthood. In addition, 309 participants filled out the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR) to assess current externalizing and internalizing problem behavior. With respect to psychiatric diagnoses during young adulthood, early psychosocial risks were associated with a significantly increased probability for suffering from substance abuse/dependence. By contrast, risk was not significantly increased for anxiety, depressive, and personality disorders. In addition, early psychosocial risks significantly predicted externalizing and internalizing behavior problems as measured by the YASR. The CBCL-DP was found to mediate this association. To conclude, our results confirm an association between childhood adversities and psychopathology in adulthood. Hence, findings from retrospective studies can also be replicated by the use of prospective study designs. Affective and behavioral dysregulation as measured by the CBCL-DP seems to be a mediating bridge between early psychosocial risks and long-term adverse consequences. The CBCL-DP may be used to identify children at an enhanced risk for developing chronic mental problems.

AB Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and serious mental health problem with prevalence rates ranging from 13% to 19%, and is associated with an increased risk of adverse child development. PPD is characterized by symptoms common of depression, particularly by impairments of maternity, parenting, and mother-infant interactions. Several reviews suggest an impact on attachment, cognitive, behavioral, and health-related outcome in the offspring. However, the long-term effects of PPD regarding cognitive and mental development into adulthood and the underlying mechanisms, especially the role of maternal interactional behavior, are not yet well understood. In the Mannheim Study of Children at Risk, maternal depression was assessed when the child was 3 months and 2 years old. Development from infancy to young adulthood (25 years) was assessed at regular intervals in 28 children of postnatally depressed mothers and 107 children born to mentally healthy mothers. Cognitive outcome up to age 11 was measured using standardized instruments; in adulthood, school outcome was used approximately. Psychiatric diagnosis as well as symptom scores served as psychological outcome. At age 3 months, mothers and infants were videotaped during a nursing and a playing situation. Videotapes of the 10-min session were recorded and evaluated by trained raters (kappa > .83) using the Category System for Microanalysis of Early Mother Child Interaction (Esser, Scheven, et al., 1989). The cognitive as well as social-emotional outcome of children of mothers suffering from PPD was significantly poorer than in the children of mentally healthy mothers. The adverse effects were more pronounced during childhood. The offspring of postnatally depressed mothers who interacted in a responsive manner with their infant exhibited a better prognosis in contrast to those with mothers interacting less sensitively. This effect was observed with regard to cognitive development and symptoms of externalizing behavior at age 19 years. Regarding internalizing behavior, no impact of maternal behavior was detected. These findings emphasize the importance of high-quality early mother-child interaction in the development of children at risk. Furthermore, convincing arguments are given for very early specialized treatment of impaired mother-child interactions in mothers suffering from PPD. The PPD treatment should always comprise treatment of depression as well as treatment of the disturbed mother-child interaction.

AB Many youths who are victimized by peers suffer from depression symptoms. However, not all bullying victims show depression symptoms and individuals' biological sensitivity may play an important moderating role in this regard. In line with this notion, peer victimization has been associated with increased depressive symptoms in youth with higher basal cortisol secretion. It is unclear, however, whether this moderating effect of cortisol really concerns the environmental effect of peer victimization on depression. Indeed, genetic factors can also influence individuals' environmental experiences, including peer victimization, and part of these genetic factors may be those associated with depression. Using a genetically informed design based on 159 monozygotic and 120 dizygotic twin pairs (52% girls) assessed at age 14 years, this study examined whether cortisol secretion moderates the environmental or the genetic association between peer victimization and depression symptoms. Salivary cortisol at awakening was obtained with buccal swabs during four school week days. Peer victimization and depression were assessed via self-reports. Cholesky modeling revealed that peer victimization was associated with depression symptoms via both genetic and environmental pathways. Moreover, the environmental association between peer victimization and depression symptoms steadily increased with increasing levels of morning cortisol. The genetic association between peer victimization and depression symptoms also varied, albeit less, as a function of individuals' cortisol secretion. These findings support the hypothesis that peer victimization increases internalizing psychopathology mainly in youth with heightened biological reactivity to environmental conditions.

AB The human brain requires a wide variety of experiences and environmental inputs in order to develop normally. Children who are neglected by caregivers or raised in institutional environments are deprived of numerous types of species-expectant environmental experiences. In this review, we articulate a model of how the absence of cognitive stimulation and sensory, motor, linguistic, and social experiences common among children raised in deprived early environments constrains early forms of learning, producing long-term deficits in complex cognitive function and associative learning. Building on evidence from animal models, we propose that deprivation accelerates the neurodevelopmental process of synaptic pruning and limits myelination, resulting in age-specific reductions in cortical thickness and white matter integrity among children raised in deprived early environments. We review evidence linking early experiences of psychosocial deprivation to reductions in cognitive ability, associative and implicit learning, language skills, and executive functions as well as atypical patterns of cortical and white matter development-domains that should be profoundly influenced by deprivation through the learning and neural mechanisms we propose. These patterns of atypical development are difficult to explain with existing models that emphasize stress pathways and accelerated limbic system development. A learning account of how deprived early environments influence cognitive and neural development provides a complementary perspective to stress models and highlights novel pathways through which deprivation might confer risk for internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. We end by reviewing evidence for plasticity in cognitive and neural development among children raised in deprived environments following interventions that improve caregiving quality.

AB Filial piety is an important cultural construct in the lives and behaviors of Chinese emerging adults and may act as a moderating factor for the relationship between perceived parenting practices and indices of adjustment. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not filial piety moderates the influence of psychologically controlling and warm parenting behaviors on internalizing problems, self-esteem, and risk behaviors. Using a sample of Chinese college students (N = 612), results from regression analyses indicated that filial piety moderated the relationship between psychological control and self-esteem, in that psychological control predicted lower self-esteem at high and moderate levels of filial piety values but was not related at low filial piety values. The discussion focuses on the possibility that filial piety may exacerbate the conflict between psychologically controlling tactics and autonomy.

A nationally representative sample of parents (N = 3,375) provided data on their children at ages 4, 5, and 6 years. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for ordinal data, two competing models (three-factor model vs. five-factor model) were tested to establish equivalence across time. Results showed that the five-factor model had a superior fit to the data compared with the alternative three-factor model which only achieved an adequate fit at a configural level. Strong longitudinal factorial invariance was established for the five-factor parent version of the SDQ. Our findings support the use of the SDQ in longitudinal studies and provide the important psychometric information required for basing educational, clinical, and policy decisions on outcomes of the SDQ.

AB This study examined the benefit of utilizing one-item academic and one-item behavior readiness teacher-rated screeners at the beginning of the school year to predict end-of-school year outcomes for middle school students. The Middle School Academic and Behavior Readiness (M-ABR) screeners were developed to provide an efficient and effective way to assess readiness in students. Participants included 889 students in 62 middle school classrooms in an urban Missouri school district. Concurrent validity with the M-ABR items and other indicators of readiness in the fall were evaluated using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, with the academic readiness item having medium to strong correlations with other baseline academic indicators (r = +/- 0.56 to 0.91) and the behavior readiness item having low to strong correlations with baseline behavior items (r = +/- 0.20 to 0.79). Next, the predictive validity of the M-ABR items was analyzed with hierarchical linear regressions using end-of-year outcomes as the dependent variable. The academic and behavior readiness items demonstrated adequate validity for all outcomes with moderate effects (beta = +/- 0.31 to 0.73 for academic outcomes and beta = +/- 0.24 to 0.59 for behavioral outcomes) after controlling for baseline demographics. Even after controlling for baseline scores, the M-ABR items predicted unique variance in almost all outcome variables. Four conditional probability indices were calculated to obtain an optimal cut score, to determine ready vs. not ready, for both single-item M-ABR scales. The cut point of "fair" yielded the most acceptable values for the indices. The odd ratios (OR) of experiencing negative outcomes given a "fair" or lower readiness rating (2 or below on the M-ABR screeners) at the beginning of the year were significant and strong for all outcomes (OR = 2.29 to OR = 14.46), except for internalizing problems. These findings suggest promise for using single readiness items to screen for varying negative end-of-year student outcomes.

AB Background: Prenatal phthalate exposure has been associated with behavioral problems and lower performance on measures of cognitive ability in children. However, the potential effect of phthalate exposure during the sensitive preconception period is unknown. Objectives: To estimate the association of maternal and paternal preconception urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations with child behavior and evaluate potential modification by child sex.
   Methods: We used data from 166 children (111 singletons, 26 pairs of twins, and 1 set of triplets) born to 134 mothers and 100 fathers participating in a prospective preconception cohort study of subfertile couples from the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center. We estimated mean maternal and paternal preconception exposures by averaging individual phthalate metabolite concentrations in multiple urine samples collected before pregnancy. We assessed children's behavior at 2-9 years of age by parent report using the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2). We estimated the covariate-adjusted association between individual phthalate metabolite concentrations and the sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (Sigma DEHP) and behavior scores, and evaluated differences in associations by child sex using linear regression with Generalized Estimating Equations. Models were further adjusted for prenatal phthalate concentrations in sensitivity analyses.
   Results: Each log(e)-unit increase in maternal and paternal preconception concentrations of Sigma DEHP was associated with a 2.0 (95% CI: - 3.2, - 0.7) and 1.8 (95% CI: - 3.1, - 0.4) point decrease in BASC-2 internalizing behavior scores among all children, respectively. We observed sex-specific associations for some phthalate biomarkers: among boys, maternal monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP) was positively associated with externalizing behaviors, and paternal MiBP and mono-n-butyl phthalate were positively associated with internalizing behaviors.
   Conclusions: In this cohort, paternal and maternal preconception concentrations of some phthalate biomarkers were associated with specific aspects of child behavior, even after adjustment for prenatal concentrations. While additional research is warranted to confirm these results, our findings suggest that the preconception period of exposure may be a critical window for offspring neurodevelopment.

AB Objective: To date, few studies of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have been adequately powered to examine patterns and predictors of comorbidity, despite the frequency with which it occurs. We address this gap, drawing on a large sample of youth with OCD who were systematically assessed through research and clinical programs in a university-based specialty Program for children and adolescents with OCD. We examine patterns of comorbidity across different epochs of development and predict specific classes of OCD (comorbidity internalizing/externalizing/both) from key demographic and clinical variables that may be useful in guiding individualized treatment.
   Method: A total of 322 youths (mean age = 12.28, 53% male) were assessed using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS; Silverman and Albano, 1996), the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS; Scahill et al., 1997) and other standardized measures.
   Results: Consistent with prior research, 50% of youth met criteria for a co-occurring anxiety or depressive disorder. Rates of externalizing disorders were lower (16%). Developmental differences emerged such that older youth met criteria for a higher number of co-occurring disorders. As expected, adolescents in particular were more likely to have a co-occurring internalizing disorder compared to early or pre-adolescent peers. Surprisingly, they were also more likely to have a comorbid externalizing disorder. Developmental trends were particularly striking with respect to depression, with adolescents with OCD demonstrating a six-fold greater likelihood of co-occurring depressive disorder compared to younger counterparts.
   Discussion: Clinical implications are discussed with eye toward tailoring interventions, particularly during the transition to adolescence when youth are at heightened risk for depression. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescent suicide is a global public health problem. Currently, most suicide prevention and treatment programs rely heavily on youth self-report in order to determine adolescent suicide risk. Parents may be useful informants, however, as there are times when parents are more likely to report suicidality than youth, particularly when youth display externalizing symptomatology, such as aggression and delinquency. This study compared parent-adolescent suicide report concordance among adolescents with internalizing versus externalizing symptoms and examined whether internalizing or externalizing youth were more or less likely than parents to report adolescent suicidal ideation. Using data from a subsample of adolescents recruited from inpatient and partial hospitalization programs for a separate study (n = 64), a one-sized z-test for proportions was used to compare parent-adolescent suicide report concordance for subsamples of adolescents with internalizing versus externalizing symptomatology. Two-sided z-tests for proportions were used to compare the proportions of parents and adolescents reporting adolescent suicidal ideation for discordant pairs in each subset. There were no statistically significant discrepancies in reports of suicidal ideation for the internalizing and externalizing subsets, nor were adolescents significantly more likely than parents to report adolescent suicidal ideation. Among the discordant pairs in the externalizing subset, the proportion of parents who reported that their adolescents had expressed suicidal ideation (60%) was higher than the proportion of adolescents who actually reported experiencing suicidal ideation (40%), though this difference was not statistically significant. For internalizing adolescents, the proportion of parents who reported their children had expressed suicidal ideation (63.0%) was significantly smaller than the proportion of adolescents who reported experiencing suicidal ideation (81.5%; p<.05). The clinical implications of these preliminary findings point to the importance of including parents in the process of assessing suicidality in order to help them recognize warning signs in their children.

AB AIM
   To identify factors that promote a positive start to school for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   METHODS
   Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsychINFO searches were conducted to identify literature published after 1991 and relevant to school transition processes in children with ASD. Twenty studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. These studies evaluated a range of factors including school readiness, parent and teacher perspectives on transition practices, characteristics of children with ASD that are associated with successful transition to school and the impact of school based intervention programs.
   RESULTS
   A review of these studies showed that children with ASD are less school ready emotionally than their peers and those children with ASD appear to have more externalising behaviours and self-regulation difficulties that affect their school engagement and their relationships with their teachers. There was a paucity of research looking at interventions targeting school readiness. However, school-based behavioural interventions appear to improve cognitive, language and daily living skills, but have less impact on socialisation and peer inclusion.
   CONCLUSION
   Children with ASD face more challenges transitioning to school, particularly with social interaction. Further development and implementation of specific schoolbased interventions is needed in order to assist children with autism to maximise their success in starting school.

AB Background, Despite substantial evidence demonstrating numerous parental risk and protective factors for the development of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders, there is currently no single measure that assesses these parenting factors. To address this gap, we developed the Parenting to Reduce Adolescent Depression and Anxiety Scale (PRADAS) as a criterion-referenced measure of parental concordance with a set of evidence-based parenting guidelines for the prevention of adolescent depression and anxiety disorders, In this paper, we used a sample of Australian parents of adolescents to: (1) validate the PRADAS as a criterion-referenced measure; (2) examine parental concordance with the guidelines in the sample; and (3) examine correlates of parental concordance with the guidelines.
   Methods. Seven hundred eleven parents completed the PRADAS, as well as two established parenting measures, land parent-report measures of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms. Six hundred sixty adolescent participants (aged 12-15) also completed the symptom measures. Concordance with the guidelines was assessed via nine subscale scores and a total score. Reliability of the scores was assessed with an estimate of the agreement coefficient, as well as 1-month test-retest reliability. Convergent validity was examined via correlations between the scale and two established parenting measures,
   Results. One proposed subscale was removed from the final version of the scale, resulting in a total of eight subscales. Reliability was high for the total score, and acceptable to high for seven of the eight subscales. One-month test-retest reliability was acceptable to high for the total score. Convergent validity was supported by moderate to high correlations with two established measures of parentiug. Overall, rates of parental concordance with the guidelines were low in our sample. Higher scores were associated with being female and higher levels of parental education. Greater parental concordance with the guidelines was associated with fewer symPtoms of depression and anxiety in adolescent participants.
   Discussion. This initial validation study provides preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the PRADAS. The scale has potential for use in both clinical and research settings. It may be used to identify parents'' strengths and potential targets for intervention, and as an outcome measure in studies of preventive parenting interventions.

AB Atypical respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a biomarker of emotion dysregulation, is associated with both externalizing and internalizing behaviors. In addition, social adversity and gender may moderate this association. In this study, we investigated if RSA (both resting RSA and RSA reactivity in an emotion regulation task) predicts externalizing and/or internalizing behaviors and the extent to which social adversity moderates this relationship. Two hundred and fifty-three children (at Time 1, mean age = 9.05, SD = 0.60, 48% boys) and their caregivers from the community participated in this study. Resting RSA and RSA reactivity were assessed, and caregivers reported children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors at both Time 1 and Time 2 (1 year later). We found that lower resting RSA (but not RSA reactivity) at Time 1 was associated with increased externalizing and internalizing behaviors at Time 2 in boys, even after controlling for the effects of Time 1 behavioral problems and Time 2 age. Moreover, there was a significant interaction effect between Time 1 resting RSA and social adversity such that lower resting RSA predicted higher externalizing and internalizing behaviors in boys only under conditions of high social adversity. Follow-up analyses revealed that these predictive effects were stronger for externalizing behavior than for internalizing behavior. No significant effects were found for girls. Our findings provide further evidence that low resting RSA may be a transdiagnostic biomarker of emotion dysregulation and a predisposing risk factor for both types of behavior problems, in particular for boys who grow up in adverse environments. We conclude that biosocial interaction effects and gender differences should be considered when examining the etiological mechanisms of child psychopathology.

AB Background: This study focuses on children living in foster families with a history of maltreatment or neglect. These children often show adverse mental health outcomes reflected in increased externalizing and internalizing problems. It is expected that these adverse outcomes are associated with increased parental stress levels experienced by foster mothers as well as foster fathers.
   Methods: The study sample included 79 children living in foster families and 140 children living in biological families as comparison group. The age of the children ranged from 2 to 7 years. Mental health problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, while parenting stress was measured with a parenting stress questionnaire including subscales on the amount of experienced stress and the amount of perceived support. The Child Behavior Checklist assessments were based mainly on maternal reports, while the parental stress assessments were based on maternal as well as paternal reports.
   Results: As expected the results showed increased externalizing and internalizing scores for the foster children accompanied by increased parental stress experiences in the foster family sample (however only in the maternal, but not in the paternal stress reports). The stress differences between the foster and biological family groups disappeared, when the children's mental health problem scores were included as covariates. Moreover, especially the externalizing scores were strong predictors of parental stress in both, the groups of foster and biological parents. The amount of perceived social support was associated with reduced parental stress, but only in the group of biological fathers.
   Conclusion: The emergence of parental stress in biological as well as foster parents is closely related to child characteristics (mainly externalizing child problems). Possible implications for the reduction of parental stress are discussed as a consequence of the present results.

AB Cyber victimization is a contemporary problem facing youth and adolescents (Diamanduros, Downs, & Jenkins, 2008; Kowalski & Limber, 2007). It is imperative for researchers and school personnel to understand the associations between cyber victimization and student social-emotional outcomes. This article explores (a) gender differences in rates of cyber victimization, (b) overlap between traditional and cyber victimization, (c) differences in social-emotional outcomes across victimization classes, and (d) associations among cyber victimization and social-emotional risk, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems while controlling for traditional victimization among 1,152 high school students. Boys reported significantly higher rates of cyber victimization than did girls. Ten percent of students reported experiencing low levels of both cyber and traditional victimization (low dual), 3% of students reported experiencing moderate levels of both cyber and traditional victimization (moderate dual), and 1% of students reported high levels of both types of victimization (high dual). Three percent of students reported experiencing traditional victimization but not cyber victimization (traditional). There were significant differences in social and emotional problems among youth involved in victimization in various groups (i.e., uninvolved, traditional, low dual, moderate dual, and high dual). Lastly, cyber victimization significantly predicted variance in social-emotional risk and internalizing problems above and beyond that predicted by traditional victimization.

AB Social difficulty during adolescence contributes to internalizing problems (e.g., depression, stress) and spurs cycles of aggression and retaliation. In this article, I review how implicit theories of personality-beliefs about whether people can change their socially relevant characteristics-cause some adolescents to respond to social difficulty in these ways while others do not. Believing an entity theory of personality-the belief that people cannot change-causes people to blame their own and others' traits for social difficulty, and predicts more extreme affective, physiological, and behavioral responses (e.g., depression, aggression). Interventions that teach an incremental theory of personality-the belief that people can change-can reduce problematic reactions to social difficulty. I discuss why interventions to alter implicit theories improve adolescents' responses to conflict, and I propose suggestions for research.

AB The role of mother-infant interaction quality is studied in the relation between prenatal maternal emotional symptoms and child behavioral problems. Healthy pregnant, Dutch women (N = 96, M = 31.6, SD = 3.3) were allocated to the "exposed group" (n = 46), consisting of mothers with high levels of prenatal feelings of anxiety and depression, or the "low-exposed group" (n = 50), consisting of mothers with normal levels of depressive or anxious symptoms during pregnancy. When the children (49 girls, 47 boys) were 23 to 60 months of age (M = 39.0, SD = 9.6), parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (T.M. Achenbach & L.A. Rescorla, 2000), and mother-child interaction quality during a home visit was rated using the Emotional Availability Scales. There were no differences in mother-child interaction quality between the prenatally exposed and low-exposed groups. Girls exposed to high prenatal emotional symptoms showed more internalizing problems, if maternal interaction quality was less optimal. No significant effects were found for boys.

AB BACKGROUND: Sex-specilic associations have been reported between phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA) and child behavior. No data on large study populations are available for other phenols with possible endocrine-disrupting properties.
   OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates and several phenols on behavior among male infants.
   METHODS: We quantified 11 phthalate metabolites and nine phenols (four parabens, benzophenone-3, BPA, two dichlorophenols, triclosan) in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy among EDEN cohort mothers who delivered a boy. Mothers completed the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when their children were 3.1 (n = 529) and 5.6 (n = 464) y old.
   RESULTS: BPA was positively associated with the relationship problems subscale at 3 y [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CH: 1.03, 1.201 and the hyperactivity inattention subscale scores at 5 y (1RR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior, relationship problem, and emotional symptom scores at 3 y. Monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior and relationship problems scores at 3 y. After dichotomizing SDQ scores, triclosan tended to be positively associated with emotional symptom subscales at both 3 and 5 y.
   CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations between BPA, MnBP, and behavior in boys are consistent with previous findings. Further health impact assessment studies based on dose response functions corrected for exposure misclassification are required to quantify the public health burden possibly entailed by such associations.

AB Anxiety and depression are often highly correlated in adolescence, and cognitive biases are commonly associated with both types of symptoms. The purpose of this study was to examine cognitive biases in early adolescents showing: (a) elevated symptoms of anxiety; (b) elevated symptoms of depression; (c) elevated co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and depression; and (d) neither elevated symptoms of anxiety nor depression (comparison group). In particular, we were interested in the extent to which certain cognitive biases showed symptom specificity. Participants were N=686 10- to 14-year-olds, who provided self-reports of anxiety, depression, and measures of cognitive biases. Four groups were created based on quartile cutoffs: anxious, depressed, anxious-depressed, and comparison. Among the results from multivariate analysis of variance, the anxious group thought negative events were more costly as compared to the depressed group. In contrast, the depressed group was higher in terms of negative causal attributions, overgeneralizing, selective abstraction, and negative views of the self, world, and future. The anxious-depressed group showed an overall more negative pattern of cognitive biases than all other groups. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are distinguishable in terms of certain cognitive biases, and the co-occurrence of symptoms is indicative of a particularly negative pattern of thinking. These findings have implications for intervention programs that could target specific cognitive biases.
   Highlights
   Are distinct patterns of cognitive biases evident among early adolescents with symptoms of anxiety, symptoms of depression, and co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and depression? We collected self reports of cognitive biases. We also collected self reports of anxiety, depression, and cognitive biases, and created the following groups: 1) anxious; 2) depressed; 3) anxious-depressed; 4) comparison. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are distinguishable in terms of certain cognitive biases, and symptom co-occurrence may indicate a particularly maladaptive pattern of thinking.

AB Although the effects of personal initiative (PI) on adults' performance and other favorable outcomes are well documented, research has only recently begun to study PI in childhood. This study aimed at examining the development of PI, its predictors, and its developmental effects from childhood to early adolescence. A total of 1,593 German children participated in a longitudinal study starting at Grades 2 to 4, with a second measurement wave two years later. Latent change score analyses revealed that 1) children differed significantly in their change scores of PI, that 2) executive functions and positive parenting predicted change scores in PI, and that 3) high initial levels and change scores in PI reduced the development of internalizing and externalizing problems and supported the development of prosocial behavior and academic competencies. These findings endorse the plasticity of PI and shed light on the active part of children in promoting their own development.

AB Understanding predictors of adolescent inpatient length of stay (LOS) is important in informing treatment outcomes for this age group. The current literature on adolescent LOS remains limited and has been characterized by methodological limitations. In the study described here, we examined a wide range of predictors for LOS in a psychiatric unit for adolescents (N = 285), including severity of disorder (previous hospitalizations, self-harm, cognitive impairment and thought disorder, severe depression, history of trauma), types of psychotropic medication, and diagnoses. Our results indicated that LOS is associated with predictors that reflect psychiatric severity-most notably prescription of mood stabilizers and youth-reported internalizing symptoms.

AB The aim of this paper is to discuss how do children co-construct their Self developmental trajectories, in the transition process from preschool to primary school. Two approaches, Dialogical Self Theory (DST) and Sociocultural Psychology, were the basis for the analysis. Methodologically, we developed a study about one year in the schooling context, with interviews, observations and semi-structured task of children, parents and teachers. Three children were selected for a microgenetic analysis, Helena, Giselle and Anderson. The analysis demonstrated, that children co-construct their Self developmental trajectories internalizing actively the cultural suggestions of significant social others and in the meaning-making process oriented to the emergence of I/self positionings. The children created, each on his/her way, signs or new I/self positionings to deal with the transition process.

AB Several previous studies of pyrethroid biomarkers and behavior have reported associations between concurrent pyrethroid levels and adverse behavioral problems in children. One geospatial study reported associations between prenatal exposure to pyrethroids and autism. However, the association between prenatal pyrethroid biomarkers and childhood behavior is unknown. The Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center is a prospective birth cohort with urinary pyrethroid biomarkers during pregnancy and behavioral measurements at 4, 6, and 7-9 years of age. Primiparous women were enrolled between 1998 and 2002. 162 mother/child pairs with complete exposure and behavioral outcomes data were used to investigate associations between detectable levels of prenatal pyrethroid metabolites and scores on the Behavioral Assessment System for Children and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Overall, detection frequencies of pyrethroid metabolites were low (<30%). In longitudinal mixed models, detectable levels of 3-PBA during pregnancy were associated with worse Internalizing (13 -4.50, 95% Cl -8.05, -0.95), Depression (beta -3.21, 95% Cl-6.38,-0.05), Somatization (beta -3.22, 95% Cl -6.38, -0.06), Behavioral Regulation (beta -3.59,95% CI -6.97, -0.21), Emotional Control (beta -3.35,95% CI -6.58, -0.12), Shifting (beta -3.42, 95% CI -6.73, -0.11), and Monitoring (beta -4.08, 95% CI -7.07, -1.08) scales. Detectable levels of cis-DCCA were associated with worse Externalizing (beta -4.74, 95% CI -9.37, -0.10), Conduct Problems (beta -535,95% CI -9.90, -0.81), Behavioral Regulation (beta -6.42,95% CI -11.39, -1.45), and Inhibitory Control (beta -7.20, 95% CI -12.00, -2.39). Although detection frequencies of pyrethroid metabolites were low, we found suggestive evidence that prenatal exposure to 3-PBA and cis-DCCA may be associated with a variety of behavioral and executive functioning deficits.

AB Introduction: Gestational phthalate exposures have been adversely associated with attention, externalizing, and internalizing behaviors in childhood. Early childhood temperament may be a marker of later behavioral patterns. We therefore sought to determine whether gestational phthalate exposures were associated with infant and toddler temperament.
   Methods: The Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Study is a prospective cohort study of children born between May 1998 and July 2001 in New York City (N=404). Phthalate metabolites were measured in spot urine samples collected from pregnant women in their third trimester. Child temperament was assessed by parental report at 12-months using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ) (N = 204) and at 24-months using the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (TBAQ) (N = 279). We used multiple linear regression to evaluate associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and eleven temperament domains.
   Results: Phthalate biomarker concentrations were weakly associated with lower gross motor activity levels as well as higher duration of orienting at the 12-month assessment. Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and the sum of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (Sigma DEHP) were associated with lower levels of smiling and laughing at 12 months. At 24 months, social fear and lower pleasure was linked to higher concentrations of MCPP and MBzP, and higher Sigma DEHP was weakly associated with increased anger levels at 24-months.
   Conclusions: Though we observed some weak associations between biomarkers of prenatal exposure to phthalates and temperament at 12- and 24-months, overall phthalates biomarkers were not strongly associated with alterations in temperament. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: The current study is an investigation of the relationship between the appraisal of traumatic events and mental disorder symptoms: internalizing symptoms and externalizing/substance- abuse symptoms. Cumulative trauma over the lifetime was taken into account. Also, specific effects related to traumatic events of various types (i.e., betrayal trauma, accident involving a family member, physical violence, and natural disaster) were assessed. Participants, 190 young men and 277 young women, were asked to evaluate the strength with which the traumatic event impacted their lives.
   Method: It was hypothesized that the relationship between traumatic experiences and mental disorder symptoms would be stronger in women than in men, and also that cognitive appraisal, in interaction with gender, would be related to the severity of the symptoms.
   Results: Women showed higher levels of internalizing symptoms, but lower levels of externalizing/substance- abuse symptoms than men. Still, the correlation between cumulative trauma and both types of symptoms was stronger in women. For all types of trauma, women reported a stronger negative appraisal of the event than men. Interaction of sex and cognitive appraisal was demonstrated to be related to the severity of internalizing disorders.
   Conclusion: In the present study, women, as compared with men, evaluated traumatic events more negatively (for all types of trauma) and the relationship between trauma and mental disorder symptoms was also stronger in women. These results show the importance of the appraisal of trauma in the development of psychiatric symptoms in women and men following trauma.

AB Previous research suggests that exposure to early life stress (ELS) affects the structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a frontolimbic white matter tract that undergoes protracted development throughout adolescence. Adolescence is an important transitional period characterized by the emergence of internalizing psychopathology such as anxiety, particularly in individuals with high levels of stress sensitivity. We examined the relations among sensitivity to ELS, structural integrity of the UF, and anxiety symptoms in 104 early adolescents. We conducted structured interviews to assess exposure to ELS and obtained subjective and objective ratings of stress severity, from which we derived an index of ELS sensitivity. We also acquired diffusion MRI and conducted deterministic tractography to visualize UF trajectories and to compute measures of structural integrity from three distinct segments of the UF: frontal, insular, temporal. We found that higher sensitivity to ELS predicted both reduced fractional anisotropy in right frontal UF and higher levels of anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that fibers in frontal UF, which are still developing throughout adolescence, are most vulnerable to the effects of heightened sensitivity to ELS, and that reduced structural integrity of frontal UF may underlie the relation between early stress and subsequent internalizing psychopathology.

AB Objective: Emotion regulation difficulties are a potentially key mechanism underlying the association between childhood maltreatment and alcohol use in adulthood. The current study examined the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties in the association between childhood maltreatment severity (i.e., Childhood Trauma Questionnaire total score) and past-month alcohol use severity, including alcohol consumption frequency and alcohol-related problems (i.e., number of days of alcohol problems, ratings of "bother" caused by alcohol problems, ratings of treatment importance for alcohol problems).
   Method: Participants included 111 acute-care psychiatric inpatients (45.0% female; Mage=33.5, SD=10.6), who reported at least one DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder Criterion A traumatic event, indexed via the Life Events Checklist for DSM-5. Participants completed questionnaires regarding childhood maltreatment, emotion regulation difficulties, and alcohol use.
   Results: A significant indirect effect of childhood maltreatment severity via emotion regulation difficulties in relation to alcohol use severity (beta = 0.07, SE = 0.04, 99% CI [0.01, 0.21]) was documented. Specifically, significant indirect effects were found for childhood maltreatment severity via emotion regulation difficulties in relation to alcohol problems (beta's between 0.05 and 0.12; all 99% bootstrapped CIs with 10,000 resamples did not include 0) but not alcohol consumption.
   Conclusion: Emotion regulation difficulties may play a significant role in the association between childhood maltreatment severity and alcohol outcomes. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB We examined self-reported maternal and paternal harsh parenting (HP) and its effect on the moment-to-moment dynamic coupling of maternal autonomy support and children's positive, autonomous behavior. This positive behavior coupling was measured via hidden Markov models as the likelihood of transitions into specific positive dyadic states in real time. We also examined whether positive behavior coupling, in turn, predicted later HP and child behavior problems. Children (N = 96; age = 3.5 years at Time 1) and mothers completed structured clean-up and puzzle tasks in the laboratory. Mothers' and fathers' HP was associated with children's being less likely to respond positively to maternal autonomy support; mothers' HP was also associated with mothers' being less likely to respond positively to children's autonomous behavior. When mothers responded to children's autonomous behavior with greater autonomy support, children showed fewer externalizing and internalizing problems over time and mothers showed less HP over time. These results were unique to the dynamic coupling of maternal autonomy support and children's autonomous behavior: The overall amount of these positive behaviors did not similarly predict reduced problems. Findings suggest that HP in the family system compromises the coregulation of positive behavior between mother and child and that improving mothers' and children's abilities to respond optimally to one another's autonomy-supportive behaviors may reduce HP and child behavior problems over time.

AB The current study explored whether older sibling mentalization moderated the relationship between familial risk for internalizing symptoms and the development of future internalizing problems in the younger siblings, referred to as target children. Data were collected on 397 older siblings at Time 1 (T1) when target children were newborn and their older siblings were on average 2.61 years old (SD = .75). Target children were on average 1.60 years old at Time 2 (T2). Internalizing problems were assessed via mother and partner reports. Familial risk was operationalized as the average of all older siblings' level of internalizing problems. Older sibling mentalization, indexed by internal state talk and reasoning, was observed and coded during a sibling pretend- play interaction at T2. Results revealed a significant interaction between familial risk of internalizing problems and older siblings' mentalizing abilities, showing that familial risk was related to target children's internalizing problems in the absence of sibling mentalization. Familial risk was not associated with target children's internalizing problems when siblings demonstrated mentalizing abilities. Findings support the need to consider sibling mentalization as a protective factor for children's internalizing problems.

AB Study Objectives: Little is known about the association between menstruation and sleep disturbance in adolescent girls. This study examined sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality in relation to age at menarche and menstrual problems in a large sample of Chinese adolescent girls.
   Methods: This report represents the baseline data of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort in Shandong, China. A total of 5800 girls aged 12-18 years (mean age = 15.0, standard deviation = 1.4) participated in the baseline survey. A structured questionnaire was used to assess participants' age at menarche, menstrual cycle interval, menstrual flow length, period irregularity, period pain, body weight and height, and demographics. Internalizing and externalizing problems were measured by the Youth-Self Report of Child Behavioral Checklist. Sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and sleep quality were assessed by the items adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
   Results: After adjusting for age, school, body mass index, internalizing and externalizing problems, and family covariates, irregular periods (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-2.02), period pain (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.44-2.76), and menstrual flow length >= 7 days (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.00-1.48) were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms. Irregular periods (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.30-2.27) and period pain (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.34-2.37) were significantly associated with poor sleep quality. Age at menarche <= 11 years (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.05-2.50) was significantly associated with insomnia symptoms in 12-to 14-year-old girls.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that irregular periods and period pain appear to be associated with sleep disturbance and that early menarche may have short-term impact on sleep in adolescent girls.

   SYMPTOMS; SCALE
AB Adolescents with Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) exhibit symptoms of slowness, mental confusion, excessive daydreaming, low motivation, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Although many symptoms of SCT reflect internalizing states, no study has evaluated the clinical utility of self-report of SCT in an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) sample. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether SCT is best conceptualized as a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. In a sample of 262 adolescents comprehensively diagnosed with ADHD, the present study used adolescent- and parent reports of SCT to evaluate the predictive utility of a general SCT factor from a bifactor modeling approach compared the utility of three specific SCT factors (slow, sleepy, and daydreamer) for predicting academic impairment and internalizing psychopathology. Overall, a multidimensional framework of SCT was supported, with the three SCT factors differentially predicting impairment and in one case (school grades), predicting impairment when the general factor did not. Consistent with prior research, SCT slow behaviors appear to be most strongly associated with impairment, predicting both academic impairment and internalizing psychopathology. Parent report of SCT was most useful for predicting academic functioning, whereas youth self-report was important for predicting anxiety and depression. Implications of the findings for the assessment and potential treatment of SCT are discussed.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to compare temperament and behavior profiles among groups of preterm toddlers differentiated by level of prematurity and the presence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), controlling for neonatal clinical conditions and chronological age.
   Method: The sample comprised 100 preterm toddlers segregated according to level of prematurity (75 very preterm and 25 moderate/late preterm) and presence of BPD (n = 36) and ROP (n = 63). Temperament was assessed by the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire and behavior by the Child Behavior Checklist. The MANOVA was performed with a post-hoc univariate test.
   Results: The level of prematurity and the presence of BPD and ROP did not affect temperament and behavioral problems in toddlers born preterm. However, the covariates age and length of stay in NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) affected temperament and behavioral problems, respectively. The older toddlers showed higher inhibitory control and lower activity levels than younger toddlers (range of 18-36 months-old). Additionally, toddlers who stayed in the NICU longer showed more pervasive development and emotionally reactive problems than toddlers who stayed in NICU for less time.
   Conclusion: The level of prematurity and the presence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity did not affect temperament and behavioral problems in toddlers born preterm. However, a longer stay in the NICU increased the risk for behavioral problems, and age enhanced the regulation of temperament at toddlerhood.

AB CONTEXT: Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) is effective at reducing children's externalizing behavior. However, modifications are often made to PCIT, and it is not known whether these impact effectiveness.
   OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of PCIT on child externalizing behaviors, considering modifications, study design, and bias.
   DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, Sociological Abstracts, and A+ Education.
   STUDY SELECTION: We selected randomized controlled or quasi-experimental trials.
   DATA EXTRACTION: We analyzed child externalizing and internalizing behaviors, parent stress, parent-child interactions, PCIT format, and study design and/or characteristics.
   RESULTS: We included 23 studies (1144 participants). PCIT was superior to control for reducing child externalizing (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]:-1.17 to -0.58). PCIT studies that required skill mastery had significantly greater reductions in externalizing behavior than those that did not (Mastery: SMD: -1.09, 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.73; Nonmastery: SMD: -0.51, 95% CI: -0.85 to -0.17, P =.02). Compared with controls, PCIT significantly reduced parent-related stress (mean difference [MD]: -6.98, 95% CI: -11.69 to -2.27) and child-related stress (MD: -9.87, 95% CI: -13.64 to -6.09). Children in PCIT were observed to be more compliant to parent requests (SMD: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.28) compared with controls. PCIT effectiveness did not differ depending on session length, location (academic versus community settings), or child problems (disruptive behaviors only compared with disruptive behavior and other problems).
   LIMITATIONS: Results for parent-child observations were inconsistently reported, reducing the ability to pool important data.
   CONCLUSIONS: PCIT has robust positive outcomes across multiple parent-reported and observed parent-child interaction measures, and modifications may not be required even when implemented in diverse populations.

AB With increasing numbers of same-sex couples raising children in the United States, discriminatory attitudes toward children of same-sex parents (ACSSP) are of increasing concern. As with other forms of stigma and discrimination, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals are at risk for internalizing these societal attitudes, which can negatively affect parenting-related decisions and behaviors and the mental and physical health of their children. Secure attachment is characterized by positive views of the self as loveable and worthy of care that are understood to develop in early relationships with caregivers. Secure attachment has been associated with positive mental and physical health, including among LGB individuals and couples. This study aimed to test the potential buffering role of secure attachment against stigma internalization by examining associations among secure attachment, discrimination, internalized homonegativity (IH), and ACSSP in an online survey study of 209 U.S. adults in same-sex relationships. Bootstrap analyses supported our hypothesized moderated mediation model, with secure attachment being a buffer. Greater discrimination was indirectly associated with more negative ACSSP through greater IH for individuals with mean or lower levels, but not for individuals with higher than average levels of secure attachment, specifically because among those with higher levels of secure attachment, discrimination was not associated with IH. These findings build on and extend past research, with important implications for future research and clinical work with LGB individuals, same-sex couples, and their families, including potential implementation of interventions targeting attachment security.

AB Objective: Typologies of symptom development have been used to identify individuals with different symptom development in the externalizing and internalizing domains of child psychopathology separately despite the domains' high comorbidity and shared common etiologic risk. This study identified typologies of development jointly across the 2 symptom domains in childhood and investigated their associated antecedents with a specific focus on the comparisons between overall severity of symptoms and symptom expression in one or the other domain.
   Method: Latent class analysis identified groups based on emotional and behavioral symptoms assessed at 3, 5, 7, and 11 years in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 15,439). Different sociodemographic, family structure and environment, birth, infancy, and early childhood antecedents were examined.
   Results: Five groups were identified: 1. low symptoms (57%), 2. moderate behavioral (21%), 3. moderate emotional (12.5%), 4. high emotional and moderate behavioral (5.5%), and 5. high behavioral and moderate emotional (4%). Higher symptoms were predicted by larger numbers of antecedents and risk factors compared with the low symptom group and compared with moderate and high levels of symptoms in either domain (groups 5 versus 2 and 4 versus 3). Comparisons of groups with similar overall symptom levels but different dominant symptom domain (groups 2 versus 3 and 4 versus 5) indicated that apart from gender and ethnicity, there were few unique antecedents of whether children mainly internalize or externalize their symptoms.
   Conclusion: It is possible and useful to define groupings or typologies jointly across externalizing and internalizing symptom development in childhood. Although numerous antecedents predict the experience of symptoms, there are few unique antecedents that differentiate individuals with similarly high levels of psychopathology expressed mainly as internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Identification of at-risk children and delivery of early intervention might benefit from a decreased focus on symptom domain with possible downstream effects through the life course for most common psychiatric disorders.

AB Research examining pubertal timing effects on psychopathology has emphasized that a subset of adolescents, particularly females, who experience early pubertal maturation relative to their peers appear to be at increased risk for psychopathology. The aims of the current meta-analysis were (a) to quantify the magnitude of early pubertal timing effects on psychopathology, (b) to examine potential moderators of pubertal timing effects (sex, psychopathology domain, sample composition, measurement method, and mean sample age), and (c) to examine findings in relation to hypotheses in the extant literature explicating differential pubertal timing effects for early versus late youth and males versus females. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and PsycInfo databases and 101 articles met criteria for inclusion. Included studies reported a quantitative association between pubertal timing and higher-order broadband dimensions of psychopathology (i.e., internalizing, externalizing), and/or lower-order subdomains (i.e., distress, fear, antisocial behavior, substance abuse, eating pathology). Using meta-analytic methods, we estimated global effect sizes (Cohen's ds) for the association between pubertal timing and psychopathology. Adolescent sex did not moderate early pubertal timing effects on emotional and behavior problems. However, robust early pubertal timing effects emerged for both males and females across all domains of psychopathology that were small in magnitude (ds similar to.20). Measurement method of pubertal timing, but not sample composition or mean sample age, significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies. Findings have implications for refinement of theoretical models of pubertal timing effects on psychopathology and highlight the importance of empirical work that can identify pathways which may link offset pubertal timing to psychopathology during adolescence.

AB Schools have become the largest provider of mental health services to children, thus increasing the need to identify children at risk before problems worsen. The Social, Academic, and Emotional Behavioral Risk Screener-Student Rating Scale (SAEBRS-SRS) student version is a universal screener that assesses pre-symptomology of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Prior research on the SAEBRS-SRS has supported a psychometrically defensible factor structure; however, additional research is necessary to support applied used in schools. In this study, 1102 middle grades students completed the SAEBRS-SRS and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Data were analyzed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the screener via receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to identify measurement invariance across gender. Results indicated that (1) the SAEBRS-SRS has adequate diagnostic accuracy statistics, particularly for the SAEBRS Total score, and (2) the SAEBRS-SRS is invariant across gender at the metric and scalar levels of measurement invariance. Implications and recommendations for future research are further discussed.

AB Psychological and psychiatric dysfunction is a major problem in a substantial proportion of young adults with Down syndrome. Some patients develop psychiatric issues, such as depressive, obsessive-compulsive, or psychotic-like disorders, in their late adolescence or young adulthood. Furthermore, these individuals may experience moderate to severe emotional and psychological distress. Development of a psychosocial treatment to address these issues is needed in addition to psychotropic medication. The current study reports two cases of young adults with Down syndrome, who presented psychiatric symptoms and marked disruption in their daily lives. These individuals participated in a Dohsa-hou treatment program. Following treatment, adaptive levels, maladaptive behaviors, and internalizing problems were evaluated by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II. Participants showed improvement in maladaptive behaviors and internalizing problems; however, improvement in these areas may be influenced by baseline severity of the problems. This case report suggests that Dohsa-hou could be an effective therapeutic approach for maladaptive and internalizing problems in adults with Down syndrome.

AB The Community-Family Integration Teams (C-FIT) diversion program was developed to address behavioral and mental health treatment for justice-involved adolescents. The C-FIT pilot study, implemented in Jordan, aimed to (1) evaluate intervention fidelity and (2) assess intervention effectiveness. Adolescent males (n=19) and their families participated in the C-FIT study. Pre and post data were collected through interviews and standardized instruments. The mean fidelity score was 31.4 out of 46 (68%), indicating reasonable fidelity. Data suggest declining levels of internalizing problems. The C-FIT program holds promise for improving adolescent mental health outcomes and decreasing recidivism youths who are at risk of detention center placement.

AB Objective: To document behavior in children residing in very remote Western Australian communities as rated by parent/caregivers and teachers. We hypothesized that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) would have higher rates of problematic behavior than children without FASD. Methods: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; n = 97), and Teacher Report Form (TRF; n = 106) were used in this population-based study. Raw scores, proportions scoring within "Normal/Borderline/Clinical" ranges, and frequencies of Critical items were determined. Mann-Whitney U and x(2) tests were used for between-group comparisons. Results: Children were aged from 7.5 to 9.6 years, and 19% had FASD. Academic performance was commonly rated in the "Borderline/Clinical" range (73%). Teacher-rated scores were poorer in the FASD group on 15 scales encompassing total and internalizing problems, adaptive function, academic performance, attention, withdrawn/depressed, social problems, posttraumatic stress, thought problems, and sluggish cognitive tempo (p <.05). More children in the FASD group had scores in the "Borderline/Clinical" range on 11 TRF scales (p <.05). "Physically attacks people" was the most prevalent Critical item endorsed by teachers for the total cohort (22%). " Talks about killing self" was endorsed by teachers more often in the FASD group (14%) than the Non-FASD group (1%; p = .03). There were no significant differences between groups in parent-reported CBCL scores after adjustment for multiple comparison testing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that children with FASD have more teacher-reported behavioral impairment than children without FASD. In remote Australian communities, academic performance is poor.

AB Heterotypic psychopathological continuity (i.e. one disorder predicting another at a later time point) contradicts the conventional view that psychiatric disorders are discrete, static entities. Studying this phenomenon may help to tease out the complex mechanisms that underpin psychiatric comorbidity. To date, no studies have explicitly compared heterotypic effects within and across higher order dimensions of psychopathology.
   Patterns of homotypic and heterotypic psychopathological continuity were examined using cohort data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 4815). Eight common psychiatric disorders were assessed at age 7.5 and again at age 14 years using the maternal report version of the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA). Cross-lagged models were used to compare patterns of homotypic and heterotypic continuity within and across three higher order dimensions of psychopathology; internalizing-fear, internalizing-distress, and externalizing.
   Homotypic continuity was universal. Considerable heterotypic continuity was observed even after controlling for homotypic continuity and the presence of all disorders at baseline. Heterotypic continuity was more common within higher order dimensions, but a number of significant cross-dimension effects were observed, with ADHD acting as a strong predictor of subsequent internalizing disorders.
   Heterotypic continuity may reflect elements of shared aetiology, or local-level interactions between disorders.

AB Background. Socioeconomic difficulties affect the cognitive and emotional development of children. However, the focus of prior studies has largely been on poverty and material hardship. This study expands on the existing literature by examining the impact of familial transient financial difficulties during infancy on long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes.
   Methods. The National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (79) were used to assess the association between a transient drop in family income by 50% or more (called transient income decline or TID) during the first 3 years of life and later-life Peabody Individual Achievement Math and Reading scores and behavior problem index (BPI) scores (N = 827217 348; median assessment age = 9 years). A subsample of matched siblings (N = 2049-4238) was examined to tease out maternal and intra-familial effects.
   Results. Exposure to TID predicted increased total and externalizing BPI scores (std. coefficients of 0.10 and 0.09, respectively, p < 0.01) in the overall sample. Among matched siblings, exposure to TID predicted increased total, externalizing, and internalizing BPI scores (std. coefficients of 0.27, 0.25, and 0.23, respectively, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion. Familial transient financial difficulties can have long-lasting behavioral effects for infants. The study identifies an early risk factor and at-risk children, thus providing insight into developing early intervention measures for infants to avoid long-term behavioral problems.

AB This study examined a university-community partnership, focusing on mental health promotion within an after-school music program. We pursued two goals: (a) supporting staff around student engagement and behavior management; (b) integrating social-emotional activities into the curriculum. We assessed youth's mental health needs and examined feasibility of social-emotional activities delivered. One-hundred sixty-two youth participated in activities, while a subset of youth (n = 61) and their parents provided information on mental health need. Rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were high, and youth reported high satisfaction with the activities. Results suggest promise of this model for mental health promotion for urban youth.

AB This integrative review draws on previous empirical and theoretical work across multiple research traditions, including psychology, sociology, and neurology, to create a framework detailing pathways linking early socioeconomic adversity in childhood and adolescence to subsequent disease risk later in adolescence and young adulthood. A comprehensive search ultimately led to the socioeconomic adversity and disease risk model for youth, which is a heuristic research framework detailing four over-arching pathways focused on early biological/genetic vulnerability, physiological responses (comprised of stress responses and hormonal activity), psychosocial resource trajectories, and behavioral and mental health trajectories as well as potential modifiers of these pathways. Other central constructs include brain development/neuroplasticity and adolescent life stressors. The heuristic research framework calls for an integrated perspective taking a long-view over early life course to explain cumulative physical disease risk by combining knowledge from developmental, social, neurocognitive, and biological sciences.

AB The present short-term longitudinal study examined prospective associations between two forms of peer victimization (i.e., physical, relational) and both externalizing and internalizing problems in early childhood. The study assessed 97 children (42 girls; M age=45.22 months, SD=6.99) over the course of one school year with assessments occurring at the end of each semester (approximately 6 months apart). Multiple methods were used to collect data over the course of one school year to test theoretically driven hypotheses. Cross-lagged path analyses were conducted, revealing significant associations between relational victimization and increases in depressive symptoms. On the other hand, relational victimization was also significantly associated with decreases in externalizing problems (e.g., inattention, deception/lying) and increases in prosocial behavior. Physical aggression predicted increases in physical victimization, supporting hypotheses that children displaying physically aggressive behavior are likely to be reactive to negative peer interactions and endure future victimization.

AB Discrepancy in perception of bullying experiences may lead to later internalizing or externalizing behavior in adolescents. A 1,663 South Korean 7th and 8th graders (mean age: 13.1 and 14.1 years old), were seen for a follow-up study to examine the relationships between the discrepancy in perception of their bullying experiences (defined as discrepancy between self- and peer-reports of bullying experiences) and internalizing or externalizing behavior at follow-up. Bullying was assessed by self- and peer-report. The discrepancy in perception of bullying experiences was defined by the concordance or discordance between self- and peer-reports. Internalizing and externalizing behavior was evaluated using the Youth Self Report and Child Behavior Checklist, at baseline and follow-up. Two by two ANCOVA was performed with a factorial design, categorizing discrepancy in perception of bullying experiences based on the agreement between self-report and peer-report. Internalizing/externalizing behavior-at-follow-up was used as an outcome, adjusting for other known risk factors for internalizing/externalizing behavior, including baseline internalizing/externalizing behavior, and bullying experiences. Adolescents with perceptions of bullying experiences discrepant from peer-reports showed increased internalizing/externalizing behavior at follow-up. Bullying also stands out as an independent risk factor for the development of future externalizing behavior even among adolescents with accurate perceptions of bullying experiences. These specific groups of youth warrant more focused assessment and intervention.

AB BackgroundAnxiety disorders are common, often start in childhood and run a chronic course. As such there is a need for effective prevention.
   MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials to prevent the onset of anxiety disorders in at risk' young people. Diagnostic and symptom outcomes were examined. Putative moderators were tested as was publication bias.
   ResultsWe included 16 trials (2545 young people). Two trials reported diagnostic outcomes, and significant effects were found for these at end-of-programme (RR=.09, 95%CI=.02 to .16), 6- (RR=.17, 95%CI=.06 to .27) and 12-month (RR=.31, 95%CI .17 to .45) follow-ups. Based on 16 trials, improved anxiety symptoms were significant compared to nonattention controls only, with small effect sizes reported by young people at the end-of-programmes, 6- and 12-month follow-ups; and by parents at the end of the programmes and 12-, but not 6-, month follow-ups. There was no evidence of significant moderation or publication bias.
   ConclusionsFourteen studies included children and young people who presented with elevated anxiety symptoms, but anxiety disorder was not ruled out in the participants in these studies. Hence, these studies might be reporting results of mixed prevention/early intervention programmes. Prevention programmes that target developmental risk factors, not only disorder maintaining factors, appear most promising. The clinically meaningful impact of anxiety disorder prevention programmes remains unknown.

AB The growing mental health needs of students within schools have resulted in teachers increasing their involvement in the delivery of school-based, psychosocial interventions. Current research reports mixed findings concerning the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions delivered by teachers for mental health outcomes. This article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of school-based psychosocial interventions delivered by teachers on internalizing and externalizing outcomes and the moderating factors that influence treatment effects on these outcomes. Nine electronic databases, major journals, and gray literature (e.g., websites, conference abstract) were searched and field experts were contacted to locate additional studies. Twenty-four studies that met the study inclusion criteria were coded into internalizing or externalizing outcomes and further analyzed using robust variance estimation in meta-regression. Both publication and risk of bias of studies were further assessed. The results showed statistically significant reductions in students' internalizing outcomes (d = .133, 95% CI [.002, .263]) and no statistical significant effect for externalizing outcomes (d = .15, 95% CI [-.037, .066]). Moderator analysis with meta-regression revealed that gender (%male, b = -.017, p < .05), race (% Caucasian, b = .002, p < .05), and the tier of intervention (b = .299, p = .06) affected intervention effectiveness. This study builds on existing literature that shows that teacher-delivered Tier 1 interventions are effective interventions but also adds to this literature by showing that interventions are more effective with internalizing outcomes than on the externalizing outcomes. Moderator analysis also revealed treatments were more effective with female students for internalizing outcomes and more effective with Caucasian students for externalizing outcomes.

AB The study of vulnerabilities to depression typically identifies factors that are thought to be universally maladaptive or adaptive. In contrast, researchers recently have theorized that the ability to flexibly engage in different thoughts and behaviors that fit situational demands may be most indicative of psychological health. We review empirical evidence from 147 studies reporting associations between five components of flexibility (set-shifting, affective set-shifting, cardiac vagal control, explanatory flexibility, and coping flexibility) and depression and classify studies according to strength of study design. Evidence from correlational and case-controlled studies suggests cross-sectional relationships, but few prospective studies have been conducted. We discuss limitations of existing studies, identify new directions for programmatic research, and discuss implications that flexibility has for the prevention and treatment of depression.

AB Children vary in their sensitivity to parenting practices, which may influence their competence and development of psychological symptoms. Three theoretical frameworks that address youth's sensitivity to parenting and potential outcomes include the diathesis stress model, differential susceptibility hypothesis, and the vantage sensitivity hypothesis. The purpose of the present review is to examine the relations among child genetic, endophenotypic, and phenotypic attributes with parenting, and links to social and emotional adjustment and symptoms from infancy to young adulthood (18 years of age) that support the diathesis-stress model, differential susceptibility hypothesis, or vantage sensitivity hypothesis. We also examined whether (a) the assessment method (e.g., questionnaires, observations) and (b) developmental period (e.g., early childhood, adolescence) during which variables were assessed influenced support for the theoretical perspectives considered. Support was found for each framework but differed across studies. This inconsistent support may be because some child-specific features act as vulnerabilities, whereas others operate as plasticity factors; the parenting dimension under consideration may influence the adjustment of youth differently; or sex differences in child-specific features may differentially predict youth social and emotional competence or symptom development. Other potential explanations involve issues related to informants and contextual variations in children's behaviors, different analytic approaches, the assessment method, and developmental period of assessment.

AB Purpose: This study used longitudinal data to examine the influence of the religiosity of pre-adolescents with psychiatric problems on the course of mental health during adolescence.
   Methods: In the TRAILS clinical cohort of 543 pre-adolescents (10-12 years), mental health problems were assessed using self-report at baseline, T2 (12-14 years), T3 (14-17 years), and T4 (17-21 years). The Youth Self Report (YSR) was used at baseline, T2, and T3, and the Adult Self Report (ASR) was used at T4. Religiosity was assessed at baseline using self-report and information from mothers and fathers, resulting in three categorical religiosity variables and six SOCON (Social Cultural Developments Questionnaire) religiosity scales that assess religiosity in greater detail. Repeated measure ANOVA analyses were performed for each independent religiosity variable with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior as dependent variables, gender as a factor and time (T1, T2, T3 and T4) as within factor. Results were adjusted for marital status of parents and socioeconomic status and corrected for multiple testing.
   Results: There were main effects of the self-report SOCON scale "Humanistic beliefs'' and gender and gender "by Humanistic beliefs'' interaction effect on internalizing problems. Follow-up tests revealed that among females "high'' scores on "Humanistic beliefs'' were associated with increased internalizing problems.
   Conclusions: There were hardly any associations between religiosity and mental health in a clinical cohort of pre-adolescents up to adolescence. The exception being that among females strong humanistic beliefs were associated with internalizing problems. Implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Temporal phases of threat response, including potential threat (anxiety), acute threat (startle, fear), and post-threat response modulation, have been identified as the underlying markers of anxiety disorders. Objective measures of response during these phases may help identify children at risk for anxiety; however, the complexity of current assessment techniques prevent their adoption in many research and clinical contexts. We propose an alternative technology, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), that enables noninvasive measurement of the movements associated with threat response, and test its ability to detect threat response phases in young children at a heightened risk for developing anxiety. We quantified the motion of 18 children (3-7 years old) during an anxiety-/fear-provoking behavioral task using an IMU. Specifically, measurements from a single IMU secured to the child's waist were used to extract root-mean-square acceleration and angular velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions, and tilt and yaw range of motion during each threat response phase. IMU measurements detected expected differences in child motion by threat phase. Additionally, potential threat motion was positively correlated to familial anxiety risk, startle range of motion was positively correlated with child internalizing symptoms, and response modulation motion was negatively correlated to familial anxiety risk. Results suggest differential theory-driven threat response phases and support previous literature connecting maternal child risk to anxiety with behavioral measures using more feasible objective methods. This is the first study demonstrating the utility of an IMU for characterizing the motion of young children to mark the phases of threat response modulation. The technique provides a novel and objective measure of threat response for mental health researchers

AB ObjectivePreadolescent loss-of-control-eating (LOC-eating) is a risk factor for excess weight gain and binge-eating-disorder. We evaluated feasibility and acceptability of a preventive family-based interpersonal psychotherapy (FB-IPT) program. FB-IPT was compared to family-based health education (FB-HE) to evaluate changes in children's psychosocial functioning, LOC-eating, and body mass.
   MethodA randomized, controlled pilot trial was conducted with 29 children, 8 to 13 years who had overweight/obesity and LOC-eating. Youth-parent dyads were randomized to 12-week FB-IPT (n=15) or FB-HE (n=14) and evaluated at post-treatment, six-months, and one-year. Changes in child psychosocial functioning, LOC-eating, BMI, and adiposity by dual-energy-X-ray-absorptiometry were assessed. Missing follow-up data were multiply imputed.
   ResultsFB-IPT feasibility and acceptability were indicated by good attendance (83%) and perceived benefits to social interactions and eating. Follow-up assessments were completed by 73% FB-IPT and 86% FB-HE at post-treatment, 60% and 64% at six-months, and 47% and 57% at one-year. At post-treatment, children in FB-IPT reported greater decreases in depression (95% CI -7.23, -2.01, Cohen's d=1.23) and anxiety (95% CI -6.08, -0.70, Cohen's d=.79) and less odds of LOC-eating (95% CI -3.93, -0.03, Cohen's d=.38) than FB-HE. At six-months, children in FB-IPT had greater reductions in disordered-eating attitudes (95% CI -0.72, -0.05, Cohen's d=.66) and at one-year, tended to have greater decreases in depressive symptoms (95% CI -8.82, 0.44, Cohen's d=.69) than FB-HE. There was no difference in BMI gain between the groups.
   DiscussionFamily-based approaches that address interpersonal and emotional underpinnings of LOC-eating in preadolescents with overweight/obesity show preliminary promise, particularly for reducing internalizing symptoms. Whether observed psychological benefits translate into sustained prevention of disordered-eating or excess weight gain requires further study.

AB Empirical evidence suggests maternal behavioral health problems are significant predictors of child behavioral health difficulties, but it is unclear of the specific relation of maternal alcohol use problems and depression symptoms with child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of maternal depression symptoms and alcohol use problems on children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems over a period of 5 years. Implications for intervention may differ depending on which type of maternal behavioral health concerns predicts which child behavior problem. A total of 1874 families eligible for Early Head Start participated. Maternal depression symptoms and alcohol use problems were assessed when children were in preschool, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were assessed when children were in fifth grade. Clinical internalizing behavior problems was best predicted by maternal depression symptoms, whereas clinical externalizing behavior problems was best predicted by maternal alcohol use problems. Children were almost twice as likely to have clinical internalizing behavior problems when mothers exhibited very elevated depression symptoms compared to when mothers displayed minimal symptoms. A similar relation was found with maternal alcohol use problems and clinical externalizing behavior problems. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and treating various kinds of behavioral health concerns in mothers of young children.

AB Gender differences in externalizing and internalizing pathways from child abuse to adult crime were examined across four waves of an extended longitudinal study (N = 186 males and 170 females) using multiple-group structural equation modeling. Results show that child abuse was associated with both internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the elementary school years for both males and females. However, gender differences were found such that internalizing behaviors increased the risk of adult crime for females only, and externalizing behaviors increased the risk of adult crime for males only. Internalizing behaviors among males actually lessened the risk of adult crime, and externalizing behaviors were unrelated to adult crime among females. Findings confirm distinct pathways leading from child abuse to later crime for males and females, which is important for prevention and intervention strategies.

AB In this meta-analytic and narrative review, we examine several overarching issues related to the study of coping, emotion regulation, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, including the conceptualization and measurement of these constructs. We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research.

AB Over the last decade Child Maltreatment has come to be considered a public health problem. Numerous studies analyzing its direct effects on children's mental health report a high prevalence in internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Cognitive Behavioral-Trauma Focused Therapy is the only treatment methodology which has been considered well established and as an effective treatment in the child-juvenile population. The technique of prolonged exposure is considered of choice for the treatment of PTSD, although many patients present difficulties in carrying it out. Virtual reality has become an alternative that facilitates the technique of exposure. Several systematic reviews have recently been published endorse the efficacy of Virtual Reality Exposure Based Therapy (VR-EBT) for the treatment of PTSD in the adult population. However, there are no studies on this therapy in the child and adolescent populations. The virtual reality system known as "EMMA'S WORLD" has been used in the adult population and based on this, the GUIIA-PC research team carried out the first adaptation in 2008 of this system called "EMMA-Child" in children who suffered chronic intra-family maltreatment. The present work aims to present the first experiences in the application of EMMA-Child in 8 children, highlighting how there are advantages over traditional treatment, and the scores before and after treatment in symptoms of anxiety, depression, anger, and hostility, adaptation, and post-traumatic stress.

AB Psychological assessment of mental health through the Internet can be an effective alternative to collect information. Commonly, these online assessments are carried out using self-report questionnaires extrapolated directly from paper-and-pencil formats, which does not always guarantee interformat reliability. The DetectaWeb-Distress scale is a new web-based questionnaire for the most common emotional disorders, which has reported initial support for its reliability and validity for the assessment of emotional symptoms (depressive and anxious disorders, and suicidal behaviors) in community samples of children and adolescents. However, psychometric data are unknown for its use with clinical samples. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide the first reliability and validity data for the DetectaWeb-Distress scale with clinical samples. A sample of 83 participants with a clinical diagnosis (8-18 years) completed the DetectaWeb-Distress scale along with other questionnaires of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and psychological well-being through a survey online. The results indicated a structural model of 10 correlated factors, high internal consistency, and adequate evidence of validity. Therefore, this measure could be considered a brief screening questionnaire, which is valid, innovative, and useful for early screening, epidemiological studies, and the evaluation of preventive programs of mental health with community and clinical programs. This is one of the first specific instruments for assessment emotional disorders through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), featuring robust psychometric properties and advantages related with this new way of assessment.

AB There is limited information regarding the association between youth mental health problems and work incapacity in adulthood. We investigated whether internalizing (depressive, anxious, somatic complaints) and externalizing (aggressive, rule-breaking) behavior problems in childhood and adolescence were associated with sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP) in young adulthood.
   Data were used from the population-based and prospective Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (TCHAD) which includes all Swedish twins born in 1985-1986 (N = 2570). Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist at ages of 8-9, 13-14, 16-17, and 19-20 years. Individuals participating in TCHAD were followed regarding SA and DP during 2001-2013 using nationwide registers. Cox regression models were applied to assess hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   Each one-unit increase of rule-breaking behavior implied a significant higher risk for SA in early adulthood, despite of age at assessment, with the highest HR of 1.12 (95% CI 1.05-1.19) at age of 8-9 years. Higher levels of anxious and depressive symptoms in childhood and adolescence were associated with DP in early adulthood despite age at assessment, with the highest risk at age 19-20 years [HR 1.31 (95% CI 1.12-1.53)]. The associations attenuated slightly when familial factors were taken into account.
   Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems identified at an early age (8-9 years) increased risk for SA and DP in young adulthood. These findings indicate that early prevention and intervention efforts to reduce behavior problems may promote a successful start in working life.

AB According to the neighborhood effects hypothesis, there is a negative relation between neighborhood wealth and youth's problem behavior. It is often assumed that there are more problems in deprived neighborhoods, but there are also reports of higher rates of behavioral problems in more affluent neighborhoods. Much of this literature does not take into account relative wealth. Our central question was whether the economic position of adolescents' families, relative to the neighborhood in which they lived, was related to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. We used longitudinal data for youth between 12-16 and 16-20 years of age, combined with population register data (N = 926; 55% females). We employ between-within models to account for time-invariant confounders, including parental background characteristics. Our findings show that, for adolescents, moving to a more affluent neighborhood was related to increased levels of depression, social phobia, aggression, and conflict with fathers and mothers. This could be indirect evidence for the relative deprivation mechanism, but we could not confirm this, and we did not find any gender differences. The results do suggest that future research should further investigate the role of individuals' relative position in their neighborhood in order not to overgeneralize neighborhood effects and to find out for whom neighborhoods matter.

AB This retrospective longitudinal study in young children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aimed to identify if, and how early problems in behavior, intelligence, and language development are associated with later behavioral problems. At the first assessment at preschool age, we evaluated language skills, intelligence, and emotional and behavioral problems as reported by parents. The second assessment at school-age we evaluated intelligence, and emotional and behavioral problems as reported by parents and teachers. Association of baseline assessments with secondary assessment was evaluated using multivariable linear regression analysis. Of the 61 patients (25 males, 36 females; mean age 4;5 years [SD 1;1 years]) with NF1 who had a first assessment, 38 children (21 males, 17 females; mean age 7;11 years [SD 2;1 years]) had a second assessment after a mean period of 3;5 years. Longitudinal data on behavioral problems were collected for 23 of these children. Intelligence and language development were not associated with internalizing problems. Parent-rated internalizing behavioral problems significantly increased with age in this subgroup. Baseline internalizing problems predicted later internalizing problems (adjusted R-2=0.33, p=0.003). The presence of these problems at pre-school age may be predictive of internalizing problems at a later age.

AB Purpose Gender dysphoria (GD) is associated with clinically significant distress and impairment in social, scholastic, and other important areas of functioning, especially when early onset is reported. The aim of the present study is to assess the psychopathological features associated with GD in adolescence, comparing a group of gender dysphoric adolescents (GDs) with a group of non-referred adolescents (NRs), in terms of body uneasiness, suicide risk, psychological functioning, and intensity of GD.
   Methods A sample of 46 adolescents with GD and 46 age-matched NRs was evaluated (mean +/- SD age = 16.00 +/- 1.49 and 16.59 +/- 1.11 respectively, p > 0.05). Subjects were asked to complete the Body Uneasiness Test (BUT) to explore body uneasiness, the Youth Self Report (YSR) to measure psychological functioning, the Multi-Attitude Suicide Tendency Scale (MAST) for suicide risk, and the Gender Identity/Gender Dysphoria Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults (GIDYQ-AA) for GD assessment.
   Results Adolescents with GD reported significantly higher levels of body uneasiness (BUT-GSI, F = 380.13, p < 0.0001), as well as a worse psychological functioning (YSR, F = 13.06 and p < 0.0001 for "total problem scale" and F = 12.53, p = 0.001 for "internalizing" scale) as compared to NRs. When YSR subscales were considered, GDs showed significantly higher scores in the "withdrawal/depression", "anxiety/depression", and "social problems" (all p < 0.0001). In addition, GDs showed significantly higher levels in the "attraction to death" and "repulsion by life" scales and lower scores in the "attraction to life" scale (all p < 0.0001). Finally, GIDYQ-AA score was significantly lower (meaning a higher level of gender dysphoria symptoms) in GDs vs. NRs (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions GD adolescents reported significantly higher body dissatisfaction and suicidal risk compared to NRs. In addition, results confirmed a significant impairment in social psychological functioning in adolescents with GD.

AB This study evaluated whether community therapists delivering family therapy for adolescent behavior problems in usual care achieved performance benchmarks established in controlled trials for treatment fidelity and outcomes, with particular focus on individual differences in therapist performance. The study contained N = 38 adolescents (50 % male; mean age 15 years) whose self-reported race/ethnicity was Hispanic (74 %), African American (11 %), multiracial (11 %), and other (4 %). Clients were treated by 13 therapists in one community mental health clinic that delivered family therapy as the routine standard of care. Therapists provided self-report data on adherence to core family therapy techniques; these scores were inflation-adjusted based on concordance with observer reports. Results showed that community therapists surpassed the fidelity benchmark for core family therapy techniques established by research therapists during a controlled trial. Regarding change in client functioning at 6-month follow-up, community therapists were equivalent to the benchmark for internalizing symptoms and superior for externalizing symptoms and delinquent acts. Community therapists also demonstrated a high degree of performance uniformity: Each one approximated the fidelity benchmark, and only two produced relatively weak outcomes on any of the client change indicators. Caveats for interpreting therapist performance data, given the small sample size, are described. Recommendations are made for developing therapist-report fidelity measures and utilizing statistical process control methods to diagnose therapist differences and enhance quality assurance procedures.

AB Many community mental health (CMH) systems contain inefficiencies, contributing to unmet need for services among youth. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we examined the implementation of an adapted structural-strategic family intervention, Parenting with Love and Limits, in a state CMH system to increase efficiency of services to youth with co-existing internalizing and externalizing functional impairments (PLL n = 296; Treatment-As-Usual n = 296; 54% male; 81% Caucasian). Youth receiving PLL experienced shorter treatment durations and returned to CMH services at significantly lower rates than youth receiving treatment-as-usual. They also demonstrated significant decreases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms over time. Findings lay the foundation for further examination of the role of an adapted structural-strategic family treatment in increasing the efficiency of CMH systems.

AB Maladaptive adolescent behavior patterns often create escalating conflict with adults and peers, leading to poor long-term social trajectories. To address this, school-based behavior management often consists of contingent reinforcement for appropriate behavior, behavior reduction procedures, and placement in self-contained or alternative settings. Yet, these commonplace practices may not foster the self-regulation processes necessary to override the habitual and negative response sequences that prohibit independent and sustained positive social functioning. As such, we developed I Control, a curriculum to teach middle school students with significant behavior problems how to engage in appropriate social self-regulation. Pre-post pilot data analyses using Mplus from 152 students in 14 schools/17 classrooms indicated that students taught I Control evidenced more positive scores than controls on teacher-reported contextualized executive function, externalizing behavior problems, and general problem behavior, and student-reported emotional control, social problem solving, and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Also, students who were taught the curriculum had greater curricular knowledge than control students. These positive findings indicate that I Control warrants more extensive investigation.

AB The School Refusal Assessment Scale (SRAS) was developed to identify four factors that might maintain a youth's school attendance problem (SAP), and thus be targeted for treatment. There is still limited support for the four-factor model inherent to the SRAS and its revision (SRAS-R). Recent studies indicate problems with the wording of eight items added to the SRAS to form the SRAS-R. We examined the factorial validity of an adapted item set comprising 16 of the 24 SRAS-R items and eight items developed for this study. The eight items paralleled the content of the SRAS-R items being replaced but were less complex and ambiguous. Data were gathered from 199 youth with a SAP and 131 parents. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the adapted item set supported a four-factor model. Internal consistency reliability of the subscales was higher than it is commonly reported in SRAS-R studies. Concurrent validity was supported by associations between the four factors and measures of internalizing or externalizing behavior. The adapted SRAS-R may help professionals reliably assess the relative strength of factors maintaining SAPs. This is one of the few studies conducted independent of the instrument's developer and in a school culture different from that where the instrument is usually tested.

AB As part of universal screening efforts in schools, validated measures that identify internalizing distress are needed. One promising available measure, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), has yet to be thoroughly investigated with adolescents in the United States. This study investigated the underlying factor structure of the DASS-21 in a sample of U.S. adolescents (N = 2,454) by using confirmatory factor analytic techniques to test several alternate models. A bifactor model specifying general Negative Affectivity and three specific factors of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress yielded the best fit. Results from this study suggest that (a) the DASS-21 scales reflect a common factor, indicating that a total score of the DASS-21 can be derived as a measure of general negative affectivity, and (b) the DASS-21 may not adequately differentiate between the experiences of negative affectivity, anxiety, and stress in U.S. adolescents.

AB Behavioral and emotional problems among children and adolescents can lead to numerous negative outcomes without intervention. From a prevention standpoint, screening for behavioral and emotional risk is an important step toward identifying such problems before the point of diagnosis or referral. The present study conducted a k-means cluster analysis to determine the subtypes of risk captured by one such screening instrument, the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System (BESS). The final solution produced four clusters: Well-Adapted, Internalizing/Adjustment Problems, Mild Externalizing Problems, and General Problems-Severe; these results were similar to those found with the full Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2), suggesting that the BESS assesses similar constructs. Predictive validity evidence suggested that cluster membership was associated with standard achievement scores and in-school disciplinary incidents.

AB The present research examined how the within-person association between sexual initiation and internalizing symptoms decays over time, using data with annual measurement occasions across adolescence (N=1,789) and statistical models of within-person change. Sexual initiation was associated with increased levels of internalizing symptoms for early-initiating girls (ninth grade, approximately age 15), but not for on-time-initiating girls or for boys. The association between girls' early sexual initiation and internalizing symptoms declined precipitously over time. Indeed, 1year after sexual debut, early-initiating girls were similar to on-time or noninitiating girls on internalizing symptoms, suggesting early sexual initiation does not produce lasting detriments to girls' mental health. Findings inform how researchers perceive sexual initiation, both as a developmental milestone and as a prevention target.

AB This study was designed to test for specificity in the relationship between individual friendship provisions and adjustment across early adolescence. Using a narrative procedure, attachment (i.e., accessing care) and affiliation (i.e., forming cooperative partnerships) were found to be distinct functional themes organizing 293 adolescents' (M-age=13) internal representations of their best friendship across three annual measurement occasions. Longitudinal, cross-lag analyses revealed a unique transactional relationship between friendship affiliation and greater social competence over time, controlling for friendship stability, maternal relationship quality, socioeconomic status, and gender. By contrast, friendship attachment predicted fewer subsequent internalizing symptoms from ages 14 to 15. Together, findings point to the importance of understanding individual differences in the content of adolescents' internal representations of friendship.

AB Although evidence of negative associations between early literacy development and children's behavior problems exists, the field still lacks an understanding of the complicated links between these two areas. Children's gender has often not been included in much of the extant research as a potential moderating variable, yet gender differences may provide insights into the nuanced relationship between early literacy development and maladaptive behaviors. Results from the current study of 472 kindergarten and first-grade children suggested that compared with nonstruggling readers, teachers rated struggling readers as higher on internalizing behaviors and hyperactivity/inattention, but not externalizing behaviors, when accounting for children's socioeconomic status. Furthermore, higher levels of internalizing behaviors and hyperactivity/inattention in struggling readers predicted lower reading scores at the end of the school year across a variety of domains, but these negative effects were more prominent for young boys. Implications for early intervention are discussed.

AB Background: 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is one of the strongest known genetic risk factors for developing schizophrenia. Individuals with 22q11.2DS have high rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood, while in adulthood 25% develop schizophrenia. Similar to the general population, high rates of comorbidity are common in 22q11.2DS. Employing a dimensional approach where psychopathology is examined at the symptom-level as complementary to diagnostic categories in a population at such high genetic risk for schizophrenia can help gain a better understanding of how psychopathology is structured as well as its genetic underpinnings. This is the first study to examine the dimensional structure of a wide spectrum of psychopathology in the context of a homogeneous genetic etiology like 22q11.2DS.
   Methods: We evaluated 331 individuals with 22q11.2DS, mean age (SD) = 16.9(8.7); 51% males, who underwent prospective comprehensive phenotyping. We sought to replicate previous findings by examining a bi-factor model that derives a general factor of psychopathology in addition to more specific dimensions of psychopathology (i.e., internalizing, externalizing and thought disorder).
   Results: Psychopathology in 22q11.2DS was divided into one 'general psychopathology' factor and four specific dimensions (i.e., 'anxiety', 'mood', 'ADHD' and 'psychosis'). The 'psychosis' symptoms loaded strongly on the 'general psychopathology' factor.
   Conclusions: The similarity of the symptom structure of psychopathology between 22q11.2DS and community and clinical populations without the deletion indicate that 22q11.2DS can provide a model to explore alternative approaches to our current nosology. Our findings add to a growing literature indicating the need to reorganize current diagnostic classification systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lower vagal activity is associated with psychopathology independent of age. Research suggests that alterations of vagal activity precede the development of psychopathology. The present review aimed to quantify sex differences in vagal activity in children and adolescents. Studies reporting on sex differences on measures of vagally-mediated heart rate variability derived from short-term recordings under resting conditions in boys and girls were included. Drawing on data from more than 5,000 children and adolescents, we provide evidence that healthy young girls display lower vagal activity and greater mean heart rate compared to boys, a finding that may have implications for risk associated with the development of internalizing psychopathology and somatic ill-health.

AB Background: Studies conducted mainly in high-income countries have shown that preterm births are associated with increased risk of behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of behavioral problems from middle-childhood to early-adolescence according to gestational age at birth in a middle-income setting.
   Methods: A population-based birth cohort (n = 4231) in Pelotas, Brazil, was followed-up in several occasions from birth to 11 years. Estimated GA was based on last menstrual period or, when unknown or inconsistent, on the Dubowitz method. Behavioral problems were assessed at 4 (Child Behavior Checklist - CBCL), and at 6 and 11 years (Development and Well-Being Assessment - DAWBA) tool. Maternal socio-economic characteristics and depression at 2, 4 and 6 years post-partum, child perinatal characteristics and breastfeeding duration were used as confounders. Analyses were run by linear and logistic regression.
   Results: Three thousand two hundred four children had full information on gestational age, CBCL and DAWBA. At 4 years, mean total (42.9 +/- 24.0) and mean externalizing (18.8 +/- 9.1) CBCL scores were higher among preterm girls born at < 34 weeks than among full term girls (33.2 +/- 15.1 and 15.0 +/- 6.6, respectively). After controlling for confounders the association was no longer significant. At the age of 6 years there was no association between gestational age and behavior, neither in crude nor in adjusted analyses. Odds ratio for any psychiatric disorders at 11 years was 60% (1.6; 1.1-2.1) higher among those born at 34-36 weeks than in full-term children, but the association disappeared in adjusted analyses.
   Conclusion: At this large cohort, behavioral problems from middle-childhood to early-adolescence are more related to family socio-economic characteristics and to other child perinatal conditions than to gestational age at birth.

AB This study examined the role of parenting styles and parental warmth in moderating relations between exposure to political life events and mental health symptoms among 277 Israeli adolescents aged 12-14 and their parents, who had been exposed to protracted periods of war, missile bombardments, and terrorism. Adolescents completed the Political Life Events (PLE) scale, Brief Symptom Inventory and questionnaires regarding parenting style and parental warmth. The primary caregiver completed the Child Behavior Checklist for assessment of the child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results confirmed that severity of PLE exposure was positively correlated with psychological distress and with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Maternal authoritativeness and warmth functioned as protective factors and had moderating effects on the relation between PLE exposure and mental health symptoms. In contrast, maternal authoritarianism exacerbated the relation between PLE exposure and children's externalizing symptoms. Fathers' parenting style and warmth had no significant relationship with children's mental health outcomes. These findings have important clinical and practical implications for parental guidance and support during periods of war and armed conflict.

AB Background: Anxiety and depression are among the most common mental disorders during childhood and adolescence. Among the instruments for the brief screening assessment of symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) is one of the more widely used. Previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of the RCADS for different assessment settings and different versions. The aims of this study were to examine the mean reliability of the RCADS and the influence of the moderators on the RCADS reliability.
   Methods: We searched in EBSCO, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and NCBI databases and other articles manually from lists of references of extracted articles.
   Results: A total of 146 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The RCADS showed robust internal consistency reliability in different assessment settings, countries, and languages. We only found that reliability of the RCADS was significantly moderated by the version of RCADS. However, these differences in reliability between different versions of the RCADS were slight and can be due to the number of items.
   Limitations: We did not examine factor structure, factorial invariance across gender, age, or country, and test retest reliability of the RCADS.
   Conclusions: The RCADS is a reliable instrument for cross-cultural use, with the advantage of providing more information with a low number of items in the assessment of both anxiety and depression symptoms in children and adolescents.

AB Background: The death of a parent is a highly stressful life event for bereaved children. Several studies have shown an increased risk of mental ill-health and psychosocial problems among affected children. The aims of this study were to systematically review studies about effective support interventions for parentally bereaved children and to identify gaps in the research.
   Methods: The review's inclusion criteria were comparative studies with samples of parentally bereaved children. The focus of these studies were assessments of the effects on children of a bereavement support intervention. The intervention was directed towards children 0-18 years; but it could also target the children's remaining parent/caregiver. The study included an outcome measure that dealt with effects of the intervention on children. The following electronic databases were searched up to and including November 2015: PubMed, PsycINFO, Cinahl, PILOTS, ProQuest Sociology (Sociological Abstracts and Social Services Abstracts). The included studies were analysed and summarized based on the following categories: type of intervention, reference and grade of evidence, study population, evaluation design, measure, outcome variable and findings as effect size within and between groups.
   Results: One thousand, seven hundred and-six abstracts were examined. Following the selection process, 17 studies were included. The included studies consisted of 15 randomized controlled studies, while one study employed a quasiexperimental and one study a pre-post-test design. Thirteen studies provided strong evidence with regards to the quality of the studies due to the grade criteria; three studies provided fairly strong evidence and one study provided weaker evidence.
   The included studies were published between 1985 and 2015, with the majority published 2000 onwards. The studies were published within several disciplines such as psychology, social work, medicine and psychiatry, which illustrates that support for bereaved children is relevant for different professions. The interventions were based on various forms of support: group interventions for the children, family interventions, guidance for parents and camp activities for children. In fourteen studies, the interventions were directed at both children and their remaining parents. These studies revealed that when parents are supported, they can demonstrate an enhanced capacity to support their children. In three studies, the interventions were primarily directed at the bereaved children. The results showed positive between group effects both for children and caregivers in several areas, namely large effects for children's traumatic grief and parent's feelings of being supported; medium effects for parental warmth, positive parenting, parent's mental health, grief discussions in the family, and children's health. There were small effects on several outcomes, for example children's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, anxiety, depression, self-esteem and behaviour problems. There were studies that did not show effects on some measures, namely depression, present grief, and for the subgroup boys on anxiety, depression, internalizing and externalizing.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that relatively brief interventions can prevent children from developing more severe problems after the loss of a parent, such as traumatic grief and mental health problems. Studies have shown positive effects for both children's and remaining caregiver's health. Further research is required including how best to support younger bereaved children. There is also a need for more empirically rigorous effect studies in this area.

AB Validated brief screening instruments are needed to improve the detection of anxiety disorders in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), a 41-item parent-and self-reported scale measuring anxiety, was compared to the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) scales. One hundred participants with a clinical diagnosis of high-functioning ASD, aged 8-18 years, and their parents completed the above scales. We hypothesized that the SCARED would be useful in screening for anxiety and its results for total scores of anxiety would converge with ASEBA syndrome scales for anxiety and internalizing disorders. Significant correlations were shown between the SCARED and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) across a broad spectrum of scales. The CBCL syndrome scale for anxious/depressed showed the highest correlation and predicted anxiety scores on the SCARED. While many of the YSR scales significantly correlated with child ratings of anxiety, none of the scales predicted the SCARED child scores. Differences in self and parent reports suggest that parents interpret externalizing behaviors as signs of anxiety in ASD, whereas youth may describe internalized symptoms as anxiety. Females were more likely to self-report anxiety than males. Results support the use of the SCARED as a screening tool for anxiety in high-functioning ASD, but it should be supplemented with other tools to increase the specificity of its results.

AB The self-equilibrium hypothesis underlines the importance of having a strong core self, which is defined as a high and developmentally stable self-concept. This study tested this hypothesis in relation to body image (BI) trajectories in a sample of 1,006 adolescents (M-age = 12.6, including 541 males and 465 females) across a 4-year period. The results supported the self-equilibrium hypothesis among 3 profiles of adolescents, all characterized by matching BI levels and stability: (a) High (48.0%); (b) Increasing (34.1%); and (c) Decreasing (17.9%). Boys presented higher levels of BI, and the quality of relationships with peers and parents predicted initially more desirable trajectories across gender. By the end of the study, more positive academic outcomes were associated with the Decreasing profile, lower internalizing problems with the High profile, and lower externalizing problems with the High and the Increasing profiles.

AB The study described in this article sought to enhance the social interaction skills of 3 preschool children using video modeling. All children had been assessed as having difficulties in their interactions with peers. Two were above average on internalizing problems and the third was above average on externalizing problems. The study used a delayed multiple probe across participants design and was situated in a preschool setting. Videos were individualized for each participant based on age, gender, ethnicity, and individual needs. The models demonstrated appropriate play behavior with peers. Positive outcomes were achieved for 2 participants. The findings suggest that although the social interaction skills of preschool children can be enhanced in their natural environment through the use of video modeling; video modeling alone might not be sufficient for addressing the needs of children with externalizing problems.

AB The child victimization rate in the US has rapidly grown over the past five years. Today, nine out of every 1000 children are victims of some type of child maltreatment, and lifetime costs of child victimization exceed $100 billion per year. Effective policies promoting fairness and child safety must target the most salient indicators of child maltreatment. In this study, we examined three groups of risk factors for child abuse potential with the goal of identifying the most prominent indicators in a sample of 170 African-American and Latina mothers. Specifically, we analyzed the effect of socio-demographic variables (e.g., SES), child-specific behaviors, maternal trauma and corresponding psychological sequelae on child abuse potential. Variables from all three groups were significantly associated with child abuse potential with maternal SES, alexithymia, depression, and child self-control as well as internalizing behaviors having the largest effects. All factors combined captured over 50% of the variation in child abuse potential. The results highlight the need for programs that not only address the financial needs of low SES mothers, but also the mental health outcomes correlated with low SES. Particular emphasis should also be placed on interventions that address children's social needs, specifically their socio-emotional functioning.

AB Resilience, commonly understood as the ability to maintain adaptive functioning in the face of adversity, has emerged as a salient entry point in the field of positive youth development. This study makes a unique contribution by exploring dimensions of resilience among adolescents in Uganda, examining associations between violence from different perpetrators and resilience, and testing whether sex moderates these relationships. Analyses are based on data from 3706 primary school students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified five factors underlying the construct of resilience: Emotional Support; Family Connectedness; School Connectedness; Social Assets; and Psychological Assets. We used regression analysis to investigate associations between these dependent variables, background characteristics, and experiences of violence (including exposure to intimate partner violence against female caregivers). Results reflect a complex relationship between violence and resilience, with patterns varying by perpetrator (e.g., teacher, peers, caregivers) and some evidence that the sex of the student moderates these dynamics. Overall, there is a consistently negative relationship between all violence measures and Psychological Assets. In addition, teacher violence is associated with lower resilience across factors and both caregiver violence and exposure to IPV are consistently associated with decreased Family Connectedness. These findings suggest that adolescents experiencing (and exposed to) violence from adults may be particularly vulnerable to internalizing and/or externalizing behaviors and withdrawal from the family. Findings point to preventing violence from teachers complemented with enhancing family relationships as promising avenues for resilience-strengthening interventions, and also emphasize the need to consider gendered strategies to ensure girls and boys benefit equally.

AB Background Observational rating instruments are an important supplement to explore the need for interventions in the framework of an adequate treatment in detention centers. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of a newly developed observational instrument for juvenile detainees (BEO-GF-J).
   Method The BEO-GF-J was applied in a sample of 126 juvenile prison inmates (mean age = 16.83 years, standard deviation = 1.11 years). A factor analysis was used to examine the factor structure of the 18 items in the BEO-GF-J. The association of the BEO-GF-J with interview-based internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders, with later recidivistic criminal offences (official data) and with interventions during detention were examined.
   Results Depressive and anxious behavior was observed most frequently in the juveniles (38-39%). Threatening and impulsive behavior (15-33%) and suicidality (4-9%) were less frequently observed. The factor analysis showed evidence for two significant factors of the BEO-GF-J, which represent aggression (BEO-A) and emotional problems (BEO-E). The interrater reliability and the internal consistency were found to be satisfactory. The total score and the emotional problem scale indicated the presence of internalizing disorders and suicidality. The BEO-GF-J did not predict later criminal behavior, but was found to be related to interventions during incarceration.
   Conclusion The BEO-GF-J is a promising screening tool to identify adolescents who need further assessment and psychiatric interventions.

AB An increasing prevalence of mental health problems calls for more knowledge into factors associated with resilience. The present study used multiple statistical methodologies to examine a biopsychosocial model of risk and resilience on preadolescence behavior. Data from 889 children and mothers from a birth cohort were used. An adversity score was created by combining maternal symptoms of depression, psychosocial risk and children's experiences of life events. The proposed resilience factors investigated were candidate genetic polymorphisms, child temperament, social functioning, and maternal sense of coherence. The l/ l genotype of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region was associated with lower internalizing scores, but not mainly related to the level of adversity. An easy temperament was associated with resilience for children exposed to high adversity. Social functioning was found to be promotive independent of the risk level. The results support a multiple-level model of resilience indicating effects, though small, of both biological and psychosocial factors.

AB Sleep problems are associated with problematic adjustment in toddlers, but less is known regarding the direction of association between specific sleep problems and adjustment. To address this gap, we used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1001) to examine reciprocal associations between sleep problems and behavior problems from 24- to 36-months. Results from cross-lagged path models suggested specificity of associations between type of sleep problem and behavior problem. Specifically, there were reciprocal associations between trouble getting to sleep and internalizing problems, and unidirectional links between externalizing problems and bedtime resistance from 24- to 36-months. Internalizing and externalizing problems at 24 months, however, predicted increases in bedtime resistance from 24-to 36-months for boys, but not girls. Findings highlight specific relations between sleep problems and internalizing and externalizing problems during toddlerhood, and the importance of examining sex differences.

AB Objective To examine the trajectories of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems of preterm children between 16 months and 6 years of age and predictors of trajectories, including gestational age, child dysregulation, maternal depression, socioeconomic status, and parenting.
   Study design This longitudinal study followed 148 children and their mothers from neonatal intensive care unit discharge until 6 years of age. Gestational ages ranged from 23 to 36 weeks. The study included assessment of maternal-reported behavior problems, maternal depression, neonatal and socioeconomic characteristics, and observations of dysregulated behavior and parenting. Trajectories were identified with a semiparametric groupbased analytic method, and multinomial logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors.
   Results Three distinct trajectories for preterm children were found for both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. For the 2 groups with greater behavior problems (groups 1 and 2), trajectories reached their peak between 24 and 36 months of age, then leveled off or decreased. Group 3 showed a stable low level of externalizing behaviors, and a low, but slightly increasing level of internalizing behaviors. Maternal depression, child dysregulation, gestational age, and socioeconomic challenges were identified as risk factors that predicted less optimal behavior problem trajectories.
   Conclusions Children born prematurely followed 1 of 3 distinct developmental trajectories for both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The most severe behavior problems started early in development and were associated with increased child dysregulation, maternal depression, and lower socioeconomic status. These findings have implications for screening and monitoring preterm children.

AB Objective: The information about the etiology of anxiety disorders are still limited however anxiety disorders are prevalent disorders in childhood. In this study it is aimed to evaluate the relation of emotion regulation and anxiety level of children diagnosed with anxiety disorder with attachment and emotion regulation in the children's mother and it is also aimed to compare the results with healthy controls. Methods: The study group consisted of 64 children 8-12 years old) diagnosed with anxiety disorder and their mothers. The control group (78 children and mothers) comprised patients of other clinics at hospital and was matched for gender and age to the anxious patients. We evaluated disorder severity at the time of assessment using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). Emotional Regulation Checklist (ERC) was used to examine children emotional regulation. Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to indicate maternal emotional dysregulation status, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) was used for anxiety sensitivity in mothers and Experiences in Close Relationship Scale-II was used to evaluate attachment properties in mothers. Results: SCARED child and parent form scores were compared with anxiety sensitivity index, ERC subscales, DERS and ASI with Pearson's correlation analysis. Positive correlation was found between SCARED child, parent form scores and ERC emotional lability scores, social, physical, cognitive anxiety scores of ASI, maternal anxious attachment and DERS scores and negative correlation was found between SCARED child, parent form scores and ERC emotional regulation scores. There was no relation between SCARED child, parent form scores and maternal avoidant attachment. Conclusion: This is the first study which evaluated the relationship of emotion regulation difficulties of children, who are diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and maternal attachment properties and maternal emotion regulation. The anxiety symptoms may decrease with using cognitive behavioral methods in emotion regulation difficulties of children diagnosed with anxiety disorder.

AB Adoption marks a radical transition in caregiving for thousands of children adopted internationally from institutional care; however, very little is known about the quality of this parenting compared with other populations or the transactional effects of parent and child characteristics in postadoption families during the transition to family care. The current study examined parental sensitivity/responsiveness and structure/limit-setting in a group of 68 children adopted internationally from institutions (41 girls, 27 boys; M age = 26.13 months, SD = 4.99) and their parents over the first year after adoption and compared them to a sample of nonadoptive families (26 girls, 26 boys; M age = 27.65 months, SD = 5.71). Results indicated no mean-level differences in parenting quality on either dimension between adoptive and nonadoptive parents. For postinstitutionalized youth, higher quality parental structure and limit-setting soon after adoption predicted reduced child regulation difficulties 8 months later; however, initial child regulation did not predict later parenting. There were no cross-lagged relations for parental sensitivity/responsiveness. Higher quality preadoptive care for children was associated with higher scores on both sensitivity/responsiveness and structure and limit-setting among adoptive parents. Less growth stunting, indicative of less preadoptive adversity, was associated with parents' use of more effective structure and limit-setting behaviors. Policies should promote better preadoptive care abroad, such as lower caregiver-child ratios, as well as early adoption. At least in families exhibiting generally high sensitivity/responsiveness, interventions should target parental structure and limit-setting to have the greatest effect on child behavioral regulation in the immediate years postadoption.

AB The present study investigated the associations between multigenerational continuity in family conflict and current psychopathology symptoms and social impairment experienced by parents and adolescents. We sampled 246 families from a multigenerational, high-risk, longitudinal study of parents (G1s) and their children (G2s), followed from adolescence (M-age = 14.3 years, 57% female, 71% Caucasian, 26% Hispanic or Latino) to adulthood as well as the children of G2 targets (G3s; M-age = 12.1 years, 47% female, 51% Caucasian, 33% Hispanic or Latino). Family conflict was measured by composite latent variables incorporating mother, father, and adolescent reports in G1-G2 families and incorporating G2 target, G2 target's spouse, and G3 adolescent report in G2-G3 families. Indicators of G2 and G3 impairment including psychopathology symptoms (e.g., internalizing, externalizing, and substance use symptoms) and social role impairment (e.g., marital satisfaction, parenting behavior) were predicted from G1-G2 family conflict, G2-G3 family conflict, and the interaction between G1-G2 and G2-G3 family conflict. Results indicate that G1-G2 family conflict uniquely predicted indicators of G2 and G3 psychopathology, as well as G2 social impairment, even after controlling for more temporally proximal G2-G3 family conflict. Results further indicate that for G2 externalizing, internalizing, and marital functioning outcomes, high G2-G3 family conflict was associated with highest G2 impairment when G1-G2 family conflict was also high. It appears that for many G2 outcomes the interactive effects of multigenerational conflict are associated with greater risk for impairment.

AB Western Studies show that father involvement is predictive of adolescent development; however, there are few studies that demonstrate this relationship in Chinese cultures, including Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of father involvement on adolescents' development in areas of academic achievement, self-esteem, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors in Taiwan. This study utilized dyadic data of 1043 10th graders from wave 5 of a longitudinal study on adolescent development in Taiwan. The study utilized student reports of father involvement, child academic achievement, externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, and self-esteem. Structural equation modeling results indicate father involvement significantly predicts child academic achievement, externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, and self-esteem. Gender analysis shows that male adolescents exhibited more externalizing behaviors, whereas female adolescents exhibited more internalizing behaviors. The findings of this study provide evidence that father involvement is important for the overall wellbeing of adolescents in Chinese cultures.

AB The phenotype and genotype of antisocial behavior among females are different from those among males. Previous studies have documented structural brain alterations in males with antisocial behavior, yet little is known about the neural correlates of female antisocial behavior. The present study examined young women who had presented conduct disorder (CDW) prior to age 15 to determine whether brain abnormalities are present in adulthood and whether the observed abnormalities are associated with comorbid disorders or maltreatment that typically characterize this population. Using magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry, we compared gray matter volumes (GMV) of 31 women who presented CD by midadolescence and 25 healthy women (HW), age, on average, 23 years. Participants completed structured, validated interviews to diagnose mental disorders, and validated questionnaires to document physical and sexual abuse. Relative to HW, CDW presented increased GMV in the left superior temporal gyrus that was associated with past alcohol and drug dependence, current use of alcohol and drugs, and current anxiety and depression symptoms and maltreatment. Additionally, CDW displayed reduced GMV in lingual gyrus, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex that was associated with past comorbid disorders, current alcohol and drugs use, current anxiety and depression symptoms, and maltreatment. The CDW also presented reduced total GMV that was associated with past comorbid disorders and current anxiety/depression symptoms. Alterations of brain structure were observed among young adult females with prior CD, relative to HW, all of which were associated with internalizing and externalizing disorders and maltreatment that typically accompany CD.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the plausibility of a risk prediction tool in infancy for school-entry emotional and behavioral problems. Familial aggregation has been operationalized previously as maternal psychopathology. The hypothesis was tested that older sibling (OS) psychopathology, as an indicator of familial aggregation, would enable a fair level of risk prediction compared with previous research, when combined with traditional risk factors.
   METHODS: By using a longitudinal design, data on child and family risk factors were collected on 323 infants (M = 2.00 months), all of whom had OSs. Infants were followed up 4.5 years later when both parents provided ratings of emotional and behavioral problems. Multiple regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted for emotional, conduct, and attention problems separately.
   RESULTS: The emotional and behavioral problems of OSs at infancy were the strongest predictors of the same problems in target children 4.5 years later. Other risk factors, including maternal depression and socioeconomic status provided extra, but weak, significant prediction. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for emotional and conduct problems yielded a fair prediction.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to offer a fair degree of prediction from risk factors at birth to school-entry emotional and behavioral problems. This degree of prediction was achieved with the inclusion of the emotional and behavioral problems of OSs (thus limiting generalizability to children with OSs). The inclusion of OS psychopathology raises risk prediction to a fair level.

AB The current study examined the prospective relationship between distress tolerance (DT) and positive and negative cigarette smoking outcome expectancies, which are reliable predictors of the onset and maintenance of smoking behaviors. Data from a longitudinal study (N = 204) examining risk behaviors in adolescence were used to assess whether DT predicts individual differences in rate of change in smoking outcome expectancies over 4 annual assessment waves through adolescence. Adolescents (mean age at first wave: 13.03 years; SD = 0.88 years) completed a behavioral task assessing DT at baseline and a self-report measure of adolescent smoking expectancies annually across 4 years. Latent growth curve models were estimated to test our hypotheses. Results showed that DT at baseline did not significantly predict initial levels of negative affect reduction (NAR) expectancies, but NAR expectancies increased more quickly over time for adolescents with lower DT. Moreover, as hypothesized, DT did not prospectively predict significant changes in smoking expectancies outside of the domain of NAR, including negative physical feelings, negative social impression, and boredom reduction expectancies. These findings suggest that DT is a useful indicator of adolescent expectancies about the consequences of cigarette smoking, particularly those focused on reducing negative affect. Thus, DT may be an important target for preventing smoking initiation among adolescents via this putative mechanism. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed within the context of observed effect sizes.

AB While the degree of concordance between parent and adolescent self-report of internalizing and externalizing pathology is well studied, virtually nothing is known about concordance in borderline pathology and the implication of parent-adolescent discrepancies for outcomes. The present study aimed to (1) examine discrepancies between parents and adolescents on two interview-based measures of borderline personality disorder (BPD)the Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R-22) and the Childhood Interview for Borderline Personality Disorder (CI-BPD23); and (2) investigate the implications of discrepancies for clinical outcomes. Diagnostic concordance on the DIB-R and CI-BPD showed rates of 82% and 94% respectively, with lower concordance demonstrated for dimensionally scored variables. Standardized difference scores between adolescent and parent reports on both borderline measures were significantly correlated with few interview-based axis I diagnoses as reported by parents, but not adolescents themselves. Implications regarding the use of each measure for the assessment and diagnosis of borderline personality disorder are discussed. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective A cancer diagnosis during pregnancy may be considered as an emotional challenge for pregnant women and their partners. We aimed to identify women and partners at risk for high levels of distress based on their coping profile.
   Methods Sixty-one pregnant women diagnosed with cancer and their partners filled out the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) and the newly constructed Cancer and Pregnancy Questionnaire (CPQ). K-means cluster analysis was performed on the CERQ scales. Scores on the CPQ were compared between the women and their partners and between the CERQ-clusters.
   Results Comparison of women and partners on the CPQ did not reveal significant differences on distress about the child's health, the cancer disease, and the pregnancy or on information satisfaction (P = .16, P = .44, P = .50, and P=.47, respectively). However, women were more inclined to maintain the pregnancy than their partners (P = .011). Three clusters were retrieved based on the CERQ scales, characterized by positive coping, internalizing coping, and blaming. Women and partners using internalizing strategies had significantly higher scores on concerns about the child's health (P = .039), the disease and treatment (P < .001), and the pregnancy and delivery (P = .009) compared with positive and blaming strategies. No cluster differences were found for information satisfaction (P = .71) and tendency to maintain the pregnancy (P = .35).
   Conclusion Women and partners using internalizing coping strategies deal with the highest levels of distress and may benefit from additional psychosocial support.

AB Research studies using existing samples of individuals with autism spectrum disorders have identified differences in symptoms between males and females. Differences are typically reported in school age and adolescence, with similarities in symptom presentation at earlier ages. However, existing studies on sex differences are significantly limited, making it challenging to discern if, how, and at what point in development females with autism spectrum disorder actually exhibit a different behavioral presentation than males. The purpose of this study was to gather impressions from a large group of clinicians to isolate specific areas for future study of sex differences. Clinicians were surveyed about their opinions and perceptions of symptom severity in females, as compared to males, at different points during development. They were also asked to provide open-ended responses about female symptom presentation. Consistent with previous literature, clinicians noted more sex-related differences in restricted and repetitive behaviors and fewer differences for social communication features. Differences were most commonly observed in school age and adolescence, suggesting this time period as a critical and particularly vulnerable window for females with autism spectrum disorder. The results are discussed in the context of other male/female differences across development so that more targeted investigations of autism spectrum disorder sex differences across development.

AB Background: Internalizing disorders (IDs), consisting of the syndromes of anxiety and depression, are common, debilitating conditions often having onsets in adolescence. Scientists have developed dimensional self-report instruments that assess putative negative valence system (NVS) trait-like constructs as complimentary phenotypes to clinical symptoms. These include various measures that index temperamental predispositions to IDs and correlate with neural substrates of fear, anxiety, and affective regulation. This study sought to elucidate the overarching structure of putative NVS traits and their relationship to early manifestations of ID symptomatology.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 768 juvenile twin subjects ages 9-13. Together with ID symptoms, extant validated instruments were chosen to assess a broad spectrum of NVS traits: anxiety sensitivity, irritability, fearfulness, behavioral activation and inhibition, and neuroticism and extraversion. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA/CFA) were used to investigate the latent structure of the associations among these different constructs and ID symptoms. Bifactor modeling in addition to standard correlated-factor analytic approaches were applied.
   Results: Factor analyses produced a primary tripartite solution comprising anxiety/fear, dysphoria, and positive affect among all these measures. Competing DSM-like correlated factors and an RDoC-like NVS bifactor structure provided similar fit to these data.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the conceptual organization of a tripartite latent internalizing domain in developing children. This structure includes both clinical symptoms and a variety of self-report dimensional traits currently in use by investigators. These various constructs are, therefore, most informatively investigated using an inclusive, integrated approach.

AB Purpose: To inform efforts to reduce costly service utilization, the present study examined longitudinal trajectories of mental health-related outpatient and residential service use among at-risk youth with a history of early externalizing problems.
   Methods: A cohort of 809 children in the Fast Track Project, a multisite longitudinal study of children at risk for conduct disorder, were followed prospectively from kindergarten through 12th grade. They resided in high-risk areas with high rates of poverty, crime, and violence. Their outpatient and residential service use was assessed annually between sixth and 12th grades through parent report. Growth mixture modeling was applied to model individual differences in trajectories of service use during this period. Teacher, parent, and observer-reported childhood predictors of those trajectories were also examined.
   Results: Most youths had minimal service use during preadolescence into adolescence. However, approximately 31% had moderate probability of using outpatient counseling services, and approximately 8% had elevated probability of seeing a family doctor for mental health needs. For residential services, approximately 6% had moderate to high probability of service use that peaked during transition to high school, whereas close to 5% had service use that dramatically increased during high school. Childhood predictors of these trajectories included earlier externalizing, internalizing, and emotion regulation problems.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to use person-centered analytic methods to examine longitudinal trajectories in mental health-related service use among at-risk adolescents. Timely treatment for severe externalizing problems, comorbid internalizing problems, and emotion dysregulation during childhood may be crucial for preventing chronic service use.

AB The present study examined whether children with elevated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms display a unique pattern of emotion dysregulation as indexed by both parent report and physiological reactivity during experiences of failure. A sample of 61 children (9 to 13 years; M = 11.62, SD = 1.29; 48 % male) with and without clinical elevations in ADHD symptoms participated. Parent and teacher report of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms and parent report of internalizing problems were collected. Parents also provided ratings of children's emotional negativity/lability and emotion regulation. Children's physiological reactivity, based on changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance level (SCL), were assessed while they completed a manipulated social rejection task and impossible puzzle task. Regression analyses indicated that ADHD symptoms were associated with higher parent-rated emotional negativity/lability and with blunted RSA withdrawal in response to social rejection; these effects were not accounted for by co-occurring ODD symptoms or internalizing problems. ODD symptoms also were uniquely associated with parent ratings of poor emotion regulation. Internalizing problems were uniquely associated with emotional negativity/lability, poor emotion regulation, and increased SCL activity in response to social rejection. Results suggest that there may be a pattern of emotion dysregulation that is specific to ADHD symptomatology. The importance of contextual factors when examining physiological reactivity to stress in youth with ADHD is discussed.

AB Many studies examining the association between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and alcohol use during adolescence have focused on between-individual differences (rank order stability), comparing whether adolescents with elevated rates of alcohol use have higher BPD symptoms than those with lower rates of alcohol use. As such, the extent to which an individual's alcohol use is associated with concurrent and future BPD symptoms has been relatively unstudied. The current study assessed year-to-year fluctuations in alcohol use and BPD symptoms in a large urban sample of girls from age 14 to age 17 (N = 2450). The primary aim was to examine whether increases in alcohol use were associated with increases in adolescent girls' BPD symptoms in the same year and in the following year. Results of fixed-effects (within-individual) models revealed that even while controlling for the time-varying impact of symptoms of both internalizing and externalizing disorders, prior and concurrent other substance use, and all time invariant, pre-existing differences between individuals, higher past-year alcohol use was associated with higher levels of BPD symptoms. Furthermore, this association did not vary by age, or by sociodemographic factors, including child race and socioeconomic status of the family. The results of this study indicate heightened risk for the exacerbation of BPD symptoms following increases in alcohol use frequency and highlight the potential utility of interventions targeting drinking behavior for preventing escalations in BPD symptoms.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between attachment, emotion regulation (ER), and risk for internalizing/externalizing problems in typically developing children. To this end, a mediation model was proposed in which attachment security was hypothesized to exert an indirect effect on internalizing/externalizing problems through ER. A sample of 212 preschoolers aged between 3 and 5 years old was included in the study. Children's attachment representations were assessed using the Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT); a story-stem task was also employed to evaluate children's ability to generate ER strategies in response to anger, sadness, and fear eliciting vignettes. Parents and teachers evaluated risk for emotional and behavioral problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF), respectively. The results showed that effective ER strategies mediated the relationship between attachment security and internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems. Furthermore, when effective ER strategies were differentiated, attachment security had a significant indirect effect on internalizing problems through problem-solving, but not on externalizing problems. Comforting was associated with increased attachment security, but not with ratings of internalizing/externalizing problems. Distraction was not associated with attachment security, and hence, exhibited only direct effects on reducing levels of internalizing and externalizing problems These findings suggested that in typically developing children distraction and problem-solving strategies might act as protective factors against mental health problems, but only problem-solving seems to be associated with children's perception about attachment when measured on a continuum from insecure to secure attachment.

AB Latent class (LCA) and latent profile (LPA) analysis represent methodological approaches to identify subgroups of maltreated individuals. Although research examining child abuse and neglect (CAN) profiles is still rare, the application of person-centered techniques to clarify CAN types co-occurrence has substantially increased in recent years. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide a summary and critical evaluation of the findings of LCA/LPA child maltreatment research to: (a) systemize the current understanding of patterns of maltreatment across populations and (b) elucidate interactive effects of CAN types on psychosocial functioning. A search in PsychInfo, Eric, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct, and Google Scholar was performed. Sixteen studies examining the co-occurrence between child physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and/or exposure to domestic violence were identified. A critical review of the studies revealed inconsistent findings as to the number of CAN classes, but most research uncovered a poly-victimized and a low abuse group. Further, multiple victimization was associated with most adverse internalizing and externalizing outcomes, especially when sexual abuse was present. Exposure to physical and emotional abuse was frequently reported to lead to behavioural problems. Based on the present study results, we provide a set of recommendations for surpassing the current methodological and conceptual limitations in future research.

AB The negative influence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) outcomes are well documented. However, no research to date has examined the effect of ACEs on SEB outcomes in youth who received mental health services after reporting to the child welfare system. This study's analyses of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II revealed that the most prevalent ACEs included hospitalization for a medical condition, neglect, and exposures to domestic and community violence. Logistic regression of this data showed that the odds of being diagnosed with internalizing problems increased with age and when sexual abuse was reported. The results also showed that compared to Caucasian youth, Latinos were less likely to be diagnosed with externalizing behaviors, even when sexual abuse had been reported. Contrary to one of this study's hypotheses, mental health service use within the past 18 months increased the odds of being diagnosed with SEB problems. These findings highlight the persistence of SEB problems despite receipt of mental health services. Future research should assess the impact of interventions that aim to mitigate poor SEB outcomes due to ACEs, especially sexual abuse.

AB Although the evidence base for treatment of depressive disorders in adolescents has strengthened in recent years, less is known about the treatment of depression in middle to late childhood. A family-based treatment may be optimal in addressing the interpersonal problems and symptoms frequently evident among depressed children during this developmental phase, particularly given data indicating that attributes of the family environment predict recovery versus continuing depression among depressed children. Family-Focused Treatment for Childhood Depression (FFT-CD) is designed as a 15-session family treatment with both the youth and parents targeting two putative mechanisms involved in recovery: (a) enhancing family support, specifically decreasing criticism and increasing supportive interactions; and (b) strengthening specific cognitive-behavioral skills within a family context that have been central to CBT for depression, specifically behavioral activation, communication, and problem solving. This article describes in detail the FFT-CD protocol and illustrates its implementation with three depressed children and their families. Common themes/challenges in treatment included family stressors, comorbidity, parental mental health challenges, and inclusion/integration of siblings into sessions. These three children experienced positive changes from pre- to posttreatment on, assessor-rated depressive symptoms, parent- and child-rated depressive symptoms, and parent-rated internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These changes were maintained at follow-up evaluations 4 and 9 months following treatment completion.

AB Childhood abuse and neglect (CAN) is considered as a risk factor for substance use disorder (SUD). Based on the drinking to cope model, this study investigated the association of two trauma-relevant emotions (shame and sadness) and substance use. Using ecological momentary assessment we compared real-time emotion regulation in situations with high and low intensity of shame and sadness in currently abstinent patients with CAN and lifetime SUD (traumaSUD group), healthy controls with CAN (traumaHC group), and without CAN (nontraumaHC group). Multilevel analysis showed a positive linear relationship between high intensity of both emotions and substance use for all groups. The traumaSUD group showed heightened substance use in low, as well as in high, intensity of shame and sadness. In addition, we found an interaction between type of emotion, intensity, and group: the traumaHC group exhibited a fourfold increased risk for substance use in high intense shame situations relative to the traumaSUD group. Our findings provide evidence for the drinking to cope model. The traumaSUD group showed a reduced distress tolerance for variable intensity of negative emotions. The differential effect of intense shame for the traumaHC group emphazises its potential role in the development of SUD following CAN. In addition, shame can be considered a relevant focus for therapeutic preinterventions and interventions for SUD after CAN.

AB Extremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1000 g) infants have been exposed to stressful intrauterine and early postnatal environments. Even greater early adversity has been experienced by ELBW survivors who were also born small for gestational age (SGA; <10th percentile for GA) compared to those born appropriate for GA (AGA). ELBW survivors, particularly those born SGA, face increased risk for internalizing problems compared to normal BW (NBW; 2500 g) controls. Internalizing problems are related to allelic variations in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR). We followed the oldest longitudinal cohort of ELBW survivors to adulthood. Participants provided buccal cells and reported on internalizing problems, using the Young Adult Self-Report when they were in their mid-20s (ELBW/SGA, N = 28; ELBW/AGA, N = 60; NBW, N = 81) and mid-30s (ELBW/SGA, N = 27; ELBW/AGA, N = 58; NBW, N = 76). The findings indicate that ELBW/SGAs carrying the 5-HTTLPR short allele reported increased internalizing problems, particularly depression, during the third and fourth decades of life. This is the first known report on gene-environment interactions predicting psychopathology among ELBW survivors. Our findings elucidate putative neurobiological pathways that underlie risk for psychopathology.

AB This study sought to identify trajectories of DSM-IV based internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) problem scores across childhood and adolescence and to provide insight into the comorbidity by modeling the co-occurrence of INT and EXT trajectories. INT and EXT were measured repeatedly between age 7 and age 15 years in over 7,000 children and analyzed using growth mixture models. Five trajectories were identified for both INT and EXT, including very low, low, decreasing, and increasing trajectories. In addition, an adolescent onset trajectory was identified for INT and a stable high trajectory was identified for EXT. Multinomial regression showed that similar EXT and INT trajectories were associated. However, the adolescent onset INT trajectory was independent of high EXT trajectories, and persisting EXT was mainly associated with decreasing INT. Sex and early life environmental risk factors predicted EXT and, to a lesser extent, INT trajectories. The association between trajectories indicates the need to consider comorbidity when a child presents with INT or EXT disorders, particularly when symptoms start early. This is less necessary when INT symptoms start at adolescence. Future studies should investigate the etiology of co-occurring INT and EXT and the specific treatment needs of these severely affected children.

AB In contrast to victimization, prior research on the antecedents and outcomes of bullying perpetration has provided little conclusive knowledge. Some adolescent bullies may be well adjusted and popular among peers, while other bullies are rejected and lack self-control. There is also great variation in the outcomes, with a number of studies (but not all) showing increased risk for externalizing and internalizing problems. We used a developmental framework and data from 2,230 participants of the Dutch Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) to examine bullying perpetration across adolescence, to test the links with various antecedents in preadolescence, and to elucidate the outcomes in early adulthood. Latent growth models indicated significant variance in initial bullying perpetration levels and an overall decrease between pre- and late adolescence. Individual, family, and peer factors were associated with initial levels and partially associated with bullying development over time. Bullying perpetration was linked to later maladjustment and substance use, although only in girls. Finally, bullying perpetration appears to function as an intermediate variable between preadolescent individual, family, and peer risk and substance use more than 10 years later. These results have important implications for understanding the gender-specific nature of bullying perpetration and its outcomes and for demonstrating that bullying carries early risk into adulthood.

AB Comorbidity of internalizing and externalizing problems and its risk and protective factors have not been well incorporated into developmental research, especially among racial minority youth from high-poverty neighborhoods. The present study identified a latent comorbid factor as well as specific factors underlying internalizing and externalizing problems among 592 African American adolescents living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods (291 male; M age = 15.9 years, SD = 1.43 years). Stressful life events and racial discrimination were associated with higher comorbid problems, whereas stressful life events and exposure to violence were associated with higher specific externalizing problems. Collective efficacy was associated with both lower specific externalizing problems and lower comorbid problems. Moreover, high collective efficacy buffered the risk effects of stressful life events and racial discrimination on comorbid problems. Our results demonstrated the advantages of latent variable modeling to understanding comorbidity by articulating impacts of risk factors on comorbid and specific components underlying internalizing and externalizing problems. They also highlighted the protective effect of collective efficacy in mitigating risks for these problems. These findings broadly call for more studies on comorbidities in developmental psychopathology among youth from diverse sociocultural backgrounds.

AB There is ample evidence demonstrating the importance of maternal thyroid hormones, assessed at single trimesters in pregnancy, for child cognition. Less is known, however, about the course of maternal thyroid hormone concentrations during pregnancy in relation to child behavioral development. Child sex might be an important moderator, because there are sex differences in externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems. The current study examined the associations between maternal thyroid hormone trajectories versus thyroid assessments at separate trimesters of pregnancy and child behavioral problems, as well as sex differences in these associations. In 442 pregnant mothers, serum levels of TSH and free T4 (fT4) were measured at 12, 24, and 36 weeks gestation. Both mothers and fathers reported on their children's behavioral problems, between 23 and 60 months of age. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to determine the number of different thyroid hormone trajectories. Three trajectory groups were discerned: 1) highest and non -increasing TSH with lowest fT4 that decreased least of the three trajectories; 2) increasing TSH and decreasing ff4 at intermediate levels; 3) lowest and increasing TSH with highest and decreasing fT4. Children of mothers with the most flattened thyroid hormone trajectories (trajectory 1) showed the most anxiety/depression symptoms. The following trimester-specific associations were found: 1) lower first-trimester fT4 was associated with more child anxiety/depression, 2) higher first-trimester TSH levels were related to more attention problems in boys only. A flattened course of maternal thyroid hormone concentrations during pregnancy was a better predictor of child anxiety/depression than first-trimester fT4 levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB The primary objectives of the current prospective longitudinal study were to (a) describe social functioning outcomes and (b) identify childhood predictors of social functioning in young adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). Childhood predictors of young adult social functioning were examined. Family environment and parental stress in adolescence were investigated as potential mediators between childhood variables and adult social functioning. Parent rated childhood internalizing symptoms significantly predicted young adult social functioning in 22q11.2DS, even after controlling for concurrent positive symptoms of psychosis, and problem behaviors contributing to parenting stress in adolescence partially mediated this relationship. These findings highlight child internalizing symptoms and adolescent problem behaviors as potential targets for social functioning interventions in 22q11.2DS.

AB Background: Most studies of the effects of parental religiousness on parenting and child development focus on a particular religion or cultural group, which limits generalizations that can be made about the effects of parental religiousness on family life. Methods: We assessed the associations among parental religiousness, parenting, and children's adjustment in a 3-year longitudinal investigation of 1,198 families from nine countries. We included four religions (Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, and Islam) plus unaffiliated parents, two positive (efficacy and warmth) and two negative (control and rejection) parenting practices, and two positive (social competence and school performance) and two negative (internalizing and externalizing) child outcomes. Parents and children were informants. Results: Greater parent religiousness had both positive and negative associations with parenting and child adjustment. Greater parent religiousness when children were age 8 was associated with higher parental efficacy at age 9 and, in turn, children's better social competence and school performance and fewer child internalizing and externalizing problems at age 10. However, greater parent religiousness at age 8 was also associated with more parental control at age 9, which in turn was associated with more child internalizing and externalizing problems at age 10. Parental warmth and rejection had inconsistent relations with parental religiousness and child outcomes depending on the informant. With a few exceptions, similar patterns of results held for all four religions and the unaffiliated, nine sites, mothers and fathers, girls and boys, and controlling for demographic covariates. Conclusions: Parents and children agree that parental religiousness is associated with more controlling parenting and, in turn, increased child problem behaviors. However, children see religiousness as related to parental rejection, whereas parents see religiousness as related to parental efficacy and warmth, which have different associations with child functioning. Studying both parent and child views of religiousness and parenting are important to understand the effects of parental religiousness on parents and children.

AB Objective: Recent results from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; MTA) have demonstrated impairments in several functioning domains in adults with childhood ADHD. The childhoOd predictors of these adult functional outcomes are not adequately understood. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of childhood demographic, clinical, and family factors on adult functional outcomes in individuals with and without childhood ADHD from the MTA cohort.
   Method: Regressions were used to determine associations of childhood factors (age range 7-10 years) of family income, IQ, comorbidity (internalizing, externalizing, and total number of non-ADHD diagnoses), parenting styles, parental education, number of household members, parental marital problems, parent child relationships, and ADHD symptom severity with adult outcomes (mean age 25 years) of occupational functioning, educational attainment, emotional functioning, sexual behavior, and justice involvement in participants with (n = 579) and without (n = 258) ADHD.
   Results: Predictors of adult functional outcomes in ADHD included clinical factors such as baseline ADHD severity, IQ, and comorbidity; demographic factors such as family income, number of household members and parental education; and family factors such as parental monitoring and parental marital problems. Predictors of adult outcomes were generally comparable for children with and without ADHD.
   Conclusion: Childhood ADHD symptoms, IQ, and household income levels are important predictors of adult functional outcomes. Management of these areas early on, through timely treatments for ADHD symptoms, and providing additional support to children with lower IQ and from households with low incomes, could assist in improving adult functioning.

AB Children's and adolescents' cognitive abilities, social adaptation, and externalizing behaviors are broadly associated with each other at the bivariate level; however, the direction, ordering, and uniqueness of these associations have yet to be identified. Developmental cascade models are particularly well-suited to (1) discern unique pathways among psychological domains and (2) model stability in and covariation among constructs, allowing for conservative tests of longitudinal associations. The current study aimed to identify specific cascade effects among children's cognitive abilities, social adaptation, and externalizing behaviors, beginning in preschool and extending through adolescence. Children (46.2 % female) and mothers (N = 351 families) provided data when children were 4, 10, and 14 years old. Cascade effects highlighted significant stability in these domains. Unique longitudinal associations were identified between (1) age-10 cognitive abilities and age-14 social adaptation, (2) age-4 social adaptation and age-10 externalizing behavior, and (3) age-10 externalizing behavior and age-14 social adaptation. These findings suggest that children's social adaptation in preschool and externalizing behavior in middle childhood may be ideal intervention targets to enhance adolescent well-being.

AB BACKGROUND: Headache and psychopathology (especially anxiety and mood disorders) are comorbid across the life span. The present study is a clinical contribution in the direction of studying the familial recurrence of headache, and the interplay of headache and psychopathology in children.
   METHODS: The clinical sample is composed by 130 headache patients (53 boys and 77 girls, age range 8-18), while the control group is composed by 87 healthy subjects from the general population (39 boys and 48 girls, age range 8-18). A structured interview according to International Classification for Headache Disorders-II criteria has been administered to the clinical group; the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Self Administrated Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA) have been used in order to assess psychopathology in both groups.
   RESULTS: The recurrence of headache in family members is confirmed by the present study, albeit limited to paternal side, chi(2) (4, N.=130)= 10.47, P=0.033. Results also showed that scores obtained by the clinical sample in CBCL and SAFA are generally higher than scores obtained by the control group, but without differences between headache sub-types. Finally, internalizing symptoms (anxiety and depression) in children correlate with mothers' point of view, r >= 0.23, P< 0.05, outlining a specific attunement between headache patients and their mothers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Headache runs in families, with high level of psychological disorders. Mothers are particularly attuned with the psychological needs of their headache children.

AB Using the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LA. FANS), this paper examines the association between the presence of co-resident extended kin and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The paper demonstrates the differential role of extended kin by family structure, as well as across parental immigrant status specifically, nativity and documentation status. Children in the sample were found to be disadvantaged in extended family households, especially with regard to internalizing behaviors. This disadvantageous association was found mostly among married-parent extended family households, whereas there was no association between the presence of extended kin and behavior problems in children from single-parent families. This pattern emerged more clearly among children of documented immigrants, compared to those with native-born parents and those whose parents were unauthorized immigrants. These findings suggest a need to modify previous theories on extended family living arrangements; they also provide policy implications for immigrant families. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although experiencing child abuse (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, exposure to violence) is associated with a variety of mental health difficulties, simple exposure to abuse does not produce symptoms in every individual. The current study explored emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship between a history of child abuse and symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression. Adolescent females (ages 11-17 years) were asked to retrospectively report on their exposure to child abuse, current symptoms of PTSD/depression, and emotion regulation abilities. Caregiver report of adolescent emotional difficulties was also obtained. Analyses revealed that child abuse-exposed females, when compared to females without a trauma history, had worse emotion regulation abilities and increased mental health difficulties. Moreover, emotion regulation significantly mediated the relationship between child abuse and all assessed mental health symptoms. These findings extend previous work from adult samples, underscoring the importance of assessing emotion regulation abilities in abuse-exposed youth.

AB There is little research on how family violence affects children who live the Arab world. This study had three aims. First, to examine the prevalence of family violence in Yemen. Second, to examine the associations between family violence and internalizing and externalizing problems in Yemeni children. Third, to examine participant gender as a possible moderator. A total of 598 children, 11-16 years old, completed measures of experiencing and witnessing physical and psychological abuse in the home, and reported emotional symptoms and conduct problems. Findings indicate that prevalence rates of all forms of abuse are high among Yemeni children (57.5% experiencing physical abuse, 71.2% psychological abuse, 33.6% witnessing physical abuse, and 78.9% witnessing psychological abuse). Boys experienced more physical and psychological abuse in the home than girls, although the level of physical and psychological abuse children witnessed in the home did not differ for boys and girls. The structural equation model indicated that witnessing psychological abuse was associated with emotional symptoms and conduct problems in children. Experiencing physical abuse was associated with conduct problems, whereas experiencing psychological abuse was associated with emotional symptoms. These associations were similar for boys and girls. These findings suggest that living in an abusive home can have harmful effects on Yemeni children.

AB The present study reports on the initial validation of the eight-item version of the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y8) as a school mental health screener for identifying clinical-level depression and anxiety caseness within a sample of urban high school students (N = 219). Results indicated that responses to the AFQ-Y8 yielded better data-model fit and comparable internal consistency and convergent validity in relation to responses to the longer, 17-item version of the measure. Findings from receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses showed that scores derived from the AFQ-Y8 had excellent discrimination ability for correctly classifying students with and without clinical-level depression (area under the curve [AUC] = .91) and anxiety (AUC = .92), and that a cutoff score of 15 yielded optimal sensitivity (.86, .92) and specificity (.88, .87) for accomplishing these purposes. Taken together, findings suggest the AFQ-Y8 is a technically adequate instrument for both measuring psychological inflexibility and classifying students with clinical-level internalizing problems. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA)-axis plays an important role in the expression of defensive freezing. Adaptive freezing reactivity, characterized by an immediate increase in acute stress and timely termination upon threat offset or need to act, is essential for adequate stress coping. Blunted HPA-axis activity in animals is associated with blunted freezing reactivity and internalizing symptoms. Despite their potential relevance, it remains unknown whether these mechanisms apply to humans and human psychopathology. Using a well established method combining electrocardiography and posturography, we assessed freezing before, immediately after, and one hour after a stress induction in 92 human adolescents. In line with animal models, human adolescents showed stress-induced freezing, as quantified by relative reductions in heart rate and body sway after, as compared to before, stress. Moreover, relatively lower basal cortisol was associated with reduced stress induced freezing reactivity (i.e., less immediate freezing and less recovery). Path analyses showed that decreased freezing recovery in individuals with reduced cortisol levels was associated with increased levels of internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that reduced freezing recovery may be a promising marker for the etiology of internalizing symptoms.

AB The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to intervene with parents of overweight/obese 4- to 8-year-old children to improve child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Parent-child dyads (N = 60) were randomly assigned to treatment or comparison conditions. Parents attended four intervention sessions at their child's primary health care office over 3 months. Child behaviors were assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention. Parental beliefs in their skills/abilities increased in the experimental group parents, but there was no statistical difference between groups at any time. Child externalizing behaviors significantly decreased from baseline to postintervention for both groups (F = 3.26, p = .020). Post hoc model testing suggests that this change was more pronounced in the intervention group (F = 0.56, p = .692). Child somatic symptoms significantly decreased over time (F = 4.55, p = .004), and there were group differences in child depressive behaviors (F = 6.19, p = .020). These findings suggest that a parent-focused intervention program demonstrated positive preliminary effects on children's behaviors.

AB Adolescent stressors coupled with environmental demands, such as pressures to achieve, might lead to negative outcomes for some students. Students who worry about their ability to meet high standards might be more at risk of internalizing problems. The current study investigated the relations among perfectionism, social support, and internalizing problems of middle school students (N = 169). Research has established perfectionism as having maladaptive and adaptive traits. Regression analyses indicated that maladaptive perfectionism was positively related, while adaptive perfectionism was negatively related, to anxiety and depression. Adaptive perfectionists reported significantly higher levels of teacher support than maladaptive perfectionists and nonperfectionists and higher levels of classmate support than nonperfectionists. In addition, classmate support for girls and boys, and teacher support for boys, were found to buffer the relation between maladaptive perfectionism and anxiety and depression. Future research should examine social support and perfectionism and how to best provide support to maladaptive perfectionists.

AB Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) has been associated with symptoms of externalizing (e.g., hyperactivity) and internalizing (e.g., emotional) disorders in childhood. The present research addresses two new questions about the nature of this relation: (1) Do the associations between MSDP and externalizing and internalizing symptoms vary by who reports the symptoms? and (2) Is MSDP associated with changes in symptomatology across childhood? We address these questions with two cohorts from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Parents and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire up to six times every two years between child ages 4 and 14 in the older cohort (N = 3841) and up to four times between child ages 4 and 10 in the younger cohort (N = 3714); the study children also completed the same questionnaire up to three times starting at age 10. Across the two cohorts, MSDP was associated with more externalizing symptoms as reported by parents, teachers, and self. MSDP was also associated with increases in externalizing symptoms across childhood when teachers assessed the symptoms but not when parents assessed them. Finally, MSDP was not consistently associated with the average level of internalizing symptoms, but it was associated with increases in these symptoms across childhood. The present research indicates a robust association between MSDP and the average level of externalizing symptoms in childhood regardless of who reports the symptoms. It also indicates that whether MSDP is associated with the trajectory of externalizing symptomatology depends on who reports on the symptoms. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Individual heterogeneity exists in the onset and development of conduct problems, but theoretical claims about predictors and prognosis are often not consistent with the empirical findings. This study examined shape and outcomes of conduct problem trajectories in a Belgian population-based sample (N = 682; 49.5 % boys). Mothers reported on children's conduct problems across six waves (age 4-17) and emerging adults reported on their behavioral adjustment (age 17-20). Applying mixture modeling, we found four gender-invariant trajectories (labeled life-course-persistent, adolescence-onset, childhood-limited, and low). The life-course-persistent group was least favorably adjusted, but the adolescence-onset group was similarly maladjusted in externalizing problems and may be less normative (15 % of the sample) than previously believed. The childhood-limited group was at heightened risk for specifically internalizing problems, being more worrisome than its label suggests. Interventions should not only be aimed at early detection of conduct problems, but also at adolescents to avoid future maladjustment.

AB Several studies demonstrated that maternal psychopathological risk is related to child's maladjustment, but until recently research has relatively neglected fathers. Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD) and Eating disorders (ED) have a large prevalence during childhood but a few studies have focused on their association with paternal psychopathological risk. One-hundred and thirty-nine children and their fathers were recruited from pediatric hospitals and outpatient clinics and paired with a healthy control group (CG). Fathers were administered the SCL-90/R and the CBCL 6-18 to assess: 1) psychopathological risk of fathers of children with DBD, ED and CG; 2) significant differences between ED and DBD fathers' psychopathological profiles; and 3) associations between specific fathers' psychopathological symptoms and children's emotional-behavioral problems. Fathers of children with ED showed a higher psychopathological risk than fathers of DBD offspring. Children with DBD showed higher externalizing symptoms. Paternal hostility was associated with internalizing problems in children with DBD. Paternal hostility showed a non-significant but clinically interesting association with internalizing problems in DBD children; interpersonal sensitivity was associated with internalizing problems in ED children. This study can constitute a contribution to a better understanding of the clinical characteristics of fathers of children with DBD and ED.

AB Teen Court is a prevention program aimed at diverting first time juvenile offenders from the traditional juvenile justice system and reintegrating them into the community. Few studies have examined if Teen Court impacts adolescent functioning. We examined how Teen Court participation impacted psychosocial functioning, social relationships, and school experiences in a sample of 392 rural Teen Court participants relative to two comparison samples, one from the same county as Teen Court (n = 4276) and one from a neighboring county (n = 3584). We found that Teen Court has the potential to decrease internalizing symptoms, externalizing behavior, violent behavior, parent-adolescent conflict, and delinquent friends, and increase self-esteem and school satisfaction.

AB Background
   During pregnancy, many women experience sleep problems and anxiety that require treatment. The long-term safety for the child of maternal benzodiazepine (BZD) and z-hypnotic use during pregnancy remains controversial.
   Method
   We conducted a cohort and a sibling control study using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Data on use of BZD and z-hypnotics, internalizing and externalizing outcomes, and covariates were collected from mothers at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and when children were 0.5, 1.5, and 3 years of age. The total sample consisted of 71,996 children (19,297 siblings) at 1.5 years and 55,081 children (13,779 siblings) at 3 years. Shortterm use was defined as use in one pregnancy period only. Long-term use was defined as use in two or more pregnancy periods. Linear full cohort random-effect and sibling-matched fixed-effect regression models were used to compare internalizing and externalizing behavior in children prenatally exposed compared to those unexposed in the full cohort of pregnancies accounting for family clusters, as well as within sibling clusters comparing pregnancies with discordant exposures. Propensity score (PS) adjustment included variables on indication for use (sleep problems, symptoms of anxiety and depression) and other potential confounding factors.
   Results
   Long-term prenatal exposure to BZD or z-hypnotics was associated with increased internalizing behavior in crude cohort analyses and at age 1.5 years after PS adjustment in siblingmatched fixed-effect models [beta 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.95]. Analyses on specific drug groups showed that prenatal exposure to BZD-anxiolytics was associated with increased internalizing problems at both 1.5 years [beta 0.25, 0.01-0.49] and 3 years [beta 0.26, 0.002-0.52] while exposure to z-hypnotics was not associated with any adverse outcomes after adjustment.
   Conclusion
   The findings suggest a moderate association between BZD-anxiolytic exposure and child internalizing problems that is not likely due to stable familial confounding factors.

AB Background
   Schistosomiasis is a parasite-related chronic inflammatory condition that can cause anemia, decreased growth, liver abnormalities, and deficits in cognitive functioning among children.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   This study used the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) to collect data on thirty-six 9-12 year old school-attending children's behavioral profiles in an Schistosoma mansoni-endemic area of western Kenya, before and after treatment with praziquantel for S. mansoni infection. BASC-2 T scores were significantly reduced post-treatment (p < 0.05) for each of the 'negative' behavior categories including externalizing problems (hyperactivity, aggression, and conduct problems that are disruptive in nature), internalizing problems (anxiety, depression, somatization, atypicality, and withdrawal), school problems (academic difficulties, included attention problems and learning problems), and the composite behavioral symptoms index (BSI), signifying improved behavior. While the observed improvement in the 'positive' behavior category of adaptive skills (adaptability, functional communication, social skills, leadership, and study skills) was not statistically significant, there were significant improvements in two adaptive skills subcategories: social skills and study skills.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Results of this study suggest that children have better school-related behaviors without heavy S. mansoni infection, and that infected children's behaviors, especially disruptive problem behaviors, improve significantly after praziquantel treatment.

AB Background: Both self-regulation and insistence on sameness (IS) are related to anxiety, which is a common feature of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we aimed to characterise the IS-self-regulation-anxiety interrelationship by investigating the potential contribution made by self-regulation, assessed via effortful control (EC), to the IS-anxiety relationship in a sample of adolescents and young adults with ASD.
   Method: Seventy-one older adolescents and younger adults with ASD (49 males, 22 females; M-age = 18.71 years, SD = 2.51, range 14.42-24.81) completed the Adult Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire-2, Effortful Control Scale of the Adult Temperament Questionnaire and the DSM-5 Dimensional Anxiety Scales.
   Results: IS was associated with both EC (r = -.39, p = .001) and anxiety (r = .45, p < .001), and anxiety was in turn associated with EC (r = -.44, p < .001). To characterise the nature of this interrelationship, two mediation analyses were performed using the serial mediation model in PROCESS with 5000 resamples in bootstrapping. There was a significant indirect effect of EC on anxiety, through IS (b = -.06; BCa 95% CI [-.13, -.02]), and indirect effect on anxiety through EC (b = 1.62; BCa 95% CI [.59, 3.24]) with the mediators accounting for 29.07 and 26.04% of the total effect, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our study provides the first exploration of the IS-anxiety-self-regulation link in ASD. The finding that lower levels of self-regulation are related both to anxiety and IS behaviours points to self-regulation as a viable intervention target for both anxiety and IS behaviours.

AB Children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at risk for social impairment, but research has yet to document the trajectory of these skills post-injury and factors that may predict social problems. This study addressed these gaps in knowledge, reporting on findings from a prospective, longitudinal follow-up study that investigated social outcomes post-injury and explored factors contributing to these outcomes at two years post-injury. The sample included 113 children, 74 with TBI and 39 typically developing (TD) controls. TBI participants were recruited on presentation to the hospital. Parents rated pre-injury function at that time, and all children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were followed up at two years post-injury. Outcomes were social adjustment, social participation, social relationships, and social cognition. Predictors of social outcomes examined included brain lesion characteristics, child cognition (6 months post-TBI), and behavior and environmental factors (pre-injury and two years). Reduced social adjustment (p=0.011) and social participation (p<0.001) were evident in children with TBI compared with TD controls. Poor social adjustment was predicted by externalizing behavior problems and younger age at injury. Reduced social participation was linked to internalizing behavior problems. Greater lesion volume, lower socioeconomic status, and family burden contributed to poorer social relationships, whereas age at injury predicted social cognition. Within the TBI group, 23% of children exhibited social impairments. Younger age at injury, greater pre-injury, and current behavior problems and family dysfunction, and poorer intelligence quotient (IQ), processing speed, and empathy were linked to impairment. Further follow-up is required to track social recovery and the influences of cognition, brain, and environment over time.

AB Current research refers to videogames as a constant variable. However, games today are designed to be highly interactive and versatile: two players may be using the same videogame, but as a result of different using patterns, the game will not necessarily encompass the same content and gameplay. The current study examined the possible relationship between psychopathology and in-game playing patterns. We hypothesized that adolescents would play videogames differently, in a manner that would reflect their particular psychopathologies. We examined 47 male adolescents from three diagnostic groups: those suffering from externalizing psychopathologies, internalizing psychopathologies and controls. We performed a high-resolution examination of their gameplay, using in-game quantitative statistics mechanisms of two fundamentally different games, a structured racing game and an unstructured adventure game. While there was no difference in the groups' using patterns of the structured game, there was a high variability between the groups' using patterns when they were using a non-structured game. These findings suggest that virtual behavior in unstructured games is reflective of adolescent-players psychopathology, and might shed light on an unexplored facet of videogames research. Possible implications are discussed.

AB Serum inflammatory markers have been studied in adults with anxiety and depression, but little is known about cytokine levels in young adolescents with emotional disorders. The objective of this study is to compare serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) between adolescents with internalizing disorders and adolescents from the same community without internalizing disorders. A total of 134 non-medicated subjects (n = 76 with internalizing disorders) were recruited from a larger sample of 2457 individuals. Serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were quantified and psychiatric diagnosis was evaluated using structured clinical interviews. Adolescents with internalizing disorders presented significantly higher levels of IL-6 as compared to youngsters without internalizing disorders. Differences between groups in IL-10 levels were not statistically significant. This study points out that IL-6 levels may be associated with internalizing disorders in youths and suggests that inflammation might be an early biomarker of emotional distress. High levels of cytokines may adversely affect general health in the long-term, which raise broader issues in terms of public health if results are replicated.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate the role of fathers' positive engagement as a protective factor in the development of children's behavior problems and whether this buffering effect differs by family poverty status.
   BackgroundChildren who have behavior problems at early ages are more likely to show persistent behavior problems over time. Fathers' roles in the development and persistence of child behavior problems have been less investigated than mothers' roles.
   MethodLongitudinal survey data from 762 constant-resident-father families participating in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study were used. Mothers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems when the focal child was 5 and 9years of age, and fathers reported on their frequency of positive engagement with children at child age 5. Data were analyzed using moderated moderation regression analyses.
   ResultsChildren living in greater family poverty at age 5 showed more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 9, but greater positive engagement by fathers weakened the association between family poverty and children's later behavior problems. Moreover, fathers' positive engagement appeared to disrupt continuity in internalizing behavior problems from early to middle childhood for children in families living below the poverty level.
   ConclusionFathers' positive engagement may serve as a protective factor for children's social-emotional development.
   ImplicationsEmphasizing fathers' positive engagement in prevention and intervention programs designed to lower children's risk for behavior problems may have potential value.

AB ObjectiveTo identify interplay of early maternal and paternal mental health symptoms for predicting child mental health and development.
   BackgroundResearch on family mental health has largely excluded fathers, although the well-being of both parents is likely to be important for child development. In this study, we analyzed (a) intrafamilial dynamics between mothers' and fathers' early mental health symptoms and (b) the importance of separate (mother and father) and joint (additive, hierarchical, and buffering) theoretical models of parental mental health for predicting child mental health and development.
   MethodFinnish mothers and fathers (N=763), half of whom conceived through assisted reproductive treatments (ART), reported their symptoms of psychological distress and depression from the pregnancy to 2months and 12months postpartum. Later, when the child was 7-8years of age, parents (N=485) reported the child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms and social and cognitive developmental problems.
   ResultsWe identified both co-occurrence and compensation in intrafamilial early parental mental health. Further, mothers' symptoms alone (separate mother model) predicted child internalizing symptoms, whereas joint parental symptoms (additive model) predicted problems in executive function.
   ConclusionThe pre- and postnatal mental health of mothers and fathers is important for later child development.
   ImplicationsTo support healthy child development, both parents need to be screened for early mental health problems, and psychological help should be offered to families across the pre- and postpartum period.

AB Childhood is stage that is vulnerable to stressful situations, such as abuse. Childhood maltreatment is an adverse environmental factor that may disrupt the neurological development and determine child's brain maturation, leading to cognitive deficits persistent in adulthood. The profile of maltreated children profile features problems in attention, memory, language, and intellectual development, school failure, and high prevalence of internalizing and externalizing problems. Disruptions in neurogenesis, myelinization, synaptogenesis, and neuronal pruning processes, as well as subsequent damage in hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex, are the neurobiological physiopathological basis of the said cognitive profile.

AB Background/Context: Chronic school absenteeism is a pervasive problem across the US; in early education, it is most rampant in kindergarten and its consequences are particularly detrimental, often leading to poorer academic, behavioral and developmental outcomes later in life. Though prior empirical research has identified a broad range of determinants of chronic absenteeism, there lacks a single, unified theoretically driven investigation examining how such factors concurrently explain the incidence of chronic absenteeism among our nation's youngest schoolchildren. Thus, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of one factor over another, hence making it challenging to develop appropriate supports and services to reduce school absences.
   Purpose/Research Questions: Our study filled this critical void-we investigated multiple determinants of chronic absenteeism that were grounded, theoretically and empirically, in Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model of development. Specifically, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 and the method of hierarchical generalized linear modeling, we analyzed how the co-occurrence of key (a) process, (b) person, and (c) context (micro-, meso-, exo- and macrosystem) factors was associated with kindergarteners' probability of being chronically absent.
   Findings/Results: Children who have poorer health, higher internalizing behaviors, and more frequent engagement in learning activities at home had higher odds of chronic absenteeism. Also, children from larger families and of lower socioeconomic status faced increased odds of chronic absenteeism. Conversely, children holding positive attitudes towards school had lowered odds of chronic absenteeism, a finding that remained robust across socioeconomic status groups. Finally, parent-school connections were associated with lowered odds of absenteeism.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: Overall, our findings strongly suggested that addressing chronic absenteeism will require comprehensive and multifaceted approaches that recognize these multiple factors. With this theoretically grounded, more descriptive approach, it is more feasible to identify key factors and subsequently design policies and practices to prevent absence behavior.

AB This study's purpose was to evaluate whether two aspects of positive peer relations having a friend and being well-liked mitigate prospective transactions between depressive symptoms and peer victimization. Participants were early adolescents in fifth and sixth grades (N = 483; 50% girls; M-age in 5th grade spring = 11.10 years; SD = 0.40) and late adolescents in ninth and tenth grades (N = 444; 52% girls; M-age in 9th grade spring = 14.70 years; SD = 0.62). Data were collected in the spring annually. Depressive symptoms were assessed via parent-, teacher-, and self-reports (late adolescence only) and peer victimization by self-, peer-, and teacher-reports. Mutual friendship nominations and peer acceptance ratings indexed positive peer relations. Results showed that positive peer relations are protective: Depressive symptoms contributed to peer victimization for early and late adolescents without a friend; moreover, late adolescents high on acceptance were at decreased risk for peer victimization.

   THEORY
AB In adults, rumination has been associated with costs at affective, cognitive, and physiological levels. We examined if rumination in children is characterized by the same dysfunctional consequences and the possible moderating role of family functioning (cohesion and flexibility) and parents' trait rumination and depression. After induction of rumination, forty children (20 girls; 9.6 years) performed a tracking task with thought probes while their mood, reaction times (RT), heart rate (HR), and variability (HRV) were assessed. Self-reported episodes of rumination were associated with higher HR, lower HRV, mood worsening, and slower RT compared to being on task. Moderation analysis suggested that children's slower RT during ruminative thinking were associated with greater trait rumination in mothers and less flexibility in the family, whereas higher HR and lower HRV during rumination in children were associated with less family cohesion. Findings help our understanding of the person-environment interaction in modulating the costs of rumination.

AB Objectives Little is known about how employment and work outcomes among young adults are influenced by their life-course history of mental health problems. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (i) identify trajectories of mental health problems from childhood to young adulthood and (ii) investigate the association between these trajectories and employment and work outcomes among young adults.
   Methods Data were used from 360 participants of the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a Dutch prospective cohort study, with 12-year follow-up. Trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems were identified with latent class growth models. Employment conditions and work outcomes (ie, psychosocial work characteristics) were measured at age 22. We assessed the association between mental health trajectories and employment conditions and work outcomes.
   Results Four trajectories of mental health problems were identified: high-stable, decreasing, moderate-stable and low-stable. Young adults with high-stable trajectories of externalizing problems worked over six hours more [B=6.71, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.82-10.6] and had a higher income [odds ratio (OR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.71], than young adults with low-stable trajectories. Young adults with high-stable trajectories of internalizing problems worked six hours less per week (B=-6.07, 95% CI-10.1-2.05) and reported lower income (OR 3.44,95% CI 1.53-7.74) and poorer psychosocial work characteristics, compared to young adults with low-stable trajectories.
   Conclusions Among young adults who had a paid job at the age of 22 (and were not a student or unemployed), those with a history of internalizing problems are less likely to transition successfully into the labor market, compared to other young adults.

AB Objective: Children with a physical disability, psychological disorder, or of nonnormative weight are often targets of peer victimization. Sibling victimization, however, is more common than peer victimization, but rarely explored. We investigated linkages between sibling victimization and whether children had a physical disability, psychological disorder (i.e., internalizing disorder, attention deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), and were perceived by parents as being thinner than average or overweight. Also, we explored how the extent and kinds of sibling victimization experiences were related to these characteristics in childhood. Methods: A US probability sample of adult caregivers of a child aged 0 to 9 (N = 780; 50% women; mean age 4.58) in 2-child households who completed a telephone interview. Results: Controlling for other forms of maltreatment and individual and family characteristics, children with a physical disability and parent-perceived children who are thinner than average and children who are overweight experienced more sibling victimization. Children with an internalizing disorder experienced less sibling victimization. Sibling victimization did not differ for children with and without ADHD. Children perceived to be overweight by parents and children with a physical disability were at increased risk of experiencing more types of sibling victimization. Children with a physical disability had greater odds of being victims of property victimization by a sibling. Conclusion: Children with a physical disability or perceived as different from average weight are at risk for sibling victimization. Using a nationally representative sample, this is the first study to highlight the importance of screening for sibling victimization in families of children with a disability and/or nonnormative weight status.

AB Objective: Information from parents is regularly used in the diagnostic process of children and adolescents with psychiatric symptoms. But the reliability of this information is debatable, because the parents' own stress can distort their perceptions of the child's symptoms. Method: For each of N = 68 children and adolescents (11-18 years) who were using mental health services for the first time, we evaluated the ratings of a parent and a professional clinician (internalizing, externalizing symptoms, total-problem score). In addition, parenting stress was scored on the Eltern-Belastungs-Inventars (EBI, Troster, 2011), which measures both child-related stress and parent-related stress as well as total stress. Results: Highly stressed parent ratings differed more from the clinicians' ratings than the ratings of less stressed parents. Additionally, correlations showed that higher parenting stress resulted in larger differences between the parent's and the clinician's assessments. Multiple regressions proved the predictive value of child-caused parenting stress for these differences. These results apply for internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and total-problem score. Conclusions: Parenting stress should be evaluated systematically in order to carefully assess the value of the information from parents and to determine how it should be included in diagnostic and therapeutical decisions.

TI Empowering Marginalized Youth: A Self-Transformative Intervention for

ID IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT; DIRECTIONS; MEDIATION
AB This article reports the results of a positive youth development (PYD) intervention for adolescents in alternative high schools (209 African American and Hispanic American adolescents, aged 14-18; 118 females and 91 males). The intervention was guided by a self-transformative model of PYD (Eichas, Meca, Montgomery, & Kurtines, 2014). This model proposes that the actions youth take to define themselves function as active ingredients in positive development over the life course. Consistent with the self-transformative model, results provided support for direct or mediated intervention effects on the self-transformative processes of self-construction and self-discovery, life goal development, identity synthesis, and internalizing problems. The findings illustrate the utility of using a self-transformative approach to PYD in work with marginalized youth populations.

AB Objectives: The current study examines whether psychosocial outcomes following pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) vary as a function of children's rejection sensitivity (RS), defined as their disposition to be hypersensitive to cues of rejection from peers. Methods: Children ages 8-13 with a history of severe TBI (STBI, n=16), complicated mild/moderate TBI (n=35), or orthopedic injury (OI, n=49) completed measures assessing self-esteem and RS on average 3.28 years post-injury (SD=1.33, range=1.25-6.34). Parents reported on their child's emotional and behavioral functioning and social participation. Results: Regression analyses found moderation of group differences by RS for three outcomes: social participation, self-perceptions of social acceptance, and externalizing behavior problems. Conditional effects at varying levels of RS indicated that externalizing problems and social participation were significantly worse for children with STBI at high levels of RS, compared to children with OI. Social participation for the STBI group remained significantly lower than the OI group at mean levels of RS, but not at low levels of RS. At high levels of RS, self-perceptions of social acceptance were lower for children with moderate TBI compared to OI, but group differences were not significant at mean or low levels of RS. No evidence of moderation was found for global self-worth, self-perceptions of physical appearance or athletic ability, or internalizing problems. Conclusions: The findings highlight the salient nature of social outcomes in the context of varying levels of RS. These findings may have implications for the design of interventions to improve social outcomes following TBI.

AB Although culture-based measurement bias threatens the validity of intergroup comparison research, measurement invariance is often assumed rather than demonstrated by researchers who draw conclusions about cross-cultural similarities or differences. The current article investigates the cross-cultural invariance of a popular measure of perfectionism, the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (F-MPS; Frost, Marten, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1990) for a Hispanic/Latina sample. Perfectionism, which encompasses high goal setting and sensitivity to critical evaluation, is a transdiagnostic risk factor for internalizing psychopathology that especially warrants focus among groups burdened by mental health disparities. Multiple samples were used in a series of analyses to construct a baseline first-order measurement model and test for cross-group equivalence. For model development, confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used with 320 female participants (M-age = 19.61 years) who identified primarily (n = 301) as European/European American. Measurement invariance testing was conducted with multigroup CFAs using another sample of female adults (n = 574; M-age = 21.21 years), identifying either as European/European American (n = 217) or Hispanic/Latina/Latin American (n = 357). Evidence was found for invariance across the revised F-MPS factor structure, pattern of factor loadings, and factor variances/covariances. Results indicate that predictive relationships may be compared across these groups, but caution is suggested when interpreting raw mean score differences due to intercept non-equivalence. Further, second-order model testing demonstrated support for the bidimensional model of perfectionism cross-culturally. Future research on perfectionism within the Latino/a population is encouraged using this equivalent item set.

AB Objective: Research has cited increased prevalence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and exposure to interpersonal violence for Hispanics and non-Hispanic Black adolescents, as well as ethnic differences in externalizing behavior (e.g., substance use, delinquency). The current study combined these areas by examining racial/ethnic differences in mental health correlates of trauma exposure. Method: Interviews were conducted to assess polyvictimization, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use, and delinquency in a nationally representative sample of adolescents (N = 3,614; 15.4% non-Hispanic Black; 11.3% Hispanic; 64.9% non-Hispanic White). Results: Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adolescents endorsed greater polyvictimization than non-Hispanic Whites; however, differences in MDD and PTSD were only significant when assessed with symptom counts. Non-Hispanic Black adolescents reported the least drug use. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adolescents endorsed more delinquency than non-Hispanic White adolescents. Polyvictimization only accounted for ethnic disparities in delinquency. Conclusion: Trauma-related disparities may differ across internalizing and externalizing concerns. Subsequent research should continue to examine other factors that may contribute to racial/ethnic differences in trauma sequelae.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examined mental health outcomes in extremely preterm children (EPT) born at 23 to 25 weeks of gestation between 1992 and 1998 at 2 Swedish tertiary care centers that offered regional and active perinatal care to all live-born EPT infants.
   METHODS; We assessed 132 (98%) of the 134 EPT survivors at 10 to 15 years of age alongside term-born controls. Behavioral and emotional problems were evaluated by using Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form and Conners' Parent and Teacher scales for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
   RESULTS: Parents and teachers reported significantly more problems with internalizing behaviors as well as attention, social, and thought problems in EPT children than in controls, even when those with major neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) were excluded. Multivariate analysis of covariance of the behavioral problems reported by parents and teachers revealed no interactions, hut significant main effects emerged for group status (EPT versus control) and sex, with all effect sizes being medium to large and accounting for 8% to 14% of the variance. Compared with the controls, EPT children without NDDs had significantly increased rates of >= 90th percentile for total Conners' attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problem scores (parents: 40% vs 15%, odds ratio: 3.7, P <.001) (teachers: 24% vs 9%, odds ratio: 3.3, P =.005). The corresponding rates were higher in the total population.
   CONCLUSIONS: EPT children with or without NDDs had behavioral problems characterized by a higher risk for anxiety and attention, social, and thought problems. These findings further strengthen the proposition that a preterm behavioral phenotype is recognizable in adolescents born EPT.

AB There is strong evidence of a positive association between corporal punishment and negative child outcomes, but previous studies have suggested that the manner in which parents implement corporal punishment moderates the effects of its use. This study investigated whether severity and justness in the use of corporal punishment moderate the associations between frequency of corporal punishment and child externalizing and internalizing behaviors. This question was examined using a multicultural sample from eight countries and two waves of data collected one year apart. Interviews were conducted with 998 children aged 7-10 years, and their mothers and fathers, from China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Thailand, and the United States. Mothers and fathers responded to questions on the frequency, severity, and justness of their use of corporal punishment; they also reported on the externalizing and internalizing behavior of their child. Children reported on their aggression. Multigroup path models revealed that across cultural groups, and as reported by mothers and fathers, there is a positive relation between the frequency of corporal punishment and externalizing child behaviors. Mother-reported severity and father-reported justness were associated with child-reported aggression. Neither severity nor justness moderated the relation between frequency of corporal punishment and child problem behavior. The null result suggests that more use of corporal punishment is harmful to children regardless of how it is implemented, but requires further substantiation as the study is unable to definitively conclude that there is no true interaction effect.

A total of 290 children aged 2-12 participated in this study in Quebec, Canada from 1998 to 2004, including 138 children with histories of CSA and 152 non-abused children. To assess child dissociative symptoms, internalizing and externalizing difficulties, as well as sexualized behaviour difficulties, the Child Dissociative Checklist, the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Child Sexualized Behaviour Inventory were completed by parents. Dissociation mediated the relationship between CSA and internalizing, externalizing, and sexualized behaviour difficulties, with the model explaining respectively 42.5%, 49.9% and 33.9% of the variance of these difficulties. Findings are consistent with a model where dissociation is a common pathway linking CSA and child psycho-sexual difficulties.

   SAMPLE
AB Investigating heterogeneity in antisocial behavior early in life is essential for understanding the etiology, development, prognosis, and treatment of these problems. Data from the longitudinal National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) study of Early Child Care were used to identify homogeneous groups of young antisocial children differentiated on externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and callous-unemotional (CU) traits using latent profile analysis (LPA). We examined how identified subgroups were differentiated on adolescent social, biological, cognitive, and environmental outcomes, controlling for dispositional and contextual antecedents during the first 2 years of life. The sample consisted of 1,167 children (52% male) followed from toddlerhood to adolescence. LPA identified a large "low problems" group (n = 795; 49.9% male) as well as 3 antisocial groups at age 3: the first scored high on internalizing and externalizing problems but low on CU traits (Ext/Int, n = 125), the second scored high on CU traits and externalizing problems but low on internalizing problems (primary CU variant, n = 135), and the third scored high on CU traits, internalizing, and externalizing problems (secondary CU variant, n = 112), and these differences persisted into adolescence. Primary and secondary CU variants were further differentiated from one another on adolescent measures of aggression (reactive and relational), biological indices (cortisol, heart rate), cognitive abilities, and parental psychopathology, after controlling for early life risk factors (i.e., maternal sensitivity, difficult temperament, and maternal depression). We discuss implications of our findings for research, theory, and practice on early childhood externalizing problems.

AB This study examined the consequences of negative change in mothers' implicit appraisals of their adolescents after engaging in a family disagreement. Participants included 194 mothers and their early adolescents (M-age = 12.4 at Wave 1; 50% female) followed over 1 year. Mothers' implicit appraisals of her child as "unlovable" were assessed using the Go/No-Go Association Task-Child (Sturge-Apple, Rogge, Skibo, et al., 2015), an associative word-sorting task, before and after engaging in a family conflict task. Mothers' implicit appraisals, on average, did not become more negative following conflicts with their teen. However, substantial variability was evident, suggesting that important individual differences exist in mothers' cognitive reactivity to conflict. Greater susceptibility to implicit change predicted more harsh and insensitive parenting in response to their adolescents' bids for support 1 year later. This effect held over and above mothers' emotional reactivity to the conflict, their explicit negative attitudes about their adolescent, and maternal harshness at Time 1. Harsh and insensitive parenting, in turn, mediated the link between maternal implicit reactivity and subsequent increases in adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. The results suggest that individual differences in maternal susceptibility to changes in implicit appraisals following conflictual interactions serve as a unique determinant of parenting in adolescence.

AB Objective: This study examined how the family environment predicts long-term academic and behavioral functioning in school following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in early childhood. Method: Using a concurrent cohort, prospective design, 15 children with severe TBI, 39 with moderate TBI, and 70 with orthopedic injury (OI) who were injured when they were 3-7 years of age were compared on tests of academic achievement and parent and teacher ratings of school performance and behavior on average 6.83 years postinjury. Soon after injury and at the longer term follow-up, families completed measures of parental psychological distress, family functioning, and quality of the home environment. Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined group differences in academic outcomes and their associations with measures of the early and later family environment. Results: The severe TBI group, but not the moderate TBI group, performed worse than did the OI group on all achievement tests, parent ratings of academic performance, and teacher ratings of internalizing problems. Higher quality early and late home environments predicted stronger academic skills and better classroom behavior for children with both TBI and OI. The early family environment more consistently predicted academic achievement, whereas the later family environment more consistently predicted classroom functioning. The quality of the home environment predicted academic outcomes more strongly than did parental psychological distress or family functioning. Conclusion: TBI in early childhood has long-term consequences for academic achievement and school performance and behavior. Higher quality early and later home environments predict better school outcomes for both children with TBI and children with OI.

AB The present study aimed to examine (a) the relative contribution of perceived parental child-rearing behaviors and attachment on anxiety and depressive symptoms, and (b) the role of attachment as a possible mediator of the association between parental rearing and anxiety and depression. A sample of 1002 children (aged 9-12 years) completed a booklet of self-report questionnaires measuring parental rearing behaviors, attachment towards peers, and DSM anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms. We found that parental aversiveness, parental neglect, and fearful/preoccupied attachment, each accounted for a significant amount of the variance in both anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, parental overcontrol was found to account for unique variance in anxiety whereas communication/warmth accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in depression. A relevant finding was that fearful/preoccupied attachment was found to mediate the association between parental rearing behaviors and both anxiety and depression. Parental rearing behaviors and attachment to peers may act as risk factors to the development and/or maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptomatology in children. Findings may contribute to outline preventive and/or treatment programs to prevent or reduce both clinical anxiety and depression during childhood.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Community-Based Group Music Therapy on internalizing behavioral problems in children who were exposed to ongoing child maltreatment and poverty in South Korea. It was a block randomized controlled trial with a two-arm parallel group design, comparing group music therapy (n = 14) to standard care (n =12). The children in the music therapy group received 12 consecutive group music therapy sessions once a week whereas the children in standard care had care-as-usual (aged seven to 12). The internalizing behavioral problems of the Child Behavior Checklist, both teacher and child reports were used to measure behavioral changes over time in both groups at baseline, pre and post interventions.

AB Due to the longstanding and detrimental effects of engaging in aggressive behaviour and of experiencing symptoms of internalizing problems in children and adolescents, there is an increasing interest in identifying the temporal sequence between these 2 problems with previous research yielding inconsistent findings. Therefore, the longitudinal links between relational aggression, physical aggression, and depression were examined across 7 years in a sample of 643 children (54 % girls) aged 10 at Time 1. Three models were compared- (1) the failure model, in which aggression predicted depression, (2) the acting out model, in which depression predicted aggression, and (3) a reciprocal model, in which both aggression and depression shared a reciprocal relation over time. Cross-lagged path analyses using structural equation modeling supported the failure model (i.e., engaging in relational and physical aggression predicts subsequent depressive symptoms). Findings were similar for boys and girls. These findings add to the literature suggesting that externalizing problems precede internalizing problems.

AB The transition to secondary school is accompanied by the fragmentation of peer groups, while adolescents are also confronted with heightened incidents of bullying and increased levels of internalizing problems. Victimization, peer rejection, and internalizing problems are known to be interrelated, but how they influence each other over time remains unclear. We tested the direction of these associations by applying a cross-lagged path model among a large sample of Finnish adolescents (N = 5645; 49.1 % boys; M age at T1 = 14.0 years) after they transitioned to secondary school (grades 7-9). Self-reported depression, anxiety, and victimization and peer-reported rejection were measured 3 times over the course of 1 year. Results showed that depression was predictive of subsequent victimization for both boys and girls, in line with a symptoms-driven model; for girls, anxiety was reciprocally related to victimization, in line with a transactional model; for boys, victimization was related to subsequent anxiety, in line with an interpersonal risk model. Peer rejection was not directly related to depression or anxiety, but among girls peer rejection was bi-directionally related to victimization. Overall, our results suggest that associations between internalizing problems and peer relations differ between depression and anxiety and between genders. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.

AB The aim of the current study was to meta-analytically examine whether anxiety levels in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are elevated. A total of 83 articles were selected from a systematic literature search and were included in the meta-analyses. Results demonstrated that children with ASD had higher anxiety levels compared to typically developing children, and this difference increased with IQ. Youth with ASD also tended to have higher anxiety levels compared to clinically referred children, and this difference increased with age. Children with ASD had higher anxiety levels compared to youth with externalizing or developmental problems, but not when compared to youth with internalizing problems. The study findings highlight the importance of more research in order to fully understand the nature and development of anxiety in children with ASD. More specifically, the results suggest that especially high-functioning adolescents with ASD may be at risk for developing anxiety disorders. Therefore, it seems important to carefully follow and monitor children with ASD transcending to adolescence.

AB Research on cumulative risk is growing, however, little work has occurred in low- or middle-income countries, and few studies have focused on processes linking risk to outcomes. This study explored relations between components of cumulative risk and adjustment in a sample of 324 South African youth (M age = 13.11 years; SD = 1.54 years; 65% female; 56% Black/African; 14% Colored; 23% Indian; 7% White), and tested competing models of emotion dysregulation as a mediator or moderator of risk-adjustment links. Data was collected from youth and their female caregivers during home interviews. Structural equation models and regression analyses accounting for age and sex contributions revealed that emotion dysregulation mediated associations between sociodemographic risk and internalizing symptoms, externalizing problem behavior, and drug use severity, and moderated links between psychosocial risk and internalizing symptoms and externalizing problem behavior. For the mediator models, sociodemographic risk was associated with impaired emotion regulation, which in turn was linked with heightened adjustment difficulties. For the moderator models, psychosocial risk was linked with adjustment problems only when emotion dysregulation was high. These data indicate the importance of disentangling components of cumulative risk. Future research within the South African cultural context might build on these findings by adapting and testing school- or family-based prevention or intervention programs that include modules on emotion regulation.

AB Exposure to domestic violence in the preschool years is consistently associated with children's heightened risk for developing behavior problems. Maternal meta-emotion philosophy (awareness, acceptance, and coaching of children's emotions) has been identified as an important protective factor in children's development of internalizing and externalizing behaviors following exposure to domestic violence. However, mothers who are victims of domestic violence often experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress, which may undermine their capacity to respond to their children's negative emotions. The present study examines the protective role of maternal meta-emotion philosophy among mothers and preschool-aged children exposed to domestic violence. Participants were 95 mothers (mean age = 31.78) and their preschool-aged children (mean age = 4.11) who had witnessed domestic violence involving their mothers. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for family socioeconomic status and child exposure to interpersonal violence in the family, indicated that maternal symptomatology was positively associated with children's internalizing problems. In addition, maternal awareness and coaching of children's negative emotions was found to moderate relations between maternal symptomatology and children's internalizing behaviors, and maternal awareness of children's negative emotions was found to moderate relations between maternal symptomatology and children's externalizing behaviors. These findings expand our understanding of maternal meta-emotion philosophy as a protective factor for preschoolers who have witnessed domestic violence.

AB Many people have worried about possible adverse effects of high-stakes testing on socioemotional outcomes. This article uses a difference-in-differences approach to investigate the effects of the introduction of high-stakes testing via the No Child Left Behind Act on socioemotional outcomes. Data are from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey-Kindergarten Cohort of 1998-1999, a nationally representative longitudinal survey. The 10 outcomes that we examine are from the children's Self-Descriptive Questionnaire, including externalizing problems related to paying attention and behavior in school, internalizing problems related to feeling sad and lonely and academic anxiety, as well as interest and competence in math, reading, and school in general. We find that the introduction of high-stakes test accountability did not have consistent significant effects on these socioemotional outcomes. These findings can help states address concerns and motivate further research on potential unintended consequences of revised accountability systems under the Every Student Succeeds Act.

AB Sexual minorities (mostly heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian/gay) are more likely than heterosexuals to have adverse mental health, which may be related to minority stress. We used longitudinal data from 1461 sexual minority women and men, aged 2230 years, from Wave 2010 of the Growing Up Today Study, to examine associations between sexual minority stressors and mental health. We hypothesized that sexual minority stressors (earlier timing of sexual orientation developmental milestones categorized into early adolescence, middle adolescence, late adolescence/young adulthood; greater sexual orientation mobility; more bullying victimization) would be positively associated with mental health outcomes (depressive and anxious symptoms). Linear regression models stratified by gender and sexual orientation were fit via generalized estimating equations and controlled for age and race/ethnicity. Models were fit for each stressor predicting each mental health outcome. Reaching sexual minority milestones in early versus middle adolescence was associated with greater depressive and anxious symptoms among lesbians and gay men. Reaching sexual minority milestones in late adolescence/young adulthood versus middle adolescence was associated with greater depressive symptoms among lesbians, but fewer depressive and anxious symptoms among gay men. Greater sexual orientation mobility was associated with greater depressive symptoms among mostly heterosexual women. More bullying victimization was associated with greater depressive symptoms among bisexual women and with greater anxious symptoms among mostly heterosexual women. Sexual minority stressors are associated with adverse mental health among some sexual minority young adults. More research is needed to understand what may be protecting some subgroups from the mental health effects of sexual minority stressors.

AB This article reviews recent empirical literature on the prevalence, correlates, assessment, and treatment of preschool-onset internalizing disorders. Major advances in the acceptance and recognition of both preschool-onset depression and anxiety have occurred over the past decade. This work has been greatly enhanced by the discovery of genetic, neural, and physiologic indicators, which further validate these constellations of symptoms in young children. Despite this growth in research, much work still needs to be done to further elucidate the cause, risk, treatment, and protective factors for preschool-onset internalizing disorders.

AB Objective: To evaluate through a comprehensive protocol, the psychopathological profile of DMD boys. The primary aim of this observational study was to describe the emotional and behavioural profile and the neurodevelopmental problems of Italian boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD); the secondary aim was to explore the relation between psychopathological profile and DMD genotype.
   Method: 47 DMD boys, aged 2-18, were included in the study and assessed through structured and validated tools including Wechsler scales or Griffiths for cognitive ability, Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), Youth Self Report (YSR) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for emotional and behavioural features. Patients "at risk" based on questionnaires scores were evaluated by a clinical structured interview using Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA) or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), as required.
   Results: The 47 enrolled patients, defined with a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) of 80.38 (one SD below average), and presenting a large and significant difference in FSIQ in relation to the site of mutation along the dystrophin gene (distal mutations associated with a more severe cognitive deficit), were showing Internalizing Problems (23.4%) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (14.8%).
   Interestingly, an association of internalizing problems with distal deletion of the DMD gene is documented.
   Conclusion: Even though preliminary, these data show that the use of validated clinical instruments, that focus on the impact of emotional/behaviour problems on everyday life, allows to carefully identify clinically significant psychopathology.

AB AimBased on McLeroy's ecological perspective, this study aimed to identify the factors that are associated with behavioral problems among children who were enrolled in community child centers that provide public welfare services for vulnerable children.
   MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted among 175 children aged 6-12years and their parents who were recruited from 16 community child centers in a municipal county of Seoul, South Korea. The children's behavioral problems were reported by their parents and measured by the Child Behavior Checklist/6-18. As predictor variables, 14 potential factors were selected at multiple ecological levels; parents' health-related quality of life was measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF. A multiple linear regression analysis was carried out.
   ResultsAt the intrapersonal level, children's chronic illness was significantly associated with internalizing problems. At the interpersonal level, lower parental health-related quality of life was significantly associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. At the organizational level, more years since the community child centers were founded was significantly associated with social problems. At the community level, a lower population density in the district in which the community child center was located was significantly associated with internalizing problems.
   ConclusionAmong vulnerable children, behavioral problems were significantly associated with a comprehensive array of intrapersonal-, interpersonal-, organizational-, and community-level factors. These ecological factors that have been identified in the present study need to be considered when developing multilevel, community-based nursing strategies for preventing and managing vulnerable children's behavioral problems.

AB Through stress generation, individuals' own thoughts and behaviors can actually lead to increases in their experience of stress. Unfortunately, stress generation is especially common among individuals who are already suffering from elevated depressive symptoms. However, despite the acknowledgement that some individuals with depressive symptoms generate greater stress than others, few studies have identified specific factors that could exacerbate stress generation among individuals with depressive symptoms. The present study examines co-rumination as a factor that might exacerbate stress generation among adolescents with depressive symptoms using a short-term longitudinal design. Considering these processes among adolescents was critical given that many youth experience increases in depressive symptoms at this developmental stage and that co-rumination also becomes more common at adolescence. Participants were 628 adolescents (326 girls; 302 boys) who reported on their depressive symptoms, experiences of stress, and co-rumination with a best friend. Interpersonal stressors (peer and family stress) and non-interpersonal stressors (school and sports stress) were assessed. Consistent with past research, adolescents with depressive symptoms experienced greater interpersonal and non-interpersonal stress over time. Importantly, co-rumination interacted with both depressive symptoms and gender in predicting increases in peer stress. Depressive symptoms predicted the generation of peer stress only for girls who reported high levels of co-rumination with friends. Implications for protecting youth with depressive symptoms against stress generation are discussed.

AB Objective: Little systematic information is available regarding how sleep problems influence daytime functioning in children with ADHD, as the role of ADHD presentations and comorbidity is unclear. Method: In total, 397 children were assessed with the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale, and the ADHD Rating Scale. Results: We found a moderate, positive correlation between sleep problems and impaired functioning in both children with ADHD and in typically developed children. ADHD presentations did not differ significantly with respect to sleep problem profile, but having a comorbid internalizing or autistic disorder lead to higher sleep problem score. Conclusion: Sleep problems and impaired daily functioning were more common in children with ADHD, but the overall association between sleep problems and impaired daily functioning was similar in clinical and nonclinical children. Internalizing or autistic comorbid disorders added significantly to the sleep problems.

AB Objective: To ascertain adult outcomes in 10 domains reflecting symptomatology (internalizing, externalizing, self-injury, substance use), attainment (education, employment), and impairment (health, social, driving, overall) as a function of both childhood diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and persistence of ADHD symptoms across time. Method: We prospectively followed 140 grade-school-aged girls with rigorously diagnosed childhood ADHD and 88 age- and ethnicity-matched comparison girls for 16 years. Outcome measures were obtained via self- and parent-report questionnaires, interviews, and objective tests. Results: Childhood AMID, whether it remitted or persisted, was a pernicious risk factor for a limited number of poor outcomes, including low educational attainment, unplanned pregnancy, body mass index (HMI), and clinician-rated impairment. Childhood ADHD that persisted over time, whether completely or partially, was associated with a number of additional detrimental outcomes in the externalizing, internalizing, self-injury, occupational, social, and overall impairment domains. Finally, in this all-female sample, ADIID was not associated with objective measures of employment, substance use, or driving outcomes. Conchtsions: We discuss the considerable impairments accruing from both childhood-limited and adult-persisting ADHD, with major implications for the health and well-being of females with this neurodevelopmental disorder.
   What is the public health significance of this article?
   Although a minority of girls no longer meet symptom criteria for ADIID in adulthood, they still show substantial educational underachievement over time, as well as increased body mass index and much greater likelihood of at least 1 unplanned pregnancy. Among girls, childhood ADHD that persists into adulthood is associated with these educational and health problems (increased body mass index and unplanned pregnancy) as well as substantially increased risk for internalizing problems (e.g., anxiety and depression), externalizing problems (e.g., aggression and defiance), self-injury, and occupational impairment. On average, however, girls with childhood ADHD are not at increased risk for later substance use problems, at least in the present sample.

AB Background: Severe iodine deficiency in pregnancy has major effects on child neurodevelopment, but less is known about the potential consequences of mild-to-moderate deficiency and iodine supplement use.
   Objective: We explored the associations between maternal iodine intake and child neurodevelopment at 3 y of age and the potential impact of maternal intake of iodine from supplements on the same outcomes.
   Methods: This population-based prospective observational study included 48,297 mother-child pairs recruited during pregnancy from 2002 to 2008. Maternal iodine intake was calculated based on a validated food-frequency questionnaire answered during midpregnancy that covered mean intake since the beginning of pregnancy. Associations between iodine intake and maternal-reported child language and motor development and behavior problems were explored by multivariable regression analyses.
   Results: In 33,047 mother-child pairs, excluding iodine supplement users, maternal iodine intake was associated with child language delay (P = 0.024), externalizing and internalizing behavior problems (both P < 0.001), and fine motor skills (P = 0.002) but not gross motor skills or the risk of not walking unaided at 17 mo of age. In 74% of the participants who had an iodine intake < 160 mu g/d (Estimated Average Requirement), suboptimal iodine intake was estimated to account for; 5% (95% CI: -5%, 14%) of the cases of language delay, 16% (95% CI: 0%, 21%) of the cases of externalizing behavior problems >1.5 SD, and 16% (95% CI: 10%, 21%) of the cases of internalizing behavior problems >1.5 SD. In 48,297 mother-child pairs, including iodine supplement users, we found no protective effects of supplemental iodine during pregnancy on neurodevelopment.
   Conclusions: Maternal iodine intake below the Estimated Average Requirement during pregnancy was associated with symptoms of child language delay, behavior problems, and reduced fine motor skills at 3 y of age. The results showed no evidence of a protective effect of iodine supplementation during pregnancy.

AB Background. Adulthood psychological health predicts labour force activity but few studies have examined childhood psychological health. We hypothesized that childhood psychological ill-health would be associated with labour force exit at 55 years.
   Method. Data were from the 55-year follow-up of the National Child Development Study (n = 9137). Labour force participation and exit (unemployment, retirement, permanent sickness, homemaking/other) were self-reported at 55 years. Internalizing and externalizing problems in childhood (7, 11 and 16 years) and malaise in adulthood (23, 33, 42, 50 years) were assessed. Education, social class, periods of unemployment, partnership separations, number of children, and homemaking activity were measured throughout adulthood.
   Results. Childhood internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with unemployment, permanent sickness and homemaking/other at 55 years, after adjustment for adulthood psychological health and education: one or two reports of internalizing was associated with increased risk for unemployment [relative risk (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.25; RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.48-3.79] and permanent sickness (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.00-1.74; RR, 1.48, 95% CI 1.00-2.17); three reports of externalizing was associated with increased risk for unemployment (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.01-5.04), permanent sickness (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.46-4.73) and homemaking/other (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.00-3.78).
   Conclusions. Psychological ill-health across the lifecourse, including during childhood, reduces the likelihood of working in older age. Support for those with mental health problems at different life stages and for those with limited connections to the labour market, including homemakers, is an essential dimension of attempts to extend working lives.

AB Multiple models of aberrant emotional processing in depression have been advanced. However, it is unclear which of these models best applies to emotional disturbances in subclinical depressive symptoms. The current study employed a battery of psychophysiological measures and emotional ratings in a picture-viewing paradigm to examine whether the underarousal, low positive emotion, heightened negative emotion, or emotion context insensitivity model of emotional dysfunction in subclinical depressive symptoms received greatest support. Postauricular reflex and skin conductance response potentiation for pleasant minus neutral pictures (measuring low positive emotion), overall skin conductance magnitude and late positive potential (LPP) amplitude (measuring underarousal), and pleasant minus aversive valence ratings (measuring emotion context insensitivity) and aversive minus neutral arousal ratings (measuring heightened negative emotionality) were all negatively related to depressive symptomatology. Of these, postauricular reflex potentiation and overall LPP amplitude were incrementally associated with depressive symptoms over the other measures. Postauricular reflex potentiation, overall skin conductance magnitude, and aversive minus neutral arousal ratings were incrementally associated with depressive symptomatology after controlling for other symptoms of internalizing disorders. Though no model was unequivocally superior, the low positive emotion and underarousal models received the most support from physiological measures and symptom reports, with self-report data matching patterns consistent with the emotion context insensitivity model.

AB Background: Sleep problems are frequent and well documented in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and children with internalizing problems, however limited work has examined sleep problems in children presenting with comorbid ASD/ADHD. In healthy children, sleep problems negatively impact social, emotional, and academic functioning. The current study sought to examine diagnostic severity as predictors of sleep problems in children with comorbid ASD/ADHD. Additionally, the association between sleep and "real-life" functional domains (i.e., intellectual functioning, academic achievement, and executive functioning) were assessed.
   Method: Sleep, internalizing difficulties, intellectual functioning, academic achievement and executive functioning were assessed in 85 children with who carried the dual diagnoses of ASD and ADHD.
   Results: Internalizing difficulties, rather than ASD or ADHD symptom severity, was the most consistent predictor of problematic sleep behaviors (i.e., nightmares overtiredness, sleeping less than other children, trouble sleeping, and Total Problematic Sleep Behaviors) in this sample. Further, parent report of problematic sleep behaviors was significantly associated with functional domains after controlling for ASD, ADHD, and internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that internalizing symptoms are associated with problematic sleep behaviors in children with comorbid ASD/ADHD and may have implications for the "real-life" functioning among children with comorbid ASD/ADHD.

AB Justice-involved youth have high rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and these youth are often placed out-of-home, although evidence identifies several negative implications of juvenile confinement, especially for youth with psychopathology. Furthermore, youth in the justice system may be processed differently based on gender. As males and females tend to manifest symptoms differently, the psychopathology of youth may act to moderate the relationship between gender and placement in the juvenile justice system. The present study used a large, diverse sample (n = 9 851, 19.8 % female) to examine whether youth placed in various types of out-of-home facilities differed in terms of externalizing, internalizing, substance use, or comorbid disorders, and to determine the predictive value of mental health diagnoses in placement decisions. The moderation effect of psychopathology and substance use on the relationship between gender and placement also was explored. The results indicated that each type of disorder differed across placements, with internalizing being most prevalent in non-secure, and externalizing, comorbid, and substance use being most prevalent in secure settings. Mental health diagnoses improved the prediction of placement in each out-of-home placement beyond legal and demographic factors such that externalizing and substance use disorders decreased the likelihood of placement in non-secure settings, and internalizing, externalizing, and substance use disorders increased the likelihood of placement in secure and state-secure facilities. The relationship between internalizing pathology and placement in more secure facilities was moderated by externalizing pathology. The relationship between gender and placement was significantly moderated by mental health such that females with mental health diagnoses receive less secure placements. Implications for policymakers and practitioners are discussed, as well as implications for reforming juvenile justice within a developmental approach.

AB Childhood neglect is associated with risk behaviors in adolescence, including substance use. There is evidence that internalizing behaviors may serve as a mechanism linking childhood neglect and substance use; however, further research is needed to examine this developmental pathway. According to developmental and ecological approaches, the neighborhood context and the developmental timing of maltreatment should both be considered when examining the sequelae of childhood neglect. Hence, the present study uses a longitudinal sample of youth (N = 965, 49.1% female, 59.2% African-American) to examine the influence of timing in the relationship between childhood neglect and adolescent psychopathology, and to examine the indirect effects of child neglect on substance use via internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Furthermore, the role of neighborhood disorder in this indirect effect was tested. Five data collection time points were used: Time 1(M (age) = 4.557, SD (age) = .701), Time 2 (M (age) = 6.422, SD (age) = .518), Time 3 (M (age) = 12.370, SD (age) = .443), Time 4 (M (age) = 14.359, SD (age) = .452), and Time 5 (M (age) = 16.316, SD (age) = .615). The findings showed that internalizing problems mediated the link between the severity of neglect in early childhood and adolescent substance use, and this pathway was moderated by neighborhood disorder. These results have implications for preventative interventions aimed toward reducing substance use for at-risk adolescents.

AB Background: Previous studies have found significant associations between maternal prenatal and postpartum depression and child behavior problems (CBP). The present study investigates whether associations remain in a prospective, longitudinal design adjusted for familial confounding. Methods: The sample comprised 11,599 families including 17,830 siblings from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study. Mothers reported depressive symptoms at gestational weeks 17 and 30, as well as 6 months, 1.5, 3, and 5 years postpartum. Fathers' depression was measured at gestational week 17. At the last three time-points, child internalizing and externalizing problems were concurrently assessed. We performed multilevel analyses for internalizing and externalizing problems separately, using parental depression as predictors. Analyses were repeated using a sibling comparison design to adjust for familial confounding. Results: All parental depressive time-points were significantly and positively associated with child internalizing and externalizing problems. After sibling comparison, however, only concurrent maternal depression was significantly associated with internalizing [estimate = 2.82 (1.91-3.73, 95% CI)] and externalizing problems [estimate = 2.40 (1.56-3.23, 95% CI)]. The effect of concurrent maternal depression on internalizing problems increased with child age. Conclusions: Our findings do not support the notion that perinatal maternal depression is particularly detrimental to children's psychological development, as the most robust effects were found for maternal depression occurring during preschool years.

AB Purpose of review
   The transgenerational transmission of mental disorders is one of the most significant causes of psychiatric morbidity. Several risk factors for children of parents with mental illness (COPMI) have been identified in numerous studies and meta-analyses.
   Recent findings
   Many interventions have been developed for this high-risk group, but data about their efficacy are heterogeneous.
   Summary
   The current meta-analysis reports on 96 articles including 50 independent samples from randomized controlled trials quantifying effects of preventive interventions for COPMI. Random effect models resulted in small, though significant Effect Sizes (ES) for programs enhancing the mother-infant interaction (ES = 0.26) as well as mothers' (ES = 0.33) and children's (ES = 0.31) behavior that proved to be stable over the 12-month follow-up, except for infants' behavior. Interventions for children/adolescents resulted in significant small effects for global psychopathology (ES = 0.13), as well as internalizing symptoms (ES = 0.17), and increased significantly over time, with externalizing symptoms reaching significance in the follow-up assessments as well (ES = 0.17). Interventions addressing parents and children jointly produced overall larger effects. Higher study quality was associated with smaller effects. There is a dearth of high quality studies that effectively reduce the high risk of COPMI for the development of mental disorders.

Children will only be well integrated into their social environment if they succeed in developing emotion regulation strategies. The quality of emotion regulation plays a crucial role in the development of mental disorders. Longitudinal studies demonstrate a significant connection between inadequate emotion regulation and the development of anxiety and depressive disorders on the one hand and aggressive behavior on the other hand.

AB Sensitive parenting in early childhood (0-3 years) forms the basis for the development of essential socio-emotional skills in infancy. Low levels of sensitive parenting are associated with children's behavioral and emotional disorders as well as problems in emotion regulation, whereas high levels of sensitive parenting lead to positive socio-emotional development in children. The current review examines links between sensitive parenting, socio-emotional development, and emotion regulation. In addition, moderating and mediating variables that influence these links throughout the course of childhood are considered. In a systematic literature search of the Web of Science, PubMed, and PsychInfo databases between 2007 and 2016, 12 longitudinal studies were identified examining these relationships. The included studies examined sensitive parenting of infants up to 3 years old with the use of standardized methods of behavioral observation. To operationalize the construct of sensitive parenting, the studies evaluate parent sensitivity, responsiveness, acceptance, emotional availability, supportiveness, positive regard, and stimulation of development. By contrast, low levels of sensitive parenting were operationalized by intrusive parenting, which stands for harsh, overcontrolling, and hostile behavior towards the child. This review demonstrates that high levels of sensitive parenting are a predictor of positive socio-emotional development, while low levels of sensitive parenting impact a child's development negatively. Sensitive parenting leads to higher social competencies and less internalizing and behavioral problems in children. Furthermore, high levels of sensitive parenting lead to improved emotion regulation (including pain regulation, inhibitory control, and effortful control) in children, whereas low levels of sensitive parenting promote difficulties in emotion regulation and a higher risk for the development of externalizing and internalizing problems. These pathways are influenced by parents' spoiling beliefs, children's frustration reactivity, and genetic influences (SLC6 A3). The results indicate the requirement for a stronger focus on the advancement of parenting skills in the parent-child interaction. Especially during the first years of infancy, programs should focus more on parents' sensitive behaviors toward their children, in order to prevent the development of emotional and behavioral problems as well as problems in emotion regulation. Parents should be supported in the perception of and appropriate response to their child's cues, in their ability to create positive interactions including warmth, acceptance, emotional availability, and positive regard, as well as in the use of positive verbalization toward their children. Furthermore, they should learn to stimulate children's cognitive abilities and to reinforce exploration behavior.

AB Obesity is a significant public health concern that affects more than one-fifth of adolescents aged 12-19 in the United States. Theoretical models suggest that prolonged dietary restraint leads to binge-eating behaviors, which in turn increases individuals' risk for weight gain or obesity. Results from the literature indicate a potential role for negative urgency (the tendency to act rashly when distressed) as a mediating variable that explains the link between dietary restraint and binge-eating episodes. The current study tested short-term, prospective longitudinal associations among dietary restraint, binge eating, negative urgency, and weight gain among college students a population at increased risk for the development of overweight and obesity. We hypothesized that dietary restraint and weight gain would be mediated by negative urgency and binge eating, but only among participants with overweight and obesity. College students (N = 227) completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory, UPPS-P Impulsivity Scale, and self-reported weight and height to calculate body mass index. Results showed that the association between dietary restraint and weight gain was mediated by negative urgency and binge eating, but only among participants with overweight and obesity. Our findings indicated that negative urgency might represent a mechanism that explains why dietary restraint leads to future binge eating episodes and weight gain among college students with overweight and obesity. Results suggest that future treatment and prevention programs for overweight and obesity may benefit from incorporating strategies to improve emotion regulation as a way to reduce binge eating and to prevent additional weight gain among 'at-risk' populations.

AB Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders during adolescence. During this life phase, the incidence of these clinical disorders rises dramatically, and even more adolescents suffer from symptoms of depression or anxiety that are just below the clinical threshold. Both clinical and subclinical levels of depression or anxiety symptoms are related to decreased functioning in various areas, such as social and academic functioning. Prevention of depression and anxiety in adolescents is therefore imperative. We conducted a meta-analytic review of the effects of school-based and community-based prevention programs that are based on cognitive behavioral therapy with the primary goal preventing depression, anxiety, or both in high risk adolescents. Articles were obtained by searching databases and hand searching reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. The selection process yielded 32 articles in the meta-analyses. One article reported on two studies and three articles reported on both depression and anxiety. This resulted in a total of 36 studies, 23 on depression and 13 on anxiety. For depression prevention aimed at high risk adolescents, meta-analysis showed a small effect of prevention programs directly after the intervention, but no effect at 3-6 months and at 12 months follow-up. For anxiety prevention aimed at high risk adolescents, no short-term effect was found, nor at 12 months follow-up. Three to six months after the preventive intervention, symptoms of anxiety were significantly decreased. Although effects on depression and anxiety symptoms were small and temporary, current findings cautiously suggest that depression and anxiety prevention programs based on CBT might have small effects on mental health of adolescents. However, it also indicates that there is still much to be gained for prevention programs. Current findings and possibilities for future research are discussed in order to further improve the effectiveness of targeted prevention on internalizing disorders.

AB Background: Dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions correlate highly with chronic stress. Studies on maltreatment-related cognitions and their predictors in children and adolescents are rare.
   Methods: The study sample consisted of 231 children aged 8-17 years who had experienced maltreatment including domestic violence, emotional abuse, neglect, physical, and sexual abuse. Using multiple linear regression analysis, gender, age, index-event, multi-type maltreatment, out-of-home-care, and migration background were investigated as possible predictors of dysfunctional maltreatment-related cognitions. Additionally, the associations between dysfunctional cognitions and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) as well as further internalizing and externalizing symptoms were calculated.
   Results: Gender emerged as a significant predictor of dysfunctional maltreatment-related cognitions. Moreover, there was an interaction effect of gender and age, with female adolescents showing most dysfunctional cognitions. Furthermore, experiencing five different maltreatment types had an impact, leading to more dysfunctional cognitions compared to single-type maltreatment. Dysfunctional maltreatment-related cognitions correlated highly with PTSS and internalizing symptoms, and moderately with externalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Dysfunctional maltreatment-related cognitions are associated with psychological symptoms after maltreatment and, therefore, need to be addressed in assessment and treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been associated with adverse neurodevelopment in epidemiological studies. However, prior studies had limited statistical power to examine sex-specific effects, and few examined child cognition.
   OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child neurobehavior at 3 y of age in a prospective cohort of 812 mothers and their children.
   METHODS: We measured BPA concentration in urine samples collected at similar to 12 wk gestation among women enrolled in a 10-city Canadian cohort study. At approximately 3 y of age, we assessed children's cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) and two scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Preschool (BRIEF-P). Parents reported children's behavior using the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (TM)-2 (SRS-2). We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in neurobehavioral outcomes with a doubling in BPA concentration and sex-specific associations.
   RESULTS: BPA was not associated with WPPSI-III scores; child sex did not modify these associations. The association between BPA and BRIEF-P scores was modified by child sex (BPA x sex p-values <= 0.03). For example, a doubling of BPA concentration was associated with 1-point (95% CI: 0.3, 1.7) poorer working memory in boys and 0.5-point (95% CI: 1.1, 0.1) better scores in girls. BPA was not associated with most BASC-2 scales; however, it was associated with more internalizing and somatizing behaviors in boys, but not in girls (BPA x sex p-values <=therefore 0.08). A doubling of BPA concentration was associated with poorer SRS-2 scores [beta = 0.3 ( 95% CI: 0, 0.7)]; this association was not modified by sex.
   CONCLUSION: Prenatal urinary BPA concentration was associated with some aspects of child behavior in this cohort, and some associations were stronger among boys.

AB The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between negative life events and emotional-behavioral problems among adolescents from low SES; and the mediator role of self-regulation (SR) in this relationship. The study consisted of a sample of 358 7th and 8th grade-students living in Esenler neighborhood, Istanbul. Students were asked to complete a series of questionnaires, including Demographic Information Form, Life Events Checklist, Self-Regulation Inventory and Youth Self Report (YSR). Path Analysis was run to examine the associations between negative life events and internalizing-externalizing problems via self-regulation. Stability of these relationships across gender was also examined by multiple-group path analysis. Results showed that negative life events predicted both internalizing and externalizing problems directly and indirectly via self-regulation. As the number of negative life events increased, the level of self-regulation skills deteriorated, in turn, it predicted internalizing and externalizing problems. Negative life events more strongly predicted internalizing problems than externalizing problems, whereas self-regulation more strongly predicted externalizing problems than internalizing problems. Besides, the relationship between negative life events and emotional-behavioral problems, and the mediator role of self-regulation in the link between negative life events and problem behaviors did not change across gender. These findings were discussed in relation to the relevant literature focusing on the indicators and outcomes of self-regulation skills among adolescents.

ID REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE; DSM-5 CRITERIA; PREVALENCE; ADULTS
AB Background: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Currently, associations between IGD in early adolescence and mental health are largely unexplained. In the present study, the relation of IGD with adolescent and parental mental health was investigated for the first time.
   Methods: We surveyed 1095 family dyads (an adolescent aged 12-14 years and a related parent) with a standardized questionnaire for IGD as well as for adolescent and parental mental health. We conducted linear (dimensional approach) and logistic (categorical approach) regression analyses.
   Results: Both with dimensional and categorical approaches, we observed statistically significant associations between IGD and male gender, a higher degree of adolescent antisocial behavior, anger control problems, emotional distress, self-esteem problems, hyperactivity/inattention and parental anxiety (linear regression model: corrected R-2 = 0.41, logistic regression model: Nagelkerke's R-2 = 0.41).
   Conclusions: IGD appears to be associated with internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescents. Moreover, the findings of the present study provide first evidence that not only adolescent but also parental mental health is relevant to IGD in early adolescence. Adolescent and parental mental health should be considered in prevention and intervention programs for IGD in adolescence. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This exploratory longitudinal study examined behavioral outcomes and parenting stress among families with children adopted from foster care, taking into account environmental and biological risk factors. Child internalizing and externalizing problems and parenting stress were assessed in 82 adopted children and their families at 2 months post-placement, 12 months post-placement, and then yearly until 5 years post-placement. A history of abuse/neglect predicted significantly higher externalizing and internalizing problems at a borderline level of statistical significance. In the initial stages after placement, externalizing problems were significantly higher among children who were 4 years or older at placement versus those who were younger than 4, although differences were no longer significant 5 years post-placement. Statistical trends in parenting stress reflected reduced stress in the first 12 months followed by a plateau for parents who adopted older children and greater stress for parents who adopted younger children. Familiar limitations for observational cohort data apply. Nonetheless, the availability of longitudinal follow-up on a sizable sample of children adopted from foster care adds insight to the psychological dynamics for adoptive families and suggests that families of children adopted from the foster care system may have unique needs for ongoing support around behavioral issues.

AB Youth in foster care often experience many negative outcomes. Fortunately, the empirical examination of potential protective factors is beginning to grow. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence that a warm relationship with one's caregiver has on the well-established association between trauma symptoms and youth reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to explore the impact of this protective factor on this association. A warm relationship with a caregiver was a significant moderator of trauma and youth report of internalizing behaviors. Implications for practice and policy are discussed.

AB There is substantial evidence for behavioral sex differences in risk trajectories for alcohol and substance use, with internalizing factors such as negative affectivity contributing more to female risk. Because the neural development of emotion circuitry varies between males and females across adolescence, it represents a potential mechanism by which underlying neurobiology contributes to risk for substance use. Longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in males and females (n = 18 each) with a family history of alcohol use disorders starting at ages 8-13 years. Participants performed an affective word task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1- to 2-year intervals, covering the age range of 8.5-17.6 years (3-4 scans per participant). Significant age-related sex differences were found in the right amygdala and right precentral gyrus for the negative vs neutral word condition. Males showed a significant decrease in both amygdala and precentral gyrus activation with age, whereas the response in females persisted. The subjective experience of internalizing symptomatology significantly increased with age for females but not for males. Taken together, these results reveal sex differences in negative affect processing in at-risk adolescents, and offer longitudinal neural evidence for female substance use risk through internalizing pathways.

AB This study reports the results of a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of Conjoint Behavioral Consultation (CBC), a family-school partnership intervention, on children's behaviors, parents' skills, and parent-teacher relationships in rural community and town settings. Participants were 267 children, 267 parents, and 152 teachers in 45 Midwestern schools. Using an Intent to Treat approach and data analyzed within a multilevel modeling framework, CBC yielded promising results for some but not all outcomes. Specifically, children participating in CBC experienced decreases in daily reports of aggressiveness, noncompliance, and temper tantrums; and increases in parent-reported adaptive skills and social skills at a significantly greater pace than those in a control group. Other outcomes (e.g., parent reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors) suggested a nonsignificant effect at post-test. CBC parents reported using more effective parenting strategies, gaining more competence in their problem-solving practices, and feeling more efficacious for helping their child succeed in school than parents in the control group. Parents participating in CBC also reported significant improvements in the parent-teacher relationship, and the parent-teacher relationship mediated the effect of CBC on children's adaptive skills. Implications for practice in rural communities, study limitations, and directions for future research are discussed. (C) 2017 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Psychological studies traditionally focus on problem behaviors and clinical diagnoses of children to explain their liking and disliking by peers. Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), in particular, often display problem behaviors resulting in their social impairment. However, adults' behaviors toward a child are an understudied factor that may also affect the impressions that peers form about that child. Participants were 137 previously unacquainted children ages 6.8-9.8 (24 with ADHD and 113 typically developing children) in a 2-week summer day program, along with their camp teachers. Data were analyzed via longitudinal social network analyses that controlled for children's ADHD diagnostic status and disruptive and internalizing behaviors. Results suggested that camp teachers' observed highlighting of children's personal strengths predicted these children receiving more liking nominations from peers and, for children with ADHD, fewer disliking nominations over the course of camp. Camp teachers' highlighting of behavioral compliance was not associated with peers' impressions of children. Camp teachers' public correction of children predicted these children's receipt of fewer liking nominations, among children with low disruptive behavior. Camp teachers' discreet corrections did not show this effect. Specific adult behaviors toward children, when displayed in front of peers, may influence peers' liking and disliking impressions.

AB Scholars have theorized interrelationships between family members' health and well-being. Though prior research demonstrates associations between parents' and children's health, less is known about the relationship between parental health limitations and children's behavioral and academic outcomes. This article uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Well being Study (N=3,273) to estimate the relationship between parental health limitations and four aspects of children's well-being. Findings reveal that mothers' health limitations, especially when they occur in middle childhood or chronically, are independently associated with greater internalizing and externalizing behaviors, lower verbal ability, and worse overall health at age 9. Fathers' health limitations are not associated with children's well-being. Fathers exert influence in other ways, as the relationship between mothers' chronic health limitations and children's internalizing behaviors is concentrated among children not residing with their fathers. These findings support the development of policies and interventions aimed at families.

AB Growing evidence has highlighted the importance of motor proficiency in relation to psychosocial outcomes including self-perceived competence in various domains, perceived social support, and emotional areas such as anxiety and depression. The Environmental Stress Hypothesis-elaborated (Cairney, Rigoli, & Piek, 2013) is a proposed theoretical framework for understanding these relationships and recent studies have begun examining parts of this model using child and adolescent populations. However, the extent to which the relationships between these areas exist, persist or change during early adulthood is currently unclear. The current study aimed to investigate the Environmental Stress Hypothesis in a sample of 95 young adults aged 18-30 years and examined the mediating role of physical self-worth and perceived social support in the relationship between motor proficiency and internalising symptoms. The McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (McCarron, 1997) was used to assess motor proficiency, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) provided a measure of internalising symptoms, and the Physical Self Perceptions Profile (Fox & Corbin, 1989) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988) were used to investigate the possible mediating role of physical self-worth and perceived social support respectively. Potential confounding variables such as age, gender and BMI were also considered in the analysis. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that perceived social support mediated the relationship between motor proficiency and internalising symptoms, whereas, the mediating role of physical self-worth was non-significant. The current results provide support for part of the model pathways as described in the Environmental Stress Hypothesis and suggest an important relationship between motor proficiency and psychosocial outcomes in young adults. Specifically, the results support previous literature regarding the significant role of perceived social support for mental well-being and suggest that an intervention that considers social support may also indirectly influence mental health outcomes in young adults who experience movement difficulties.

AB Schizophrenia and affective psychoses are both associated with impaired social functioning, but the extent to which childhood behavioral impairments are present prior to onset of illness is less well studied. Moreover, the concurrent relationship of childhood behavior problems and premorbid IQ with subsequent psychotic disorder has not been established. We investigated whether childhood behavior problems are associated with increased risk for adult schizophrenia or affective psychosis, independently and in combination with IQ. The study included individuals with schizophrenia (N = 47), affective psychoses (N = 45) and non-psychotic controls (N = 1496) from the New England Family Study. Behavior problems were prospectively assessed from standardized clinician observations at ages 4 and 7. IQ was assessed with the Stanford-Binet at age 4 and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at age 7. We found externalizing problems at age 4 and externalizing and internalizing problems at age 7 were associated with later schizophrenia, and both internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 4 and 7 were associated with later development of affective psychoses. Lower IQ at ages 4 and 7 was associated with schizophrenia, while lower IQ was associated with affective psychoses at age 7 only. Examined simultaneously, both lower IQ and behavior problems remained associated with risk of schizophrenia, while only behavior problems remained associated with affective psychoses. Behavior problems appear to be a general marker of risk of adult psychotic disorder, while lower childhood IQ is more specific to risk of schizophrenia. Future research should clarify the premorbid evolution of behavior and cognitive problems into adult psychosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Common emotional and behavioral symptoms co-occur and are associated with core temperament factors. This study investigated links between temperament and dimensional, latent psychopathology factors, including a general common psychopathology factor (p factor) and specific latent internalizing and externalizing liabilities, as captured by a bifactor model, in two independent samples of youth. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that temperament factors of negative affectivity (NA), positive affectivity (PA), and effortful control (EC) could serve as both transdiagnostic and specific risks in relation to recent bifactor models of child psychopathology. Sample 1 included 571 youth (average age 13.6, SD =2.37, range 9.3-17.5) with both youth and parent report. Sample 2 included 554 preadolescent children (average age 7.7, SD =1.35, range =5-11 years) with parent report. Structural equation modeling showed that the latent bifactor models fit in both samples. Replicated in both samples, the p factor was associated with lower EC and higher NA (transdiagnostic risks). Several specific risks replicated in both samples after controlling for co-occurring symptoms via the p factor: internalizing was associated with higher NA and lower PA, lower EC related to externalizing problems.

AB Parent-child physical aggression (PCPA) and adult intimate partner violence (IPV) are common forms of family violence that often co-occur. Their deleterious effects on children and adolescents have been well documented. However, important questions remain regarding whether the type of violence exposure, the experience of one or both forms, the chronicity of violent experiences, and the age, gender, and SES of the child, differentially influence developmental outcomes. Data on 2810 children from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods were analyzed. Children aged 3-9 at the outset were assessed three times, at 3-year intervals. Primary caregivers reported on IPV, PCPA, and children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms were examined as a function of time, age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and the time-varying effects of cumulative IPV and PCPA exposure. Cumulative experiences of IPV and PCPA each adversely affected the developmental trajectories of both externalizing and internalizing symptoms, but in different ways: and they did so independently of participants' age, gender, or SES, which all functioned as significant, independent predictors of child outcomes. PCPA was by far the more potent of the two forms of violence: and when both forms occurred, they worked additively to affect outcomes. Important questions remain regarding the reasons for the differential potency of these two forms of family violence on childhood symptoms, and related implications for interventions, as well as for later adult behavior.

AB Children who endure multiple victimization experiences, or "polyvictims," are vulnerable to maladaptive outcomes. Yet, little research exists evaluating the relationship between childhood polyvictimization and disordered eating symptoms (DES) in emerging adulthood. The current study examines the relationship between childhood polyvictimization and DES in emerging adults. Data were collected from 288 participants across two universities using online self-report measures. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between number of childhood victimization experiences and DES in young adulthood (beta = 0.14; p = 0.016). Female participants were more likely to demonstrate DES (beta = 0.14; p = 0.008). Further, high levels of emotion dysregulation during young adulthood were associated with more DES (beta = 0.33; p < 0.001). Findings suggest that exposure to victimization experiences in childhood increases individuals' risk for exhibiting DES in young adulthood. Results also highlight the strong relationship between individuals' emotion regulation abilities and the presence of DES. Findings align with the theory that children who have endured high levels of victimization often feel overwhelmed by their emotions and circumstances, demonstrate emotion regulation difficulties, and may rely on maladaptive coping strategies, including disordered eating, to manage adversities. Study results emphasize the importance of considering victimization history when working with emerging adults displaying disordered eating symptomatology.

AB Psychological maltreatment is an important social and public health problem and associated with a wide range of short and long-term outcomes in childhood to adulthood. Given the importance of investigating mitigating factors on its effect, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the mediating effect of active and avoidant coping strategies on the association between psychological maltreatment and mental health-internalizing and externalizing-problems in adolescents. Participants of the study consisted of 783 adolescents, ranging in age from 14 to 18 years (M = 15.57, SD = 0.88), with 52.9% female and 47.1% male. Several structural equation models were conducted to investigate the mediating role of coping strategies on the effect of psychological maltreatment on adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. Findings from mediation analyses demonstrated the mediating effect of active and avoidant coping strategies on the association between psychological maltreatment and mental health problems. The outcomes support adolescents use more avoidant coping strategies and fewer active coping strategies in the face of psychological maltreatment experiences, and this affects their mental health. Taken together, these results should contribute to the design of prevention and intervention services in order to promote mental health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Pediatric Diabetes 2017: 18: 297-303.
   Background: Children with type 1 diabetes demonstrate worse cognitive performance compared with their peers. Little is known regarding the cognitive and behavioral performance in obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Cross sectional evaluation of 20 obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy adolescents was performed in Cincinnati, Ohio. Cognitive tests that included measures of processing speed, working memory, verbal and semantic fluency and parent reports of executive function and problem behavior were compared. Academic achievement and the relationship between cognitive/behavioral scores and diabetes duration and diabetes control (hemoglobin A1c) were assessed in the type 2 diabetes group only.
   Results: The type 2 diabetes group had mean duration of diabetes of 2.8 +/- 2.2 yr and hemoglobin A1c of 7.9 +/- 2.2%. Adolescents with type 2 diabetes scored lower than controls on tests of working and verbal memory and processing speed (all p<0.05) and worse for Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist (all p<0.05). Adolescents with type 2 diabetes scored below the population mean in academic achievement, most notably calculation. Working memory and processing speed were negatively correlated with duration of diabetes (r=-0.50 and -0.47, respectively, p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Obese youth with type 2 diabetes score poorly compared with controls on multiple assessments of cognitive function and adaptive behavior. Further work is needed to determine if these effects are driven by obesity, diabetes or other demographic and socioeconomic risk factors.

AB Parenting and family interventions have repeatedly shown effectiveness in preventing and treating a range of youth outcomes. Accordingly, investigators in this area have conducted a number of studies using statistical mediation to examine some of the potential mechanisms of action by which these interventions work. This review examined from a methodological perspective in what ways and how well the family-based intervention studies tested statistical mediation. A systematic search identified 73 published outcome studies that tested mediation for family-based interventions across a wide range of child and adolescent outcomes (i.e., externalizing, internalizing, and substance-abuse problems; high-risk sexual activity; and academic achievement), for putative mediators pertaining to positive and negative parenting, family functioning, youth beliefs and coping skills, and peer relationships. Taken as a whole, the studies used designs that adequately addressed temporal precedence. The majority of studies used the product of coefficients approach to mediation, which is preferred, and less limiting than the causal steps approach. Statistical significance testing did not always make use of the most recently developed approaches, which would better accommodate small sample sizes and more complex functions. Specific recommendations are offered for future mediation studies in this area with respect to full longitudinal design, mediation approach, significance testing method, documentation and reporting of statistics, testing of multiple mediators, and control for Type I error.

AB Although the interpersonal difficulties associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are well established, their manifestations within the context of parent-child relationships remain understudied. The current study investigated the relation of maternal BPD symptoms to nonsupportive emotion socialization (i.e., the extent to which mothers punish or minimize their young children's displays of negative emotions), as well as the mediating role of maternal emotion regulation difficulties in this relation. The authors also investigated the moderating role of maternal BPD symptoms in the relation between infant temperamental anger and fear and punitive/minimizing emotion socialization. Using a sample of 99 mother-infant dyads, the authors found that maternal BPD symptoms were significantly related to punitive/minimizing emotion socialization and that maternal emotion regulation difficulties mediated this relation. Moreover, maternal BPD symptoms strengthened the association between mother-reported infant anger and punitive/minimizing emotion socialization. These results extend the growing literature on the impact of maternal BPD on child development.

AB Background. Maternal smoking has consistently been associated with multiple adverse childhood outcomes including externalizing disorders. In contrast the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) and internalizing (anxiety and depressive) disorders in offspring has received less investigation.
   Method. We conducted a nationwide cohort study including 957635 individuals born in Denmark between 1991 and 2007. Data on MSDP and diagnoses of depression or anxiety disorders were derived from national registers and patients were followed up from the age of 5 years to the end of 2012. Hazard rate ratios (HRRs) were estimated using stratified Cox regression models. Sibling data were used to disentangle individual- and familial-level effects of MSDP and to control for unmeasured familial confounding.
   Results. At the population level, offspring exposed to MSDP were at increased risk for both severe depression [HRR 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.36] and severe anxiety disorders (HRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.20-1.32) even when controlling for maternal and paternal traits. However, there was no association between MSDP and internalizing disorders when controlling for the mother's propensity for MSDP (depression: HRR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94-1.30; anxiety disorders: HRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.11) or comparing differentially exposed siblings (depression: HRR 1.18, 95% CI 0.75-1.89; anxiety disorders: HRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.55-1.36).
   Conclusions. The results suggest that familial background factors account for the association between MSDP and severe internalizing disorders not the specific exposure to MSDP.

AB The present study examines the extent to which residential mobility during the transition to kindergarten (cumulative moves during prekindergarten and kindergarten) is related to externalizing and internalizing behavior problems for children from low-income families who are living in non-parental care. A second, exploratory aim of this study was to investigate whether family service receipt moderated these relations. Data were obtained from the Head Start Impact Study. The sample included 300 children (53% male) who were eligible for Head Start. Residential mobility was conceptualized as three dichotomous variables: never moved, moved 1-2 times, and moved 3 or more times during the prekindergarten and kindergarten years. Predictor and outcome data were collected in the spring of prekindergarten and kindergarten. Moving three or more times was significantly related to more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in kindergarten, controlling for family and child covariates, as well as for children's behavior problems in prekindergarten. Receipt of family services moderated the association between moving three or more times and externalizing problems, but not internalizing problems. This relation was in the opposite direction than expected, however, such that children who moved frequently and received more services demonstrated more externalizing problems than their peers. Implications of study findings for supporting highly mobile children living in non-parental care and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Neighborhood and parenting influences on early behavioral outcomes are strongly dependent upon a child's stage of development. However, little research has jointly considered the longitudinal associations of neighborhood and parenting processes with behavior problems in early childhood. To address this limitation, this study explores the associations of neighborhood collective efficacy and maternal corporal punishment with the longitudinal patterns of early externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The study sample consisted of 3,705 families from a nationally representative cohort study of urban families. Longitudinal multilevel models examined the associations of collective efficacy and corporal punishment with behavior problems at age 3, as well as with patterns of behavior problems between the ages 3 to 5. Interactions between the main predictors and child age tested whether neighborhood and parent relationships with child behavior varied over time. Mediation analysis examined whether neighborhood influences on child behavior were mediated by parenting. The models controlled for a comprehensive set of possible confounders at the child, parent, and neighborhood levels. Results indicate that both maternal corporal punishment and low neighborhood collective efficacy were significantly associated with increased behavior problems. The significant interaction between collective efficacy and child age with internalizing problems suggests that neighborhood influences on internalizing behavior were stronger for younger children. The indirect effect of low collective efficacy on behavior problems through corporal punishment was not significant. These findings highlight the importance of multilevel interventions that promote both neighborhood collective efficacy and nonphysical discipline in early childhood.

AB This study examines potential mechanisms linking maternal depressive symptoms over 2 years postpartum with child behavior problems at school-age in a sample of adolescent mothers and their first-born child. Potential mechanisms include: mother-reported caregiving engagement at 6 months; observed parental nurturance and control, and child competence and affect at 24 months; and mother-reported resilience at 7 years based on achievement of adult developmental tasks. One hundred eighteen low-income African American adolescent mothers were recruited at delivery and followed through child age 7 years. Maternal depressive symptom trajectories over 24 months were estimated (low, medium, and high) based on mother-reported depressive symptoms. Direct and indirect associations between depressive symptom trajectories with 7-year maternal depressive symptoms and child behavior problems were examined. The high maternal depressive symptom trajectory was associated with 7-year maternal depressive symptoms (b = 5.52, SE = 1.65, p < .01) and child internalizing problems (b = 7.60, SE = 3.12, p = .02) and externalizing problems (b = 6.23, SE = 3.22, p = .05). Caregiving engagement among high depressive symptom trajectory mothers was significantly associated with observed child affect (b = -0.21, SE = 0.11, p = 0.05). Parental nurturance in toddlerhood mediated the association between high maternal depressive symptom trajectory and child internalizing problems at 7 years (indirect effect b = 2.33, 95% CI: 0.32-5.88). Findings suggest that family based interventions to promote parenting and adolescent resiliency strengthening may be beneficial in this population.

AB Although the negative effect of interparental conflict on child behavior problems has been well established, few studies have examined this association during infancy. This study examined the associations between mother-reported interparental conflict and young children's behavior problems over the first 2 years of their lives in a sample of 212 mothers and infants. Two aspects of maternal sensitivity, sensitivity during distressing and nondistressing contexts, were examined as possible mediators between interparental conflict and infants' behavior problems. Results indicated that interparental conflict was associated directly with infants' externalizing problems over time but was associated indirectly with infants' internalizing problems over time via compromised maternal sensitivity within distressing contexts but not through maternal sensitivity within nondistressing contexts. No significant child gender differences were found. Such findings add to a limited body of research suggesting that the early interparental relationship context is relevant for infant adjustment. The salient mediating role of maternal sensitivity within distressing contexts provides important theoretical and practical insights for future studies.

AB Prior research has linked marital conflict to children's internalizing/externalizing disorders, insecure attachment, and poor emotional regulation (e.g., Cummings & Davies, 2010; Cummings, Iannotti, & Zahn-Waxler, 1985). Although investigators have examined the impact of marital discord on older children (e.g., Crockenberg & Langrock, 2001), few have explored direct links in infancy (e.g., Cowan & Cowan, 1999). This study extends earlier work by examining linkages between marital functioning (conflict and harmony) and infants' cardiac vagal tone and developmental status across 2 time points using a cross-lag approach. Differential findings were found for boys and girls, with concurrent linkages between marital love and vagal tone at 6 months for boys and girls but only for boys at 12 months. In addition, marital conflict at 6 months predicted lower cardiac vagal tone in girls at 12 months but not boys. Finally, infants' developmental status at 6 months was found to predict marital conflict at 12 months. Higher scores on the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) predicted greater marital conflict whereas higher scores on the Mental Development Index (MDI) predicted lower conflict. These findings are discussed in the context of the emotional security hypothesis and the spillover framework as well as differential susceptibilities to early developmental contexts.

AB This investigation was designed to identify dyadic differences in mother-adolescent conflict. In 2 studies (N = 131 and N = 147), adolescents (M = 13.88 and 14.65 years old) described the number of disagreements with mothers during the previous (1 or 3) days, their affective intensity, and perceptions of negativity in the relationship. Cluster analyses yielded 3 unique groups that replicated across studies: (a) placid dyads (50% of Study 1 participants and 36% of Study 2 participants), notable for low disagreement affective intensity and low relationship negativity; (b) explosive dyads (25% of Study 1 participants and 31% of Study 2 participants), notable for high affective intensity; and (c) squabbling dyads (25% of Study 1 participants and 33% of Study 2 participants), notable for frequent conflict. Longitudinal analyses revealed that cluster group membership was stable from 1 year to the next. Follow-up analyses indicated that adolescents in placid dyads had lower levels of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors than those in the explosive or squabbling dyads, concurrently and prospectively.

AB Adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit functional impairment even those having less visible symptoms. Therefore, it is of great clinical importance to identify ADHD symptoms among adolescents in the community. Furthermore, little is known regarding the role of internalizing symptoms in their quality of life. Thus, this study aimed to screen ADHD in a sample of high school students using the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale (ASRS) and to investigate the impact of internalizing symptoms on their well-being. In the first year, adolescents aged 15-17 years old from a senior high school (N = 1947) completed the Adult ADHD Self-rating Scale (ASRS), Wender Utah Rating Scale, Impulsiveness Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory and Beck's Anxiety Inventory. In the second year, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF was applied for the measurement of their psychosocial outcomes. Results showed that adolescents with higher ASRS scores manifested more severe concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms. ADHD symptoms among these adolescents were significantly associated with poorer quality of life 1 year later (p < 0.001). And both depressive and anxiety symptoms were mediators in the relationship between ADHD symptoms and quality of life. The finding of this study supports that the concurrent internalizing symptoms may underlie the negative relations between ADHD symptoms and quality of life in adolescents in the community. The application of ASRS in adolescents may help clinicians in early intervention for their ADHD problems as well as emotional symptoms.

AB The present study examined measurement invariance and convergent validity of a novel vignette-based measure of emotion-specific self-regulation that simultaneously assesses attributional bias, emotion-regulation, and self-efficacy beliefs about emotion regulation. Participants included 541 youth-mother dyads from three countries (Italy, the United States, and Colombia) and six ethnic/cultural groups. Participants were 12.62 years old (SD = 0.69). In response to vignettes involving ambiguous peer interactions, children reported their hostile/depressive attribution bias, self-efficacy beliefs about anger and sadness regulation, and anger/sadness regulation strategies (i.e., dysregulated expression and rumination). Across the six cultural groups, anger and sadness self-regulation subscales had full metric and partial scalar invariance for a one-factor model, with some exceptions. We found support for both a four- and three-factor oblique model (dysregulated expression and rumination loaded on a second-order factor) for both anger and sadness. Anger subscales were related to externalizing problems, while sadness subscales were related to internalizing symptoms.

AB BackgroundThis study was undertaken to determine how well two oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) dimensions (irritable and headstrong/hurtful) assessed in childhood predict late adolescent psychopathology and the degree towhich these outcomes can be attributed to genetic influences shared with ODD dimensions.
   MethodsPsychopathology was assessed via diagnostic interviews of 1,225 twin pairs at ages 11 and 17.
   ResultsConsistent with hypotheses, the irritable dimension uniquely predicted overall internalizing problems, whereas the headstrong/hurtful dimension uniquely predicted substance use disorder symptoms. Both dimensions were predictive of antisocial behavior and overall externalizing problems. The expected relationships between the irritable dimension and specific internalizing disorders were not found. Twin modeling showed that the irritable and headstrong/hurtful dimensions were related to late adolescent psychopathology symptoms through common genetic influences.
   ConclusionsSymptoms of ODD in childhood pose a significant risk for various mental health outcomes in late adolescence. Further, common genetic influences underlie the covariance between irritable symptoms in childhood and overall internalizing problems in late adolescence, whereas headstrong/hurtful symptoms share genetic influences with substance use disorder symptoms. Antisocial behavior and overall externalizing share common genetic influences with both the irritable and headstrong/hurtful dimensions.

AB BackgroundPrevious research has shown that a mismatch between one's own socioeconomic status (SES) and the SES of the surrounding context can lead to maladaptive outcomes, such as increased social stigma and low levels of belongingness (Johnson, Richeson, & Finkel, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100, 2011, 838; Ostrove, The Journal of Social Issues, 59, 2003, 771). This study examines an adolescent population, as contextual comparisons should be especially salient at this time.
   MethodsParticipants included over 900 adolescents at age 15 involved in a multisite longitudinal study.
   ResultsResults showed that lower relative income status predicted increased social dissatisfaction, internalizing and externalizing problems, after controlling for family SES. Moreover, the effect of relative income was indirectly related to these problems through social dissatisfaction. Exploratory multigroup analyses by gender suggested that the adolescent girls may be driving the effects of relative income.
   ConclusionsFindings are discussed in regard to adolescent socioemotional functioning, as well as the implications for gender differences related to relative income status.

AB Internalizing and externalizing problems commonly co-occur with adolescent post-traumatic stress and grief reactions. However, little is known about whether these co-occurring symptoms moderate adolescents' response to sequenced components of trauma- and grief-focused interventions. Forty-four middle school students (aged 12-14) rated their self-identified Top Problem during a 17-week flexibly tailored course of Trauma and Grief Component Therapy for Adolescents (TGCTA), a group-based treatment for traumatized and bereaved youth. Baseline internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined as potential moderators of adolescents' response to skills-building (Module I), narrative-sharing (Modules II and III), and developmental progression (Module IV) phases of intervention. Piecewise analyses of change during the three treatment phases indicated that adolescents with more internalizing symptoms showed significantly less improvement during the skills-building phase and significantly more improvement during the narrative construction phase. Findings provide preliminary evidence that: (a) traumatized and bereaved adolescents show different trajectories of response to different TGCTA components as a function of internalizing versus externalizing baseline symptoms and (b) assessing self-nominated problems and broad-spectrum internalizing and externalizing symptoms can guide trauma- and bereavement-informed treatment planning and monitoring.

AB Founded in 1939, the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study represents the earliest longitudinal-experimental study in developmental crime prevention, combining the aims of understanding how the developmental process is related to future offending (i.e., longitudinal focus) as well as attempting to prevent offending through an experimental intervention during early adolescence. This article examines the historical context in which this novel design arose and provides a review of studies performed by Joan McCord based on her age-45 follow up of the study. The study made possible decades of research on developmental risk factors for delinquency and criminal offending. A central question that arises from McCord's body of research is how these risk factors are transmitted from parents to children. This article reviews extant research on the transmission of intergenerational offending, and discusses the potential of the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study to contribute to this literature. Specifically, the prospective longitudinal design makes it possible to include the children of the study participants and investigate the intergenerational transmission of offending, while the longitudinal-experimental design allows for the investigation of the transmission of treatment effects. This potential research stands as a testament to the study's design and vision.

AB This study investigated the relationship between self-reported time in bed and sleep quality in association with self-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms in a sample of 285 elementary school students (52 % female) recruited from a rural Midwestern elementary school. Path models were used to estimate proposed associations, controlling for grade level and gender. Curvilinear associations were found between time in bed and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and irritability. Marginal curvilinear trends were found between time in bed and emotion dysregulation, reactive aggression, and proactive aggression. Sleep quality was negatively associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, irritability, reactive aggression, and delinquency engagement. Gender and grade differences were found across models. Findings suggest that examining self-reported time in bed (both linear and quadratic) and sleep quality is important for understanding internalizing and externalizing symptoms associated with sleep in school-age youth. Incorporating self-reported sleep assessments into clinical practice and school-based evaluations may have implications for a child's adjustment.

AB One of teenagers' key developmental tasks is to engage in new and meaningful relationships with peers and adults outside the family context. Attachment-derived expectations about the self and others in terms of internal attachment working models have the potential to shape such social reorientation processes critically and thereby influence adolescents' social-emotional development and social integration. Because the neural underpinnings of this developmental task remain largely unknown, we sought to investigate them by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We asked n = 44 adolescents (ages 12.01-18.84 years) to evaluate positive and negative adjectives regarding either themselves or a close other during an adapted version of the well-established self-other trait-evaluation task. As measures of attachment, we obtained scores reflecting participants' positive versus negative attachment-derived self- and other-models by means of the Relationship Questionnaire. We controlled for possible confounding factors by also obtaining scores reflecting internalizing/externalizing problems, schizotypy, and borderline symptomatology. Our results revealed that participants with a more negative attachment-derived self-model showed increased brain activity during positive and negative adjective evaluation regarding the self, but decreased brain activity during negative adjective evaluation regarding a close other, in bilateral amygdala/parahippocampus, bilateral anterior temporal pole/anterior superior temporal gyrus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that a low positivity of the self-concept characteristic for the attachment anxiety dimension may influence neural information processing, but in opposite directions when it comes to self- versus (close) other-representations. We discuss our results in the framework of attachment theory and regarding their implications especially for adolescent social-emotional development and social integration.

AB Worldwide, 10-20% of adolescents experience mental health problems. Strategies aimed at strengthening resilience protective factors provide a potential approach for reducing mental health problems in adolescents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a universal, school-based intervention targeting resilience protective factors in reducing mental health problems in adolescents. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 20 intervention and 12 control secondary schools located in socio-economically disadvantaged areas of NSW, Australia. Data were collected from 3115 students at baseline (Grade 7, 2011), of whom 2149 provided data at follow up (Grade 10, 2014; enrolments in Grades 7 to 10 typically aged 12-16 years; 50% male; 69.0% retention). There were no significant differences between groups at follow-up for three mental health outcomes: total SDQ internalising problems, and prosocial behaviour. A small statistically significant difference in favour of the control group was found for externalising problems. Findings highlight the continued difficulties in developing effective, school-based prevention programs for mental health problems in adolescents. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Objective: This study evaluated whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is separable from ADHD-inattention (IN) and uniquely associated with internalizing dimensions in preschool children in South Korea. Method: Mothers of 172 preschool children (ages 4-6 years; 52% girls) rated children's SCT, ADHD-IN, ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), aggression, emotional reactivity, anxiety/depression, somatic complaints, withdrawal, and sleep problems. Results: Eight of 10 SCT symptoms showed convergent and discriminant validity with ADHD-IN. ADHD-IN remained significantly positively associated with ADHD-HI, ODD, and aggressive behavior after controlling for SCT, whereas SCT was no longer positively associated with these externalizing behaviors after controlling for ADHD-IN. Both SCT and ADHD-IN were uniquely associated with greater emotionally reactivity, anxiety/depression, and withdrawal. Only SCT was uniquely associated with somatic complaints, and only ADHD-IN was uniquely associated with sleep problems. Conclusion: Findings replicate results with children and adolescents, thus expanding evidence for the validity of SCT in early development.

AB This brief report examined the unique associations between parents' ratings of child internalizing symptoms and their own depression and anxiety in families with parental substance use disorder (SUD). Further, we examined whether parental SUD (father only, mother only, both parents) was related to discrepancy in mothers' and fathers' reports of children's internalizing symptoms. Participants were 97 triads (fathers, mothers) in which one or both parents met criteria for SUD. Polynomial regression analyses were conducted to examine whether father-mother reports of child internalizing symptoms had unique associations with parents' own symptoms of depression and anxiety while controlling for child gender, child age, and SUD diagnoses. Controlling for fathers' symptoms and other covariates, mothers experiencing more depression and anxiety symptoms reported more symptoms of child internalizing symptoms than did fathers. Mothers' and fathers' SUD was associated with higher anxiety symptoms among mothers after controlling for other variables. A second set of polynomial regressions examined whether father-mother reports of child internalizing symptoms had unique associations with parents' SUD diagnoses while controlling for child gender and child age. After controlling for mothers' symptoms and other covariates, parents' reports of children's internalizing symptoms were not significantly associated with either parent's SUD or parental SUD interactions (i.e., both parents have SUD diagnoses). Taken together, mothers' ratings of children's internalizing symptoms may be accounted for, in part, by her reports of depression and anxiety symptoms.

AB ObjectivesMaternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a risk factor for negative child adjustment, but it is unclear whether this association is direct (e.g., a mother's PTSD symptoms are observed, learned, and internalized by children which results in behavioral and emotional problems) or indirect, through parent-child relationship difficulties or parenting stress. We hypothesized that parenting stress and maternal emotional availability would exhibit indirect effects on relationships between maternal PTSD and children's functioning.
   MethodParticipants were 52 trauma-exposed mothers and their children (aged 7-12 years). Mothers completed measures of PTSD and parenting stress and reported on their children's functioning. Emotional availability was assessed through observer-rated mother-child interactions.
   ResultsEmotional availability was not related to PTSD or child outcomes. Parenting stress had a substantial indirect effect on the relationships between maternal PTSD and child emotion regulation, internalizing, and externalizing behaviors.
   ConclusionsResults highlight the need to target parenting stress in interventions with trauma-exposed families. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We evaluated Bem's (1981, 1993) thesis that psychological androgyny-perceiving the self to possess characteristics of both genders-is associated with healthy adjustment and minimal gender-polarizing cognition. Prior studies testing Bem's ideas have yielded ambiguous results, mainly because self-perceptions of gender-typed attributes have been inferred narrowly from self-perceptions of expressive and instrumental personality traits. We administered measures of gender identity (self-perceived similarity to a gender) that more clearly capture self-perceptions of attributes typical of a gender, and we examined conjoint influences of same-gender typicality and other-gender typicality on children's self-esteem, internalizing problems, felt pressure for gender differentiation, and sexist ideology. Two studies were conducted with ethnically/racially diverse samples of preadolescent children in the southeastern United States. In Study 1 (N = 305, M (age) = 10.8 years), androgynous children (i.e., children who saw themselves as similar to both genders) reported high self-esteem, evidenced few internalizing problems, and reported feeling little pressure for gender differentiation. In Study 2 (N = 236, M (age) = 11.3 years), androgynous boys reported few sexist beliefs. Children with other patterns of gender identity (e.g., high same-gender typicality coupled with low other-gender typicality) sometimes showed similar correlates, but each other pattern of gender identity was associated with poor adjustment or strong gender-differentiating cognition on at least one dependent variable whereas androgyny never was. Results support Bem's thesis that persons who perceive themselves as possessing characteristics of both genders enjoy mental health advantages over those who perceive themselves as possessing characteristics of only one.

AB Depressed parents may negatively influence the well-being and outcomes of their children. However, prior research has mostly addressed mother's depression and early childhood outcomes, whereas fathers and adolescents have been largely ignored in the literature. Using data from the sixth grade and age 15 waves of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, this study addresses similarities and differences in the influence of paternal and maternal depression on adolescent behavior. Results from structural equation models showed that paternal depression had direct effects on both internalizing and externalizing behaviors, whereas maternal depression did not. Maternal depression worked through parenting behaviors, whereas paternal depression did not. These results highlight the importance of understanding depression through a gender-specific lens, highlight the paternal role in the family system, and underscore the importance of better depression screening and help-seeking interventions for fathers.

AB Although behavioral inhibition (BI) is clearly identified as a temperamental risk factor for childhood anxiety psychopathology, much less is known about whether the strength of this association may vary as a function of parasympathetic nervous system regulation in children with anxiety disorders. To build upon extant research in this area, the present study examined whether respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) can explicate the conditions in which BI is linked to increased symptom severity among anxiety disordered children (N = 44; M = 9.61 years, SD = 1.63; 52% female and African American, respectively). We examined RSA responding both during a basal period and during a stressor ("challenge" RSA): interacting with a "mystery guest" who was wearing a mask. As hypothesized, the interaction between BI and both basal and challenge RSA was significantly related to anxiety disorder symptom severity, even after controlling for depressive symptoms. The form of the interaction indicated that highest levels of anxiety disorder symptoms were found among children with high levels of BI and low basal and challenge RSA, respectively. These data provide novel empirical evidence of a clinically-relevant interplay between RSA and BI in relation to anxiety disorder symptom severity among clinical youth. Future work is needed to expand on the specific mechanisms that may be responsible e for the interplay between temperamental and psychobiological risks for childhood anxiety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although breathing CO2-enriched air reliably increases anxiety, there is debate concerning the nature and specificity of CO2 hypersensitivity to panic risk and panic disorder versus anxiety disorders and related traits broadly, particularly among adolescents and emerging adults. The present study sought to clarify the association of CO2 hypersensitivity with internalizing conditions and symptoms among adolescents and young adults. Participants (N = 628) self-reported anxiety levels every 2 min while breathing air enriched to 7.5% CO2 for 8 min. Growth mixture models were used to examine the structure of anxiety trajectories during the task and the association of each trajectory with dimensional and diagnostic assessments of internalizing disorders. Three distinct trajectories emerged: overall low (low), overall high (high), and acutely increased anxiety (acute). Compared to the low class, the acute class reported elevated neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity, and stress whereas the high class reported elevated anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, neuroticism, anxiety sensitivity, and increased likelihood of an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Moreover, the acute and high classes reported experiencing a panic-like event at a higher rate than the low class while participants in the high class terminated the task prematurely at a higher rate. The present study clarifies the nature of response to CO2 challenge. Three distinct response profiles emerged, which clarifies the manifestation of CO2 hypersensitivity in anxiety disorders with strong, though not unique, associations with panic-relevant traits.

AB The body of research investigating the sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) construct continues to accumulate at a rapid pace. This article provides an introduction to the Special Issue on SCT, which includes 10 empirical studies that collectively make a major contribution to the SCT knowledge base. Notably, the studies in this Special Issue include participants spanning in age from 4 to 64 years and from four continents, helping to move the field toward a life span, transcultural understanding of SCT. Together, these studies demonstrate that SCT symptoms can be distinguished from ADHD symptoms as early as preschool and that SCT does not fall under the overarching umbrella of ADHD. These studies also show SCT to be associated with a range of external correlates including internalizing symptoms, learning difficulties, functional impairment, and daily life executive functioning (but not performance-based measures of executive functions). Preliminary findings of SCT in relation to thyroid functioning and tobacco exposure are reported. In addition to providing a summary of the key themes across studies included in the Special Issue, this article highlights key ways in which future research can build from these studies. There is a particular need for research utilizing longitudinal, multi-method, and multi-informant designs that can shed light on the etiologies and developmental psychopathology of SCT across the life span.

AB Objective: We sought to characterize relationships between sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) and both internalizing symptoms and executive functioning in adults with ADHD. Method: A total of 102 adults with ADHD completed clinical interviews and clinical rating scales. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to ascertain the independent predictive power of SCT symptoms for deficits in executive function (EF) after considering severity of ADHD inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and internalizing symptoms. Results: SCT correlated with ADHD inattentive symptoms and dimensional measures of depression and anxiety but not with clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety. SCT predicted EF deficits over and above the effects of internalizing and ADHD symptoms. This relationship between SCT and EF was limited to the subset of participants (n = 48) receiving stimulant treatment. Conclusion: SCT in adults with ADHD is associated with internalizing symptoms, ADHD inattentive symptoms, and, independently, with EF deficits. Further research is needed to ascertain why this relationship occurred primarily in adults concurrently receiving stimulants.

AB Residential mobility is generally viewed as an adverse event for adolescents' development. Less is known about whether moving during adolescence, childhood, or both periods explains this connection and whether the extent of mobility matters. Analytic shortcomings with much of the research call into question extant findings. We examined associations between childhood, adolescent, and child-adolescent mobility and adolescents' achievement (math and reading) and behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing). With a multisite, longitudinal sample (N=1,056), we employed propensity score methods, which mitigate concerns about selection bias on observed variables, to investigate relationships. Results suggest that multiple, child-adolescent movers had more internalizing problems in adolescence than their stable peers, but did not differ on externalizing problems or achievement.

AB Self-esteem, generally regarded as an important indicator of adolescents' mental health, was assessed by a self-report questionnaire in a school sample of 593 subjects who had been assessed at 3 time points over 7 years between 11 and 25 years of age within the Zurich Psychology and Psychopathology Study (ZAPPS). Cross-lagged panel analyses of the longitudinal data from ZAPPS indicated that self-esteem was predictive of internalizing problems and had an impact on internalizing symptoms when the analyses were adjusted for coping behavior, efficiency of social networks, and impact of stressful life events. Self-esteem was also stable (r = .37-.60) within the observed age range, after controlling for prior levels of the predicted variables. The findings support the impact of self-esteem on mental health and indicate the importance of addressing self-esteem in prevention and intervention programs.

AB As a stressful environment in families, mothers' depressive symptoms might increase children's risks of developing behavioral problems by exacerbating genetic influences. Using data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort data of approximately 750 pairs of twins, we examined whether genetic influences on preschoolers' behavioral problems depended upon mothers' depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the genetic etiology for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors varied with maternal depressive symptoms at 9-months child age. Genetic effects on externalizing behaviors increased as mothers' depressive symptoms increased; however, genetics effects on internalizing behaviors increased when depressive symptoms either increased or decreased from the median level. These different patterns of interactive effects suggest potentially different mechanisms for the etiology of children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors.

AB Emetophobia is an under-researched disorder characterized by a specific fear of vomiting. There is a paucity of research on this impairing condition, with extant examinations being largely limited to adult samples and online communities. The present study examined the incidence, phenomenology, and correlates of emetophobia in 305 Salvadorian youths. Caregivers completed a battery of questionnaires regarding the youth's symptoms of emetophobia, internalizing/externalizing symptoms, health anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Approximately 7.5 % of the sample was elevated on emetophobia symptoms, and higher levels of emetophobia symptoms were correlated with higher levels of internalizing, externalizing, health anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and lower levels of adaptive functioning. Youths meeting the cutoff for elevated emetophobia symptoms versus those who did not demonstrated significantly higher levels of externalizing behaviors, as well as general obsessive-compulsive symptoms, especially doubting/checking and neutralizing behaviors. These findings are hoped to help improve the conceptualization and treatment of this poorly understood disorder.

AB Emotional dysregulation was explored as a mediator of the relationship between perceived father rejection and young adult male and female aggression. Among undergraduate college students (N = 534), emotional dysregulation was assessed as a combined construct and then as distinct components. Analyses revealed that impulsivity mediated the relationship between perceived father rejection and aggression for both males and females. Nonacceptance of emotions was partially supported as a mediator of the perceived father rejection-aggression relationship among males, but not females. Results suggest that although father-child relationships may contribute to a variety of emotion regulation difficulties, impulsivity may play an integral role in the development of aggression. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to pay particular attention to the process by which impulsivity may influence aggression for father-rejected sons and daughters, with additional attention to nonacceptance of emotions for sons. Limitations and future research recommendations are discussed.
