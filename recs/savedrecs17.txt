AB This study examined the cultural and developmental significance of maternal and paternal parenting processes (closeness, support, monitoring, communication, conflict, and peer approval) for measures of anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents from Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States (N = 6,935). Across all cultural contexts, measures of maternal and paternal support and conflict were most consistently associated with measures of internalizing behaviors. Few differences were observed in the importance of individual parenting processes for anxiety or depression symptoms across cultures. Additionally, with the exception of maternal conflict for anxiety and depression symptoms and paternal closeness for depression symptoms, none of the parenting process dimensions differed in importance for internalizing behaviors across developmental periods (middle versus late adolescence). The investigation provides evidence of great similarity in developmental processes, both across cultural contexts and developmental periods.

AB The association of pubertal maturation with internalizing and externalizing symptoms was examined with a sample of 867 African-American 10-12-year-old children. Children reported their pubertal development status and timing using a self-report questionnaire, and symptoms were assessed through diagnostic interviews with the children and their primary caregivers. Pubertal status and timing were significantly associated with children's reports of the internalizing symptoms of social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depression and with the externalizing symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit disorder, and conduct disorder. Pubertal development also was associated with caregivers' reports of children's externalizing symptoms. The pubertal transition was associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms in both boys and girls.

AB Relatively few studies have examined psychological maltreatment as a risk factor for adolescent psychopathology. This cross-sectional study evaluated mother-adolescent conflict frequency, maternal support, and avoidant coping as mediators of relations between mother's degrading parenting and adolescent conduct problems and internalizing. Analyses were conducted to determine if relations between model constructs were influenced by reporter, gender, or ethnicity. The sample included 232 adolescents and their mothers. Household interviews were conducted with families who were randomly selected from two urban school districts. The proposed model was estimated using path analysis and generally fit the data well. Results suggested that mothers' degrading parenting was associated with risk for internalizing and conduct problems, regardless of adolescent gender or ethnicity. Mother-adolescent conflict frequency mediated relations between mothers' degrading parenting and adolescent adjustment. Maternal support and avoidant coping mediated relations between degrading parenting and internalizing when adolescent report was used.

AB Sex differences exist in pain and the strategies used to cope with pain. Although it is has been proposed that such differences become apparent around puberty, somewhat surprisingly very little research has specifically investigated sex as a moderator of pain within adolescents. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate sex differences in pain and coping within a group of 46 male and 115 female adolescent chronic pain sufferers. All were aged between 11 and 19 years and had been referred to the Pain Management Unit at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, United Kingdom. Patients completed a battery of measures including pain experiences and a pain coping questionnaire. No sex differences were found in pain chronicity, although males and females did differ in self-reported pain experiences (females reported higher pain). Sex differences were also found in coping behaviours. Females used more social support, positive statements and internalizing/catastrophizing, whereas males reported engaging in more behavioural distraction. Of these strategies internalizing/catastrophizing was found to mediate the relationship between sex and pain. This suggests that not only do sex differences exist in the pain experiences and pain-coping strategies of adolescents with chronic pain, but that internalizing/catastrophizing may be an important mechanism in understanding such differences. More research examining potential sex differences in children and adolescents is recommended. (c) 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE. Our objectives with this study were to describe the prevalence of bullying involvement (ie, bullying and victimization) among children from a multigenerational study and to examine the relationship of these childhood behaviors and exposure to intimate partner violence.
   METHODS. A community-based cohort of 112 children (aged 6 to 13 years) was asked to self-report on physical, verbal, and relational types of bullying and victimization experienced in the past year. Parents reported on their child's externalizing and internalizing behaviors during the previous 6 months using items from Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist. The frequency of parental experiences of intimate partner violence perpetration and victimization at 2 time points during the preceding 5 years was measured using Conflict Tactics Scale items. The association of intimate partner violence and parent-reported child behavioral problems was examined, followed by exposure to intimate partner violence and child-reported bullying or victimization. Parental risk factors (eg, race/ethnicity, education, problem drinking) that predispose to intimate partner violence were controlled for using propensity score statistical modeling.
   RESULTS. Eighty-two (73.2%) children reported being victimized by peers, and 38 (33.9%) children reported bullying behaviors in the past year. More reports came from girls than from boys (55% for victimization and 61% for bullying). Almost all (97%) child bullies were also victims themselves. Intimate partner violence was reported by parent respondents in 53 (50.5%) households at any or both of the 2 time points. Exposure to intimate partner violence was not associated with child-reported relational bullying behaviors or victimization by peers, However, intimate partner violence-exposed children were at increased risk for problematic levels of externalizing behavior/physical aggression and internalizing behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS. In our sample, children who were 6 to 13 years of age reported a substantial amount of bullying and victimization; a large majority were bully-victims and female. Regression analyses did not show that children who were exposed to intimate partner violence were more likely to engage in relational bullying. However, children who are exposed to intimate partner violence have a higher likelihood of internalizing behaviors and physical aggression.

AB BACKGROUND. Very low birth weight survivors are at increased risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems and low social and academic competencies. Information on such problems in very low birth weight adolescents is still sparse.
   OBJECTIVES. Our purpose for this work was to study gender-specific emotional and behavioral problems and social and academic competencies in a cohort of very low birth weight adolescents in north Norway.
   METHODS. Families with very low birth weight adolescents aged 13 to 18 years, born between 1978 and 1989 (n = 162) were addressed by mail and asked to complete the Child Behavior Check List and the Youth Self-Report. Data were compared with 2 normative adolescent populations (Child Behavior Check List, n = 540; Youth Self-Report, n = 2522). Scores given by very low birth weight adolescents and their parents on identical items in Child Behavior Check List and Youth Self-Report (cross-informant syndrome constructs) were compared in pairs. To explore predictive effects, demographic and early medical characteristics were entered into a hierarchical multiple regression analysis.
   RESULTS. There were 156 eligible families, and 99 (63.5%) responded. All completed the Child Behavior Check List, and 82 (52.6%) completed the Youth Self-Report. Very low birth weight boys reported less externalizing and internalizing behaviors and thought and attention problems and higher activity score, whereas very low birth weight girls reported less externalizing behavior and less social, thought, and attention problems and higher activity score compared with normative adolescents. Very low birth weight parents, however, reported more social and attention problems and less social and school competence in boys and more internalizing behavior and social and attention problems and less school competence in girls compared with normative parents. They scored high proportions of both genders within the borderline/clinical range on all of the scales, except for externalizing behavior and social problems in girls. Female very low birth weight adolescents, in contrast to males, reported more problems than parents when compared in pairs, and externalizing problems in particular were not recognized by parents.
   CONCLUSIONS. From parents' point of view, significant proportions of very low birth weight adolescents experience more emotional and behavioral problems and less competence than normative adolescents. In contrast, very low birth weight adolescents state less problems and similar or higher competence than normative adolescents. Very low birth weight adolescent girls report more emotional and behavioral problems compared with their parents than very low birth weight adolescent boys do. Externalizing problems in very low birth weight adolescent girls are often not recognized by parents. To better understand these seemingly paradoxical findings and to develop adequate intervention programs, there is a need for prospective longitudinal studies.

AB Background. This study reports prevalence and comorbidty of five DSM-III-R diagnoses (alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug abuse, major depressive episode, and generalized anxiety disorder) among American Indian and Canadian First Nations parents/caretakers of children aged 10-12 years from the Northern Midwest United States and Canada. Lifetime prevalence rates were compared to adults in the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and Southwest and Northern Plains cultures from the AI-SUPERPFP study. Method. Native interviewers used computer-assisted personal interviews to administer the University of Michigan Composite International Diagnostic Interview (UM-CIDI) to 861 tribally enrolled parents and caretakers (625 females; 236 males) of 741 tribally enrolled children aged 10-12 years. Fathers/male caretakers ranged in age from 21 years to 68 years with an average age of 41 years; mothers/female caretakers ranged in age from 17 years to 77 years with an average of 39 years. Results. About three-fourths (74.6%) of the adults met lifetime criteria for one of the five disorders; approximately one-third (31.6%) met lifetime criteria for two or more of the five disorders. Prevalence of the substance use disorders was higher than those in the general population (NCS); prevalence of internalizing disorders (major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder) was very similar to those in the general population. Prevalence rates for alcohol abuse among the Northern Midwest adults were higher than those reported for Southwest and Northern Plains Tribes, but rates of alcohol dependency were very similar across cultures. Conclusions. The higher prevalence rates for some mental disorders found for the Northern Midwest are discussed in terms of potential method variance. The Northern Midwest results reflect unique patterns of psychiatric disorders in the ubiquity of substance abuse disorders and the co-occurrence of substance abuse disorders with internalizing disorders. Reducing lifetime occurrences of substance abuse disorders would have an enormous positive impact on the mental health of this population.

AB Gender differences for adolescents in residential care were examined for a sample of 2,067 youths in a large residential facility. At admission, female youths were more troubled than male youths, as shown in significantly higher Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) diagnoses and comorbidity rates, higher internalizing and externalizing Child Behavior Checklist scores, and significantly higher Suicide Prevention Scale hopelessness, negative self-evaluation, and suicide ideation scores. Girls had higher rates of depressive and anxiety diagnoses on the DISC at both admission and I year. Both genders demonstrated significant reductions in both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors over the first year in the program. Girls had significantly higher rates of internalizing problem behavior but showed a significantly greater reduction in these behaviors than did boys. At departure, girls were rated as being more successful than boys by clinical staff. Youths did not differ by gender in their behavior on a 6-month follow-up success scale. Implications for prioritizing research addressing the needs of female adolescents in residential care are discussed.

AB Findings yielded a comprehensive portrait of the predictive relations among children's aggressive or withdrawn behaviors, peer rejection, and psychological maladjustment across the 5-12 age period. Examination of peer rejection in different variable contexts and across repeated intervals throughout childhood revealed differences in the timing, strength, and consistency of this risk factor as a distinct (additive) predictor of externalizing versus internalizing problems. In conjunction with aggressive behavior, peer rejection proved to be a stronger additive predictor of externalizing problems during early rather than later childhood. Relative to withdrawn behavior, rejection's efficacy as a distinct predictor of internalizing problems was significant early in childhood and increased progressively thereafter. These additive path models fit the data better than did disorder-driven or transactional models.

AB Objective: To evaluate associations between self-concept and psychosocial adjustment among adolescents with craniofacial anomalies.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: Reconstructive plastic surgery department in urban medical center.
   Participants: Forty-nine adolescents with congenital craniofacial anomalies, aged 14 to 18 years, and their parents.
   Main Outcome Measures: Psychosocial adjustment (internalizing problems and social competence), assessed by self-report and parent-report forms of the Child Behavior Checklist; appearance self-concept and global self-worth, assessed by the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents.
   Results: Both appearance self-concept and global self-worth were associated with psychosocial adjustment; however, global self-worth remained associated with adjustment when the effects of appearance self-concept were controlled, whereas appearance self-concept was no longer associated with adjustment when global self-worth was controlled. Demographic variables (ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and adolescent gender) largely failed to moderate the associations between self-concept and adjustment.
   Conclusions: Adolescent dissatisfaction with appearance is linked to psychosocial adjustment problems only when it is part of a negative overall view of the self.

AB This review examines recent evidence on the comorbidity between literacy problems and psychiatric disorder in childhood and,discusses possible contributory factors.
   Recent studies confirm the substantial overlap of literacy problems with a range of emotional/behavioural difficulties in childhood. Literacy problems and inattention may share genetic influences, contributing to associations with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. To an extent; links with conduct problems may be also mediated by attentional difficulties. In addition, findings suggest bidirectional influences whereby disruptive behaviours impede reading progress and reading failure exacerbates risk for behaviour problems. Associations between literacy problems and anxiety disorders are not entirely mediated by inattentiveness. Rather, comorbid anxiety disorders seem likely to arise from the stressors associated with reading failure. Findings in relation to depression are less consistent, but suggest that poor readers may be vulnerable to low mood. Children with autism seem more likely to face problems in reading comprehension than the decoding difficulties more prominent in other disorders.
   Literacy problems are associated with increased risks of both externalizing and internalizing disorders in childhood, with different mechanisms likely to be implicated in each case. When comorbid problems occur, each is likely to require separate treatment.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate psychosocial, cognitive, and motor functioning in patients clinically suspected of Sotos syndrome and to examine differences between patients with deletions or mutations of the gene encoding nuclear SET domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1; the major cause of the syndrome) and those without such alterations. Twenty-nine participants (21 males, 8 females) clinically suspected of Sotos syndrome (mean age 11y 10mo [SD 10y 11mo], range 1y 10mo-48y 5mo) were divided into an NSD1 mutation group (n=12; 8 males, 4 females) and an NSD1 non-mutation group (n=17; 13 males, 4 females). Intelligence, behaviour problems, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, temperament, adaptive behaviour, and motor functioning were assessed with an extensive test battery. Scores were compared with those of control groups, and scores of the two subgroups were compared with each other. The mean IQ in the 21 individuals tested was 76 (SD 16; range 47-105). High rates of behaviour problems were found and patients lagged 1y 7mo to 2y 7mo behind in aspects of adaptive behaviour. In comparison with a control group of patients with a learning disability*, motor functioning was better. NSD1 mutation compared with NSD1 non-mutation patients showed easier temperament, and fewer NSD1 mutation patients scored in the clinical range for 'total behaviour problems' (3/11 vs 13/17), 'internalizing behaviour' (2/11 vs 11/17), and ADHD (0/9 vs 4/15).

AB The aims of the present study were to investigate the role for problematic children of the child's social competence, teacher relations and behaviour with peers for later problem persistence, school performance and peer acceptance, in terms of moderating (protective and exacerbating) and independent effects. Groups of children with externalizing (n = 26) and internalizing (n = 25) problems and a non-problematic group (n = 44) were followed from grade 1-6. Teachers rated behaviour problems and social competence in the first, third and sixth grades, the teacher-child relationship in third grade, and school achievement in sixth grade. Behaviour with peers was assessed in observations in later elementary school. Peer acceptance was assessed through peer nominations in sixth grade. Both problem groups had lower social competence, school achievement and peer acceptance in sixth grade than the non-problematic group. There were moderating and independent effects of social competence, teacher and peer relations on outcomes, but these applied mainly to children with internalizing problems.

AB In the current study, 466 children completed a peer nomination survey assessing both perceived and sociometric popularity at the end of the 5th grade. Measures of behavior problems were assessed through a composite of peer-, teacher- and self-reports at the end of the 8th grade. Examination of the unique concurrent associations of each popularity type with peer nominated social characteristics in 5th grade demonstrated that sociometric popularity was positively associated with prosocial behavior and inclusive behavior, while perceived popularity was positively associated with overt and relational aggression. In addition to emerging as distinct conceptual constructs, these two dimensions of popularity also demonstrated unique associations with adjustment over time. Sociometric popularity in the 5th grade was associated with lower levels of externalizing behavior problems 3 years later, while perceived popularity was associated with higher levels of these problems over time. Interestingly, high levels of perceived popularity in the 5th grade were associated with less internalizing symptoms over time for boys, while high levels of sociometric popularity were associated with less internalizing. symptoms over time for girls.

AB We investigated the development of ego-control (EC) and ego-resiliency (ER) over a 13-year period in a cohort of Swedish children first assessed at 2 years of age. Children became more ego-controlled over time although individual differences in EC remained stable. Children's levels of resiliency increased from 2 to 3 years of age and then declined when they were 7 and 8 years of age. Boys continued to become less resilient in adolescence whereas girls became more resilient. Individual differences in boys' resiliency levels were more stable over the 13-year span than girls'. The intercorrelations between EC and ER were only significant for boys at 2 and 15 years of age. The external validity of EC and ER was demonstrated by significant associations with ratings of the children's adaptation to school as well as with their measures of their internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.

AB Background: Minorities and indigenous peoples are likely to have poor mental health and physical outcomes. This study examines resiliency indicators in Hawaiian adolescents.
   Aims: Multiple resiliency indicators were examined across different domains including individual, family and community in relation to increased psychological well-being.
   Methods: Existing data from the Native Hawaiian Mental Health Research Development Program (NHMHRDP) were used. These data included information from a community sample of five high schools on three islands from the state of Hawaii. The sample included 1,832 students, where 64% were Native Hawaiian and 36% were non-Hawaiian.
   Results: This study found that Native Hawaiian youth experienced more family adversity compared with non-Hawaiians, but Native Hawaiians were also more likely to have higher levels of family support. For internalizing symptomatology, the most robust resiliency factors were family support and physical fitness/health for Native Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian adolescents. For externalizing symptomatology, achievement and family support were consistently strong resiliency factors. The indicator for physical fitness and health was more influential among Native Hawaiians than non-Hawaiians for externalizing symptoms, while academic achievement was more influential among non-Hawaiians than for Native Hawaiians for the protection against internalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the need for intervention programs designed to promote resilience in adolescents, including highlighting the importance of the family. Further research is needed to design and evaluate programs that promote well-being, enhance resilience and improve mental health in culturally appropriate ways.

AB Purpose: To examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body weight perception (BWP), and indicators of internalizing and externalizing distress and social, attention and thought problems in a large representative sample of Dutch youth.
   Methods: A total of 1826 pupils in the eighth grade of primary education and 5730 students in the first four years of secondary education gave their height and weight to obtain an estimate of their BMI. They reported their evaluation of their body weight and completed Achenbach's Youth Self-Report (YSR) (1991), which assesses eight types of problem behavior. Data were analyzed in a multivariate framework with BMI and BWP as predictors and the YSR scores on different kinds of problem behavior as dependent variables, controlling for background characteristics.
   Results: Both BMI and BWP are associated with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior, and social, attention and thought problems. Multivariate tests show that BWP is more closely linked to problem behavior than BMI. Adolescents who were either underweight or overweight but considered themselves in good shape had no more problems than the group with normal BMI and BWP 'good'. The perception of being 'too thin' and particularly the perception of being 'too heavy' best predict problem behavior in both male and female adolescents. Overweight youngsters with an adequate perception of their weight have less somatic complaints than their normal-weight peers who perceive themselves as too heavy, but they show higher withdrawnness, social problems, and anxiety/depression.
   Conclusions: Adolescent girls are more dissatisfied with their weight than boys; however, the relationship between weight perception and problem behavior is the same for both genders. (c) 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Researchers (e.g., [Gibb, B.E., 2002. Childhood maltreatment and negative coenitive styles. A quantitative and qualitative review. Clinical Psychology Review, 22 (2), 223-246]; [Rose. D.T., Abramson, L.Y., 1992. Developmental predictors of depressive cognitive styles: developmental perspectives on depression. In Cicchetti. D., Toth, S.L. (Eds.), Developmental Perspectives on Depression. Rochester symposium on developmental psychopathology, vol. 4, pp. 323-349]) have proposed that when childhood abuse is verbal (rather than sexual or physical), the child is more likely to develop a negative self-schema because the negative self-cognitions are directly supplied to the child by the abuser (e.g., "you are stupid").
   Methods: In a test of this theory in adult participants, and drawing on the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) (N=5877), we investigate the mediating role of current levels of self-criticism on the relationship between retrospective reports of parental verbal abuse, as well as sexual and physical abuse, and adult internalizing symptoms.
   Results: We found self-criticism, but not dependency traits, to fully mediate the relationship between childhood verbal abuse perpetrated by parents and internalizing (depression, anxiety) symptoms. On the other hand, self-criticism was only a partial mediator of the relationship between the other types of abuse and internalizing symptoms.
   Limitations: The NCS data is cross-sectional, which limits any firm conclusions regarding causality. While these results are suggestive that self-criticism is a mediator of the relationship between abuse and internalizing symptoms, longitudinal data are necessary to help rule out alternative explanations.
   Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that childhood abuse experiences, and in particular verbal abuse, may confer risk for internalizing disorders in part because verbal abuse influences the development of a self-critical style. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: To study predictors at age 3 and at age 12 for ideations and acts of deliberate self-harm at age 15 in a representative birth cohort.
   Method: Information about ideations and acts of deliberate self-harm at age 12 and at age 15 was obtained from parents and children. Information about the child's problems was obtained at age 3 using the Child Behavior Checklist 2/3 (CBCL 2/3), and at age 12 with the CBCL and Youth Self-report (YSR). Furthermore, when the child was 12, mothers and fathers gave information about their own health, well-being and mental distress, and about family functioning measured with the Family Assessment Device (FAD).
   Results: There was a significant increase in self-reported deliberate self-harm (ideations or acts) from age 12 to age 15, especially among girls (from 3% to 13%). Parent-child agreement on acts and ideations of deliberate self-harm was very low at both time-points (proportion of agreement 0.0-0.2). Self-reports of deliberate self-harm at age 12 independently predicted both acts and ideations of deliberate self-harm at age 15. Female gender, self-reports of internalizing problems and somatic complaints, parent reports of child's externalizing problems and aggressivity, mother's reports of her health problems, and living in nonintact family at age 12 independently predicted self-reported acts of deliberate self-harm 3 years later. Parent reports of child's learning difficulties, and self-reports of being bullied independently predicted ideations of deliberate self-harm at age 15. Parent reports of child's psychopathology at age 3 assessed with the CBCL 2/3 had no predictive association with ideation or acts of deliberate self-harm at age 15.
   Conclusions: Acts of deliberate self-harm in mid-adolescence are due to an accumulation of earlier family and parental distress, and child's externalizing and internalizing problems. Information about deliberate self-harm at age 12 is an important warning sign of deliberate self-harm in mid-adolescence. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Contemporaneous and longitudinal associations among marital conflict, parent-child relationship quality, and youth maladjustment were examined using data from the National Survey of Families and Households. Analyses were based on 551 married families with a child age 5 to I I years at Wave 1. The concurrent association between marital conflict and youth externalizing problems at both waves was mediated completely at Wave I and partially at Wave 2 by harsh discipline and parent-youth conflict. The concurrent association between marital conflict and internalizing problems at both waves was mediated partially through parent-youth conflict. Longitudinal mediating effects were detected through stable marital conflict over 5 years and through its connection with parent-youth conflict. Findings delineate areas of specificity and stability in marital conflict processes as children transition from middle childhood through adolescence.

AB The present study attempted to identify individual and contextual factors associated with outcomes in a group of 63 latency-aged children disclosing sexual abuse (SA). Children reporting SA were found to display greater internalizing and externalizing behavioral difficulties as well as more sexualized behaviors relative to same-age non-abused peers. Mothers also reported these children as less socially competent than their peers. Family contextual factors appeared to be associated with behavioral difficulties and made a unique contribution to the prediction of externalizing and sexualized behaviors. Of the personal variables, avoidance coping was found to be linked to poorer outcomes. In examining possible factors linked to'resilient' outcomes in a 6-month time-frame, family conflict and avoidance coping were found to be associated to clinical status in children reporting SA.

AB Objective To test the effects of written emotional disclosure on the health of adolescents with asthma and to examine how language in disclosures predicts outcomes. Methods We randomized 50 adolescents with asthma to write for 3 days at home about stressful events (disclosure) or control topics. At baseline and 2 months after writing, we assessed symptoms, affect, disability, internalizing behavior problems, and lung function; parents independently rated internalizing behavior and disability. Results Compared with control writing, disclosure writing led to improved positive affect and internalizing problems. Disclosure also decreased asthma symptoms and functional disability among adolescents with baseline elevations of these difficulties. Lung function was not changed. Disclosures with more negative emotion, insight, and causal words-and increased causal or insight words over days-predicted improved health. Conclusions Written emotional disclosure improves emotional and behavioral functioning among adolescents with asthma, particularly those whose writings suggest emotional processing and cognitive restructuring.

AB Objective: To test for gene-environment interaction with depressive symptoms and family conflict. Specifically, to first examine whether the influence of family conflict in predicting depressive symptoms is increased in individuals at genetic risk of depression. Second, to test whether the genetic component of variance in depressive symptoms increases as levels of family conflict increase. Method: A longitudinal twin design was used. Children ages 5 to 16 were reassessed approximately 3 years later to test whether the influence of family conflict in predicting depressive symptoms varied according to genetic liability. The conflict subscale of the Family Environment Scale was used to assess family conflict and the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire was used to assess depressive symptoms. The response rate to the questionnaire at time 1 was 73% and 65% at time 2. Controlling for initial symptoms levels (i.e., internalizing at time 1), primary analyses were conducted using ordinary least-squares multiple regression. Structural equation models, using raw score maximum likelihood estimation, were also fit to the data for the purpose of model fit comparison. Results: Results suggested significant gene-environment interaction specifically with depressive symptoms and family conflict. Genetic factors were of greater importance in the etiology of depressive symptoms where levels of family conflict were high. The effects of family conflict on depressive symptoms were greater in children and adolescents at genetic risk of depression. Conclusions: The present results suggest that children with a family history of depression may be at an increased risk of developing depressive symptoms in response to family conflict. Intervention programs that incorporate one or more family systems may be of benefit in alleviating the adverse effect of negative family factors on children.

AB Objective: To examine the persistence of parent-reported social-emotional and behavioral problems in infants and toddlers. Method: The sample comprised 1,082 children ascertained from birth records. Children were 12 to 40 months old in year 1 (1998-1999) and 23 to 48 months old in year 2 (1999-2000). Eighty percent participated in year 1 and 91% were retained in year 2. Social-emotional and behavioral problems were measured by high scores (>= 90th percentile) on the Internalizing, Externalizing, and/or Dysregulation domains of the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA). Parents reported on sociodemographic factors, family life impairment, parenting stress, and family functioning. Results: Among children with any high ITSEA domain score in year 1, 49.9% had persistent psychopathology, as indicated by the continued presence of a high score in year 2. In multivariate analyses, persistence was significantly more likely when parents reported co-occurring problems (i.e., problems in multiple ITSEA domains), high family life disruption, and high parenting distress in year 1. Homotypic persistence rates (i.e., same domain persistence) ranged from 38% to 50%. Only for dysregulation was homotypic persistence greater when co-occurring problems were present than for dysregulation alone. Persistence patterns were similar for boys and girls. Conclusion: Findings indicate that infant-toddler social-emotional/behavioral problems are not transient and highlight the need for early identification, multidomain and family assessment, and effective early intervention.

AB Objectives: 1) To investigate the comorbidity of verbal and nonverbal learning disability subtypes with several domains of behavior problems among 8-year-old children. 2) To determine whether receipt of an early intervention modified the association between childhood behavior problems and learning disabilities (LD). Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP), a randomized clinical trial of an early intervention provided between ages 0 and 3 involving 985 children born low birthweight and premature. The findings are based on a prospective follow-up of these children at 8 years of age. Results: Compared to children without verbal LD (VLD), those with VLD were twice as likely to exhibit clinical levels of total behavior problems and 89% more likely to exhibit externalizing behavior problems. Analysis of specific subscales of behavior revealed significant associations with anxious/depressed and withdrawn behaviors, as well as an increased likelihood of attention problems among children with VLD. No significant association was found between nonverbal LD (NVLD) and any type of behavior problem. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between VLD and the intervention, in which the odds of internalizing behavior problems were greater among children with VLD. No interaction effect of the intervention occurred for any type of behavior problem among children with NVLD. Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that distinct differences exist for different learning disability subtypes with regards to behavioral outcomes and the effects of early intervention services among 8-year-old children.

AB OBJECTIVE. It has been shown that bullying victimization is associated with behavior and school adjustment problems, but it remains unclear whether the experience of bullying uniquely contributes to those problems after taking into account preexisting adjustment problems.
   METHODS. We examined bullying in the Environmental Risk Study, a nationally representative 1994 - 1995 birth cohort of 2232 children. We identified children who experienced bullying between the ages of 5 and 7 years either as pure victims or bully/victims. We collected reports from mothers and teachers about children's behavior problems and school adjustment when they were 5 years old and again when they were age 7.
   RESULTS. Compared with control children, pure victims showed more internalizing problems and unhappiness at school when they were 5 and 7 years. Girls who were pure victims also showed more externalizing problems than controls. Compared with controls and pure victims, bully/victims showed more internalizing problems, more externalizing problems, and fewer prosocial behaviors when they were 5 and 7 years. They also were less happy at school compared with control children at 7 years of age. Pure victims and bully/victims showed more behavior and school adjustment problems at 7 years of age, even after controlling for preexisting adjustment problems at 5 years of age.
   CONCLUSIONS. Being the victim of a bully during the first years of schooling contributes to maladjustment in young children. Prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing mental health problems during childhood should target bullying as an important risk factor.

AB Replication of the core syndrome factor structure of the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA; P.A. McDermott, N.C. Marston, & D.H. Stott, 1993) is reported for a sample of 183 Native American Indian (Ojibwe) children and adolescents from North Central Minnesota. The six ASCA core syndromes produced an identical two-factor solution as the standardization data through principal axis analysis using multiple criteria for the number of factors to extract and retain. Varimax, direct oblimin, and promax rotations produced identical results and nearly identical factor-structure coefficients. Coefficients of congruence resulted in an excellent match to the factorial results of the ASCA standardization sample and a large, independent sample. It was concluded that for these Ojibwe students, the ASCA measures two independent dimensions of psychopathology (i.e., Overactivity and Underactivity) that are similar to the conduct problems/externalizing and withdrawal/internalizing dimensions commonly found in the child psychopathology assessment literature.

AB Authors examined the association between internalizing disorders and asthma attacks at 1-year follow-up among a community sample of 1, 789 children and adolescents ages 5-18 years living on the island of Puerto Rico. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was administered to assess DSM-IV internalizing disorders during the past year Children with a lifetime history of asthma attacks at baseline had greater odds of having an internalizing disorder at 1-year follow-up, independent of socio-demographic measures. However an association was not found between asthma attacks and persistence of internalizing disorders. These findings show that the association between internalizing disorders and asthma attacks was replicated I year later in the same sample.

AB Aim: To study the long-term relationship between symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and the developing self-esteem in a population-based sample of twins. Methods: The cohort is all twin pair families born in Sweden between May 1985 and December 1986 (n = 1.480). Wave 1 took place in 1994 when the twins were 8 years old and wave 2 in 1999 when the children were 13 years old. In wave 1 and 2 the parents completed questionnaires regarding ADHD-symptoms about their children. In wave 2 the twins completed a questionnaire about self-esteem and Youth Self Report (YSR). ADHD-symptoms and self-esteem were analyzed in the total study group. Results: There was a long-term relationship between high scores of parental-reported ADHD-symptoms at 8 and 13 years of age and low scores in measures of self-reported self-esteem at 13 years of age. In the cotwin control method controlling for YSR internalizing problem, paired comparisons within the twin pairs revealed that a high score of ADHD-symptoms at age 8 was related to significantly lower scores at age 13 in the self-esteem.
   Conclusions: The long-term relationships between ADHD-symptoms and a low self-esteem in a population-based sample were confirmed by the co-twin analyses.

AB Aim: To study the association between intrauterine exposure to tobacco smoke and behavioural disorders in preschool children, primarily symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity but also hostile-aggressive and anxious-fearful symptoms. Methods: We conducted a follow-up study in 1355 singletons born to Danish-speaking mothers. Information on smoking habits during pregnancy and other lifestyle factors was obtained from self-administered questionnaires filled in during second and third trimester. Approximately 3.5 years later, the parents provided information on their child's behaviour using the self-administered Preschool Behaviour Questionnaire. The children were categorized into three not mutually exclusive behaviour groups: hyperactive - distractible (13.6%), hostile - aggressive (4.6%), and anxious-fearful (6.4%) children. Results: Compared with children of non-smokers, children born to women who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day had a 60% increased risk of hyperactivity and distractibility perceived by the parents ( OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 - 2.3; P < 0.05). The results were adjusted for maternal lifestyle factors and socioeconomic characteristics. Additional adjustment for perinatal factors and parental psychiatric hospitalization did not change the results substantially (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.6). We found no statistically significant association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and hostile - aggressive and anxious-fearful behaviour in the offspring.
   Conclusion: Exposure to tobacco smoke in utero was associated with hyperactive-distractible behaviour in preschool children.

AB Objective: Internalizing behaviors in children between 4 and 5 years of age who had been prenatally exposed to psychotropic medications were investigated. The authors had previously reported the effects of prenatal medication exposure in this same cohort when they were newborns and infants at 3 and 8 months of age.
   Method: Parental/teacher reports and a clinical measure of mother and child interactions were used to assess levels of internalizing behaviors (e.g., depression, anxiety, withdrawal). Outcomes were compared between children with prenatal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure (N = 22) and nonexposed children of healthy, nondepressed, nonmedicated mothers (N = 14). Measures of maternal mood were obtained. Ordered logistic regressions, independent-sample t tests, and univariate ANOVAs were used to compare outcomes between groups. Pearson correlations were used to determine associations between maternal mood and child behaviors.
   Results: Levels of internalizing behaviors did not differ significantly between children with prenatal psychotropic medication exposure and those not exposed. However, as symptoms of maternal anxiety and depression increased, so did reported internalizing behaviors in their children. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to psychotropic medications was not associated with increased reports of internalizing behaviors at 4 years of age, whereas impaired maternal mood did have an identified impact on child behavior. Further study of complex associations between maternal psychiatric disorders, prenatal SSRI exposure, and childhood internalizing behaviors is required to understand if the child outcome is affected by the illness, medications, or a combination of both.

AB Children with autism not only display social impairments but also significant individual differences in social development. Understanding the source of these differences, as well as the nature of social impairments, is important for improved diagnosis and treatments for these children. Current theory and research suggests that individual differences in response monitoring, a specific function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), may contribute to social-emotional and social-cognitive impairments and individual differences in autism. To examine this hypothesis, we used a modified flanker task to assess an ERP index of response monitoring, the error-related negativity (ERN), in a sample of higher function children with autism (HFA) and an IQ-matched control sample. The results revealed a significant Diagnostic group by Verbal IQ interaction on ERN amplitude indicating that the most verbally capable HFA children displayed significantly larger ERN amplitudes than did the control children. Within the HFA sample, greater ERN amplitude was also related to parent reports of fewer symptoms of social interaction impairments, fewer internalizing problems, but more externalizing problems, although these associations were reduced to nonsignificance when medication status was controlled. The latter results complement previous observations from imaging studies of a significant association between ACC activity and social symptoms and impairments in autism. The implications of these results for future research on brain-behavior relations, as well as treatment related research with children with autism are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective To report on the intelligence scores and the psychiatric pathology of distinct groups of children with metabolic diseases. Methods The study population consists of 53 children between 0 and 18 years of age. Diagnostic assessment included a semi-structured interview, self-report questionnaires and a standard intelligence test. Results In 40% of the children older than 5 years, a child psychiatric diagnosis was made. While CBCL total and internalizing scores did not differ between metabolic disease groups, the CBCL externalizing scores for some groups did. Two fifths of the children showed a below normal intelligence, while a performal-verbal IQ discrepancy was found in half of the children. Of the school aged children almost one third attended a special needs school. Conclusion In spite of the small sample size, the results suggest substantial psychiatric problems in children with a metabolic disease. Further study on larger groups is warranted, which should enable further comparison of patients affected by specific metabolic diseases.

AB In this longitudinal study we investigated relations between parenting and externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour during early adolescence. First, we examined parenting effects on problem behaviour, including child behaviour as a moderator. Second, we examined child behaviour as predictor of parenting, also including moderator effects. A total of 650 13- to 14-year-olds filled out the Youth Self-Report and questionnaires about parenting at two times within a one-year interval. Relations between parenting and problem behaviour appeared to be stronger for externalizing than for internalizing problem behaviour. Both parenting effects and child effects were found. Parenting significantly predicted an increase in externalizing problem behaviour one year later. Adolescent's previous level of problem behaviour predicted changes in parenting (involvement and decisional autonomy granting). In addition, parental and child characteristics interacted in predicting outcome. (c) 2005 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examined for profiles of positive trait affectivity (PA) and negative trait affectivity (NA) associated with adolescent conduct problems. Prior trait affectivity research has been relatively biased toward the assessment of adults and internalizing symptomatology. Consistent with recent developmental modeling of antisocial behavior, this study, proposed that conduct problems are uniquely associated with 2 PA-NA profiles (i.e., high PA-high NA and low PA-low NA). A nonreferred sample of 109 adolescents ages 12 to 19 was recruited to assess the independent relations between rating scale measures of the PA-NA dimensions and conduct problems, controlling for related internalizing (anxiety and depression) and externalizing (hyperactivity-impulsivity) symptomatology. The results generally confirmed the proposed interaction between the PA-NA dimensions in the prediction of adolescent conduct problems.

AB The longitudinal impact of a family-based intervention on grandchildren of parents with HIV (PWH) is evaluated. Because PWH and their daughters demonstrated gains over 6 years when randomized to a coping skills intervention compared with a control condition, the adjustment of the PWH's grandchildren was also compared across conditions. Grandchildren in the intervention condition reported significantly fewer internalizing and externalizing behavioral symptoms compared with grandchildren in the control condition. There is weak evidence that grandchildren in the intervention condition had higher scores on measures of cognitive development and more positive borne environments. These results suggest that there are possibly long-term, intergenerational benefits of an intervention for families coping with HIV.

AB Parenting was examined as a mediator of associations between marital and child adjustment, and parent gender was examined as a moderator of associations among marital, parental, and child functioning in 226 families with a school-age child (146 boys). Parenting fully mediated associations between marital conflict and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Parent gender did not moderate associations when data from the full sample or families with girls only were evaluated. Parent gender did moderate associations when families with boys were evaluated, with the association between marital conflict and parenting stronger for fathers than mothers. A trend suggested fathers' parenting may be more strongly related to internalizing behavior and mothers' parenting may be more strongly related to externalizing behavior in boys.

ID ADJUSTMENT; TRANSITIONS; BEHAVIOR
AB This study examined whether the occurrence and timing of parental separation or divorce was related to trajectories of academic grades and mother- and teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing problems. The authors used hierarchical linear models to estimate trajectories for children who did and did not experience their parents' divorce or separation in kindergarten through 10th grade (N = 194). A novel approach to analyzing the timing of divorce/separation was adopted, and trajectories were estimated from I year prior to the divorce/separation to 3 years after the event. Results suggest that early parental divorce/separation is more negatively related to trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems than is later divorce/separation, whereas later divorce/separation is more negatively related to grades. One implication of these findings is that children may benefit most from interventions focused on preventing internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas adolescents may benefit most from interventions focused on promoting academic achievement.

AB Objectives To describe personality traits, internalizing, and externalizing problems of 6- to 12-year-old children with nocturnal and diurnal enuresis, examining differences from healthy referents, and investigating the association between personality traits and problem behavior. Methods Eighty-five children with combined nocturnal and diurnal enuresis were compared with 56 children with nocturnal enuresis and 155 healthy children on personality characteristics and problem behavior. Results Post hoc analyses of multivariate analyses indicated that parents of children with combined nocturnal and diurnal enuresis reported on average lower conscientiousness and higher neuroticism scores in their children than parents of healthy children, although the magnitude of these differences was moderate. Considerable differences in mean scores were found for the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) total problem scale and moderate differences for internalizing, externalizing, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems in children with nocturnal and diurnal enuresis compared with healthy referents. Regression analyses across enuretic and healthy groups demonstrated that personality trait and problem behavior scales share substantial variance. Conclusion Moderate to substantially higher levels of problem behavior is demonstrated in children with nocturnal and diurnal enuresis, who also display slightly higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness scores.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine if specificity exists between three factors of parenting stress (i.e., parental distress, parent-child (PC) dysfunctional interactions, and difficult child) and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The incremental validity of parenting stress beyond parental psychopathology was also examined. The sample was drawn from families of children aged 5-17 (N = 300), who sought treatment for their child from a community mental health clinic. Results indicated that the PC dysfunctional interactions factor showed specificity to internalizing symptoms when controlling for parental psychopathology. Parental distress did not show specificity or incremental validity and the difficult child factor was associated with both internalizing and externalizing symptoms when controlling for parental psychopathology. The influence of age, gender, and ethnicity on these associations is also presented, and findings are discussed in terms of how the results add to understanding the specific relations between parenting stress and child and adolescent symptoms.

AB Objective: This prospective study characterizes trajectories of symptoms and impairment in pediatric patients with abdominal pain not associated with identifiable organic disease. Method: The Children's Somatization Inventory and the Functional Disability Inventory were administered four times over 5 years to 132 patients (6-18 years old) seen in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Individual trajectories were empirically grouped and correlates of trajectory group membership at baseline were evaluated. Results: A model with three unique trajectories was found to adequately fit both symptom and impairment data. Two trajectories indicated relatively long-term improvement and one indicated continued high levels of symptoms and impairment. At baseline, the long-term risk group did not have the most severe pain but had significantly more anxiety, depression, lower perceived self-worth, and more negative life events. Conclusions: These results indicate that several distinct trajectories of relatively long-term outcomes may exist in children with functional abdominal pain. One trajectory indicated long-term risk for a high level of symptoms and impairment. Psychosocial correlates of long-term risk for physical symptoms and impairment, such as child-reported stress and internalizing symptoms, may be useful for treatment planning.

AB A structural model accounting for child internalizing problems in substance-abusing families was tested. Parents receiving substance abuse treatment (N = 242) completed forms about children between the ages of 6 and 18 who resided in their home. The effects of parent gender, child gender, and child age were controlled. Negative parenting was examined as a mediator between parent internalizing and externalizing problems and child anxiety and affective problems using path analysis. Negative parenting mediated relations only between parent internalizing problems and child affective problems. High-positive involvement moderated relations between parent externalizing problems and child internalizing problems. Relations between parent externalizing problems and child anxiety and affective problems were significant only among families in which high-positive involvement was present.

AB This study was designed to examine the effects of family experiences (family violence, family conflict, parental affection and support) on peer victimization and to explore whether linkages between family variables and peer victimization are mediated by the development of internalizing problems and inappropriate reactions to peer aggression. Self-report data were collected from 446 boys and 287 girls attending the 5(th) to 10(th) grade (mean age = 13.3 years). Results show that non-victimized aggressors, aggressive and non-aggressive victims report more negative family experiences and more internalizing problem behavior than matched controls. Results of structural equation modeling show that the effects of the family variables differ from each other and only family violence seems to increase the probability of being victimized by peers.

ID INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; ADOLESCENTS
AB Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic condition due to germline Mutations in HRAS proto-oncogene and characterized by increased birth weight, postnatal growth retardation, distinctive facial appearance, typical medical problems (including feeding problems in the neonatal period), Cutaneous anomalies, and developmental delay. Outgoing personality has often been noted in case reports, but few Studies have focused specifically on the behavioral aspects of CS. A preliminary survey described irritability in younger-patients with improvement between age 2 and 4, but a standardized psychometric tool was not used. A second study using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) showed relatively high (albeit subclinical) levels of internalizing problems. These descriptive investigations lacked a control group. We describe a comparative survey to evaluate the behavioral and temperamental features of children with CS. We conducted a cross-sectional assessment Using the CBCL and the Emotionality, Activity, Shyness, Sociability (EAS) temperament questionnaire to evaluate behavior and temperament in 11 CS children (2 years 5 months to 9 years) comparing them to 33 gender- and age-matched children without disability. The results Suggest that the high levels of internalizing problems found before age 4 in CS patients might decrease,with age. They also point to possible "hyperemotionality." Further Studies using a larger sample size bind IQ-matched control groups are needed to more accurately characterize individuals with this rare syndrome. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The objective of the present study was to examine gender differences in the influence of paternal alcoholism on children's social-emotional development and to determine whether paternal alcoholism is associated with a greater number of externalizing symptoms in the male offspring. From the Mannheim Study of Risk Children, an ongoing longitudinal study of a high-risk population, the developmental data of 219 children [193 (95 boys and 98 girls) of non-alcoholic fathers, non-COAs, and 26 (14 boys, 12 girls) of alcoholic fathers, COAs] were analyzed from birth to the age of I I years. Paternal alcoholism was defined according to the ICD-10 categories of alcohol dependence and harmful use. Socio-demographic data, cognitive development, number and severity of behavior problems, and gender-related differences in the rates of externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed using standardized instruments (IQ tests, Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire and diagnostic interviews). The general linear model analysis revealed a significant overall effect of paternal alcoholism on the number of child psychiatric problems (F = 21.872, d.f. = 1.217, P < 0.001). Beginning at age 2, significantly higher numbers of externalizing symptoms were observed among COAs. In female COAs, a pattern similar to that of the male COAs emerged, with the predominance of delinquent and aggressive behavior. Unlike male COAs, females showed an increase of internalizing symptoms up to age 11 years. Of these, somatic complaints revealed the strongest discriminating effect in 11-year-old females. Children of alcoholic fathers are at high risk for psychopathology. Gender-related differences seem to exist and may contribute to different phenotypes during development from early childhood to adolescence.

AB Since cognitive and behavioural characteristics of paediatric migraineurs have yet to be adequately defined, in this study we assessed the effect of migraine on the interictal functioning of children and adolescents by comparing the performance of two patient groups, 17 migraineurs with aura (MA) and 31 without aura (MoA) and by correlating the duration of the disorder, the frequency of attacks and interictal period with neuropsychological and behavioural findings. Both patient groups had cognitive performance within normal range except for a significant delay in the reaction time (RT) task. Both MA and MoA revealed a behavioural phenotype characterized by internalizing problems on Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) scales. Slower RT to simple visual stimuli may be an early sign of a subclinical neuropsychological dysfunction, significantly correlated with the frequency of headache attacks and interictal period. The lack of a control group and other methodological limitations, such as patient selection bias and unadjusted P-value for multiple testing, make it difficult to give this finding a clearcut meaning. Further studies are needed on larger samples compared with a control group.

AB This study used latent growth modeling to investigate longitudinal relationships between self-system processes and depressive symptoms among maltreated (n=142) and nonmaltreated children (n=109) aged 6-11 years. On average, self-esteem and self-agency increased and depressive symptoms decreased over time. Multivariate growth modeling indicated that, regardless of gender, physical abuse was negatively related to initial levels of self-esteem, and physical abuse and physical neglect were positively associated with initial levels of depressive symptoms. Emotional maltreatment was predictive of changes in self-esteem and changes in depressive symptoms. Initial levels of self-esteem were negatively associated with initial levels of depressive symptoms. The findings contribute to enhancing our understanding of the developmental processes whereby early maltreatment experiences are linked to later maladjustment.

AB This study examined a model wherein children's attributional style mediates the relationship between parental physical child-abuse risk and children's internalizing problems. Using structural equation modeling, three indices of abuse risk, were selected (child abuse potential, physical discipline use, and dysfunctional parenting style) and two indices of children's internalizing problems (depression and anxiety). The sample included 75 parent-child dyads, in which parents reported on their abuse risk and children independently completed measures of depressive and anxious symptomatology and a measure on their attributional style. Findings supported, the model that childrens attributional style for positive events (but not negative events) partially mediated the relationship between abuse risk and internalizing symptoms, with significant direct and indirect effects of abuse risk on internalizing symptomatology. Future directions to continue evaluating additional mediators and other possible contextual variables are discussed.

AB One thousand and ten Non-Hispanic White, African American, Hispanic, and Asian Pacific Islander youth who were high risk and receiving public sector services were interviewed regarding history of child emotional and physical abuse and current internalizing symptoms. The study examined whether race moderated the association between adolescents' reports of specific parent behaviors and their self-labeling as victims of abuse. The study also examined whether reports of parental behaviors or self-labeled abuse better predicted internalizing symptoms, and whether these associations differed 1 1 race. Mien reporting punitive parent behavior, Non Hispanic While youth were more likely to describe themselves as abused compared to Asian Pacific Islanders. Reported punitive parental behaviors accounted for more variance in internalizing symptoms than did self-labeled abuse. Reports of parent behaviors were more strongly related to concurrent internalizing symptoms among ethnic minority youth than among Non-Hispanic While youth. Results are discussed in the context Of cultural competence in identfication of child abuse.

AB The present study was conducted to investigate the specificity of the association between parental and offspring psychiatric disorders using epidemiological data from a series of parent and offspring interviews. A community-based sample of 593 mothers and their offspring from upstate New York were interviewed during the adolescence and early adulthood of the offspring. The children of parents with generalized anxiety disorder were at specifically elevated risk for anxiety disorders when co-occurring psychiatric disorders were controlled. The associations between parental and offspring antisocial, conduct, depressive, and Substance use disorders were characterized by modest specificity. Children of parents with externalizing disorders were nearly as likely to develop internalizing disorders as they were to develop externalizing disorders. Children of parents with internalizing disorders were somewhat, but not significantly, more likely to develop internalizing disorders. These findings Support the inference that children of parents with generalized anxiety disorder may be more likely to develop anxiety disorders than they are to develop other psychiatric disorders. However, when co-occurring psychiatric disorders are accounted for. the children of parents with depressive, disruptive, and substance use disorders may be as likely to develop other disorders as they are to develop the same type of disorder that their parents have had.

AB Somatic complaints in children have been associated with internalizing disorders, especially anxiety disorders. However, few studies have examined specific somatic complaints across specific anxiety disorders. This quasi-experimental study examines the type and frequency of somatic complaints in children (n = 178; ages 7-14 years) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), and no anxiety disorder. Children and their parents who sought treatment completed a structured diagnostic interview and youth completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) (March, Parker, Sullivan, Stallings, and Conners). Children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder reported more frequent somatic complaints compared to children without an anxiety disorder, but somatic complaints did not differ across the principal anxiety disorder groups. Children with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders reported somatic complaints more frequently than children without comorbid disorders. Results are discussed in terms of somatic complaints as a) criteria within the diagnostic system, and b) as part of the process of avoidance.

AB Individuals with early-emerging conduct problems are likely to become parents who expose their children to considerable adversity. The current study tested the specificity of and alternative explanations for this trajectory. The sample included 246 members of a prospective, 30-year cohort study and their 3-year-old children. Parents who had a history of conduct disorder were specifically at elevated risk for socioeconomic disadvantage and relationship violence, but suboptimal parenting and offspring temperament problems were common to parents with any history of disorder. Recurrent disorder, comorbidity, and adversity in the family of origin did not fully account for these findings. The cumulative consequences of early-onset conduct disorder and assortative mating for antisocial behavior may explain the long-term effects of conduct disorder on young adult functioning.

The sample consisted of 189 low-income. European American and Mexican American children and their mothers. Tire data analyses partially supported our hypotheses that mothers perceptions of neighborhoods mediated the relation of neighborhood disadvantage to family processes, which in turn were associated with child internalizing problems. The value of contextual factors and social disorganization theory in studying the development of child adjustment problems was supported by the current study. Research issues and practical implications were discussed.

AB Maternal stress was assessed in mothers of children ages 8 to 11 years with learning disorders (LD). Age-, gender-, and IQ-matched children with reading disorders (RD; n = 31), children with nonverbal learning disorders (NVLD; n = 21), and typically developing control participants (n = 23) participated. Mothers of children with LD reported higher levels of stress, although the specific nature of the stress appeared to vary by disorder subtype: Mothers of children with RD reported higher levels of general distress, whereas mothers of children with NVLD reported higher levels of dysfunctional interactions with their child. The severity of the LD was strongly associated with maternal stress in the sample of children with NVLD but not in the sample of children with RD. In the sample of children with NVLD, the best predictors of maternal stress were 2 variables associated with the child: The lower the child's Performance IQ, the higher the level of maternal stress. Furthermore, the level of the child's internalizing symptoms was also a strong predictor of maternal stress in the sample of children with NVLD. In our sample of children with RD, the 3 best predictors were all variables associated with the mother, including her age, her level of reported psychiatric symptoms, and her overall level of social support.

AB This study tested the association between mother's early age at first birth and various life outcomes for her children in later adolescence and early adulthood. Data were analyzed from the Rochester Youth Development Study, an ongoing panel study of adolescents enrolled in seventh or eighth grade in Rochester Public Schools in 1988 (N =729). Boys born to mothers who began childbearing before age 19 had elevated risks of drug use, gang membership, unemployment, and early parenthood. Girls born to young mothers only had elevated risks of early parenthood. Of the mediators tested, low maternal education had the largest mediating effects. The findings suggest that the risks associated with being born to a young mother are substantial but perhaps disproportionately so for boys.

AB Objective To examine the psychometric properties and utility of a Child Behavior Checklist-Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CBCL-PTSD) Scale to screen for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in traumatized preschool children. Method Data for this study were drawn from a study of young child trauma and consisted of 62 traumatized children, 23 months through 6 years of age. The children's mothers were interviewed about PTSD symptoms and then completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results The modified CBCL-PTSD correlated highly with the number of PTSD symptoms from the interview (r = 0.66). The CBCL-PTSD scale predicted PTSD symptoms above and beyond the internalizing and externalizing scales of the CBCL. A cutoff score of nine on this scale possessed the best sensitivity and specificity in classifying those traumatized children who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Conclusion The modified CBCL-PTSD scale could be a useful cost-effective tool to screen for PTSD in traumatized, preschool-age children.

AB Objective: To investigate the association between mesial temporal lobe morphology, ratios of prefrontal cortex to amygdala and hippocampus volumes, and psychiatric symptomatology in children and adolescents with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). Method: Scores on behavioral rating scales and volumetric measures of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging were compared among 47 children with VCFS, 15 of their siblings, and 18 community controls. Results: After covarying for whole brain volume, children with VCFS exhibited 11% greater volume of the left amygdala (p = .002) and 8% greater volume of the right amygdala (p = .01). Children with VCFS exhibited smaller volumes of the hippocampus, but not disproportionately to reductions in whole brain volume. Children with VCFS exhibited smaller volumetric ratios of prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex to amygdala, but not prefrontal cortex to hippocampus. For children with VCFS, but not for the comparison sample, larger volumes of the amygdala and smaller ratios of prefrontal cortex to amygdala were associated with higher scores on the Internalizing, Externalizing, Anxiety, and Aggression scales of the Child Behavior Checklist and on the parent version of the Young Mania Rating Scale. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit that underlies emotional processing is disrupted in children with VCFS and may be an important neurobiological substrate of psychiatric disorder in these children.

AB The objective of this study was to quantify behavioral and attention capacity changes in children aged 4-11 y before and 3 mo after adenotonsillectomy (A/T). Overnight cardiorespiratory recordings were performed in 61 "behaviorally normal" children 1 wk before A/T. Tests of sustained attention using visual and auditory continuous performance tests (CPT) were completed by children I wk before and 3 mo after A/T. Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) and a sleep questionnaire were completed by the parent/s at these same times. Results from overnight cardiorespiratory recordings showed that the children had mild sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) preoperatively with a mean apnea/hypopnea index of 3.0/h and a movement awakening index of 2.5/h. The majority had parent-perceived sleep and breathing difficulties that significantly improved post-A/T. BASC T scores for externalizing and internalizing behaviors improved post-A/T, e.g., behavioral symptom index mean pre-A/T was 56.2 (95% confidence interval, 52.8-59.6) compared with 50.9 (48.5-53.5) post-A/T. Some measures indicative of impulsivity and attentiveness obtained from the visual CPT before Surgery, improved post-A/T, but no change was observed in any auditory CPT measures. Our data confirm improvements in Subjective measures of sleep problems in children treated for SRBD and strengthen the notion of treating the disorder, not only related to the obvious clinical condition but also to the underlying sleep problems and adverse effects on daytime behavior and attention.

AB Strong and consistent gender differences exist in mental health problems and crime. Females suffer more from internalizing problems, including depression and anxiety, while males predominate in externalizing problems, which include delinquency, aggression, and substance abuse. These gender differences vary by race, however. Although gender differences in externalizing problems remain considerable across race, gender differences in internalizing problems are far greater for whites than African Americans. In explaining these patterns, our perspective differs from prior theories in both mental health and criminology by focusing on the intersection of gender and race in relation to both internalizing and externalizing problems. We propose that gender and race affect internalizing and externalizing problems through their impact on schemas about self-salience, which refer to beliefs about the importance of the self versus the collective in social relations. In testing this perspective, we examine a sample of white and African American males and females in adolescence, the point at which these patterns arise. We find that gender and race interact to shape schemas about self-salience. Further, these differences in self-salience help to explain the disparities by gender and race in internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Background Evaluation of symptom presentation and antipsychotic response based on ethnicity in children and adolescents with schizophrenia is limited. The purpose of this naturalistic, retrospective database study was to compare symptom presentation of children and adolescents of different ethnicities with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and response to risperidone.
   Method African-American (n = 38), Caucasian (n = 30), or Hispanic (n = 37) youths started on risperidone were eligible. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) total, internalizing, and externalizing scores were evaluated at baseline, 90 days, 1 year, and 2 year intervals.
   Results At baseline, Hispanic patients had lower CBCL externalizing scores than African-Americans or Caucasians. African-Americans showed significant differences in CBCL total, internalizing, and externalizing scores at 90 days compared to baseline. Hispanics showed improvement in CBCL internalizing scores over the 2 year period. No significant improvements were observed in Caucasians. African-American patients had significantly lower CBCL total at 90 days compared to Hispanic patients. No significant difference existed in 2 year hospitalization rates between groups.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that ethnicity may play a role in symptom presentation and treatment response to risperidone for children and adolescents with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Future studies in children and adolescents are necessary to examine ethnospecific differences in antipsychotic use and treatment response.

AB Objective To study the prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems and the scope of symptoms in preschool children. The results serve as baseline in a 4-year follow-up study.
   Method The sample consisted of 1887 preschool children who started primary level education within 6 months upon data collection. The sample represented the complete 1-year intake of all first year primary school children in a northern German town of 254,000 residents. The data were collected with standardized parent questionnaires.
   Results The 6-month prevalence of behavioural and emotional symptoms was 12.4%. The overall score for internalizing symptoms (INT) was significantly higher than the score for externalizing symptoms (EXT). The disturbed children had the highest mean scores on the syndrome scale "Anxious or Depressed".
   Conclusions The level of psychopathology in preschool children was already as high as levels seen elsewhere in school children. The predominant role of INT was unexpected, particularly for boys. The attention of child mental health services need to focus on preschool children as on school children and on INT as much as on EXT, especially in boys.

AB The behaviors and medical problems in 27 persons with CHARGE syndrome were studied, because it was hypothesized that their behavior might be partly dependent on the heterogeneous medical status. With the exception of more tics, cardiac surgery was associated with positive behaviors: less withdrawn behavior, better mood, and a more easy temperament. Tube feeding was also related to positive behavior, since participants with a history Of tube Feeding showed less intense behavior. Cerebral deficits were associated with three problem behaviors: more intense and withdrawn behavior and a worse mood. Deafblindness was associated with developmental delays in expressive and overall communication level, and recurrent middle ear infections correlated with delays in written language. Of all medical conditions, only the presence or absence of heart defects and cardiac surgery could differentiate between the participants with regard to the number of behavioral problems. participants with heart surgery especially, had less behavior problems. The number of operations and hospitalizations,vas not associated with behavior, but the total length of the hospitalizations was. Long hospital stays were associated with less problem behavior, especially internalizing behaviors. Cerebral and heart problems did not result in longer hospital stays, whereas esophageal reflux did. Age effects were reflected in older participants, who showed more internalizing problems. Heart surgery and hospitalization may be protective factors, but the protection might not be the actual surgery or hospital stay, as there may be other variables that are the actual cause, such as reduced vitality or altered parent child interactions after heart surgery. The study could not confirm a significant association between medical conditions and autism found in previous studies. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This study used a feminist developmental framework to test the hypothesis that internalizing conventional ideas about femininity in two domains-inauthenticity in relationships and body objectification-is associated with diminished sexual health among adolescent girls. In this study, sexual health was conceptualized as feelings of sexual self-efficacy (i.e., a girl's conviction that she can act upon her own sexual needs in a relationship) and protection behavior (i.e., from both STIs and unwanted pregnancy). A total of 116 girls (aged 16-19) completed measures of femininity ideology, sexual self-efficacy, sexual experiences, and protection behavior. Results revealed that inauthenticity in relationships and body objectification were associated with poorer sexual self-efficacy and sexual self-efficacy, in turn, predicted less sexual experience and less use of protection. Further, the two components of femininity ideology were associated with different forms of protection. The importance of a feminist developmental framework for identifying and understanding salient dimensions of sexual health for female adolescents is discussed.

AB The association between attachment and self-reported externalizing and internalizing behavior problems was examined for a diverse SES French-Canadian sample of 108 children. Attachment classifications were assigned on the basis of reunion behavior with mother when the children were approximately 6 years old. Child problem behavior was assessed two and a half years later using the Dominic test. Results indicated that boys with disorganized attachment and children with ambivalent attachment reported a higher level of externalizing problems then did secure children. Moreover, disorganized children also reported a higher level of internalizing problems than secure children. Child assessments using the Dominic in conjunction with a measure of separation-reunion behavior at age 5 to 7 can play an important role in the identification of school-aged children at risk for aggressive or anxious-depressive adaptive problems.

AB Infants who survive open-heart surgery are at risk for developmental disability, which may impact on the well-being not only of the child, but also the family. The objective of our prospective study, therefore, was to determine the long-term health-related quality of life of children with congenital cardiac malformations following open-heart surgery, and to describe the persisting level of stress in their families. To this end, 49 parents completed the Child Health Questionnaire, the Parenting Stress Index, and the Child Behaviour Checklist as part of a developmental follow-up protocol when their child was 5 years of age. Mean scores on the Child Health Questionnaire were in the normal range, with physical well-being equal to 53.5, psychosocial wellbeing 50.9, with only 6.4 percent and 8.5 percent of subjects, respectively, falling within the suboptimal range of less than 40. The distribution of scores on the Parenting Stress Index, however, were more variable, with over one-quarter of parents indicating a high level of stress, with almost one-fifth having low levels of stress, and just over half scoring in the normal range, with the group mean being 52.6 plus or minus 32.3. An abnormal neurologic examination before surgery was associated with lower physical health (beta equal to -5.5, p equal to 0.02, r(2) equal to 0.18), whereas lower arterial saturations of oxygen, less than 85 percent preoperatively, was associated with lower psychosocial health (beta equal to -6.6, p equal to 0.01, and r(2) equal to 0.14). The internalizing and externalizing beliaviours of the child were significantly correlated with psychosocial well being, with r ranging from -0.32 to -0.52, and p less than 0.05. Parental stress also correlated with psychosocial health (r equal to -0.48 and p equal to 0.0009). Overall, the perception by the parents of the health-related quality of life of their child is favourable 5 years following open-heart surgery during infancy. Many parents, nonetheless, continue to feel either stressed or defensive about their child, particularly if their child exhibits behavioural difficulties. Our findings suggest that strategies need to be considered to enhance family wellbeing in the planning and delivery of health services to this population at high risk.

AB During the past three decades, considerable progress has been made in the development, implementation, and evaluation of psychosocial treatments focused on alleviation of risk factors of delinquency, reduction of juvenile crime, and prevention of recidivism. This article reviews selected youth-, family-, and community-based psychosocial treatments for delinquent behavior that are likely to be used in the juvenile justice system and evidence-based psychosocial treatments for internalizing disorders that have a potential for being successfully implemented in the juvenile justice system. The authors discuss the practical issues in dissemination and implementation of evidence-based psychosocial treatments in the juvenile justice system.

AB The relationship between adolescent personality and problem behaviour has been well established. However relatively little attention has been given to the role of the social environment in the association between adolescent personality and problem behaviour We tested the mediating and moderating role of the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship in the associations between adolescents' personality traits and problem behaviour The sample consisted of 140 adolescents (11 to 18 years of age) and both their parents. Results supported a mediating role of the father/mother-adolescent relationship in the associations between Agreeableness, Emotional Stability, and Conscientiousness and externalizing problem behaviour The father/mother-adolescent relationships did not mediate the associations between personality traits and internalizing problem behaviour We also found support for a moderating role of the father/mother-adolescent relationships in the association between Emotional Stability and both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviours. Other moderated effects were specific for parent, personality trait and type of problem behaviour Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The study reported here considered the nature of associations among children's behavior problems, parenting stress, and mothers' feelings of competence. Seventy-two adoptive mothers reported on their adopted children's behavior problems, their own parenting stress, and feelings of competence. Parenting stress was found to mediate the association between children's attention problems and mothers' feelings of competence. When children exhibited higher levels of attention problems, their mothers felt more stress. In turn, when mothers experienced more parenting stress, they felt less competent as parents. Parenting stress moderated the association between children's internalizing behavior and mothers' feelings of competence. A negative relationship between children's internalizing behavior and mothers' feelings of competence was stronger when mothers reported more parenting stress than when they reported less parenting stress.

AB Although great strides have recently been made in our understanding of relational aggression and its consequences, one significant limitation has been the lack of prospective studies. The present research addressed this issue by identifying and assessing groups of relationally aggressive, physically aggressive, relationally plus physically aggressive (co-morbid), and nonaggressive children during their third grade year in elementary school and then reassessing them a year later, during fourth-grade (N = 224, 113 girls). Two aspects of social-psychological adjustment were assessed during both assessment periods including internalizing difficulties (i.e., withdrawal, depression/anxiety, and somatic complaints) and externalizing problems (i.e., aggressive behavior, delinquency). It was revealed that the strongest predictor of future social-psychological adjustment problems and increases in these problems from third to fourth was the combination of relational and physical aggression. Relational aggression also contributed unique information, relative to physical aggression, in the prediction of future maladjustment. Implications of these findings for future research and prevention efforts, particularly for aggressive girls, are discussed.

AB Investigated whether three self-system beliefs, fear of abandonment, coping efficacy, and self-esteem, mediated the relations of stressors and caregiver-child relationship quality with concurrent and prospective internalizing and externalizing problems in a sample of children who had experienced parental death in the previous 2.5 years. The cross-sectional sample consisted of 340 children ages 7-16 and their surviving parent/current caregiver; the longitudinal analyses employed a subset of this sample that consisted of 100 children and their parents/caregivers who were assessed at three time points. A multirater, multimethod measure of caregiver-child relationship quality and a multirater measure of children's mental health problems were used. The cross-sectional model supported a mediational relation for fear of abandonment, coping efficacy, and self-esteem. The three-wave longitudinal model showed that fear of abandonment at Time 2 mediated the relation between stressors at Time 1 and internalizing and externalizing problems at Time 3. Implications of these findings for understanding the development of mental health problems in parentally bereaved children and designing interventions for this at-risk group are discussed.

AB The role of parenting in the relationship between maternal chronic pain and negative child outcomes, including internalizing, externalizing, and social and health problems, was investigated. Parenting strategies used by mothers with chronic pain were compared to parenting strategies used by a control group of mothers without pain. Thirty-nine mothers experiencing chronic pain, their 55 children, 35 pain-free mothers, and their 48 children participated in the study. The results showed that for mothers with chronic pain, dysfunctional parenting strategies and the quality of the mother-child relationship were related to negative child outcomes. Mothers with chronic pain were more likely to engage in lax parenting and report reduced relationship quality with children than were control mothers. For the chronic pain group, over-reactive parenting was found to mediate the relationship between maternal physical functioning and child adjustment. Dysfunctional parenting strategies may constitute part of the risk that maternal chronic pain poses for children. The similarities between the impact of maternal chronic pain on child adjustment and that of other maternal stressors, such as depression, are discussed.
   Perspective: In mothers with chronic pain, poor maternal physical functioning was associated with increased maternal over-reactive behavior that was in turn related to poor child adjustment. Maternal over-reactive behavior did not, however, differ in chronic pain and control mothers. (C) 2006 by the American Pain Society.

AB Psychosocial factors related to disability in adults with chronic back pain have been well studied, but little is known about factors associated with functional impairment in pediatric patients with chronic back pain. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 2 potential risk factors-use of catastrophizing as a coping technique and presence of a familial pain history-were associated with disability in pediatric back pain patients. Participants were 65 patients (ages 8-18) with chronic back pain seen at a multidisciplinary pain clinic. Patients completed measures of pain (visual analog scales), disability (Functional Disability Inventory), and catastrophizing (Internalizing/Catastrophizing subscale of the Pain Coping Questionnaire). Parents provided demographic information and familial pain history. Patients reported that chronic back pain caused disruptions in their daily functioning and they missed, on average, 2.5 days of school every month. Catastrophizing and familial chronic pain history both were significantly associated with greater disability, with use of catastrophizing being the stronger predictor of disability. This study presents important findings on potential psychosocial risk factors of functional disability in children and adolescents with chronic back pain. Future research might clarify mechanisms by which such coping styles are developed and explore how familial communication about pain might influence a child's coping ability.
   Perspective: Pediatric patients seeking treatment for chronic back pain often present with substantial functional impairment that is not well explained by disease variables or pain intensity. Two important psychosocial variables (catastrophizing and familial pain history) may provide a context for a better understanding of pain-related disability in children.

AB Objective The purpose of the current study was to examine prevalence of and relations between a commonly used measure of nighttime breathing problems, the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), and a range of problem behaviors in community children. Methods Participants were 403 unreferred children aged 6-12 years. Recruitment was completed through public elementary schools. Overnight unattended in-home polysomnography was used to assess sleep and breathing. The RDI was used as the indicator of respiratory events during sleep. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners' Parent Rating Scales-Revised were used to assess behavior. Results Prevalence rates for Attention, Cognitive Problems, Aggression, Oppositional behavior, and Social Problems were greatest for subjects with high RDIs. Prevalence for Internalizing behaviors was not greater for those subjects with high RDIs. Hyperactivity was not strongly related to higher RDIs. Conclusions Behavioral problems may exist in the presence of nocturnal breathing events in unreferred children. Specific patterns of behavioral morbidity have still not been established. Some behaviors, such as hyperactivity, may show differing sensitivity and specificity in relation to the RDI.

AB OBJECTIVE. To determine whether the processes through which parenting practices, maternal depression, neighborhood, and chronic poverty affect child behavioral problems are similar or different in minority and nonminority children in the United States.
   METHODS. Data from 884 white, 538 black, and 404 Latino families with children who were 6 to 9 years of age in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were analyzed. The outcome, child behavioral problems, was measured using the Behavior Problems Index externalizing and internalizing subscales. The effects of chronic poverty, neighborhood, maternal depression, and parenting on the outcome were analyzed using multigroup structural equation modeling.
   RESULTS. Chronic poverty affected child behavioral problems indirectly through the other variables, and parenting practices had direct effects in each racial/ethnic group. The effects of maternal depression were partially mediated through parenting in the white and Latino samples but were direct and unmediated through parenting practices in the black sample. Neighborhood effects were present in the white and black samples but were not significant for the Latino sample.
   CONCLUSIONS. Chronic poverty, neighborhood, maternal depression, and parenting practices have effects on child behavioral problems in white, black, and Latino children, but the processes and mechanisms through which they exert their effects differ among the groups. The differences may be related to social stratification mechanisms as well as sociocultural differences in family and childrearing practices.

AB The present article provides an overview of the best-developed interventions for child and adolescent internalizing disorders characterized by anxiety and depression. The review emphasizes interventions that fall into established efficacy categories, but also addresses briefly several other promising treatment procedures. Research on the treatment of child and adolescent depression has not yielded interventions with clearly established efficacy, although there are a number of treatment approaches that may be characterized as possibly efficacious. The treatment of child and adolescent anxiety disorders, on the other hand, includes a number of interventions with good empirical support. While the field is clearly advancing, there remain important deficits and limitations with regard to the evidence base for interventions addressing child internalizing disorders.

AB The relationship among three personal fables (omnipotence, invulnerability, personal uniqueness), narcissism, and mental health variables was assessed in a large, cross-sectional sample of adolescents drawn from Grades 6 (n = 94), 8 (n = 223), 10 (n = 142), and 12 (n = 102). Participants responded to the New Personal Fable Scale, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, the Children's Depression Inventory, three indices of suicidal ideation, an inventory of delinquent risk behaviors, the Global Self-Worth scales from the Self-Perception Profiles for Children and for Adolescents, and two subscales from the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adolescents. The results showed that omnipotence and narcissism strongly counterindicated internalizing symptomatology, and were robust predictors of positive mental health and adjustment. Invulnerability was strongly associated with risk behaviors. Personal uniqueness was strongly associated with depression and suicidal ideation, a relationship that increased with age. Hence, personal fable ideation is a multidimensional construct with differential implications for adolescent mental health. Adolescent fables of invulnerability and personal uniqueness are risk factors for externalizing and internalizing symptoms, respectively, while "narcissistic omnipotence" is associated with competence. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Aims: To study the associations between drunkenness frequency and adaptive functioning, psychopathology and service use among 18-year-old Finnish boys in a nation-wide population-based study. Methods: Information about drunkenness frequency within the previous six months was collected from the Finnish boys born in 1981 (n = 2306) at the boys' obligatory military call-up in 1999. Self-report questionnaires were used to study demographic factors, adaptive functioning, risk behaviour, life events, and mental health service use. Psychopathology and adaptive functioning was assessed with the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR) questionnaire. Results: Of the boys, 85% reported drunkenness within the previous 6 months. Most of the subjects were occasionally drunk: 39% reported drunkenness less than a month, and 35% less than once a week, while 10% reported being frequently drunk once a week or more often. Occasional drunkenness was associated with better adaptive functioning and psychosocial well-being in general. Refraining from drunkenness was associated with suicidal ideation and internalizing problems in the YASR scale. Frequent drunkenness associated with daily smoking, illicit drug use, and externalizing problems in the YASR scale, especially delinquent behaviour. In the multivariate analysis, number of friends, having a regular relationship and cigarette smoking had a linear association with frequency of drunkenness, while drunkenness-related alcohol use was less common among those with poor friendship quality. Among the participants, entering substance use treatment was rare (0.2%). Frequent drunkenness was found to be common among mental health service users. Conclusions: Among late- adolescent boys, occasional drunkenness is a normative alcohol use pattern and associates with social competence and good psychosocial functioning. Late-adolescent boys refraining from drunkenness in addition to those with frequent drunkenness may be in a need of mental health assessment. As entering substance use treatment is infrequent, establishing integrated services with multi-professional co-operation for late-adolescent males with frequent drunkenness is emphasized.

AB Psychophysiological responses during affect regulation were examined in 57 children ages 3-9 years, 41 of whom had a parent history of childhood-onset depression (COD). During a structured laboratory task, children were given first a disappointing toy and then a desired toy. Frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart period, and heart period variability were measured during resting and task conditions. Affective and self-regulatory behaviors were coded from videotape. In 3-5-year olds, greater relative right frontal activity was associated with withdrawal behavior. High heart period was associated with approach behavior. Compared with children of psychiatrically healthy parents, children of parents with COD exhibited poor heart period recovery after disappointment. For children of parents with COD, greater relative left frontal activity was related to concurrent internalizing and externalizing problems, and low resting RSA was related to internalizing problems. Physiological responses associated with affect regulation may help identify children at risk for depression. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The psychosocial development of children with burns is at risk. Children with health care issues tend to develop internalizing problems. Several areas of protective or risk factors were composed into a conceptual model on how internalizing problems might develop or might be prevented after getting burned. The purpose of this study was to explore the relation between post burn internalizing problems on the one hand and child characteristics, burn characteristics and the family environment on the other hand. Data have been collected from 28 mothers and 27 fathers of children with burns (N = 29) in six burn centers in the Netherlands and Belgium. The age of the participating children ranged from 2 to 14, TBSA ranged from 1 to 42%. Parents reported problem behavior on the child behavior checklist (CBCL). Three scales of the family environment scale (FES) have been used to explore family conflict, family cohesion and family control. Relations between a clinical level of internalizing problems, reported in 25% of the sample and the family environment were found. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To examine the effects of different forms of family violence at two developmental stages by assessing a sample of 110 Israeli children, drawn from the case files of Israeli family service agencies, studied longitudinally in both middle childhood and adolescence.
   Methods: Information about the children's adjustment was obtained from parents, teachers, and the children themselves when the children averaged 10.6 and 15.9 years of age using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form (TRF), Youth Self-Report (YSR), and Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Information about the history of family violence was obtained from the mothers, fathers, children, and social workers.
   Results: The results paint a mixed picture of the effects of family violence on children and adolescents. The relationship between concurrent behavior problems and abuse group varied by informant and study phase, although they were strongest when children were the informants. Predictions regarding the relationship between early abuse and later adjustment were only partially confirmed. Different informants did not agree about which groups of children were most adversely affected, there was little stability over time in the pattern of reported effects, and children were more likely than other informants to report levels of maladjustment that varied depending on recent or concurrent exposure to family violence. Many families changed their abuse status over time, and children who were new victims at follow-up had the most internalizing problems. Girls were found to be at more risk for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than boys.
   Conclusions: Multiple informants are necessary to evaluate and assess the effects of family violence on children's behavior. Younger children may be more susceptible to the effects of family violence than older children, but problems manifest by some children may not carry over to adolescence. Changes in family and parenting practices, as well as in children's capacity to appraise and cope with family violence may help mitigate the adverse effects of family violence. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Using survey data from former Head Start children in the third grade from 15 sites across the nation (n = 576), this study examines the relationship between maternal subjective neighborhood attributions and their children's behavioral problems. Maternal perceptions of neighborhood characteristics were measured across five domains, including collective efficacy, barriers to services, negative neighbor affects, probability of child status attainment success, and overall neighborhood rating. Children's problem behaviors, measured with the Social Skills Rating System, includes externalizing and internalizing outcomes. Our results suggest that the worse the maternal assessments on each neighborhood construct, the greater the extent of children's problem behavior, holding constant child demographic factors and parental socioeconomic status. In addition, we find that family income effects on children's problem behavior are partially mediated by these perceived neighborhood domains. Taken together, these results suggest that neighborhood deprivation is related to problematic behavioral outcomes in children.

AB This study investigated the characteristics of 106 children primarily referred for externalizing behavior problems and their families, and assessed the prediction of treatment outcome following a standardized short-term, cognitive behavioral group program. Exploring Together comprised a children's group (anger management, problem-solving and social skills training), a parents' group (parenting skills training, dealing with parents' personal, relationship and family-of-origin issues), and a combined children's and parents' group (to target parent-cbild interactions). The main predictors of reductions in externalizing and internalizing behaviors at home following treatment were children's pre-existing levels of these behavioral and emotional problems (children with higher levels improved most), and positive parent-child interaction. Higher pre-existing levels of behavioral and emotional problems and low levels of attention problems predicted greater improvement in post-treatment school behaviors. Implications of the findings for improving interventions for childhood behavioral and emotional problems are discussed.

AB Findings about the influence of coping on psychological adjustment in children with different medical conditions are inconsistent and often based on cross-sectional data. This prospective study evaluated the effect of various coping strategies on children's post-traumatic stress symptoms and behavioral problems 1 month and 1 year after an accidental injury or the diagnosis of a chronic disease in 161 pediatric patients 6-15years of age. Only minor positive effects of coping on psychosocial adjustment were found: Religious coping reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms. Active coping strategies had negative effects on internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. Support seeking strategies, distraction, and avoidance had no impact on long-term psychosocial adjustment.

AB This study examined the relationship between paternal alcoholism and toddler behavior problems from 18 to 36 months of age, as well as the potential moderating effects of 12-month infant-mother attachment security on this relationship. Children with alcoholic fathers had higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior than children of nonalcoholic fathers. Simple effects testing of an interaction effect of child age, group, and attachment security with mothers on externalizing behavior suggested that at 24 and 36 months of age mother-infant attachment security moderated the relationship between alcohol group status and externalizing behavior. Namely, within the alcohol group, those children with secure relationships with their mothers had significantly lower externalizing than insecure children of alcoholics. A similar pattern was noted for internalizing behavior at 36 months of age. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB The predictive relation between attachment and mother, teacher, and self-reported psychopathology was examined for a diverse socioeconomic status French Canadian sample of 96 children. Attachment classifications were assigned on the basis of reunion behavior with mother when the children were approximately 6 years old, and child problem behavior was assessed 2 years later using the Child Behavior Checklist (mother report), the Social Behavior Questionaire (teacher report), and the Dominic Questionnaire (child self-report). Results indicated that both insecure/ambivalent and insecure/controlling children children were rated higher than secure children on a composite measure of externalizing problems. Concerning internalizing problems, only the controlling group was significantly higher on both a composite adult (teacher and mother) and self-report measure of internalizing problems. Analyses of clinical cutoff scores showed that only the controlling group had a significantly greater likelihood of overall problem behavior than other children.

AB The relations of children's coping strategies and coping efficacy to parent socialization and child adjustment were examined in a sample of school-age children that included families in which some of the grandparents and/or parents had an alcoholism diagnosis. Parents and older children reported Oil the children's coping strategies; parents reported on their parenting behavior; and teachers reported on children's externalizing and internalizing problems. Measures of parent socialization were associated with parents' and children's reports of active coping strategies and parents' reports of both support-seeking coping and coping efficacy. Some of these relations were moderated by familial alcohol status. Children higher in parent-reported active/support-seeking coping and coping efficacy were rated lower in teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing adjustment problems. The findings were consistent with the view that active/support-seeking coping and coping efficacy mediated the association of parent socialization to children's psychological adjustment and that this relation was sometimes moderated by parental alcohol status.

AB This study examined the etiology and course of anxiety symptoms from infancy through adolescence in a longitudinal high-risk community sample. One hundred fifty-five subjects were assessed using a variety of observational, projective, and objective measures. Results of path analyses revealed the following: (a) anxiety symptoms showed moderate stability during childhood and adolescence: (b) heightened neonatal biobehavioral reactivity and poor regulation predicted emotion regulation difficulties in preschool, which predicted anxiety symptoms in childhood: (c) developmental incompetence in childhood predicted anxiety symptoms in preadolescence, and anxiety symptoms in preadolescence predicted incompetence in adolescence; (d) insecure attachment relationships in infancy predicted negative peer relationship representations in preadolescence, and these representations predicted anxiety symptoms in adolescence; (e) compared to males, females showed similar rates of anxiety symptoms in childhood but greater and more stable rates in adolescence; however, males and females showed similar patterns of association between risk factors and anxiety symptoms across childhood and adolescence: and (f) the model tested was specific in predicting anxiety symptoms and not psychopathology in general. The results support a developmental model of the etiology and maintenance of anxiety symptoms in childhood and highlight factors to consider in efforts to prevent and treat childhood anxiety.

AB This longitudinal study examined antecedents of substance use behavior among 176 (53% male) adolescents. Adolescents were classified as (a) abstainers (n = 19), (b) experimenters (n = 65), (c) at-risk youth (n = 63), and (d) abusers (n = 29) based on their reported substance use behavior at age 17.5. Parental behavior, peer competence, and problem behavior, measured from early childhood through age 16, were examined as predictors of substance use patterns. Multinomial logistic regression models revealed that early maternal hostility, externalizing behavior problems in first grade and at age 16, internalizing behavior in first grade and at age 16, and parental monitoring at age 16 significantly differentiated substance use groups. The study provides evidence that experiences occurring early in development, in addition to those that occur later in development, can play a pivotal role in setting the stage for late adolescent substance use behavior.

AB The primary goal of this study was to assess the ability of maltreated school-age children and adolescents to understand the thoughts, feelings, and points of view of others. Level of egocentrism and social perspective-taking coordination were assessed in a group of 49 maltreated and 49 demographically matched nonmaltreated children. Twenty-six elementary and 23 high school students in each group were individually interviewed and their responses to hypothetical interpersonal situations coded for egocentricity and level of perspective-taking ability. The findings revealed that maltreated children and adolescents were more egocentric and delayed in their social perspective-taking development than their nonmaltreated peers and that they reported lower levels of global self-worth. However, differences within the group of maltreated children and adolescents emerged with regard to negotiating novel relationships, as those with fewer internalizing or externalizing symptoms exhibited better skills in this area than their peers who displayed more symptoms.

AB Within-child associations between family income and child externalizing and internalizing problems were examined using longitudinal data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (2004a, 2004b; N = 1, 132). Variations in income effects were estimated as a function of whether families were poor, whether mothers were partnered, and the number of hours mothers and their partners were employed. On average, children had fewer externalizing problems during times when their families' incomes were relatively high than during times when their families' incomes were relatively low; the estimated benefits of increased income were greatest for children who were chronically poor. For both externalizing and internalizing problems, income was most strongly associated with problems when chronically poor children's mothers were partnered and employed.

AB A mega-analytic study was designed to exploit the power of a large data set combining raw data from multiple studies (n = 1870) to examine the effects of type of family violence, age, and gender on children's behavior problems assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Our findings confirmed that children who experienced multiple forms of family violence were at greater risk than children who experienced only one form of abuse, and witnesses of inter-parental violence were at similar risk as victims of violence. Age moderated the effects of family violence on externalizing behavior problems, but not on internalizing behavior problems. No main or interaction effects involving children's gender were evident. These results underscore the need to take children's age, type of violence, and type of outcome into account when examining the effects of family violence on children's behavior problems.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in externalizing and internalizing problem behaviours in 6-year-olds with a focus on sex differences. Teachers rated problem behaviours at the beginning and at the end of the school year, 8 months apart, in 370 children (197 boys and 173 girls) attending 22 school preparatory classrooms. Although the majority of the children were quite stable, considerable negative and positive changes for both boys and girls in problem behaviours were found. The results showed that girls were more likely to change their externalizing behaviours in a positive direction than boys, whereas a tendency to the opposite pattern was found for internalizing behaviours. Boys were also found to be more prone to a negative change in problem behaviours of both types than girls were. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB One hundred eight preschool children and their teachers participated in a cross-sectional study of the socio-emotional correlates of mathematics skills. Children's strengths and difficulties were considered as possible correlates of skills. Initiative, self-control, and attachment were all related to better math skills. Overall behavior problems, internalizing symptoms, withdrawal, social problems, and attention problems were related to poorer skills. There were no sex differences in these relationships. Participation in an early math intervention was associated with fewer behavior problems, compared to children who did not receive the intervention. Additionally, participation in the intervention moderated the relationships between socio-emotional strengths and math skills, such that initiative, self-control, and attachment were less strongly correlated with math skills in children who received the intervention.

AB Internalizing disorders are a public health issue affecting up to 20% of school-age children,yet few receive assistance. Internalizing difficulties can emerge in the preschool years, with stability from this time onward. To inform prevention programs, knowledge is needed about early internalizing indicators in community samples. This study describes initial development of the Children's Moods, Fears, and Worries Questionnaire,a parent report measure for toddler and preschool internalizing difficulties. Potential internalizing indicators were identified via literature review and pilot testing. These indicators were empirically examined with 112 parents of 2-year-old children drawn from the community and followed longitudinally to age 4. Parents rated their child on symptoms of anxiety, depression, inhibition, peer withdrawal, and separation insecurity. The new questionnaire included items that grouped statistically at 2 and 4 years. It demonstrated internal consistency, test-retest stability, and initial construct validity. While further research is needed to assess predictive validity and to establish clinical cut-points and community norms, the questionnaire appears to be a useful instrument for assessment of young children's internalizing difficulties.

AB Although associations between marital conflict and children's adjustment problems are established, less is known about child individual differences that can have an impact on these relations. The authors examined longitudinal relations between marital conflict and children's adjustment using a community sample of elementary school-age children and young adolescents and assessed the role of children's vagal regulation in moderating the conflict-child problems link. Elevated marital conflict was predictive of negative child outcomes, and greater vagal suppression to a simulated argument was protective against internalizing problems associated with marital conflict. Findings are supportive of the value of a biopsychosocial perspective and illustrate that child vagal regulation can contribute to the aggregation or amelioration of risk for maladjustment in the context of exposure to marital conflict.

AB The present study investigated 2 questions pertinent to understanding developmental aspects of children's conflict appraisals: (a) Do 7- to 9-year-old children make reliable distinctions between their perceptions of conflict and their appraisals of threat and self-blame? (b) Do threat and blame appraisals mediate the association between exposure to interparental conflict and adjustment problems in this age group? Factor analysis of a new version of the Children's Perception of Interparental Conflict Scale (CPIC-Y) designed for younger children showed that 179 7- to 9-year-old children distinguished properties of conflict from their appraisals of it. Moreover, as predicted by the cognitive-contextual framework, threat and self-blame appraisals mediated the link between conflict and internalizing problems but not externalizing problems. This study provides compelling evidence that appraisals of interparental conflict can be reliably measured at relatively young ages and suggests that perceptions of threat and self-blame function similarly in 7- to 9-year-olds as they do in older children.

AB This study evaluated the long-term effects of Project SUPPORT, an intervention designed to reduce conduct problems among children in domestically violent families. Participating mothers had sought shelter because of domestic violence and had at least one child (4-9 years old) exhibiting clinical levels of conduct problems. Results indicated that at 2 years post-treatment, 15% of children in families in the Project SUPPORT condition exhibited clinical levels of conduct problems compared with 53% of those in the existing services condition. In addition, mothers of children in the Project SUPPORT condition reported their children to be happier, to have better social relationships, and to have lower levels of internalizing problems, relative to children in the comparison condition. Mothers in the Project SUPPORT condition were less likely to use aggressive child management strategies and were less likely to have returned to their partners during the follow-up period.

AB The authors examined the relation between dimensions of attachment and internalizing and externalizing problems in 15- to 16-year-old adolescents (n = 62) who completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ; J. Feeney, P. Noller, & M. Hanrahan, 1994) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR; T. M. Achenbach, 1991). In total, the ASQ dimensions accounted for 48% of the variance in scores on the broad YSR internalizing problem scale. Three ASQ dimensions (confidence, discomfort with closeness, preoccupation with relationships) accounted for unique variance. Girls exhibited higher problem scores than did boys even when the authors considered ASQ scores. The authors observed comparable results for the anxious/depressed subscales. The confidence, discomfort, and preoccupation dimensions predicted scores on the withdrawn subscale. The authors observed weak relations or no relations between results on the ASQ and the externalizing problems scale. In conclusion, dimensions of attachment are powerful predictors of internalizing problems in adolescents. The authors discussed the potential cause and effect relationship between attachment variables and self-reported problems.

AB Objectives: To compare the general psychopathology in an eating disorders (ED) and a child mental health Outpatient sample and investigate the implications of comorbidity on psychological and physical measures of ED severity. Methods: One hundred thirty-six children and adolescents with a DSM-IV ED diagnosis were compared with age- and gender-matched controls. Measures included the Eating Disorders Examination and the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: The ED group had lower general and externalizing psychopathology scores and no difference in internalizing (anxiety-depression) symptoms. Of the anorexia nervosa group, 49% experienced comorbid psychopathology. This group had significantly higher ED psychopathology, longer duration of illness, and more gastrointestinal symptoms, but no difference in malnutrition status. Eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNos) group measures were less influenced by comorbidity status. Conclusions: Anxiety-depressive symptoms are very common in children and adolescents with EDs. Comorbidity status influences illness severity, especially in the anorexia nervosa group. The management implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The development of alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) reflects a complex relationship between genetic influences and environmental/cultural forces. Some genes operate through intermediate phenotypes, including a low level of response (LR) to alcohol, externalizing symptoms (EXT), and internalizing characteristics such as depressive syndromes (DEP). This article evaluates the impact of these three intermediate phenotypes and additional domains in a structural equation model (SEM). Method: Data were available from baseline at approximately age 20 for LR, as well as from additional domains at the 10- and 15-year follow-up periods for 393 men from the San Diego Prospective Study. Correlational analyses and an AMOS-based SEM were used to evaluate the development of alcohol problems, including AUDs, with the hypothetical model based on results from prior studies evaluating each key intermediate phenotype separately. Results: The SEM explained 51% of the variance of the 15-year outcome, and had good fit characteristics. The family history of AUDs (FHalc) was linked, directly or indirectly, to all three key domains. The combination of LR and EXT mediated the relationship between FHalc and 15-year alcohol outcomes, with a trend (p = .07) for LR to mediate between FHalc and the 10-year outcome. DEP by itself, did not mediate FHalc to alcoholism. The LR predicted the 15-year outcome both through alcohol problems at 10 years and via drinking to cope (COPE), with each of these domains functioning as mediators. The relationship of EXT to outcome was mediated by alcohol expectations (EXPECT) and by COPE. DEP added to the model in the context of an FH of independent depressions, stress, and lower social supports, subsequently affecting COPE. Conclusions: The results indicate that the development of AUDs reflects several genetically influenced endophenotypes in the context of mutiple additional domains. Both EXPECT and COPE represented important pathways through which the phenotypes influenced the AUD risk.

AB With regard to internalizing disorders we wanted to describe: 1) a possible change in diagnoses over time; 2) a possible corresponding change in causes for referral; 3) correspondence of hospital diagnosis with causes for referral. For 70 randomly selected records/ year (n = 560),referral papers were examined and compared with register-data on all 8-13-year-old children examined in the study period (1995-2002). The hospital-based frequency increased for depressive disorders and obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD) and decreased for anxiety disorders. A corresponding increase occurred for depressive and OCD symptoms as cause for referral. Agreement between referral causes and subsequent clinical diagnoses was modest. In most cases (68%) referred for internalizing symptoms, a clinical diagnosis within the internalizing spectrum was given. The increase in the diagnoses of depressive disorder and OCD seems partly due to an increase in patients referred for these disorders. Referrers identify internalizing disorders reliably but child psychiatric examination leads to more precise diagnoses.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the psychosocial needs confronting African American youth assaulted in their community.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 36 African American youth (mean age, 14.8 years; range, 10-18 years) who presented to a pediatric emergency department with violent interpersonal injuries was interviewed to identify the psychosocial issues they were facing. Participants also completed self-report measures of violence exposure and trauma symptoms, and their parents completed a screening measure of the youths' emotional and behavioral functioning.
   Results: During the interview, the youth reported 178 different concerns that were content-analyzed and placed into 10 thematic categories labeled anger/aggressive behavior (78% of respondents), general internalizing symptoms (61%), peer difficulties (53%), parent/family conflict (50%), posttraumatic stress symptoms (47%), academic concerns (42%), physical health concerns (39%), safety concerns (39%), and public service concerns (17%). Elevated rates of historical violence exposure and trauma symptoms were observed on the self-report measures, and one third of the youths' parents reported levels of emotional and behavioral problems that would warrant further clinical attention.
   Conclusions: African American assault victims are experiencing a broad range of psychosocial needs. To bolster youth recovery and reduce the risk of future injury, researchers and practitioners need to identify effective methods of assessing these needs in the emergency department so that youth victims of interpersonal violence can be referred for appropriate follow-up services.

AB Several uncertainties regarding psychological problems in children who underwent liver transplantation and the need to differentiate these disturbances from those related to the underlying previous chronic liver disease itself exist. This background triggered the present pilot study to investigate, using quantitative assessment methods, the incidence and the type of emotional and behavioral disturbances after liver transplantation. Sixteen liver transplant recipients (aged 5.7-14.4 yr) and 12 age-matched controls with stable chronic liver disease were assessed through the parent report form of Child Behavior Checklist/ 4-18. The mean time elapsed since transplantation was 8.1 yr. No patient or family had received psychological support during chronic liver disease or at any phase of the transplantation process. Transplanted children scored within borderline range for Internalizing and Total Behavioral Problems and within pathological range for Competences, except for the Activity Scale. Transplanted children showed more Total Behavioral (p = 0.005) and Externalizing Problems (p = 0.0005) than controls. Both groups scored within the pathological range for Total Competences with no significant differences between the two groups. Our findings suggest that in the absence of support programs a psychological risk does exist for a long period of time, after transplantation. Regarding Total Behavioral Problems and Externalizing Problems, this risk is higher than in children with chronic liver disease.

AB Neuropsychology is one field that holds promise in the construction of comprehensive, developmental models for the promotion of social competence and prevention of problem behavior. Neuropsychological models of behavior suggest that children's neurological functioning affects the regulation of strong emotions, as well as performance in social, cognitive, and behavioral spheres. The current study examines the underlying neurocognitive conceptual theory of action of one social-emotional development program. Hypothesized was that inhibitory control and verbal fluency would mediate the relationship between program condition and teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Participants were 318 regular education students enrolled in the second or third grade. A series of regression analyses provided empirical support for ( a) the effectiveness of the PATHS Curriculum in promoting inhibitory control and verbal fluency and (b) a partial mediating role for inhibitory control in the relation between prevention condition and behavioral outcomes. Implications are that programs designed to promote social and emotional development should consider comprehensive models that attend to neurocognitive functioning and development. Lack of consideration of neurocognitive pathways to the promotion of social competence may ignore important mechanisms through which prevention affects youth outcomes. Furthermore, the findings suggest that developers of social-emotional preventions should design curricula to explicitly promote the developmental integration of executive functioning, verbal processing, and emotional awareness. Doing so may enhance prevention outcomes particularly if those preventions are implemented during a time of peak neurocognitive development.

AB This study used a feminist psychodynamic developmental framework to test the hypothesis that internalizing conventional femininity ideologies in two domains-inauthenticity in relationships and body objectification-is associated with early adolescent girls' mental health. One hundred forty-eight eighth-grade girls completed measures of femininity ideolopy, self-esteem, depression, and demographic characteristics. In the first part of this study, we refined the Adolescent Femininity Ideology Scale originally developed by Tolman and Porche (2000). In the second part, we used structural equation modeling to test models linking femininity ideology to mental health. Results revealed that body objectification, and to a lesser extent, inauthenticity in relationships, accounted for half of the variance in depression and over two-thirds of the variance in self-esteem in a critical period of development for adolescent girls. The importance of a feminist psychodynamic developmental framework for identifying and understanding salient dimensions of female adolescence is discussed.

AB In this paper we describe the process used to develop treatment manuals for internalizing and externalizing disorders in children and adolescents. These manuals were developed to offer health care providers and others working in child mental health a flexible intervention that could be adapted to different countries and localities based on: 1) the amount of health care and school resources that are available; 2) the nature and severity of the types of problems children have; and 3) the preferences and cultural factors that are important within these communities. We also discuss the experiences and cultural issues faced by sites in Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, and Brazil who volunteered to implement the manualized treatment programs. The feedback received from these sites indicates that the manuals can be implemented to help children with internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Aims To study predictors at age 3 and at age 12 for parent and self-reported perceived global psychological difficulties at age 15. Method A representative birth cohort was prospectively followed from early childhood to age 15. Ratings of children's behavioral and emotional problems were collected at age 3 (Child Behavior Check List 2/3) and at age 12 (Child Behavior Check List 4-16, Youth Self Report). Mothers and fathers separately completed a questionnaire on their own well-being, health and mental distress when the child was 12. At the same time-point, family functioning was measured with the Family Assessment device. Outcome variables included both parent and self-reports of children's perceived psychological difficulties at age 15. Results At age 15, of the 707 children with both parent and self-reports on perceived difficulties available, 10% had more perceived difficulties than peers of the same age in parent or self-reports. There was a significant increase in perceived difficulties from age 12 to age 15 in self-reports but not in parent reports. The parent-child agreement on difficulties at both time-points was very low (proportion of agreement 0.12-0.17). At age 3, externalizing problems, especially aggressiviness, predicted parent reports of child's difficulties at 15 years of age in univariate analysis. At age 12, parent-reported child's externalizing symptoms and perceived difficulties, poor social competence in self-reports, and mothers' reports of her own poor well-being, independently predicted parents' reporting of their child's perceived difficulties at age 15. Self-reports of internalizing problems and mother's own reports of her depressiviness when the child was 12 independently predicted the 15-year old's self-reported difficulties. Furthermore, in univariate analysis, poor family functioning at age 12 predicted perceived difficulties in parent and self-reports. Conclusions Both parent and self-reports of a child's difficulties are the outcome of an accumulation of the child's psychopathology, parental distress, and family dysfunction. The results emphasize the importance of early detection of children at risk of negative developmental pathways. In clinical practice and in prevention interventions, it is important to take into account the child's individual psychopathology, parental distress, and family dysfunction.

AB This study investigated both the quality of sibling relationships and the psychological adjustment siblings experienced across two groups: siblings of children who are deaf or hard of hearing compared to siblings of children with no disability. Twenty-four siblings of children with hearing loss and 24 siblings of children without a disability participated in the study and were evaluated based on behavioral problems and social competence. We used standardized written questionnaires to measure the psychological adjustment of the siblings. The results showed no significant differences in the quality of the sibling relationship. Parents of children who are deaf or hard of hearing reported fewer internalizing behavior problems (e.g., feelings of anxiety/depression or withdrawn behavior) in the siblings in comparison to parents whose children did not have a disability. There were no significant differences between both groups regarding their social competence. In both groups, positive sibling relationships were related to fewer emotional and behavioral problems and increased social competence, whereas negative sibling relationships had a negative influence on the development of behavioral problems and social competence. Finally, in accordance with the siblings of children without hearing loss, the perception of the siblings' social competence of parents of children who are deaf or hard of hearing broadly matched the perception siblings had of themselves. Overall, siblings of children who are deaf or hard of hearing are not more susceptible to adaptation problems than siblings of children without a disability. Implications for practice and further research are discussed.

AB We examine the association of family cohesion and conflict with childhood behavior problems. A stratified random sample of 823 children was evaluated at ages 6 and 11 years. Mothers rated the family environment at age 6 using the Family Environment Scale. Mothers and teachers rated children's behavior problems at ages 6 and 11, using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Teacher Report Form, respectively. Multiple regression analysis, applying generalized estimating equations, was used. Although results varied between mothers' and teachers' data, they converged in identifying family cohesion as a factor in children's mental health. Family cohesion, as rated by mothers, had a beneficial effect on children's internalizing and attention problems, as rated by both mothers and teachers, that was stable over time. The study highlights an important relationship between family cohesion and children's internalizing and attention problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To examine indices of behavioural and emotional problems and temperamental traits in clinically referred children and adolescents suffering from tension headache or migraine. Headache in childhood and adolescence (< 18 years) has been associated with the presence of behavioural and emotional difficulties, but limited data are available on the relationship between these problems and different types of headache. Clinically referred children and adolescents (N = 114), 6-16 years of age, suffering from primary headache according to the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society, 47 with tension-type headache (TH) and 67 with migraine (M), and 36 normal controls without headache (NC) were assessed using the Parent Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), Conner's Parent Rating Scale (CPRS), and Emotionality-Activity-Sociability-Shyness Scale (EAS). Psychological and personality self-rating assessments were obtained also on the children's parents and siblings. Although most headache patients had scores within the normative non-pathological range, both TH and M patients had higher CBCL total, internalizing, and externalizing scores than NC (P < 0.001), and TH patients had higher scores than M patients. TH and M had higher CDI and MASC scores than NC (P < 0.05), with no difference between the headache groups. TH patients had higher Emotionality and Shyness scores, and lower Sociability scores than M patients. Clinically referred children and adolescents with TH and M had higher scores of behavioural and emotional symptoms, both of internalizing and externalizing type, than normal peers. The TH group had greater psychological and temperamental difficulties than the M group.

AB Numerous studies indicate that child maltreatment increases the risk for the development of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Great variations in outcome, however, have been noted among victims of maltreatment. From an ecological perspective, this review examines how the effects of maltreatment may be influenced by the contexts in which children develop, including their families, peer groups, schools, and communities. The literature reviewed suggests that contextual factors not only influence the incidence of maltreatment but also may moderate its developmental effects, thereby accounting for some of the heterogeneity in the outcomes associated with abuse and neglect. Closer examination of the influence contextual factors exert on the psychosocial sequelae of maltreatment will better inform the interventions, treatments, and public policies directed toward the maltreated population. Methodological considerations for conducting research in this area are also discussed.

AB Two measures of psychopathic features in youths, the self-report version of the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD) and the Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory (YPI) were administered to 165 youths in a juvenile diversion program. For both measures, internal consistency was poor for the scales that assess the affective domain of psychopathic features; otherwise, internal consistency was excellent for the YPI and generally superior to that of the APSD. However, the published three-factor models for both measures did not replicate when examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Both measures obtained the expected correlations with measures of a variety of criminal justice (e.g., age of delinquency onset, past year delinquent behavior) and psychological constructs (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behavior), providing evidence of construct validity for both measures. The YPI appears to be the better measure for exploring the construct of psychopathy in adolescents. Recommendations are made concerning revisions to the APSD.

AB This study examines the relation between family instability and child maladjustment over a 6-year period in 369 children from four communities. Measures were collected annually from kindergarten through fifth grade. In associative growth curve models, family instability trajectories predicted children's externalizing and internalizing behavior trajectories during this time period. High levels of family instability also incrementally predicted the likelihood of meeting criteria for a DSM IV diagnosis during elementary school, above and beyond prediction from earlier measures of maladjustment. However, the timing of family instability had a different effect on externalizing versus internalizing disorders. In general, stronger relations were found between family instability and externalizing behaviors relative to internalizing behaviors, although children with comorbid disorders experienced the highest levels of family instability.

AB Children in the United States are exposed to considerable community violence that has been linked to child functioning. However, not all those exposed, experience negative outcomes. Recent research has focused on factors that "buffer" or protect children from negative consequences of violence exposure. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the potential buffering or moderating role of maternal acceptance in the relationship between community violence exposure and internalizing and externalizing problems. Subjects were 268 urban African American first graders. Community violence exposure was significantly related to symptoms of post-traumatic stress, but did not correlate with either internalizing or externalizing problems for all children, after control for demographics, maternal mental health, and general life stress. However, children's perceptions of maternal acceptance moderated the relationship between violence exposure and internalizing and externalizing problems which included being withdrawn, anxious-depressed, and demonstrating delinquent behavior. Children with the lowest levels of self-reported maternal acceptance were most impacted by community violence. In this sample of urban first graders, low levels of maternal acceptance placed children at greater risk for adverse outcomes associated with community violence exposure compared to moderate and high levels of maternal acceptance.

AB This study examined the specificity of relations between parent or caregiver behaviors and childhood internalizing and externalizing problems in a sample of 70 fourth-grade children (64% boys, M age = 9.7 years). Specificity was assessed via (a) unique effects, (b) differential effects, and (c) interactive effects. When measured as unique and differential effects, specificity was not found for warmth or psychological control but was found for caregiver's use of behavior control. Higher levels of behavior control were uniquely related to lower levels of externalizing problems and higher levels of internalizing problems; differential effects analyses indicated that higher levels of behavior control were related to decreases in the within-child difference in relative levels of level of internalizing versus externalizing problems. Interactive relations among the 3 parenting behavior dimensions also were identified. Although caregivers emphasized different parenting behavior dimensions across 2 separate caregiver-child interaction tasks, relations between parenting behavior dimensions and child psychopathology did not vary as a function of task. These findings indicate the importance of assessing and simultaneously analyzing multiple parenting behavior dimensions and multiple child psychopathology domains.

AB This study tests a model of children's emotion regulation (ER) as a moderator of the link between maternal depression and child internalizing problems. Participants were 78 children (ages 4 to 7), including 45 children of mothers with a history of childhood-onset depression (COD) and 33 children of mothers who had never been depressed. ER was assessed observationally during a laboratory mood induction. ER behaviors were empirically reduced into 3 categories: (a) negative focus on delay, (b) positive reward anticipation, and (c) behavioral distraction. Linear mixed models indicated that positive reward anticipation moderated the effects of maternal COD on children's internalizing problems, particularly if mothers had current depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that generating positive affect in the face of a potential frustration may be a protective ER strategy for children at risk for depression.

AB The impact of early therapeutic alliance was examined in 100 clients receiving either individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or family therapy for adolescent substance abuse. Observational ratings of adolescent alliance in CBT and adolescent and parent alliance in family therapy were used to predict treatment retention (in CBT only) and outcome (drug use, externalizing, and internalizing symptoms in both conditions) at post and 6-month follow-up. There were no alliance effects in CBT. In family therapy, stronger parent alliance predicted declines in drug use and externalizing. Adolescents with weak early alliances that subsequently improved by midtreatment showed significantly greater reductions in externalizing than adolescents whose alliances declined. Results underscore the need for ongoing developmental calibration of intervention theory and practice for adolescent clinical populations.

AB In this study, the authors investigated the efficacy of the Youth-Nominated Support Team-Version I (YST-1), a psychoeducational social network intervention, with 289 suicidal, psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents (197 girls, 92 boys). Adolescents were randomly assigned to treatment-as-usual plus YST-1 or treatment-as-usual only. Assessments were completed pre- and postintervention (6 months). There were no main effects for YST-1 on suicide ideation or attempts, internalizing symptoms, or related functional impairment. Relative to other girls, however, those who received YST-1 reported greater decreases in self-reported suicidal ideation (actually treated analytic strategy) and significantly greater decreases in mood-related functional impairment reported by their parents (intent to treat and actually treated analytic strategies). This is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of a social network intervention with suicidal youths.

AB Concurrent and prospective associations between parent-youth dyadic hostility and adolescent externalizing and internalizing problem behavior were examined in a sample of 416 families. Parenting control, parents' well-being, and youths' affiliation with deviant peers were included as integral covariates. Information from multiple sources was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Concurrently, youth externalizing problems were associated with dyadic hostility, deviant peers, inadequate parenting control, and fathers' well-being (inversely). Internalizing problems were associated with inadequate parenting control and lower levels of fathers' well-being. Prospectively, some of these relations continued over 2 years, with a few new associations emerging. A process model is proposed in which parent-youth dyadic hostility during early adolescence influences parenting, peer relations, and parents' well-being over time.

ID DIVORCE; CONFLICT
AB Research on divorce has found that adolescents' feelings of being caught between parents are linked to internalizing problems and weak parent-child relationships. The present study estimates the effects of marital discord, as well as divorce, on young adult offspring's feelings of being caught in the middle (N = 632). Children with parents in high-conflict marriages were more likely than other children to feel caught between parents. These feelings were associated with lower subjective well-being and poorer quality parent-child relationships. Offspring with divorced parents were no more likely than offspring with continuously married parents in low-conflict relationships to report feeling caught. Feelings of being caught appeared to fade in the decade following parental divorce. These results suggest that, unlike children of divorce, children with parents in conflicted marriages (who do not divorce) may be unable to escape from their parents' marital problems - even into adulthood.

AB The study aimed to compare cross-cultural trends of comorbid internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, prosocial beliefs, and perceptions of risk in adolescents with and without clinical levels of self-reported depressive symptoms. The Social and Health Assessment, a self-report survey, was conducted in a representative sample of 3309 adolescents 14 to 17 years old from urban communities in the United States (N = 1343), Belgium (N = 946), and Russia (N = 1009). In all three countries, girls reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than boys. The findings also demonstrate that in both genders, depressive symptoms were associated with increased levels of internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as lower levels of prosocial beliefs and low perceptions of harm from risk-taking behavior. Depressed boys had relatively higher levels of externalizing problems than depressed girls. Greater levels of internalizing problems observed in depressed youth, as compared with their nondepressed counterparts, were not gender-specific. Current findings suggest that the relationships between depression and comorbid psychopathology are not culture-specific and have similar patterns in different populations.

AB This article reports two studies examining the content and structural aspects of maternal and self-representations in middle childhood in two prospective studies of 9 to 11-year-old children, their stability over time and interrelations, and their contribution to symptomatology and academic functioning. In Study 1 (N=169), content and structural dimensions of participants' open-ended narratives of self and mother were assessed, and their factor structure was replicated across two consecutive measurement waves carried out a year apart. In Study 2 (N=137), using an independent sample, the authors investigated the associations of self- and maternal representations with teachers' subsequent reports of children's internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and academic competence. It was assumed that dimensions of self-representations played a mediating role in the prediction of children's symptomatology and competence by their maternal representations. Results corroborated the existence of interdependent but distinct representations of self and mother in middle childhood, as well as the stability over time of the structural and thematic aspects within each representation. The content of the self- and maternal representations was found to associate with observed symptomatic behavior, while their structure associated with children's academic competence. In addition, results indicated that self-representation content mediates the association of maternal representation content with subsequent symptomatic behavior. Findings are discussed in the light of the differentiation and interdependence of self- and maternal representations in middle childhood.

AB Objective: A family cognitive-behavioral therapy for children and adolescents ages 8 to 18 years with clinical anxiety disorders was developed and evaluated. Method: Seventeen families were measured before and after waitlist, after treatment, and at 3-month and 1-year follow-up. Results: No children changed their diagnostic status during waitlist, whereas of the treated children, 41% were free of their primary anxiety disorder posttest, 57% at 3-month follow-up, and 71% at 1-year follow-up. Effect sizes of improvement were large for children's fears, dysfunctional beliefs, and interpretations of ambiguous situations and medium for children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Interestingly, fathers but not mothers reported less anxiety themselves after treatment. Large improvements were observed on parents' dysfunctional beliefs about their child's anxiety and their role as a parent. Finally, some improvements occurred in family and rearing variables. Conclusions: Family cognitive-behavioral therapy seems effective for clinically anxious children and their families.

AB This meta-analysis examines the relationship between active coping and psychosocial health among youth. Results from 40 studies of coping with interpersonal stress were synthesized using a random-effects model. Four areas of psychosocial functioning were examined: externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, social competence, and academic performance. The magnitude of the relationship between active coping and psychosocial functioning was small, with correlations ranging from 0.02 for internalizing behavior to 0.12 for academic performance. Mean effects were moderated by stressor controllability: youth who used active coping in response to controllable stressors had fewer externalizing problems and higher social competence, as compared to those who used active coping in response to uncontrollable stressors. Implications for primary prevention programs and directions for future research on child and adolescent coping are discussed.

AB This study examined whether the impact of contextual-level socioeconomic disadvantage on adolescent mental health is contingent upon individual-level perceptions of social support. Data are from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a panel survey of a nationally representative United States sample (analytic N = 18,417) of students in 7th through 12th grade. Effects of social support and social context on both internalizing problems (depressive symptoms) and externalizing problems (minor delinquency and violent behavior) are analyzed. Contextual-level socioeconomic disadvantage is positively associated with depressive symptoms, negatively associated with minor delinquency, and not directly associated with violent behavior. High perceived support from family, friends, and other adults offsets poor mental health, but is most protective in areas of low socioeconomic disadvantage. The mental health benefits of perceived social support are dampened in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, compared to advantaged areas. Results suggest that interventions targeting only individual- or family-level processes within disadvantaged contexts may be inadequate at stemming psychological distress among adolescents.

AB Methodologically and theoretically based on metarrepresentational deficit hypothesis, we design an intervention to teach the mental state of pretense to an autistic boy. The production and comprehension of symbolic play by means of the use of two specific strategies founded on pictorial analogy of the mental representation and process, was the focus of the learning. The efficiency and efectiveness of the program is reflected in the results that indicated the subject's competence to generate and comprehend the pretense as well as to generalize the acquired knowledge into other areas of mentalistic functioning. We discuss the possibility to develop a metarrepresentational knowledge based on the internalizing of the strategies of conceptual support.

AB The aim Of this Study is to obtain dimensions from a categorical diagnostic interview. 512 children aged 8 to 17 attending public centers for children's mental health and presenting some form of psychological disorder were interviewed with the << Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents >>(DICA-IV). Analysis of the principal components indicate that a two-dimensional model (externalizing-internalizing) satisfactorily explain the data collected from the children and their parents. The data from the adolescents are better represented by a three-dimensional model (attention problems-internalizing-antisocial behavior). The factor scales show good internal consistency and significantly relate to other criteria of psychopathology and incapacity (concurrent validity). These results show that it is possible to use DICA-IV to obtain categorical and dimensional indicators simultaneously. The latter are particularly sensitive for measuring changes over the course of disorders.

AB Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder which occurs more often in twins than singletons. This article focuses on the psychosocial consequences of having a co-twin with ADHD. Specifically, the level of anxiety (generalized and separation) in non-ADHD children who have a co-twin with ADHD is examined using data from the Australian Twin ADHD Project (ATAP). Parental report data on 501 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs aged 6 to 15 and their siblings were used to examine (i) anxiety symptoms in twin pairs discordant for ADHD, 00 how the effects of an ADHD twin on their co-twin and siblings are related to the type of ADHD, and (iii) whether the effects are greater for the nonaffected twin than nontwin siblings. Results show that anxiety was high in co-twins of children with the combined subtype of ADHD, with increased symptoms of both generalized and separation anxiety. Inattentive ADHD had smaller effects, which were confined to generalized anxiety and were specific to the co-twin rather than other siblings. These results have clinical implications in managing the entire multiple birth family where one twin has ADHD, and also has implications for genetic analysis in modeling the relationship of ADHD to internalizing disorders.

AB Foster children are at high risk for perpetrating and for being victims of sibling aggression and violence. This article proposes an integrative, multidimensional model for studying risk and protective factors of sibling violence. In the model, exposure to sibling violence (perpetration and victimization), child mental disorder, and placement characteristics are risk factors for impaired psychological functioning (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and for disruptions in school competence (scholastic and social competence with classmates). Sibling positivity, quality of the foster care giving, and foster rejecting care giving are proposed as moderating processes in the linkage between exposure to sibling violence and impaired psychological functioning. Preliminary data are presented in support of the proposed model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Outpatient child psychiatrists appear to be treating a broadening array of complex, highly comorbid. and difficult-to-treat youths. In this study, designed to evaluate the current demographic and diagnostic profile of outpatient child psychiatric patients 1,292 outpatient records from 8 treatment settings were reviewed. Patient age, race, gender, and diagnoses were recorded and analyzed. Externalizing disorders (ADHD and/or behavior disorders) were diagnosed most frequently, followed by internalizing (depressive and anxiety) disorders. Comorbidity was evident in nearly half of all patients, regardless of age. Substance abuse was infrequently reported as a comorbid condition. Externalizing and internalizing pathology frequently co-occurred. Findings reinforce the need for clinician vigilance and thorough assessment of outpatient children and adolescents.

TI Toward a comprehensive developmental model for major depression in men
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; DEPENDENCE; ILLNESS; TWINS; FIT; SEX
AB Objective: The multiple risk factors for major depression are interrelated through poorly understood developmental pathways. In 2002, the authors presented a developmental model for major depression in women. Based on similar methods, they here present an analogous model for men.
   Method: Using data from 2,935 adult male twins, interviewed twice over a 2-4-year period, the authors constructed, by means of structural equation modeling, an integrated etiologic model for major depression that predicts depressive episodes over 1 year from 18 risk factors conceptualized as five developmental "tiers" reflecting childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, adulthood, and the last year.
   Results: The best-fitting model, including six correlations and 76 paths, provided a good fit to the data, explaining 49% of the variance in the liability to depressive episodes. The overall results, similar to those seen in women, suggest that the development of major depression results from the action and interaction of three broad pathways of internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and adversity. Childhood parental loss and low self-esteem were more potent variables in the model in men than in women. Genetic risks for major depression had a broader spectrum of action in men than in women. The pathway to major depression through externalizing symptoms was not more prominent in men than in women.
   Conclusions: Major depression in men, as in women, is an etiologically complex disorder influenced by risk factors from multiple domains that act in developmental time. The similarities in etiologic pathways to major depression for men and women outweigh the modest differences.

AB The Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)(1) is a 1-2 hour standardized biopsychosocial that integrates clinical and research assessment for people presenting to substance abuse treatment. The GAIN - Short Screener (GSS) is 3-5 minute screener to quickly identify those who would have a disorder based on the full 60-120 minute GAIN and triage the problem and kind of intervention they are likely to need along four dimensions (internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance disorders, and crime/ violence). Data were collected from 6,177 adolescents and 1,805 adults as part of 77 studies in three dozen locations around the United States that used the GAIN. For both adolescents and adults the 20-item total disorder screener (TDScr) and its four 5-item sub-screeners (internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance disorders, and crime/violence) has good internal consistency (alpha of .96 on total screener), is highly correlated (r = .84 to .94) with the 123-item longer scales in the full GAIN. The GSS also does well in terms of its receiver operator characteristics (90% or more under the curve in all analyses) and has clinical decision-making cut points with excellent sensitivity (90% or more) for identifying people with a disorder and excellent specificity (92% or more) for correctly ruling out people who did not have a disorder. The GSS has good potential as an efficient screener for identifying people with co-occurring disorders across multiple systems and routing them to the right services and more detailed assessments.

AB Mothers of children with intellectual disability were assessed at two time points, 2 years apart (n = 75 at Time 1, n = 56 at Time 2). Data were gathered on maternal distress, mental health, expressed emotion, and the child's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Consistent with previous research with families of children who have intellectual disability, maternal distress and children's behavior problems entered into a bidirectional relationship over time. This relationship was found to be specific to externalizing problems. Exploratory analyses also suggest that maternal distress and depression had a bidirectional longitudinal relationship. In terms of maternal expressed emotion, criticism and not emotional over-involvement was cross-sectionally but not longitudinally related to children's externalizing behavior problems and to maternal distress.

AB Advancing the process-oriented study of links between interparental discord and child adjustment, 2 multimethod prospective tests of emotional security as an explanatory mechanism are reported. On the basis of community samples, with waves spaced 2 years apart, Study 1 (113 boys and 113 girls, ages 9-18) identified emotional security as a mediator in a 2-wave test, whereas Study 2 (105 boys and 127 girls, ages 5-7) indicated emotional security as an intervening mechanism in a 3-wave test. Relations between discord and emotional security increased as children moved into adolescence in Study 1. Emotional security was identified as an explanatory mechanism for both internalizing and externalizing problems in children.

AB Because of their high comorbidity and strong associations, the distinctiveness of anxiety and depression in youth continues to be debated. In this study we used cluster analysis in a community sample (n = 225) of youth to test tripartite model predictions regarding the grouping of individuals based on their levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Findings were consistent with tripartite model predictions that four groups would emerge (primarily elevated on anxiety symptoms only, elevated on depression symptoms only, elevated on both anxiety and depression symptoms, and a low symptom group). Analyses using specific tripartite model variables and parent report of internalizing symptoms provided additional support for the groupings and tripartite model predictions. Across age groupings, the clustering of anxiety and depression symptoms was consistent with some hypothesized developmental differences in the expression of internalizing symptoms in youth. Findings add support for the tripartite model in youth, and support the idea that anxiety and depression do represent unique syndromes in youth.

AB Our objective was to determine the prevalence rate of parent-reported asthma in children with internalizing disorders seeking psychological treatment, and to study the level of internalizing and externalizing problems in these patients compared to patients without asthma. Participants were 367 children (ages 5-18 years) with internalizing disorders seeking psychological treatment. Children's psychiatric diagnosis was established with the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV-Child and Parent versions. Parents reported on their child's asthma diagnosis, medical history, and medication usage. Child psychopathology was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist and by child self-report with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and the Children's Depression Inventory. We assessed internalizing psychopathology of the mothers with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale. An additional diagnosis of parent-reported asthma was establisbed for 15% of the children diagnosed with an Axis I internalizing disorder, a prevalence rate markedly higher. than reported for current parent-reported childhood asthma in the U.S. population. Patients with asthma showed higher levels of internalizing problems than their nonasthmatic counterparts. Internalizing psychopathology was not higher for mothers of patients with asthma. Asthma is a significant problem within the population of patients with childhood internalizing disorders. It can be accompanied by a greater severity of internalizing problems and may require specific precautions in the treatment protocol. Though parent report of asthma diagnosis is commonly used in surveys of childhood asthma, our findings have to be viewed in the light of its limitations.

AB The relations between early infant-mother attachment and children's social competence and behavior problems during the preschool and early school-age period were examined in more than 1,000 children under conditions of decreasing, stable, and increasing maternal parenting quality. Infants' Strange Situation attachment classifications predicted mothers' reports of children's social competence and teachers' reports of externalizing and internalizing behaviors from preschool age through 1st grade. These relations appeared to be mediated by parenting quality; main effects of attachment classification disappeared when effects of parenting quality were controlled. Interactions were also observed. For example, when parenting quality improved over time, teachers rated children with insecure infant-mother attachments lower on externalizing behaviors; when parenting quality decreased, teachers rated insecure children higher on externalizing behaviors. In contrast, children classified as securely attached in infancy did not appear to be affected by declining or improving parenting quality.

AB Aim - This study examines the relationship between prenatal cocaine exposure and parent-reported child behavior problems at age 7 years. Methods - Data are from 407 African-American children (210 cocaine-exposed, 197 non-cocaine-exposed) enrolled prospectively at birth in a longitudinal study on the neurodevelopmental consequences of in utero exposure to cocaine. Prenatal cocaine exposure was assessed at delivery through maternal self-report and bioassays (maternal and infant urine and infant meconium). The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a measure of childhood externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, was completed by the child's current primary caregiver during an assessment visit scheduled when the child was seven years old. Results - Structural equation and GLM/GEE models disclosed no association linking prenatal cocaine exposure status or level of cocaine exposure to child behavior (CBCL Externalizing and Internalizing scores or the eight CBCL subscale scores). Conclusions - This evidence, based on standardized ratings by the current primary caregiver, fails to support hypothesized cocaine-associated behavioral problems in school-aged children with in utero cocaine exposure. A next step in this line of research is to secure standardized ratings from other informants (e.g., teachers, youth self-report).

AB This study investigates some psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief measure for screening behavioral and emotional problems in children and adolescents. In two independent Flemish community samples of young children, parents (Sample 1: N = 532; Sample 2: N = 1086) and teachers (Sample 1: N = 512; Sample 2: N = 1049) of children aged 4-8 completed all items of the SDQ. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence for both a three- and a five-factor solution. Internal consistency and interrater reliability of the different SDQ scales were found to be satisfactory, except for the Conduct problems and the Peer problems scales. A good construct validity with the subscales of the well-established Child Behavior Checklist was found. A 2 (gender) x 2 (age groups:. 4-5 and 6-7 years) ANOVA indicated that more hyperactivity/inattention problems and more internalizing behavior was reported for the oldest age group. More behavior problems were reported for boys than for girls, whereas girls were attributed more prosocial behavior.

AB In a sample of 92 children aged 6-13 years this study investigates the normal developmental change in the relation between executive functioning (EF) and the core behavioural symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention) as well as symptoms often co-occurring with childhood hyperactivity (conduct- and internalizing problems). EF was assessed by using multiple tests grouped through prior factor analysis, resulting in cognitive measures relating to disinhibition, speed/arousal, verbal working memory, non-verbal working memory, and fluency. The results showed that although disinhibition was positively related to hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention mainly for the youngest age group, there were no significant age effects for these relations. Instead, age effects were found for the relations between speed/arousal and inattention as well as for the relations between verbal working memory/fluency and inattention. In the oldest age group poor performance on these cognitive measures was associated with high ratings of inattention. For the total sample a relation was obtained between disinhibition and hyperactivity/impulsivity as well as between both working memory measures and internalizing problems. In conclusion, the results from this study suggest that poor inhibition is most clearly associated with ADHD symptoms for younger children, whereas poor functioning with regard to later developing and more complex executive functions such as working memory and fluency is associated with ADHD symptoms for older children.

AB This study examined the psychometric properties of the Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (OCS) of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Participants included 48 youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 41 with a non-OCD internalizing disorder, and 101 with an externalizing disorder. Confirmatory factor analysis of the 8-item OCS did not result in an adequate fit. Exploratory factor analysis identified a 1-factor model consisting of 6 items. Adequate internal consistency for the revised OCS (OCS-R) was obtained, and convergent validity was supported by moderate relationships with other OCD indices. The OCS-R had stronger associations with measures of OCD symptoms than with measures of depression and externalizing behaviors. Youth with OCD had significantly higher OCS-R scores than those with internalizing and externalizing disorders. Suggestions for cutoff scores are provided using results from ROC analyses. Overall, these findings suggest that the OCS-R is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of pediatric OCD. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this study was to examine patterns of comorbidity associated with generalized and performance-focused social phobia (SOP) among a community-based sample of youth while also examining whether gender and age influenced the associations found. Participants from the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study, aged 9-17 (N = 1295), were used. Diagnoses were based on structured clinical interviews with youth and their caregivers. Results indicated that both subtypes of SOP were associated with a range of other anxiety disorders. Contrary to the expectations, performance-focused SOP was somewhat more strongly associated with depressive disorders than was generalized SOP; this difference was driven primarily by higher rates of dysthymia (DYS) among those with performance-focused SOP than generalized SOP Although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was associated with generalized SOP, more severe externalizing behavior (oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD)) was only associated with performance-focused SOP. Limited gender and age differences in these relationships were found. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The children's Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale (CY-BOCS) is a commonly used, psychometrically sound clinician-rated instrument of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) severity. Given the relatively direct rating format and potential benefits of alternative versions that could be easily administered to patients and parents, we developed and examined the psychometric properties of child- and parent-report formats of the CY-BOCS severity items. A total of 53 children and adolescents (8-17 years old) with OCD and their parents was administered the CY-BOCS, children's Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale-child report (CY-BOCS-CR), children's Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale-parent report (CY-BOCS-PR), and other measures of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. In general, reliability and convergent and divergent validity of the CY-BOCS-CR/PR were satisfactory. Psychometric. properties for the CY-BOCS-CR in those children and adolescents with externalizing behavior problems were lower relative to those without externalizing problems. Exploratory factor analyses identified a two-factor structure in both measures comprised of disturbance and severity factors. This study provides preliminary support for the use of child- and parent-report versions of the CY-BOCS. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parental ratings of 695 adopted Chinese girls' internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors were analyzed in 4 stages to: (1) Compare adjustment profiles of Chinese adoptee samples with relevant US normative data; (2) analyze age differences in behavioral adjustment differences of Chinese adoptees; (3) examine interrelationships among the 3 behavior problem scores and child's age at adoption, current age, pre-adoption neglect, and post-adoption initial rejection behaviors; and (4) explore the degree to which the 4 child-level independent variables worked individually or collectively to predict behavioral adjustment outcomes. Chinese adoptees had better adjustment scores than normative samples from the U.S. Preschool-age adoptees had better adjustment scores than school-age adoptees. No relationships were observed between the age-related variables and behavioral adjustment measures. However, pre-adoption neglect and post-adoption initial rejection behaviors were predictors of behavioral adjustment scores. The implications of these findings for future research, clinical practice and parenting education were discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of the current study to assist in understanding the prevalence and clinical correlates of psychiatric distress in adolescents seeking outpatient services for marijuana abuse or dependency.
   Methods: In a multi-site randomized clinical trial, 600 adolescents and their parents were assessed at intake using the Global Appraisals of Individual Needs. DSM-IV criteria were used to diagnose marijuana use disorders, and a symptom check list was used to measure symptoms on five syndromes: conduct disorder, ADHD, depression, anxiety, and disorders of traumatic distress.
   Results: Patients endorsed acute levels of conduct disorder (74%), ADHD (77%), depression (37.7%), anxiety (28.8%), and traumatic distress (13.8%), and 72% endorsed acute levels on two or more syndromes. Adolescents with a diagnosis of dependency and females evidenced the greatest severity of mental health distress, and minimal differences were found between racial groups. Patients with acute levels of both internalizing and externalizing syndromes reported problems with substance use, criminal activities, trauma experience, and family environments.
   Conclusion: Co-occurring psychiatric distress is the norm for adolescents seeking outpatient services for marijuana disorders. Better integration of substance use and mental health services would likely improve the quality of care for these troubled youth.

AB Background: Despite findings that parent depression increases children's risk for internalizing and externalizing problems, little is known about other factors that combine with parent depression to contribute to behavior problems. Methods: As part of a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study on childhood-onset depression (COD), we examined the association of mother history of COD, child frontal electroencephalogram asymmetry, and affective behavior with children's concurrent behavior problems. Results: Children in the COD group had higher anxious/depressed and aggressive problems than did children in the control group, but this was qualified by a COD-by-asymmetry interaction effect. For COD but not control children, left frontal asymmetry was associated with both anxious/depressed and aggressive child problems. Children with left frontal asymmetry and low affect regulation behavior had higher anxious/depressed problems than did those with high affect regulation behavior. Boys with left frontal asymmetry had higher aggressive problems than did those with right frontal asymmetry. Conclusions: In children of mothers with COD, physiological and behavioral indices of affect regulation may constitute risks for behavior problems.

Participants: Families of 32 school-aged children with moderate to severe TBI randomly assigned to FPS or usual care (UC) group. Main Outcome Measures: Child Behavior Checklist, Brief Symptom Inventory, Conflict Behavior Questionnaire. Intervention: Seven-session problemsolving/skill-building intervention delivered over a 6-month period for the participating families. Results: Parents in the FPS group reported significantly greater improvements in their children in internalizing symptoms, anxiety/depression, and withdrawal than did parents in the UC comparison group. Conclusions: FPS holds promise for reducing child behavior problems, the most common and persistent sequelate of TBI.

AB This study examines how parenting helps explain the contemporaneous association between interparental hostility and adolescent problem behavior. A theoretical model of spillover was tested specifying five aspects of mothers' and fathers' parenting that might be associated with parents' hostile interactions with one another: harshness, inconsistency, psychological intrusiveness, and lower levels of acceptance and monitoring knowledge. The sample consisted of 416 early adolescents and their married parents. The association between interparental hostility and adolescent externalizing problems was mediated uniquely by fathers' and mothers' harshness, lower levels of fathers' monitoring knowledge, and mothers' psychological intrusiveness. The association between interparental hostility and adolescent internalizing was mediated uniquely by mothers' harshness, psychological intrusiveness, and lower levels of acceptance. These patterns were similar for sons and daughters.

AB This study examined the associations between lifetime mental disorder, comorbidity, and self-reported postrunaway arrests among 428 (187 males, 241 females) homeless and runaway youth. The analysis examined the pattern of arrests across five lifetime mental disorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, conduct disorder, major depressive episode, and posttraumatic stress disorder). The adolescents, ranging from 16 to 19 years old, were interviewed directly on the streets and in shelters in four Midwestern states using computer-assisted personal interviewing. Extensive self-reports of early life history, behaviors since running away from home, and diagnostic interviewing (UM-CIDI and DISC-R) were used to estimate possible disorders. There was a high level of postrunaway arrests reported by the youth; more than half were arrested at least once after the initial runaway, with the average of 4.4 times. Consistent with the hypotheses, there were differential associations between individual mental disorders and involvement with the criminal justice system. Only externalizing disorders such as substance abuse and conduct disorder were related to arrest. Street youth with multiple externalizing and internalizing disorders were more likely to be arrested than nondisordered youths.

AB Objective: There are big discrepancies among the reported prevalence rates of emotional/behavioral problems for deaf children. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence rate of emotional and behavioral problems and to assess the effect of subject characteristics on these problems in a group of deaf Turkish children and adolescents.
   Method: Seventy-two students from a regional residential school for the deaf children and adolescents, aged 6 to 18 years, were recruited as the study group. The control group consisted of 45 age-matched healthy children and adolescents. A questionnaire on sociodemographic features and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were administered to the parents of the children and adolescents.
   Results: The deaf students group showed significantly more internalizing problems than controls. The largest difference was found for the Anxious/Depressed and Somatic Complaints scale. Deaf adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years had significantly higher anxious/depressed and somatic complaints subscores of CBCL than deaf children aged between 6 and 11 years. Furthermore girls had significantly higher subscores of Anxious/Depressed and Somatic Complaints than the boys in the deaf group. The correlation analysis revealed that degree of hearing loss, academic achievement, and teacher-rated communication level were not related to any emotional or behavioral problems.
   Conclusion: Deaf children and adolescents have more internalizing problems than normal hearing controls. The results underline the need of screening the deaf children and adolescents more often concerning their mental health.

AB OBJECTIVE. We examined the relationship between women's experiences with intimate partner violence and their reports of child behavior problems.
   METHODS. Data were from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a national probability study of children who were the subjects of child abuse and neglect investigations. The sample consisted of 2020 female caregivers of children between the ages of 4 and 14 years who were interviewed about demographic characteristics, child behavior problems, female caregiver mental health, parenting behaviors, experiences with intimate partner violence, and community characteristics. Information on child abuse and neglect was obtained in interviews with child protective services workers. Multiple-regression analyses were used to investigate the association between caregiver victimization and child behavior problems while controlling for the effects of child, family, and environmental characteristics. The potential moderating effects of caregiver depression and parenting practices on the relation between intimate partner violence and child behavior problems were examined also.
   RESULTS. Severe intimate partner violence was associated with both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems when other risk factors were controlled. Use of corporal punishment and psychological aggression were significant moderators, but maternal depression did not moderate the relation between intimate partner violence and behavior problems.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study adds to the evidence that maternal caregivers' experiences with intimate partner violence are related to child functioning. The findings suggest that systematic efforts are needed to ensure that mental health needs are identified and addressed appropriately in children exposed to this violence.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the association between observed fathers' negativity in the interaction with their toddlers and internalizing problems of girls and boys at school age. In a prospective study of children at risk (Mannheim Study of Risk Children), 88 father-child dyads at the child's age of 2 years were videotaped and rated with a macro- and microanalytic coding system. Behavior problems were assessed at the age of 8 years using the Teacher Report Form of Achenbach's rating scales. Results revealed that fathers were more emotionally negative with their sons than with their daughters. No further differences in the fathers' interactive behavior according to child gender were found. However, fathers whose daughters had more internalizing problems (as seen by the teachers) at age 8 years were more restrictive and showed more inadequate control and negative interactive styles. In contrast, no predictive value of father negativity was observed in boys.

AB Background. Epidemiological studies have found lower than expected prevalence of psychiatric disorders among disadvantaged race-ethnic minority groups in the USA. Recent research shows that this is due entirely to reduced lifetime risk of disorders, as opposed to persistence. Specification of race-ethnic differences with respect to clinical and social characteristics can help identify the protective factors that lead to lower lifetime risk among disadvantaged minority groups.
   Method. Data on 5424 Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites came from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representative survey conducted with the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Race-ethnic differences in risk of disorders were compared across specific diagnoses, ages of onset, cohorts and levels of education.
   Results. Both minority groups had lower risk for common internalizing disorders: depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social phobia. In addition, Hispanics had lower risk for dysthymia, oppositional-defiant disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; non-Hispanic Blacks had lower risk for panic disorder, substance use disorders and early-onset impulse control disorders. Lower risk among Hispanics, relative to non-Hispanic Whites, was found only among the younger cohort (age <= 43 years). Lower risk among minorities was more pronounced at lower levels of education.
   Conclusion. The pattern of race-ethnic differences in risk for psychiatric disorders suggests the presence of protective factors that originate in childhood and have generalized effects on internalizing disorders. For Hispanics, but not for non-Hispanic Blacks, the influence of these protective factors has emerged only recently.

AB Background: This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between patterns of temperament and character and self-reported psychopathology in adolescents from the community. Sampling and Methods: The Junior Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) instruments were administered to 623 Korean middle school students (boys/girls = 331/292; age = 13.3 +/- 0.9 years old). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between temperament and character based on Cloninger's biogenetic theory of personality and youth psychopathology of internalizing and externalizing problems. Results: Internalizing problems of the YSR (withdrawn, somatic complaint and anxious/depressed scales) were significantly related to high Harm Avoidance and low Reward Dependence (JTCI temperament) and low Self-Directedness and high Self-Transcendence (JTCI character). Externalizing problems of the YSR (delinquency and aggression) were significantly associated with high Novelty Seeking and high Harm Avoidance (JTCI temperament) and low Self-Directedness, low Cooperativeness and high Self-Transcendence (JTCI character). Conclusions: Findings of the current study suggest that specific patterns of temperament and character potentially influence adolescents' psychopathology in the community. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

AB Objective: To evaluate the psychopathological status and denial of symptoms in a sample of 38 consecutively admitted adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). Method. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children was used to determine the categorical diagnosis of eating disorder. The anorexic adolescents completed the EAT-40 (Eating Attitude Test) and, on the basis of its score, the sample was dichotomized in a false-negative group (FNG) scoring under 30 and a positive group (PG) scoring over 30. We compared these two subgroups in terms of clinical variables (age of onset and admission, duration of illness prior to admission, diagnosis, BMI) and psychopathology assessed by the CBCL (Child Behaviour Checklist) and the YSR (Youth Self-Report). In order to evaluate the possible role of diagnosis and BIVII on the EAT score we also dichotomized the sample with respect to the diagnosis (full vs. partial AN) and to the mean female BIVII (<= 15vs. > 15). Results:A significant difference was found in terms of duration of illness prior to admission, which was briefer in the FNG. Higher CBCL and YSR values were found in the PG with significant differences in terms of YSR internalizing symptoms. A large amount of significantly positive Pearson's correlations were found between the CBCL and YSR values in the FNG. No significant Pearson's correlations were found between EAT, BMI and diagnosis. Conclusions: The lower CBCL and YSR values in the FNG seem to point out a tendency of this group to deny anxiety and depression as well as an eating pathology; the longer duration of illness prior to admission in the PG seems to support the hypothesis that the PG may be considered to be not so much more disturbed as more aware of its eating attitudes and psychopathology. The nature of denial in anorexic adolescents is discussed. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ID ADOLESCENCE
AB This longitudinal study examined internalizing behavior problems (anxiety/depression) in early adolescence in relation to adversity in early childhood and child verbal competence. We hypothesized that verbal competence would act as a protective factor in the face of early adversity, that is, high verbal IQ would predict relatively lower internalizing problems in early adolescence primarily for those children who experienced the greatest adversity. The sample was based on 191 Costa Rican children and their mothers, who were recruited in infancy from an urban community and assessed again at 5 and 11-14 years. Families were generally lower-middle to working class. A total of 165 children (94 boys) participated in the early adolescent follow-up (mean age = 12.3 years). Internalizing problems were based on maternal report (Spanish Child Behavior Checklist). Our cumulative risk index (CRI) of adversity in early childhood consisted of home environment quality (HOME score), socioeconomic status, maternal depressed mood (CESD), and maternal IQ. Controlling for the effects of age, gender, internalizing problems at 5 years, and verbal IQ at 5 years, there was a significant interaction between early adversity and verbal IQ at age 11-14 years in predicting internalizing problems in early adolescence. Youth with high verbal IQ had comparable levels of internalizing problems regardless of high or low adversity in early childhood. In contrast, youth with low verbal IQ received higher internalizing problem ratings if they experienced high adversity early in life. The results raise the possibility that interventions to improve verbal competence might help lower the risk of internalizing problems in the face of early adversity.

AB Effective emotion regulation may promote resilience and preschool classroom adjustment by supporting adaptive peer interactions and engagement in learning activities. We investigated how hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) regulation, cardiac reactivity, and classroom emotion displays related to adjustment among low-income preschoolers attending Head Start. A total of 62 four-year-olds completed a laboratory session including a baseline soothing video; emotion-eliciting slides/video clips, and recovery. Salivary cortisol, heart rate, and vagal tone were measured throughout. Independent coders used handheld computers to observe classroom emotion expression/regulation. Teachers rated child motivation, persistence/attention, learning attitudes, and internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Results reveal associations between biobehavioral markers of regulatory capacity and early school adjustment.

Participants were 95 mothers of 1- to 4-year-old children in Israel. Results suggested a differential pattern of associations between the types of trauma exposure (i.e., direct exposure to terrorism, media exposure to terrorism, and other trauma) and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. This line of research is important for the identification of risk factors and the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies to promote resilience in preschool children exposed to specific type(s) of trauma.

AB The effects of an eight-week instructional program in creative dance/movement on the social competence of low-income preschool children were assessed in this study utilizing a scientifically rigorous design. Forty preschool children from a large Head Start program were randomly assigned to participate in either an experimental dance program or an attention control group. Teachers and parents, blind to the children's group membership, rated children's social competence both before and after the program, using English and Spanish versions of the Social Competence Behavior Evaluation: Preschool Edition. The results revealed significantly greater positive gains over time in the children's social competence and both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems for the experimental group compared with the control group. Small-group creative dance instruction for at-risk preschoolers appears to be an excellent mechanism for enhancing social competence and improving behavior. The implications for early childhood education and intervention are discussed.

AB The relationships of conduct problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) signs, and depression to substance use were examined between 1994 and 1999 among 900 incarcerated young offenders in South Australia, 206 of whom were reassessed when later readmitted to secure care. At the first and second assessments, conduct problems, ADHD signs, and depression scores all had significant concurrent associations with a measure of recent substance use. Prospectively, there were no significant associations between depression and substance use. At the zero-order level, both ADHD signs and conduct problems predicted future substance use. ADHD signs remained significantly predictive after controlling for concurrent associations. The results lend support to the view that substance use is related to general deviance and that the arousal needs associated with increased ADHD signs increase the risk of substance use. There was no support for the view that substance use in this population is self-medication in response to internalizing problems.

ID CHILDHOOD
AB Background: Academic underachievement is wide spread in adolescence and constitutes a considerable risk for further psychosocial development. Achievement problems that are not caused by general intellectual impairment or specific learning disorders such as reading disorders are particularly relevant. Patients and Methods: For an efficient treatment of these youngsters a multimodal, cognitive-behavioral treatment approach was developed which is part of the treatment program for adolescents with disturbed self esteem, achievement and relationships (SELBST). The modul 'achievement problems' comprises several parts and integrates adolescent-,parent-and teacher-focused interventions. Within a case-series study 10 adolescents, 8 boys and 2 girls aged 13 to 16 years, were included. Pre-to post-changes and weekly assessed ratings by youngsters, parents and teachers were analyzed. Results: At pre-treatment, considerable achievement problems as well as comorbid externalizing behavior and, to a lesser degree, also internalizing problem behavior were found. At post-treatment, a considerable reduction of achievement problems as well as comorbid externalizing and internalizing symptoms as rated by youngsters, parents and teachers were found. Conclusions: A multimodal treatment approach that is individually tailored to the demands of each youngster and includes parents and teachers is necessary to achieve satisfying treatment results. The validity of the present study is limited because of the small sample size, the lack of a control group and the lack of independent ratings. Further research using a randomized controlled design is necessary to confirm the promising results of our study.

AB Adolescents spend more than one-third of their waking lives using media such as TV, print, audio and computer media. This paper focuses on the relationship between media use and health in adolescents from a stress-theoretical perspective, exploring the dynamics between the extent of media use, the functional value of media use in terms of coping, and stress symptoms reported by 357 fifth-graders. For different kinds of media, extent and functions of media use were recorded as well as symptomatology using the Youth Self Report (YSR). The results show gender differences with regard to both externalizing and internalizing symptomatology, and the extent of media use. Further analyses reveal significant positive correlations between media use and symptomatology. These correlations are partly mediated by the use of media in the function of coping; media use can partly be explained as an attempt to cope with stress experiences.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of child-reported violence exposure, somatic complaints, trauma-related internalizing symptoms, and health care utilization in a pediatric sample. Ninety children aged 9 to 13 completed the Children's Somatization Inventory, the Trauma Symptom Checklist, and the KID-SAVE. Health care utilization data were obtained for the year prior to recruitment. Sixty-two percent of the variance of child-reported somatic complaints was predicted by child gender, higher scores on the Physical/Verbal Abuse scale of the KID-SAVE, and higher rates of internalizing symptoms. No differences in these variables were found between high and low utilizers of health care.

AB Individual differences in autonomic nervous system reactivity have been studied in relation to physical and mental health outcomes, but rarely among children with chronic disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations among autonomic reactivity, clinical severity, family stressors, and mental health symptoms in children with homozygous sickle cell disease. Nineteen children with homozygous sickle cell disease participated in a cross-sectional study involving parent-completed measures, medical record reviews and laboratory-based measures of autonomic nervous system responses to social, cognitive, physical and emotional challenges. Autonomic reactivity was significantly associated with both clinical severity and externalizing behavior symptoms. Children with greater parasympathetic withdrawal during challenges compared to rest had significantly more severe disease (r = -0.45, p < 0.05); greater sympathetic activation during challenges compared to rest was associated with more externalizing behavior symptoms (r = 0.44, p < 0.05). Children experiencing major family stressors had internalizing behavior symptoms but no difference in autonomic reactivity or clinical severity compared to children experiencing fewer family stressors. Individual differences in autonomic reactivity may offer a new, biologically plausible account for observed variation in painful episodes, other physical complications and behavioral symptoms among children with sickle cell disease.

AB Co-occurring internalizing and externalizing disorders are moderately prevalent in children, adolescents, and adults (Anderson, Williams, McGee, & Silva, 1987; McConaughy & Skiba, 1994), but much remains to be understood regarding why some children show "pure" versus co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptoms. One possible influence that has previously not been considered is the failure to attain socio-developmental milestones, which paradoxically may prevent the development of co-occurring symptoms for some children. The present study proposes a model in which failure to attain relevant socio-developmental milestones might explain why some children may not develop heterotypic co-occurring symptoms. Specifically, it is proposed that specific clusters of internalizing symptoms (i.e., high social anxiety, withdrawal, and inhibition) and externalizing symptoms (i.e., high impulsivity, hyperactivity, and emotional reactivity) may be associated with the failure to attain socio-developmental milestones (i.e., poor peer relations for anxious children, lack of self-reflection and evaluation for impulsive/reactive children) that, in turn, may prevent subgroups of children from developing co-occurring, heterotypic symptoms.

AB A substantial proportion of children and adolescents come to suffer from psychological disorders. This article focuses on the temperament factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of child psychopathology. It is argued that besides the reactive temperament factor of emotionality/neuroticism, the regulative process of effortful control also plays an important role in the etiology and maintenance of internalizing and externalizing problems in youths. More specifically, vulnerability to child psychopathology is determined by a temperament that is characterized by high levels of emotionality/neuroticism and low levels of effortful control. Models are hypothesized in which reactive and regulative temperament factors either have interactive or additive effects on the development of psychological disorders in children, and conceptualized in terms of a developmental psychopathology perspective. Directions for future research and clinical implications of this temperamental view on psychopathology are discussed.

AB Research linking basal cortisol levels with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in youths has yielded inconsistent results. We hypothesize that the high moment to moment variation in adrenocortical activity requires an analytical strategy that separates variance in cortisol levels attributable to "stable traitlike" versus "state or situationally specific" sources. Early morning saliva samples were obtained from 724 youths (M age 13.5 years; range = 6-16 years in Year 1) on 2 successive days I year apart. Latent state-trait modeling revealed that 70% of the variance in cortisol levels could be attributed to statelike sources, and 28% to traitlike sources. For boys only, higher levels of externalizing problem behaviors were consistently associated with lower cortisol attributable to traitlike sources across 3 years of behavioral assessment. The inverse association between individual differences in cortisol and externalizing problem behavior has previously only been reported in studies of at-risk or clinical groups. The present findings suggest the relationship is a stable phenomenon that spans both normative and atypical child development. Studies are needed to reveal the biosocial mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of this phenomenon, and to decipher whether individual differences in this hormone-behavior link confers risk or resilience.

AB A longitudinal model that linked involved-supportive parenting and siblings' ability-camouflaging self-presentations to peers with the development of externalizing and internalizing symptoms was tested with 152 pairs of first- and second-born African American siblings (mean ages 12.7 years and 10.2 years at the first wave of 44 data collection). Three waves of data were collected at 1-year intervals. Teachers assessed siblings' externalizing symptoms. internalizing symptoms, and academic competence siblings reported their own self-presentations and desire for peer acceptance: and mothers and siblings provided multiinformant assessments of involved-supportive parenting. Involved-supportive parenting at Wave I was linked with peer-directed self-presentations at Wave 2. wave 2 self-presentations were linked indirectly with changes from Wave I to Wave 3 in externalizing and internalizing symptoms through their association with academic competence.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the childhood predictors of externalizing and internalizing symptoms in adolescence in an epidemiological sample. Behavior ratings were obtained from 609 children at two time-points, accounting for 71% of the target sample. At age 8, children were evaluated with parental and teacher Rutter scales, and with the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), and at age 16 with the Child Behavior Checklist. Evaluations by all informants had a unique contribution to later outcome. In multivariate analysis, among boys, parental reports of hyperactivity independently predicted externalizing problems and teacher reports of hyperactivity independently predicted internalizing problems. Teacher reports of conduct problems independently predicted externalizing problems among both boys and girls. Furthermore, parent reports of emotional problems independently predicted internalizing problems among both boys and girls. Children's own reports of internalized distress measured with CDI predicted a high level of internalizing problems among girls. Perceived need of treatment was the strongest predictor for outcome among girls. Change in family structure (e. g., divorce or remarriage) during follow-up independently predicted externalizing and internalizing problems among boys. The study supports the findings from earlier studies showing that the stability of behavior problems from childhood to adolescence is substantial. This implies a need for early recognition and initiation of treatment efforts.

AB This study evaluated the post-treatment outcome effects of a classroom-based social skills program for pre-kindergarten children, using a teacher-consultation model. The pre-K RECAP (Reaching Educators, Children, and Parents) program is a semi-structured, cognitive-behavioral skills training program that provides teachers with in-classroom consultation on program implementation and classroom-wide behavior management. Data on children's social skills and behavior problems were collected from parents and teachers at pre- and post-treatment, for 149 children aged 4-5 years (of whom 56% were girls). Significant treatment effects were found for teacher but not parent reports, with treatment group children improving significantly more than comparison group children in their teacher-rated social skills and internalizing and externalizing problems. These results provide some preliminary support for the efficacy of the program on children's social skills and behavior problems, and for a teacher-consultation model for training teachers to implement school-based mental health programs.

AB In Greece there is an almost total lack of special education after the primary school (6th grade). This is a descriptive study that aimed to examine social, academic and psychological characteristics of secondary school students with a history of special placement during primary school. It compared 86 students with a placement (group A) with their 1284 schoolmates with no such placement history (group 13) with respect to scores on School Adjustment Scale, Academic Motivation Self-Rating Inventory and Youth Self-Report. Group A presented more family social, academic and psychological problems such as: One-parent family, lower socioeconomic status, poor adjustment, low motivation and (especially for boys) high internalizing and externalizing scores. The high rates of failure and dropout of these students indicate that in Greece there is a need to set up appropriate services to help secondary school students with learning difficulties.

Participants were 84 preschoolers at risk for psychopathology. Reliability and concurrent validity are reported. The 30-min paradigm yielded reliable indexes of engaging and disruptive behavior. Adequate interrater reliability and stability were obtained with minimally trained observers. OPPUS scores were related in expected ways to independent observations of disruptive and engaging behavior during parent-child interactions. OPPUS scores were associated with parent-rated self-control and internalizing behaviors. OPPUS scores were associated with parent ratings of play skills for children with school experience and assertiveness for children without school experience. The OPPUS is a useful, brief method for assessing peer entry and play behaviors in preschoolers.

Through group problem-solving and interactive knowledge development activities, the MFGPI addressed the key components of social support, parent education, and parental empowerment. The structured group sessions used a professional/parent leadership model. Parents/primary caregivers were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions (intensive case management plus adjunctive MFGPI or "treatment as usual" intensive case management). Parent problem-solving skills, parental coping skills, perceived social support resources,and child behavior were measured at three points in time (baseline, 9 months, and 18 months). No statistically significant difference occurred by group condition for the key variables of social support versus problem-solving/coping measures; parents in both intervention conditions had significantly more individuals to help them out over time. Youth behavior in both conditions improved significantly over time as measured by the overall child behavior scores. Analysis of the time by intervention interaction suggested that parents in the group condition also reported significant improvements on child externalizing and internalizing behavior scores and several subscale behavior scores.

AB We explored the relationship between school-age children's emotional and behavioral symptoms and workforce participation of their family caregivers using structural equation modeling. Secondary analysis of data from the national evaluation of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program was performed with a subsample of 2,585 caregivers. Findings from structural equation modeling indicated that higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were significant predictors of more frequent school absences, less adequate childcare, and greater caregiver strain related to missing work. In turn, more adequate childcare and greater caregiver strain from missed work were associated with lower likelihood of workforce participation. Further research on labor force participation and increased family support is necessary to improve work-life integration for caregivers of children with emotional and behavioral disorders. Future investigations should examine caregiver employment as a standard family outcome.

AB Forty matched healthy Latino and non-Latino siblings (ages 8-14 years) of children with developmental and physical disabilities completed interviews and questionnaires assessing sibling knowledge of and adjustment to disability and sibling global psychological functioning. One-way analyses of variance revealed Latino siblings to have significantly less accurate information about the disability and more internalizing problems than non-Latino siblings. Sibling and parent wishes for the healthy sibling reflected cultural values. The results indicate that Latino siblings of children with chronic disabilities may be at risk for internalizing psychological problems. Future research regarding cultural factors affecting sibling adaptation to childhood disability is encouraged.

AB How do schemas about self-salience-the importance of the self versus the collective in social relations-affect mental health? We propose that self-salience shapes the likelihood of experiencing internalizing or externalizing problems. Schemas that privilege others over the self increase the risk of internalizing symptoms, including depressive symptoms and anxiety, whereas those that privilege the self over others predispose individuals to externalizing behaviors of antisocial behavior and substance abuse. Furthermore, we propose that these schemas contribute to the gender differences that exist in these problems. We test these predictions with data from adolescents, the stage at which these problems and the gender differences in them arise. Results show that self-salience underlies both internalizing and externalizing problems. In addition, schemas about self-salience help explain the gender differences found in mental health problems.

AB This article is a longitudinal investigation of the relationships between maternal victimization, maternal functioning, and children's behavior and development. Participants include 203 mother-child dyads from a low-income population recruited from pediatric primary care clinics. Data are collected when children are 4 and 8 years of age. Child outcomes are evaluated using maternal, teacher and child self-report and objective measures of cognitive and academic functioning. Maternal victimization history is associated with maternal depressive symptoms, low levels of maternal social support, child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and low levels of child socialization. Child behavior problems identified at age 4 are enduring and persist to age 8. The effects of maternal victimization history on both internalizing behavior problems and socialization are mediated by maternal depressive symptoms. The effects of maternal depressive symptoms on externalizing behavior problems, socialization, and anger are mediated by maternal social support. Clinical implications of findings are discussed.

AB Although childhood sexual abuse (CSA) appears to have an impact on personality, it does not affect all survivors the same way. The goal of this study was to identify common personality patterns in women with a history of CSA. A national sample of randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists described 74 adult female patients with a history of CSA and a comparison group of 74 without CSA using the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 (SWAP-200), a Q-sort procedure for assessing personality pathology. Q-factor analysis identified four personality constellations among abuse survivors: Internalizing Dysregulated, High Functioning Internalizing, Externalizing Dysregulated, and Dependent. The four groups differed on diagnostic, adaptive functioning, and developmental history variables, providing initial support for the validity of this classification. The data have potential methodological and treatment implications.

AB In the present longitudinal 3-wave study of 1274 adolescents and young adults, aged 12-24 at the 1st wave, it is examined whether youngsters from intact versus postdivorce families show long-term differences in internalizing and externalizing problems. Furthermore, possible differences in the development of this problem behavior between offspring from intact and postdivorce families are examined, i.e., possible differences in growth curves of internalizing and externalizing problems are investigated. Longitudinal multilevel analyses reveal long-term differences in internalizing and externalizing problems according to family structure. Adolescents and young adults growing up in postdivorce families display more internalizing and externalizing problem behavior than youngsters of intact families. The development of these 2 types of problem behavior does not differ by gender or family structure. That is, the shape of the growth curves of internalizing and externalizing problem behavior is similar for boys and girls and also for youngsters from intact and postdivorce families.

AB The first aim of this study was to examine the structure of externalizing and internalizing problem behavior during early adolescence. Our second aim was to determine the stability of these problems for boys and for girls over time. A total of 650, 13-14-year-olds filled out (an expanded version of) the Youth Self-Report [YSR; Manual for the Youth Self-Report and 1991 Profile. Department of Psychiatry, University of Vermont, Burlington] 2 times with a 1-year interval. By using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) to test a series of competing models, a hierarchical model provided the best representation of the structure of problem behavior at both Time 1 and Time 2: externalizing and internalizing problem behavior represent distinct aspects but the model also demonstrates the existence of comorbidity at a higher level. This model appeared to be stable over time for both boys and girls. The relative stability of problem behavior was found to be high for boys and girls. Absolute stability for both externalizing and internalizing problems appeared to be higher for boys scoring in the lower range of problem behavior.

The changes in the behavioral and emotional problems of children and adolescents placed in children's homes were studied in the same area using the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire at three different time points ( 1993, 1996 and 1999), and the Children's Global Assessment Scale in 1996 and 1999. Internalizing symptoms of the children increased significantly. The level of psychosocial problems among boys was already high at the first rating in 1993, and it remained high during the whole study period. Behavioral and emotional problems of the girls placed in children's homes increased significantly, being at the same level as the boys' by the end of the study period.

AB To investigate the reliability and validity of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), 28 youth aged 6 to 17 years with Tourette's syndrome (TS) participated in the study. Data included clinician reports of tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) severity, parent reports of tics, internalizing and externalizing problems, and child reports of depression and anxiety. All children participated in a 2nd YGTSS administration by the same rater 48 days later. Good internal consistency and stability were found for the YGTSS scores. YGTSS scores demonstrated strong correlations with parent-rated tic severity (r = .58-68). YGTSS scores were not significantly related to measures of clinician ratings of OCD severity (r = .01-15), parent ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior (r = -.07-20), and child ratings of depression (r = .02-26) and anxiety (r = -.06-28). Findings suggest that the YGTSS is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of pediatric TS.

AB Background. Although parents with psychiatric disorders are likely to have children with psychiatric problems, the nature of disorder risk to offspring of antisocial parents has received limited attention.
   Method. We examined the prevalence of common externalizing and internalizing disorders in the pre-adolescent and late adolescent offspring of antisocial parents. Lifetime diagnoses for a sample of 11-year-old twins (958 males, 1042 females) and a sample of 17-year-old twins (13 32 males, 1434 females), as well as their parents, were obtained through in-person interviews. Odds ratios were calculated for the effect of the parent's diagnosis on the child's diagnosis, controlling for the effect of the co-parent's diagnosis.
   Results. We found that parental antisociality places the child at increased risk for developing a range of externalizing and internalizing disorders. This increase is evident by pre-adolescence and extends to a wide range of disorders by late adolescence. Each parent has an effect net any effects of the co-parent.
   Conclusions. Antisocial parents have children who have an increased likelihood of developing a broad range of psychiatric disorders.

TI Internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence: general and

AB Background. We investigated the links between familial loading, preadolescent temperament, and internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence, hereby distinguishing effects on maladjustment in general versus dimension-specific effects on either internalizing or externalizing problems.
   Method. In a population-based sample of 2230 preadolescents (10-11 years) familial loading (parental lifetime psychopathology) and offspring temperament were assessed at baseline by parent report, and offspring psychopathology at 2.5-years follow-up by self-report, teacher report and parent report. We used purified measures of temperament and psychopathology and partialled out shared variance between internalizing and externalizing problems.
   Results. Familial loading of internalizing psychopathology predicted offspring internalizing but not externalizing problems, whereas familial loading of externalizing psychopathology predicted offspring externalizing but not internalizing problems. Both familial loadings were associated with Frustration, low Effortful Control, and Fear. Frustration acted as a general risk factor predicting severity of maladjustment; low Effortful Control and Fear acted as dimension-specific risk factors that predicted a particular type of psychopathology; whereas Shyness, High-Intensity Pleasure, and Affiliation acted as direction markers that steered the conditional probability of internalizing versus externalizing problems, in the event of maladjustment. Temperament traits mediated one-third of the association between familial loading and psychopathology. Findings were robust across different composite measures of psychopathology, and applied to girls as well as boys.
   Conclusions. With regard to familial loading and temperament, it is important to distinguish general risk factors (Frustration) from dimension-specific risk factors (familial loadings, Effortful Control, Fear), and direction markers that act as pathoplastic factors (Shyness, High-Intensity Pleasure, Affiliation) from both types of risk factors. About one-third of familial loading effects on psychopathology in early adolescence are mediated by temperament.

AB Study Objective: To determine the effects of experimental restriction of sleep opportunity on teacher ratings of academic performance and behavior in healthy normal children.
   Design: Home-based, within-subjects design in which participants followed 3 week-long sleep schedules-Baseline (self-selected), Optimized, and Restricted-while attending school, with order of conditions counterbalanced (Optimized and Restricted).
   Participants: Seventy-four children (39 boys; aged 6 to 12 years, mean 10) screened for medical and psychological health.
   Measurements and Results: Teachers masked to assigned hours of sleep completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires at the end of each study condition. Questionnaire items were selected from several published measures. Summary scores included Academic Problems, Hyperactive-Impulsive Behaviors, Internalizing, Oppositional-Aggressive, Sleepiness, Total Attention Problems, and Mean Severity of Attention Problems. Main effects of sleep condition were found for Academic Problems, Sleepiness, Total Attention Problems, and Mean Severity of Attention Problems. Restricting sleep increased ratings of Academic Problems (medium effect) relative to both Baseline (P <.01, eta(2)(p) =.11) and Optimized (P <.05, eta(2)(p) =.10) conditions and increased the Wan Severity of Attention Problems (medium effect) relative to Baseline (P <.01, eta(2)(p) =.12).
   Conclusions: These findings provide experimental support for widely held beliefs about the importance of sufficient time-in-bed for academic functioning in children. Reducing sleep opportunity had a direct effect on academic performance, as rated by teachers, even among healthy students with no history of behavioral problems or academic difficulty, Findings also support insufficient sleep as a direct source of variability in the manifestation of attention problems but not hyperactivity.

AB Background With the increasing number of immigrants worldwide, it is essential to have insight into the factors associated with internalizing problems in immigrant youth. However, little research on this subject has been conducted. The aim of the current study is to contribute to the knowledge in this field. Methods Data were obtained from the general population of 11- to 18-year-old Moroccan immigrant adolescents in the Netherlands. Using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Youth Self-Report (YSR), and Teacher's Report Form (TRF), 415 parent, 376 self-, and 238 teacher reports were available for analysis. Results The data showed relations between internalizing problems and several child (externalizing and chronic health problems), proximal family (paternal and maternal support and parent-child conflict), contextual family (conflicts between parents about parenting and total number of life-events), school/peer (being bored), and migration variables (adolescent's perceived discrimination). Moreover, a modest relation was found between internalizing problems and parental psychopathology. Few associations occurred with the global family factor (e.g., family educational level). Several relations between the predictors and YSR internalizing proved to be gender-specific. Conclusions Our results suggested that the child, school/peer, and proximal family factors are the most important in predicting the development of internalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant adolescents. The impact of the migration factor was small.

AB Beliefs about treatment of mental health problems are a critical area for examination among immigrant and refugee populations. Data on treatment of child problems have been conspicuously absent from the literature. This study examines explanatory models of treatment among 40 second-generation Cambodian children aged 8-18 and their parents in the US. Comparisons of perceptions of intervention for an externalizing problem (gang-related behavior) and an internalizing problem (depression) are made in a group of children who have received mental health services, their parents, and a matched community sample. A significant interaction between respondent and group membership was present in the perception that these problems could be helped, and contrary to past findings among Asian Americans, both children and parents generally endorsed the use of mental health services. Data about actual experiences with mental health services are used to help explain the findings and suggest implications for treatment of Cambodian-American youth. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the wake of welfare reform, thousands of low-income single mothers have transitioned into the labor market. In this article, the authors examine how the work conditions of mothers leaving welfare for employment are associated with the emotional well-being of 372 children ages 5 to 15 years. The authors examine the cumulative incidence, over a 5-year period, of maternal non-family-friendly work conditions, including long work hours, erratic work schedules, nonday shifts, and lengthy commute times, in association with children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and levels of positive behavior. The authors found that mothers' lengthy commute times are associated with higher levels of internalizing problem behaviors and lower levels of positive behaviors.

AB The purpose of this paper was to examine explanatory mechanisms of differences in children's internalizing problems between ethnic minority (i.e., Indian) and ethnic majority (i.e., English) children living in Britain. Fifty-nine English children (31 girls) and 66 Indian children (30 girls), and their parents constituted the sample of this study. Both mothers and fathers reported on the children's internalizing problems, and provided reports of their own parenting style and social support. Analysis showed that maternal positivity, paternal negativity, and both parents' reports of social support mediated the link between ethnicity and internalizing problems. Furthermore, according to the best-fitting structural equation model, ethnicity did not have a direct influence on children's internalizing problems, nor on parental style. Ethnicity instead predicted parental reports of social support. Social support, in turn, contributed to children's internalizing problems directly as well as indirectly through parenting style. Finally, although parenting style significantly influenced children's internalizing problems, social support was a much stronger contributor. The role of the distal as well as the proximal environments on children's adjustment is discussed.

AB Parental divorce is associated with a number of emotional and behavioral problems in young-adult offspring, but theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that the relation may be partially or fully accounted for by passive gene-environment correlation or environmental selection characteristics. The current study used the Children of Twins Design to explore whether shared environmental or genetic factors confound the relationship between parental marital instability and measures of psychopathology. Comparisons of the offspring of adult twins in Australia on 3 factors of abnormal behavior, including drug and alcohol, behavioral, and internalizing problems, suggest that environmental influences associated with divorce account for the higher rates of psychopathology. The results are consistent with a causal connection between marital instability and psychopathology in young-adult offspring.

AB Children's vagal tone was examined as a vulnerability factor in the longitudinal relation between mothers' (MPD) and fathers' (FPD) problem drinking and children's adjustment. At T1, MPD and FPD were examined, and children's vagal tone was assessed. Two years following initial participation, child adjustment problems were evaluated. A lower level of vagal tone was a vulnerability factor for internalizing problems associated with MPD and FPD and for externalizing difficulties associated with MPD. In the context of a higher level of MPD or FPD, a lower level of vagal tone was a vulnerability factor for increases in externalizing problems over time. Results are supportive of the importance of biopsychosocial perspectives in which child characteristics interact with family risk to predict psychopathology.

AB Background: Children's emotional responses and physiological reactivity to conflict were examined as mediators and moderators in the associations between exposure to parental marital conflict and child adjustment and cognitive problems. Method: One hundred and eighty elementary school children participated. In response to a simulated argument, children's skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR) was examined, and their emotional responses (reported and observed anger, sadness, and fear) were assessed. Results: A higher level of SCLR was a robust risk factor for various child outcomes, mediated boys' internalizing difficulties in the marital conflict-child functioning link, and functioned as a vulnerability factor for girls' externalizing, internalizing, and cognitive problems. Increased anger (for boys) and sadness (for girls) exacerbated adjustment difficulties related to marital conflict. Conclusion: Findings illustrate the aggregation of risk in relation to child and family characteristics.

AB This study examines the natural course of trauma-specific symptoms 6 months after disclosure. Furthermore, this study investigates whether severity and type of abuse (intrafamilial or extrafamilial sexual abuse), negative appraisals, coping strategies, and crisis support measured at time of disclosure can be predictive of trauma symptoms 6 months later Sixty-five sexually abused Flemish adolescents are reassessed 6 months after disclosure. Information from the participants is obtained through self-report questionnaires. Forty-six percent of the adolescents report clinically significant trauma symptoms. Although internalizing symptoms significantly decreases after 6 months, externalizing symptoms persist. Type or severity of the abuse does not account for differences in symptomatology. Two predictors of ongoing trauma symptomatology are identified: postdisclosure trauma symptomatology and a lack of initial crisis support. Information on the victims' postdisclosure symptomatology as well as information on the initial received social support is critical in understanding which abused adolescents are most at risk for poor outcomes in the long term.

AB Objective. To study the behavior of children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) before and after adenotonsillectomy using a standardized behavioral rating scale completed by caregivers. Design and Setting: Prospective study of children with OSAS at the University of New Mexico Children's Hospital, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Methods: Children between 2.5 and 18 years of age were included in the study and underwent adenotonsillectomy if the results of polysomnography showed an obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 or greater. Caregivers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) before surgery and a second time within 6 months of surgery. Pre- and postoperative BASC t scores were compared using a paired t test. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the contributions of several covariants to these change scores. Results: The study population included 52 children. The mean age was 7.1 (range 2.5-14.9) years, and the mean AHI was 16.2 (range 5.0-88.0). Preoperative mean BASC t scores for all behavioral scales and composites were greater than 50. The behavioral scales that showed significant improvement after adenotonsillectomy were aggression, atypicality, depression, hyperactivity, and somatization (p <= .001). Age, ethnicity, parental education, parental income, and AHI were not correlated with changes in BASC scores. Conclusions: A high proportion of children with OSAS have externalizing (hyperactivity and aggression) and internalizing (anxiety, depression, and somatization) behavioral problems. These problems improve significantly after adenotonsillectomy. The improvement is dramatic regardless of sex, age, ethnicity, parental education, parental income, or the relative severity of OSAS.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationship of corporal punishment with children's behavior problems while accounting for neighborhood context and while using stronger statistical methods than previous literature in this area, and to examine whether different levels of corporal punishment have different effects in different neighborhood contexts.
   Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
   Setting: General community.
   Participants: 1943 mother-child pairs from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
   Main Outcome Measure: Internalizing and externalizing behavior problem scales of the Behavior Problems Index.
   Results and Conclusions: Parental use of corporal punishment was associated with a 0.71 increase (P < .05) in children's externalizing behavior problems even when several parenting behaviors, neighborhood quality, and all time-invariant variables were accounted for. The association of corporal punishment and children's externalizing behavior problems was not dependent on neighborhood context. The research found no discernible relationship between corporal punishment and internalizing behavior problems.

AB Childhood temperament and family environment have been shown to predict internalizing and externalizing behavior; however, less is known about how temperament and family environment interact to predict changes in problem behavior. We conducted latent growth curve modeling on a sample assessed at ages 5, 7, 10, 14, and 17 (N = 337). Externalizing behavior decreased over time for both sexes, and internalizing behavior increased over time for girls only. Two childhood variables (fear/shyness and maternal depression) predicted boys' and girls' age-17 internalizing behavior, harsh discipline uniquely predicted boys' age-17 internalizing behavior, and maternal depression and lower family income uniquely predicted increases in girls' internalizing behavior. For externalizing behavior, an array of temperament, family environment, and Temperament x Family Environment variables predicted age-17 behavior for both sexes. Sex differences were present in the prediction of externalizing slopes, with maternal depression predicting increases in boys' externalizing behavior only when impulsivity was low, and harsh discipline predicting increases in girls' externalizing behavior only when impulsivity was high or when fear/shyness was low.

AB Objective: of the study was to examine the extent to which cognitive emotion regulation strategies were 'common determinants' of Internalizing and Externalizing problems and/or 'specific determinants' distinguishing one problem category from the other.
   Method:The sample comprised 271 12- to 18-year-old secondary school students. Internalizing and Externalizing problems were measured by the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies were measured by the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), in a cross-sectional design.
   Results: First, adolescents with Internalizing problems, Externalizing problems, comorbid Internalizing and Externalizing problems and a control group were compared on their specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that adolescents with Internalizing problems (both pure and comorbid) scored significantly higher on the cognitive emotion regulation strategies of self-blame and rumination than those with Externalizing (pure) problems or the control group.
   Unique relationships between the separate cognitive strategies and Internalizing and Externalizing problems were tested by means of Multiple Regression Analyses. Specific relationships were found between Internalizing problems and self-blame, rumination and positive reappraisal and between Externalizing problems and positive refocusing. No 'common' correlates were found.
   Conclusions: Theoretical models designed for the prediction of Internalizing problems might not simply be used for the prediction of Externalizing problems. Different (cognitive) intervention strategies should be used for adolescents with Internalizing problems and Externalizing problems.

Parents of 404 children ranging from 6 to 17 years of age and diagnosed with either insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or sickle cell disease (SCD) completed the PSC while waiting for a routine medical appointment. The measure's internal consistency was found to be high, Cronbach's alpha = .89, and test-retest reliability across 4 months was observed to be acceptable, r = .77. A principal components analysis with an oblique (promax) rotation yielded a four-factor solution with factors that included items representative of internalizing, externalizing, attention, and chronic illness-related problems, respectively. Cronbach alpha estimates ranged from .78 to .83 for the first three factors but was lower for the chronic illness-related problems factor (Cronbach's alpha = .60). A three-factor solution and reliability estimates were recomputed without the chronic illness items that yielded the same reliability estimates for each of the three factors and for the full scale. The three-factor solution was also found to be similar to a published factor structure obtained with a primary care sample, r(c) = .90-.91. The findings lend support to extending the PSC's clinical utility to tertiary care pediatric settings. Further research is recommended with a broader range of chronic illness groups to increase generalizability.

AB Object. The authors set out to evaluate the quality of life (QOL), social-emotional functioning, and behavioral functioning of children treated surgically for craniopharyngiomas.
   Methods. Twelve girls and 17 boys with a mean age at diagnosis of 8 +/- 3.8 years were surgically treated between 1985 and 1998 at the New York University Medical Center. After a mean follow-up period of 6.8 +/- 3.5 years, these 29 patients were administered either the 36-item Short Form Health Survey version 2 or the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form to assess QOL, as well as the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist or Young Adult Checklist to measure social-emotional and behavioral functioning. Patients older than 19 years of age and parents of patients younger than 19 years of age reported low average overall physical QOL, with overall psychosocial QOL in the average range. Behavioral difficulties were noted, including internalizing, attention, somatic, and social difficulties. Further analyses indicated that retrochiasmatic tumor location, recurrence, and additional surgery were associated with poorer outcomes. In contrast, hydrocephalus, tumor size, and sex were not prognostic variables, and patients significantly improved as postoperative time increased.
   Conclusions. Attention toward late effects arising after the treatment of pediatric craniopharyngioma, including decreased postoperative physical health and behavioral functioning, is warranted. Future approaches to treatment should consider the documented effects of either gross-total resection or limited surgery followed by cranial irradiation on QOL, with specific evaluation for those with retrochiasmatic tumors, a recurrent tumor, or the need for additional surgery. Psychosocial QOL and social-emotional functioning should be maintained through ongoing counseling and education.

AB Twenty peer-reviewed journal articles that described outcomes of interventions that took place in school settings and either focused on anger or included anger as a dependent variable were meta-analyzed. No differences in outcomes were found for group comparisons by school setting, special education status, entrance criteria, or treatment agents. Although 60% of articles discussed its importance, only two articles actually measured treatment integrity. Across outcomes, the weighted mean effect size of the interventions post treatment was determined to be .31. The largest effects were found for anger and extemalizing behaviors, internalizing, and social skills, with mean effect sizes of .54, .43, and .34 respectively. Weighted mean effect sizes for follow-up studies were also calculated, but given the small number of studies that reported follow-up effects, those must be interpreted with caution, The results of this meta-analysis are discussed as they relate to research, practice, and intervention with children.

AB Objective: To summarize the past 10 years of published research concerning the 2% of American children younger than 18 years old who are adoptees. Method: Review recent literature on developmental influences, placement outcome, psychopathology, and treatment. Results: Adoption carries developmental opportunities and risks. Many acloptees have remarkably good outcomes, but some subgroups have difficulties. Traditional infant, international, and transracial adoptions may complicate adoptees' identity formation. Those placed after infancy may have developmental delays, attachment disturbances, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Useful interventions include preventive counseling to foster attachment, postadoption supports, focused groups for parents and adoptees, and psychotherapy. Conclusions: Variables specific to adoption affect an adopted child's developmental trajectory. Externalizing, internalizing, attachment, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms may arise. Child and adolescent psychiatrists can assist both adoptive parents and children.

AB The diagnostic criteria for the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been changing according to international classifications. It is currently included in the ICD-10 as an hyperkinetic disorder and in the DSM-IV as a disorder having its onset during childhood and adolescence. The reported prevalence for ADHD is between 3% and 6%; up to 60% of the patients remain symptomatic through adolescence and adulthood. Population-based surveys of physicians who treat children and adolescents reveal that the rate and the proportion of office visits associated with ADHD are high and have increased over the past decade. This fact points to the need of elaborating clinical guidelines for the treatment of this disorder.
   Evidence from controlled clinical trials confirms the superiority of medication management for ADHD over behavioral therapy and the combination of medication and behavioral treatment. Stimulants are the most studied drugs for ADHD and constitute the first treatment of choice. Methylphenidate (MPH) is the only stimulant available in Mexico. Its mechanism of action is based on the blocking of the dopamine reuptake, which increases the availability of this neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Based on the dopaminergic theories of ADHD, dopamine genes have been the initial candidates for molecular studies regarding response to MPH. Variations of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) and the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) have been related with the response to MPH. The short half life of this drug (less than three hours) supports the shift from once-a-day to twice-aday or thrice-a-day dosing. The Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS) of MPH allows to maintain therapeutic plasmatic doses with once-a-day dose. Its efficacy and tolerability have been shown in clinical trials.
   Regarding the long-term effects of MPH, this drug has demonstrated efficacy in a two-year follow-up controlled study. In addition, animal models have shown that the chronic exposure to MPH during developmental periods produces changes in the function of brain dopaminergic cells, as well as changes in behavior. The association between MPH and substance abuse has also been explored. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodinamic differences between MPH and cocaine, which also acts by blocking the dopamine transporter, were examined: When administered intravenously MPH, like cocaine, has a reinforcing effects at doses that exceed a 60% dopamine transporter blockade threshold. When administered orally at clinical doses, the pharmacological effects of MPH also exceed this threshold, but reinforcing effects rarely occur. So, the pharmacokinetic properties of MPH in brain differ for oral and intravenous routes of administration, suggesting that the oral administration of MPH mimics the tonic dopamine cell firing, which may be a critical factor associated with clinical effects. In addition, therapeutic doses of MPH do not act at the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure highly associated with reinforcing. These data suggest that oral administration of MPH does not lead to abuse. Follow-up studies have also shown that stimulant therapy is not associated with increased risk of substance abuse.
   Since 30% of the patients do not respond to stimulant treatment, the efficacy and safety of other drugs have been evaluated. Among them, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are considered a good choice for the management of ADHD and conduct disorders. Their half life is longer than that of MPH, which allows a once-a-day or twice-a-day dosing. It has also been described that TCAs are effective for the treatment of comorbid tics. The main disadvantage of these drugs is their effect on cardiac conduction, which has been associated with sudden death.
   Bupropion is another antidepressant having an effect on dopamine activity. It has shown efficacy for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults, particularly in patients with nicotine dependence, patients with comorbid conduct disorder, or depression. Bupropion is available in a extended-release, once-daily formulation (XL). The main side effects of this antidepressant are the increased risk of seizure development, rash and mild elevation of blood pressure. This drug is not recommended for the treatment of patients with comorbid eating disorders.
   Venlafaxine (a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and reboxetine (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are recently introduced antidepressants which have shown efficacy in open label trials on patients with and without comorbid depressive disorder.
   Atomoxetine is another non-stimulant medication; its main mechanism of action is the inhibition or the reuptake of norepinephrine. Several clinical trials have shown its efficacy for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents and adults. This drug can also be administered in a single dose; in addition, it has a low potential for cardiotoxicity and a reduction of tic frequency and severity has been reported with its use. It is also recommended for the ADHD comorbid with anxiety or depression. Nausea and decreased appetite are the most common side effects of atomoxetine.
   Modafinil is another non-stimulant drug which was initially described for the treatment of narcolepsy This drug increases the dopamine and norepinephrine activity through its direct effect on glutamate and GABA, among other neuromodulators.
   Some clinical trials have shown its superiority over placebo on ADHD symptoms. The main side effects of modafinil are gastrointestinal distress and insomnia.
   Clonidine and risperidone are drugs considered as second treatment of choice or adjunctive treatments for patients with comorbidity.
   Although medication is the first treatment of choice, patients often get benefits from psychosocial interventions, particularly parent training in contingency management methods and classroom applications of contingency management techniques. The value of these measurements lies in the temporary reduction of symptom levels and/or in the reduction of related behavioral and emotional difficulties, such as defiance and conduct problems, depression, low self-esteem, or academic underachievement.
   Parents' training focus on general contingency management tactics, such as contingent application of reinforcement or punishment following appropriate /inappropriate behaviors. Reinforcement procedures have typically relied on praise or tokens, while punishment methods have usually been the loss of tokens or time-out from reinforcement. The classroom management include a continuous communication with teachers, in order to maintain them informed about the illness and its treatment, as well as training on contingency management tactics.
   The aforementioned information was used in the elaboration of clinical guidelines for the treatment of youngsters with ADHD, either alone or comorbid with internalizing or externalizing disorders. Another guideline for the management of preschool children with ADHD is included. Psychoeducation follows the assessment of the children in each case. The pharmacological treatment recommendations give priority to monotherapy. Stimulants are the first treatment of choice in each guideline. The use of non-stimulant medications as second choice will depend on the,age and comorbidity of patients.

AB Objectives: Currently there is a lack of screening instruments suitable for use by preschool and kindergarten teachers to assess behavioural and emotional problems in preschool children The C-TRF/1 1/2-5 (Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for the ages 1 1/2-5) is a screening instrument designed by Achenbach to assess behavioural and emotional problems in this age group. In a joint project of the Fachhochschule Dortmund and the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Ulm, in cooperation with the Youth Welfare Office Dortmund, the C-TRF/1 1/2-5 was used to assess the prevalence of psychological disturbance among kindergarten children.
   Methods: 1,050 children aged 3-6 years from 46 kindergartens from the, greater Dortmund urban area were rated by their caregivers on the basis of the German version of the C-TRF/1 1/2-5.
   Results: The reliability of C-TRF/1 1/2-5 proved to be good-to-sufficient, with internal consistencies ranging from .94 to .58. The number of behavioural and emotional problems, which is very close to that found among American preschool children, decreases with age and more strongly so among girls. The externalizing problems among boys do not decrease much, but remain quite stable from age 3 to age 6. The prevalence of internalizing problems among preschool boys and girls does not differ.
   Conclusions: The German version of the C-TRF/1 1/2-5 proved to be an instrument sufficiently reliable for screening behavioural and emotional problems in preschool children. The prevalence of these psychological problems among German and American children is very similar.

AB Community violence is recognized a significant public health problem. However, only a paucity of research has examined risk factors for community violence exposure across domains relevant to adolescents or using longitudinal data. This study examined youth aggressive behavior in relation to community violence exposure among a community epidemiologically defined sample of 582 (45% female) urban adolescents. Internalizing behaviors, deviant peer affiliation, and parental monitoring were examined as moderators of the association between aggressive behavior and exposure to community violence. For males with aggressive behavior problems and deviant peer affiliation or low parental monitoring, co-occurring anxiety symptoms protected against subsequent witnessing community violence. In contrast, males with aggressive behavior problems and co-occurring depressive symptoms were at increased risk for witnessing community violence. Implications of the findings for preventive interventions and future research are discussed.

The results show significant changes in the emotional competences and prosocial developments of children aged 6-9 years. Children who participated in the "Faustlos" lessons showed significantly reduced anxiety and internalizing behaviors compared with the control group. The parents' ratings of their children's behavior (according to the Child Behavior Checklist) provided clear evidence of improved social behavior outside the school environment.

AB Four years of longitudinal data from 2,153 families with a 5th- or 6th-grade preadolescent participating in a family-focused pediatric primary-care-based prevention program were used to examine whether prevention effects were moderated by positive parenting and/or adolescent gender. Alcohol and tobacco use, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems were examined. Although findings revealed no main effect of the prevention program, positive parenting and adolescent gender were moderators of internalizing problems and adolescent gender was a moderator of externalizing problems. Clinical implications and future directions for research are discussed.

AB Objective: To define and differentiate psychological and adjustment problems due to brain injury or brain tumour in children and adolescents.
   Methods: Two groups of patients with acquired brain lesions (24 post-traumatic patients and 22 brain tumour survivors), ranging in age between 8-15 years, received a psychological evaluation, including the Child Behaviour Checklist for Ages 4-18 (CBCL) and the Vineland Behaviour Adaptive Scales (VABS).
   Results: Both groups showed psychological and social adjustment problems. Post-traumatic patients were more impaired than brain tumour survivors. Social adjustment problems were associated to externalizing problems in post-traumatic patients and internalizing problems in brain tumour surviving patients.
   Conclusions: These differences in psychological and behavioural disorders between the two groups must necessarily be considered when developing psychological treatment, rehabilitation plan and social re-entry.

ID SUBSTANCE USE; POPULATION; HISTORY
AB Objectives: To examine the relationship between sexual abuse and academic achievement in an adolescent inpatient psychiatric population. Individual factors expected to influence this relationship were measured to explore the way they each interacted with sexual abuse and its relationship to academic achievement.
   Method: Eighty-one adolescent psychiatric inpatients participated in the study (aged 12-18 years: M=16.0). Participants were administered tests of academic achievement (dependent variable) and intelligence, and completed a number of self-report measures of their experience of different types of maltreatment, their perception of the parenting they received, socio-economic status, substance abuse, and psychopathology.
   Results: Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that intelligence was the main predictor of academic achievement (uniquely explaining 26% of the variance). A number of interaction effects were also significant indicating that intelligence, substance abuse, internalizing behavior problems, externalizing behavior problems all influenced the relationship between sexual abuse and academic achievement.
   Discussion: Examining the impact of sexual abuse is complex because it is typically an experience embedded in a range of other risk factors, such as poverty, family dysfunction, and other types of maltreatment. This study demonstrated coexistence between sexual abuse and a number of other variables, including other maltreatment types and parental overprotection, underscoring the requirement for complex models of research that more accurately reflect the experience of abused children.

AB Evidence indicates that peer victimization is predictive of later maladjustment, but the mechanisms by which harassment impairs development have yet to be identified. The objectives of this study were (a) to discern normative trends in peer victimization experiences and self- and peer perceptions during preadolescence and (b) to investigate associations between individual differences in these trajectories and changes in psychosocial adjustment. A sample of 381 children (196 girls; 185 boys) was followed longitudinally between the ages of 9 and 11 years. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that, although children's self-appraisals became increasingly positive during preadolescence, their appraisals of peers became more negative. Moreover, analyses supported the contention that self- and peer beliefs act as mechanisms through which victimization is related to psychological dysfunction.

AB The relation between cognitive and motor performance was studied in a sample of 378 children aged 5-6. Half of these children had no behavior problems; the others were selected for externalizing (38%) or internalizing problems (12%). Quantitative and qualitative aspects of motor performance were related to several aspects of cognition, after controlling for the influence of attention. No relation between global aspects of cognitive and motor performance was found. Specific positive relations were found between both aspects of motor performance, visual motor integration and working memory, and between quantitative aspects of motor performance and fluency. These findings reveal interesting parallels between normal cognitive and motor development in 5- to 6-year-old children that cannot be ascribed to attention processes.

AB Suicide is most often associated with internalizing disorders such as depression; however, recent evidence suggests that externalizing psychopathology (substance dependence disorders, antisocial personality disorder) may have an independent relationship with suicidal behavior. The aim in the present study was to examine the relationship between lifetime suicide attempts and lifetime externalizing psychopathology in the US National Comorbidity Survey data set (n = 5877). First, hierarchical regression was performed to explore the associations between internalizing and externalizing disorders and suicide attempts. Externalizing psychopathology was significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts (adjusted odds ratio = 3.47; P <.001) and significantly improved the model beyond that including only the sociodemographic variables and internalizing psychopathology (chi(2) difference = 73.12; df = 1; P <.001). A second logistic regression was used to investigate the association between specific patterns of psychopathology and suicidality. Externalizing disorders were significantly associated with suicide attempts even in the absence of internalizing disorders (adjusted odds ratio = 5.98; 95% confidence interval = 3.07-11.67; P <.001). These findings add to the growing literature that suggests that externalizing psychopathology is an important psychiatric correlate of suicidal behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a broad pattern of impulsivity and suicidality. BPD usually begins in adolescence; the full clinical picture of the disorder is associated with developmental increases in impulsivity. However, BPD also has childhood precursors. The developmental pathways are similar to those found in other impulsive spectrum disorders, but children who later develop BPD probably have both externalizing. and internalizing symptoms. Research in this area has made use of retrospective data from adults, prospective data from community studies, follow-up studies from children at risk. as well as research on '' borderline pathology of childhood '' (a condition with symptoms similar to adult BPD). Existing evidence suggests that both temperamental and environmental risk factors play a role in the development of the behavioral patterns associated with the disorder. These pathways also help account for the life course and outcome of BPD in adulthood.

AB Although parasuicidal behavior in adolescence is poorly understood, evidence suggests that it may be a developmental precursor of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Current theories of both parasuicide and BPD suggest that emotion dysregulation is the primary precipitant of self-injury, which serves to dampen overwhelmingly negative affect. To date, however, no studies have assessed endophenotypic markers of emotional responding among parasuicidal adolescents. In the present study, we compare parasuicidal adolescent girls (n = 23) with age-matched controls (n = 23) on both psychological and physiological measures of emotion regulation and psychopathology. Adolescents, parents, and teachers completed questionnaires assessing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, substance use, trait affectivity, and histories of parasuicide. Psychophysiological measures including electrodermal responding (EDR), respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP) were collected at baseline, during negative mood induction, and during recovery. Compared with controls, parasuicidal adolescents exhibited reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at baseline, greater RSA reactivity during negative mood induction, and attenuated peripheral serotonin levels. No between-group differences on measures of PEP or EDR were found. These results lend further support to theories of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity in parasuicidal teenage girls.

AB A developmental cascade model linking competence and symptoms was tested in a study of a normative, urban school sample of 205 children (initially 8 to 12 years old). Internalizing and externalizing symptoms and academic competence were assessed by multiple methods at the study outset and after 7, 10, and 20 years. A series of nested cascade models was tested through structural equation modeling. The final model indicated 2 hypothesized cascade effects: Externalizing problems evident in childhood appeared to undermine academic competence by adolescence, which subsequently showed a negative effect on internalizing problems in young adulthood. A significant exploratory effect was consistent with internalizing symptoms containing or lowering the net risk for externalizing problems under some conditions. These 3 cascade effects did not differ by gender and were not attributable to effects of IQ, parenting quality, or socioeconomic differences. Implications are discussed for developmental models of cascades, progressions, and preventive interventions.

AB OBJECTIVE- Comorbid psychiatric disorders have been associated with poorer disease outcomes in diabetic youth. Less is known, however, about the relationship between psychiatric disorders and repeat hospitalizations for youth with diabetes.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pediatric Health Information System, which included detailed discharge data from 37 noncompeting children's hospitals in the U.S. Using logistic regression, we examined whether the presence of coded diagnoses for internalizing or externalizing disorders at an index hospitalization for diabetes was associated with increased risk for rehospitalization during follow-up (duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 24 months). The analysis was stratified by age-groups, and we controlled for potential confounders including sex, age, race/ethnicity, type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, Medicaid status, intensive care unit utilization, length of stay during index admission, and duration of follow-up.
   RESULTS- Among adolescents aged 13-18, internalizing disorders were associated with significantly increased odds of rehospitalization (odds ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.27-2.52]); the point estimate for externalizing disorders was similar, but the finding was not statistically significant at the a = 0.05 level (1.74 [0.96-3.15]). No significant association between psychiatric diagnoses and odds of repeat hospitalization was observed in diabetic children aged 5-12 years.
   CONCLUSIONS- Internalizing disorders are associated with increases in repeat hospitalizations for diabetes among adolescents. Future research is needed to explore the reasons for this finding, such as degree to which treatment nonadherence mediates this relationship and whether appropriate treatment of internalizing disorders results in improved diabetes outcomes and decreased readmissions.

AB Recently there has been a growing interest and research regarding the relationship among personality and psychopathologies in children, with a main focus in the area of behavioral and emotional problems, drugs use, etc. However, there is a lack of instruments of proper measurement in spite that those are not adapted to our culture and environment. This problem is also aggravated due to imprecision in diagnostic definitions. Simultaneously, it has been observed an increased demand of attention and counseling for conduct problems and/or conduct disturbances in children. That is why, ex post facto study was developed in order to know the internalized and exteriorized conduct problems in children in the fifth and sixth grade of elementary school in Mexico city (M=11 years of age) A non probabilistic sample of 671 children (357 boys and 314 girls) answered the Achenbach and Rescorla adapted and reviewed questionary for Mexican population. The results showed differences among boys and girls. Boys showed more externalizing problems, and girls had more internalizing, somatic and anxiety conduct problems.

AB Background: This study aimed to identify personality features characterizing adolescent girls and boys with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and to see whether meaningful patterns of heterogeneity exist among adolescents diagnosed with the disorder. Methods: Two hundred and ninety-four randomly selected doctoral-level clinicians described adolescent patients using Axis II rating scales and the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure-200 for Adolescents (SWAP-200-A). We used the SWAP-200-A to provide empirically derived descriptions of female and male adolescents meeting DSM-IV criteria for BPD (who differed substantially in their profiles), and used Q-factor analysis to identify naturally occurring groupings of female patients based on shared personality features. Results: The symptoms and phenomenology of adolescent girls with BPD are similar to those of adults. Adolescent boys meeting BPD criteria have a more aggressive, disruptive, antisocial presentation. Although Ns did not permit further analysis of the data on adolescent boys, Q-analysis isolated four clinically coherent subgroups of girls with BPD: high-functioning internalizing, histrionic, depressive internalizing, and angry externalizing. Conclusions: BPD in female adolescents resembles DSM-IV BPD as defined for adults. The operating characteristics of the DSM-IV criteria for adolescent boys require further investigation. Empirically derived subgroups are similar to those identified in recent research with adult females. Differences across subgroups on internalizing and externalizing Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scales provide preliminary data on the validity of subgroups and raise questions about the place of BPD among internalizing and externalizing spectrum disorders.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY

DT Article
ID COMPETENCE; BEHAVIOR
AB This study investigated maternal emotion socialization in physically maltreating and nonmaltreating mother-child dyads (N = 63 dyads) to examine the relation between maternal support in response to children's emotional displays and children's psychological adjustment (i.e., internalizing and externalizing behavior problems). Child participants consisted of both boys (64%) and girls (36%) and ranged from 6 to 12 years of age. Findings indicated maltreatment negatively predicted maternal support and positively predicted children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Further maternal support negatively predicted children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Finally, maternal support partially mediated the relation between maltreatment and internalizing problems. No mediation was indicated for externalizing difficulties. Findings suggest that a lack of maternal support in response to children's emotion is particularly important to the development of children's internalizing behavior problems.

AB In this study, the authors examine the equivalence of the factor structure of a commonly used symptom checklist of behavioral and emotional problems-the Behavior Problem Index (BPI)-across African American, Hispanic, and White children in the United States. The sample is drawn from the 1998 data file of the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a U.S. data set. The results of the study suggest that the BPI is not equivalent across the three ethnic groups. These findings are consistent when equivalence is tested for a one-factor model, a two-factor model using the internalizing and externalizing dimensions of the BPI, and a six-factor model using the subscales of the BPI. Item-level analyses identify the statistically significant items that are associated with nonequivalence across ethnic groups. The implications of non-equivalent measures for cross-cultural research and practice with families and children are discussed.

AB Although the association between interparental conflict and youth maladjustment has been established, processes underlying this relationship are less understood. In this investigation, children's conflict appraisals were examined as mediating variables. In Study 1, 1,893 6th graders reported their perceptions of conflict and appraisals of threat and self-blame. Youth and teachers reported on externalizing and internalizing problems. In Study 2, 416 married parents from the larger sample reported their conflict and youth maladjustment. Children's appraisals of coping efficacy also were examined. Perceived threat, self-blame, and coping efficacy were salient mediators of overt conflict and triangulation, particularly for internalizing problems. Findings indicate that children's beliefs about interparental conflict play an important role in their adjustment to this family stressor.

AB Relations between parents' depressed mood, marital conflict, parent-child hostility, and children's adjustment were examined in a community sample of 136 ten-year-olds and their parents. Videotaped observational and self-report data were used to examine these relations in path analyses. A proposed model was tested in which mothers' and fathers' depressed mood and marital hostility were associated with children's adjustment problems through disruptions in parent-child relationships. Results showed that both mothers' and fathers' marital hostility were linked to parent-child hostility, which in turn was linked to children's internalizing problems. Fathers' depressed mood was linked to children's internalizing problems indirectly through father-child hostility. Fathers' depressed mood was directly linked to children's externalizing problems and indirectly linked through father-child hostility. For mothers, marital hostility was directly linked to children's externalizing problems, and marital hostility in fathers was indirectly linked to children's externalizing problems through father-child hostility.

AB Objective To examine the types and Severity of psychopathology in children with epilepsy. Methods A series of meta-analyses were conducted to review 46 studies, including 2,434 children with epilepsy. Results Effect sizes were medium to large for comparisons with children from the general population, which indicates that children with epilepsy are at increased risk for psychopathology, including internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Comparisons with children with another chronic illness revealed small to medium effect sizes, indicating that psychopathology in children with epilepsy may partly be, attributed to chronicity of the disease. Attention problems, thought problems, and social problems proved to be relatively specific to epilepsy. Comparisons with siblings suggested that psychopathology in children with epilepsy may be associated with family factors, especially where behavioral disorders appear to be more generic. Conclusions Clinicians should consider both neurological and psychosocial factors, including the family system, when treating psychopathology in children, with epilepsy.

AB Objective: This study examines the association between alcohol use and mental health in adolescence, specifically the interaction with age and gender. Method: Data were derived from the 2001 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey-a repeated cross-sectional study with a total of 5,730 students aged 12-16 years, carried out as part of the World Health Organization cross-national HBSC Project. A two-stage random sampling procedure was used. Written questionnaires were administered in classroom settings. These contained questions about alcohol and other drug use as well as sociodemographic and behavioral variables. In addition, the Youth Self-Report was used to assess mental health. Results: Weekly alcohol use among adolescents is related to less withdrawn behavior and more delinquent, aggressive behavior. Significant interactions between weekly alcohol use and age were found on both externalizing and internalizing problems, indicating a stronger association between weekly alcohol use and problems among younger adolescents. No interactions with gender were found. Conclusions: Particularly at a young age, the weekly use of alcohol is associated with mental health problems. Regular alcohol use should alert parents and professionals that these adolescents might experience problems in other areas.

Psychological symptoms were assessed by the Youth Self Report (YSR) and the Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) supplemented by school health officers blind assessments. Bullying was common: bully only (18%), victim only (10%) and victim and bully (9%). Bullies had mainly externalizing symptoms (delinquency and aggression) and those of the victim and bully group both externalizing and internalizing symptoms as well as high levels of suicidality. Adolescents in the bully only group were more likely to be boys and to have attention problems. Moreover, a substantial proportion of the adolescents in the victim only group were judged by school health officer to have psychiatric symptoms and to function socially less well.

AB Depression is highly prevalent in children and adolescents. Psychodynamic therapies are only insufficiently evaluated in this field although many children and adolescents suffering from depression are treated using this approach. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of psychodynamic short-term psychotherapy (PSTP) for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. In a waiting-list controlled study, 20 children and adolescents fulfilling diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia were included. The treatment group received 25 sessions of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Main outcome criterion was the Impairment-Score for Children and Adolescents (IS-CA) as well as the Psychic and Social-Communicative Findings Sheet for Children and Adolescents (PSCFS-CA) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which were assessed at the beginning and the end of treatment. The statistical and clinical significance of changes in these measures were evaluated. There was a significant advantage of the treatment group compared to the waiting group for the IS-CA. The effect size of the IS-CA total score was 1,3. In contrast to the treatment group, where 20 % of the children showed clinically significant and reliable improvement, no subject in the waiting-list control group met this criterion. Comparable results were found for the PSCFS-CA and for the internalising score assessed with the CBCL. The results show that psychodynamic short-term psychotherapy (PSTP) is an effective treatment for depressed children and adolescents. Still, some of the children surely require more intensive treatment.

AB Objective: Maternal psychiatric illness is a potent risk factor for child psychiatric disorders, but little is known about rates of psychiatric diagnoses among mothers who bring their children to pediatric mental health clinics. This study investigated rates of psychiatric disorders among mothers of children presenting for psychiatric evaluation and examined the relationship between maternal diagnosis and child psychopathology. Methods: Interviewers conducted structured diagnostic interviews with nonpsychotic, school-age children and their mothers (N=222) and collected self-report measures of symptoms, functioning, and social support. Results: One-hundred-thirty-five participating mothers (61 percent) met DSM-IV criteria for a current axis I disorder, most commonly depression (35 percent) and anxiety (42 percent). Children of mothers with a diagnosis met criteria for significantly more diagnoses on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children, Present and Lifetime version and had significantly higher scores on measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms than children of mothers without a diagnosis. Two-thirds of mothers with a diagnosis were not receiving psychiatric treatment. Conclusions: More than half the mothers who brought their children for psychiatric treatment were themselves suffering from a psychiatric disorder. Maternal psychiatric illness was, in turn, associated with greater occurrence of psychopathology among offspring, underscoring the importance of developing interventions that address the needs of both children with psychiatric disorders and their at-risk mothers.

AB Using data from two waves of a panel study of families that currently receive or recently received cash welfare benefits, this article examines the relationship between food hardship and behavior problems for two different age groups (3-5 years and 6-12 years). Results show that food hardship is positively associated with externalizing behavior problems for the older children even after controlling for parental stress, warmth, and depression. Food hardship is positively associated with internalizing behavior problems for the older group of children, and with both externalizing and internalizing behavior problems for the younger group of children. These effects are mediated by parental characteristics. Results suggest that practitioners who work with children should screen for food hardship as a potential source of behavior problems.

AB The article investigates the relationships between platelet monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity, personality, and psychopathology (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th ed.; American,. Psychiatric Association, 1994] diagnoses. These relationships were assessed in 178 incarcerated male juvenile delinquents. Even. after controlling for smoking, the authors found-that both Internalizing and Externalizing Psychopathology were negatively related to MAO-B activity. In the final reduced model, novelty seeking fully mediated the relationships between MAO-B and Externalizing Psychopathology but not between MAO-B and Internalizing Psychopathology. It was hypothesized that low platelet MAO-B activity does not directly predispose, individuals to psychopathology but is related, to specific personality traits, which in tdm repres ent a vulnerability.factor,for psychopathology. Future studies should help clarify the nature of the relationships between personality, biological markers, and psychopathology.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the rates of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and the relation between psychological symptoms and drug use severity, among 117 Israeli adolescents presenting for outpatient drug abuse treatment. Psychological symptoms were assessed via both adolescent self-report and parent report. Drug use was assessed using both adolescent self-report and urinalysis. Results showed that 58% of the sample evidenced clinical levels of psychological symptoms, with girls evidencing higher rates of externalizing and mixed symptomatology than boys. Parents' report of adolescents' internalizing symptoms predicted severity of drug use. These findings suggest that treatment for this population should be multidimensional, and address not only drug use per se, but also psychological risk factors.

AB The present study builds on past research that has found support for a conceptual model in which poverty is linked with adolescent psychological symptoms through economic stressors and impaired parenting. The present study examined this model in a sample of urban African American mothers and their adolescent children. In addition, an alternative hypothesis was examined: that exposure to community violence mediates the relation between poverty and psychological symptoms in urban youth. Limited support was found for a model in which poverty is linked with internalizing symptoms through exposure to community violence and with externalizing symptoms through economic stressors and inconsistent discipline. Interpretations, limitations, and directions for future research are outlined. (c) 2004 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the use of approach (e.g., seeking social support, problem solving) and avoidance (e.g., distancing, internalizing, externalizing) strategies for coping with perceived racial discrimination and their relationship to the subjective feelings of distress evoked by perceived experiences of discrimination and perceived control over discriminatory experiences among a small, relatively homogeneous sample of Black Youth (N = 71). Results of hierarchical regression analyses support evidence from the general adolescent stress and coping literature that links avoidance coping to greater feelings of distress and approach coping to a greater sense of personal control. Greater self-reports of distress are. related to greater use of internalizing and externalizing coping strategies. Greater self-reports of perceived control over discriminatory experiences are related to greater use of seeking social support and problem-solving coping strategies. Implications for promoting the successful coping of Black youth with perceived racial discrimination are discussed.

AB Although delineating the processes by which children appraise the family as a source of security from their collective experiences in the family subsystem has assumed center stage in many conceptualizations of child development, the dearth of measures of child adaptation in the family system has hindered empirical advances. Therefore, this study introduced and tested the psychometric properties of the Security in the Family System (SIFS) scales, a new measure designed to assess children's appraisals of security in their family as a whole. The SIFS was administered to 853 10-15-year-old schoolchildren and readministered to a smaller subsample two weeks later. Additional data was gathered from children, caregivers and teachers using a variety of instruments tapping family instability, cohesion, and conflict; parenting warmth and psychological control; child externalizing and internalizing symptoms; parent-child and interparental insecurity; and children's reactions to conflict simulations. Consistent with models of emotional security in the family, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded three reliable (i.e., good internal consistency, test-retest reliability) dimensions of family security: Preoccupation, Security, and Disengagement. Concurrent and prospective associations between the SIFS scales and measures of family functioning, children's psychological problems, and insecurity in specific family relationships supported the validity of the SIFS. Support for the discriminant validity of the SIFS was evidenced by its specific patterns of relations with children's psychological problems and ability to predict psychological problems after controlling for insecurity in specific family subsystems. Results indicate that the SIFS is a psychometrically sound tool capable of advancing family process models, and that family security is a viable construct whose factors parallel already-identified patterns of children's security in other family relationships.

AB This study examined the association between early emotional support provided by parents and child internalizing and externalizing problems, using a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of 1361 children. Parental emotional support was assessed using the Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment, incorporating both parent report and interviewer observation. We found that, controlling for child externalizing problems at age 6 years, parental emotional support at age 6 years was negatively related to child externalizing problems at age 8 years. A developmental model that assessed the timing of the emergence of this relationship was then analyzed by including parental emotional support at ages 2, 4, and 6 years as predictors of child externalizing problems at age 8 years. The developmental model suggested that less parental emotional support as early as age 2 years is associated with later externalizing problems in children. This study discusses the importance of very early parental emotional support in promoting positive child development.

AB Objective: Clinical and population samples demonstrate that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs with other disorders. Comorbid disorder clustering within ADHD subtypes is not well studied. Method: Latent class analysis (LCA) examined the co-occurrence of DSM-IV ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and depression symptoms in a population twin sample. The authors fit separate models for ADHD and comorbid disorder symptoms. Twin concordance ratios (monozygotic versus dizygotic) were compared examining genetic influence on class membership. Results: LCA of ADHD symptoms resulted in seven classes including inattentive, combined, and hyperactive subtypes in 1,616 subjects. The few ADHD symptoms (53.4%) and severe inattentive (12.3%) classes were most frequent. LCA of ODD, CID, and depression symptoms in 1,587 subjects revealed five classes including ODD (19.4%), depression (14.5%), and two composite classes: ODD/CD (6.9%) and ODD/CD/depression (7.2%). Internalizing and externalizing comorbid disorders were present across all ADHD subtypes. Odds ratios (ORs) for twin concordance indicate genetic influence on severe inattentive (OR = 4.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-11.53) and combined (OR = 5.25; 95% CI, 1.32-20.78) ADHD classes and ODD (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 0.70-3.17), ODD/CD (OR = 3.32; 95% CI, 0.57-19.28), and ODD/CD/depression (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 0.30-4.77) classes. Conclusions: Internalizing and externalizing disorders did not cluster differentially within ADHD subtypes. LCA may provide a more precise characterization of comorbidity with ADHD.

Birth characteristics, minor abnormalities on the neonatal ultrasound scan of the brain, and motor milestones have only limited value in the early detection of these children. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether nonoptimal reaching and relatively immobile postural behavior at an early age are associated with dysfunctional neuromotor and behavioural development at school age. The preterm children and full-term children of the present follow-up study participated in a previous study on the characteristics of reaching kinematics and the kinetics of posture at 4 and 6 mo corrected age. At the age of 6 y, the children were re-assessed by means of the Touwen neurologic assessment, the Movement ABC, and the Child Behavior Check List. The results demonstrated that in preterm children without cerebral palsy, a lack of successful reaching at 4 mo and a nonoptimal quality of reaching at 6 mo are related to the development of a complex form of minor neurologic dysfunction (MND) and fine manipulative disability at 6 y. Thus, these early signs indicate the presence of clinically significant brain dysfunction. A relatively immobile postural behavior at 4 mo was associated with simple MND, coordination problems, and at 6 mo with a worse score on the Movement ABC and internalizing behavior. This suggests that a relatively immobile postural behavior points to a mild form of brain dysfunction.

AB An unselected sample of adolescents (n= 504) was given a test measuring their social strategies in affiliative context, and emotional and behavioral problems. Four groups of adolescents were identified according to the certain patterns of the social strategies they deployed: Active optimistic group (n= 107), Defensive functional group (n= 159), Avoiders group (n= 89), and Learned helplessness group (n= 140). The degree of stability of a cluster solution was studied when the method for cluster analysis was changed, showing that the four-cluster solution captures the essential relationships between the variables. The membership of the strategy groups was associated in theoretically meaningful ways to the anxiety/depression, withdrawal, and social problems.

TI Effects of twin separation in primary school
SO TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS

DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; REGISTER
AB We studied the short- and long-term effects of classroom separation in twins on behavior problems and academic performance. Short-term effects were studied at age 7 in twins separated at age 5 and long-term effects at age 12 in twins who had been separated or together most of the time at school. Behavior problems were rated by mothers (Child Behavior Checklist at ages 3, 7 and 12) and teachers (Teacher Report Form at ages 7 and 12). Academic achievement was measured at age 12 using a national academic achievement test (CITO). At age 7, twins from separated pairs had more internalizing and externalizing problems than nonseparated twins, as rated by both mothers and teachers. Only for the maternal ratings of internalizing problems, however, could these effects be attributed to the separation itself and not to preexisting problems (at age 3) between separated and nonseparated twins. Long-term effects of separation were significant for maternal and teacher ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems, but these effects could be explained by preexisting differences between separated and nonseparated groups. There were no differences in academic achievement between the separated and nonseparated group. These results suggest that the decision to separate twins when they go to school is based in part on the existing behavioral problems of the twins and that, in the long run, separation does not affect problem behavior or academic achievement. The findings were the same for monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

AB We examined longitudinally collected behavioral reports by teachers on a unique twin sample at the ages of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 years. As twin and adoption studies implicate the role of genetic influence on behavioral problems found to be stable in epidemiological samples, the current study employs a developmental behavior genetic model to examine the extent to which genetic and environmental contributions to problem behaviors are stable and/or change during development. In this sample of 410 monozygotic (MZ) and 354 dizygotic (DZ) twins, MZ twins were rated as more similar than DZ twins on average. In general, boys were more frequently rated as displaying externalizing behaviors than were girls across each of the six observations, while girls' internalizing problems were found not to be significantly different from boys'. For both sexes, stability in externalizing problem behaviors was due to a single common genetic factor whose effects acted pleiotropically at each age in the presence of unique environmental influences that were transmitted from age-to-age. Change was largely due to uncorrelated age-specific non-shared environmental and additive genetic effects. Contributions to stability for internalizing problems were due to age-to-age transmission of earlier expressed genetic effects. Change for girls and boys internalizing problems were largely due to environmental experiences unique to siblings along with uncorrelated age-specific genetic effects. These results further inform the notion that individual environments are important factors in the etiology of problem behaviors, but suggest that heritable contributions to phenotypic stability are largely the same across middle childhood and early adolescence. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Objective: To investigate sex and informant effects on comorbidity rates for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct-oppositional disorder (CD-ODD) in an adolescent community sample.
   Method: The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-2.25 (DISC-2.25) was administered to 1201 adolescents and their mothers.
   Results: The highest comorbidity risk found was between ADHD and CD-ODD, with odds ratios (ORs) of 17.6 for adolescent reports and 12.0 for mother reports. The second-highest comorbidity risk, with ORs of 13.2 for adolescent reports and 11.0 for mother reports, was between anxiety and depressive disorders. There was not much overlap between internalizing and externalizing disorders. Adolescent girls had higher rates of coexisting anxiety and depressive disorders, whereas adolescent boys had higher rates of coexisting ADHD and CD-ODD. There was partial support for the hypothesis that adolescent-reported comorbidity rates would exceed mother-reported rates.
   Conclusions: There is a greater cooccurrence of within-category, compared with between-category, disorders. Adolescent girls are more likely to have coexisting internalizing disorders, while adolescent boys are more likely to have coexisting exterrializing disorders. Mothers tend to report more externalizing disorders (that is, ADHD), while adolescents generally report more internalizing disorders.

AB Using cross-sectional analyses in conjunction with dynamic modeling (hierarchical linear modeling), the authors profiled 119 treatment foster care youth and constructed behavioral change trajectories for a subset of 97 children. Children generally showed improvements in internalizing and critical pathology problem domains but remained the same on measures of externalizing behaviors and total problem score. The number of previous out-of-home placements was positively associated with increased levels of psychiatric symptomatology and served as the most robust predictor for modeling treatment response trajectories across problem domains. Placement instability places the well-being of children at heightened risk, therefore, accurate assessment of child need and risk in relation to caregiver capacities is critical.

   Methods: Retrospective chart review. Setting: Urban hospital plastic surgery primary care unit. Patients: A total of 724 children aged 2 to 18 years with Completed Child Behavior Checklists in their medical charts. Main Outcome Measure: Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Higher rates of problems in the clinical range were seen for withdrawn, attention, social, thought, and internalizing problems and lower rates for externalizing and somatic complaints; specific patterns varied according to age and sex. Elevated rates of competency deficits were seen in some groups.
   Conclusions: Most children with CFAs do not appear to experience psychosocial adjustment problems. Although elevated risk may be seen for certain problems, this group may be protected in other areas. Research identifying the mechanisms responsible for varying age and sex patterns of adjustment is needed.

AB Research on bullying and victimization largely rests on univariate analyses and on reports from a single informant. Researchers may thus know too little about the simultaneous effects of various independent and dependent variables, and their research may be biased by shared method variance. The database for this Dutch study was large (N = 1,065) and rich enough to allow multivariate analysis and multisource information. In addition, the effect of familial vulnerability for internalizing and externalizing disorders was studied. Gender, aggressiveness, isolation, and dislikability were most strongly related to bullying and victimization. Among the many findings that deviated from or enhanced the univariate knowledge base were that not only victims and bully/victims but bullies as well were disliked and that parenting was unrelated to bullying and victimization once other factors were controlled.

ID ADJUSTMENT; SURVIVORS; FAMILY
AB Standardized behavior rating scales have been used in the routine care of children during medical visits because they provide an objective, norm-based index for the child's behavioral functioning. The purpose of this study was to examine behavior problems among children (aged 2.5-18 years) with burn injuries using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, a multi-informant system of standardized rating scales that assesses clinical and adaptive behavior areas. Parents and youth (ages 8 -18) completed the Behavioral Assessment System for Children with reference to the pediatric patient's behavioral functioning before hospital admission for a burn injury. In total, data were collected on 94 children. Results suggested that a substantial portion of the sample endorsed significantly elevated levels of behavioral difficulties across a broad range of problem behaviors. On the basis of parent report, preschoolers exhibited concerns related to hyperactivity, anxiety, aggression, and attention problems, whereas school-aged children were reported to have these same concerns as well as depression and conduct problems. Twenty percent of our adolescent sample (ages 12-18 years) were described to be experiencing even more internalizing and externalizing behavior problems relative to the two groups of their younger counterparts. Boys were found to contribute to the cause of their burn injury significantly more often than girls. The strengths, limitations, and clinical implications of our findings are discussed.

AB Social, emotional, behavioural and school adjustment functioning among Korean, Korean American and Caucasian American children was examined with the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Self-Report of Personality (SRP) and the Parent Rating Scale (PRS). One hundred and twenty Korean, Korean-American and Caucasian-American children, ages 8 to 11, and their parents participated in this study. Generally, the Korean children were perceived as behaving in a more controlled, less self-reliant and internalizing manner than were the American children. The Korean American children were rated to have more adjustment difficulties. The notion of Korean family collectivism versus western individualism and the inherent conflict in these cultural values was used to discuss the results. Practitioners should be aware that ratings with the BASC PRS and SRP scales of Korean and Korean American children can be influenced by culture to a significant degree. Also it appears that the BASC SRP and PRS are sensitive to conflict created in children and families caught between cultures, particularly related to demands for rapid Americanization.

AB Background Although an increasing proportion of the population in Western countries originates from non-Western parts of the world, little research has been conducted on predictors of externalizing problems in immigrant adolescent samples. This study on the predictors of externalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant adolescents in the Netherlands was aimed to contribute to the knowledge in this field. Methods We obtained 415 parent-reports, 376 self-reports and 238 teacher-reports on problem behavior in a general population sample of randomly selected 11- to 18-year-old Moroccan immigrant adolescents, using the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report and Teacher's Report Form. Results The data revealed a clear relation between externalizing problems and several child (gender, internalizing problems), proximal family (parental monitoring and affection, support from father and mother, and parent-child conflict), contextual family (conflicts between parents about parenting, destructive communication between parents, and total number of life-events), school/peer (problems at school, involvement with deviant peers, hanging out), and migration variables (adolescent's perceived discrimination). Hardly any association was observed between externalizing problems and parental psychopathology, and between externalizing problems and global family variables (e.g., family employment level). Most findings matched results found in earlier studies on non-immigrant youth. Conclusions Our results suggest that the child, school/peer, and proximal family factors are essential in models predicting the development of externalizing behavior. The impact of the migration factor on externalizing problems turned out to be relatively small.

AB Three groups of students-19 hard of hearing, 20 deaf, and a control group of 36 typically developing hearing readers-were compared on their ability to process written words at the lexical level and on their comprehension of words within the structure of a sentence. Findings generally suggested that severe prelingual hearing loss does not prevent the development of word processing strategies adequate for efficient processing of written words at the lexical level, although such hearing loss seems to put individuals at risk of failure in internalizing syntactic knowledge crucial for proper processing of words at the sentence level. Evidence further indicated that neither the amount of functional hearing (deaf vs. hard of hearing), the hearing status of their parents (hearing impaired vs. hearing), nor the use of sign language as a primary communication mode was a direct cause in this regard.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between maternal representations of attachment, as assessed with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996), and mothers' thoughts and feelings about their own emotions and emotions emerging in their toddlers. Eighty-nine adolescent mothers completed the AAI and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) and Katz, Gottman, Shapiro, and Carrere's (1997) metaemotion interview for parents of toddlers. Autonomous mothers demonstrated the most open and flexible mindset around a variety of emotions in themselves and their toddlers. Dismissing mothers exhibited a tendency to minimize internalizing emotions in themselves and their children, while unresolved mothers described the most emotion regulatory difficulties.

AB Objective. - To describe the premorbid state of early onset schizophrenia (EOS).
   Methods. - Twenty-three adolescents with EOS were compared to a healthy control group (CG) and to a group of anorexic patients (AG). The premorbid state was studied through the CBCL and the data obtained were analyzed using ANOVA's and t-test.
   Results. - During the premorbid period EOS showed significantly higher scores on all scales, relative to the CG, and only on some scales (social, thought and attention problems, and school competencies) relative to the AG.
   Conclusions. - Children who develop first episode psychosis during adolescence differ from children with normal development. The premorbid internalizing state is common to AG but social competencies and school problems are the most affected areas in EOS when compared to the AG. It is hypothesized that both EOS and AG can be considered as the expression of a previous vulnerability. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Young children develop social and emotional competence through interactions with others in the two major contexts in which they spend time: home and preschool. This study examined whether parenting stress in the home context is related to the children's behaviour while in preschool. Previous research has suggested that parenting stress negatively influences parenting behaviour, which in turn has been shown to impact children's development. This study examined the direct relationship between parenting stress and children's behaviour in two types of preschool programmes: private day care centres and Head Start. Parenting stress was significantly related to teacher ratings of social competence, internalizing behaviours, and externalizing behaviours, and the effects of parenting behaviour do not appear to mediate this relationship. Parenting stress was most strongly related to children's social competence. Parents' reports of expectations for their child's behaviour appear to weakly moderate the relationship between externalizing behaviour and parenting stress. This study suggests that examination of a parent's level of stress, in addition to parenting practices, may be important in research and interventions with preschool children's behaviour and social competence.

AB Background: Little is known about risk factors of suicidal behavior among Chinese adolescents. This study examined the associations between negative life events, psychopathology, and suicidal behavior in rural adolescents of China.
   Methods: A total of 1362 adolescent students in a rural prefecture of China completed a self-administered questionnaire concerning suicidal behavior, psychopathology, life events, and demographics. Data analyses were conducted using multivariate logistic regression modeling.
   Results: Females were more likely to report suicidal ideation than males (22.0% vs. 17.5%). While the rate of suicide attempt was slightly higher in younger males (12-15 years) than in females (4.7% vs. 3.1%), the rate was higher in older females (16-18 years) than in males (12.7% vs. 9.5%). Suicide attempters reported more negative life events during the past year than suicidal ideators and non-suicidal adolescents. Academic stress and family conflicts were the major stress domains of adolescents at risk for suicidal behavior. A significant dose-response relationship was observed between the number of life events and suicidal behavior. Negative life events were also associated with increased risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. Both internalizing and externalizing problems were significantly associated with elevated risk for suicidal behavior after negative life events were controlled.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study. Longitudinal study is warranted to examine the roles of life stress in adolescent suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions: Adolescents who experienced more negative life events are at increased risk for suicidal behavior. Both internalizing and externalizing problems mediate the effect of life events on adolescent suicidal behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to assess the psychological response of children following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC and to examine prospective predictors of children's post-attack responses. Method: Children's responses were assessed in a community sample of children in Seattle, Washington, participating in an ongoing study. Symptomatology and temperament assessed prior to the attacks were examined as prospective predictors of post-attack post-traumatic stress (PTS), anxiety, depression and externalizing problems. Results: Children demonstrated PTS symptoms and worries at levels comparable to those in children directly experiencing disasters, with 77% of children reporting being worried, 68% being upset by reminders, and 39% having upsetting thoughts. The most common PTS symptom cluster was re-experiencing, and 8% of children met criteria consistent with PTSD. African-American children reported more avoidant PTS symptoms and being more upset by the attacks than European-American children. Girls reported being more upset than boys. Prior internalizing, externalizing, social competence and self-esteem were related to post-attack PTS; and child inhibitory control, assessed prior to the 9/11 attacks, demonstrated a trend towards an association with post-attack PTS symptoms controlling for prior levels of symptomatology. PTS predicted child-report anxiety and conduct problem symptoms at follow-up, approximately 6 months after 9/11. Conclusions: Children experiencing a major disaster at a distance or indirectly through media exposure demonstrated worries and PTS symptoms suggesting that communities need to attend to children's mental health needs in response to national or regional disasters. Pre-disaster symptomatology or low self-regulation may render children more vulnerable in response to a disaster, and immediate post-disaster responses predict subsequent symptomatology. These variables might be used in the identification of children in need of intervention.

AB Using structural equation modeling, the authors evaluated the hypothesis that the relation between marital adjustment and children's behavior problems is mediated by child-rearing disagreements, whose effects are mediated by parents' overreactive discipline. In a community sample, fully or partially mediated models of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems of 3- to 7-year-old boys (N = 99) and girls (N = 104) were supported for mothers and fathers in 7 of 8 cases. Child-rearing disagreements always mediated the relation of marital adjustment and child behavior problems, and overreactive discipline was a final mediator in 3 cases. More variance was accounted for in mothers' than fathers' ratings. For mothers' ratings, the most variance was accounted for in boys' externalizing and girls' internalizing behavior problems.

AB Dual-income parents (N = 122 couples) with an oldest child 18-60 months of age completed the Child-Rearing Disagreements Scale (E. N. Jouriles et al., 1991), the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach & L. A. Rescorla, 2000), and the Verbal Aggression subscale of the Conflicts and Problem-Solving Scale (P. K. Kerig, 1996). Replicating the results of E. N. Jouriles et al. (1991) and extending these findings to daughters and fathers, the authors found links between child-related disagreements and parental ratings of child behavior problems in this low-risk sample. There were no links between fathers' reports of verbal aggression and child behavior problems. Among mothers, however, use of verbal aggression mediated the link between child-related disagreements and ratings of sons' internalizing problems. Verbal aggression did not moderate the link between child-related disagreements and child behavior problems for either mothers or for fathers.

Mothers classified as high in religious involvement had significantly higher self-esteem and lower depression scores, exhibited less child abuse potential, and had higher occupational and educational attainment than mothers classified as low in religious involvement; differences remained when multiple factors, such as stress and grandmother support, were held constant. Children with more religious mothers had fewer internalizing and externalizing problems at 10 years of age, with maternal adjustment mediating this relationship. Religiosity, through increased social support, served as a protective factor for teenaged mothers and their children.

AB A 5-wave model linking family and maternal functioning to youth psychological adjustment was tested with 139 single-mother-headed African American families with young adolescents (mean age = 11 years at recruitment) living in the rural South. Structural equation modeling indicated that an accumulation of family risk factors at Wave I was linked with maternal psychological functioning at Wave 2, which forecast competence-promoting parenting practices at Wave 3. These parenting practices indirectly forecast youth externalizing and internalizing behaviors 2 years later at Wave 5, through youth self-regulation at Wave 4. The hypothesized model was retested, controlling for Wave I youth externalizing and internalizing behaviors. All paths remained significant, indicating that the model accounted for change in youth psychological adjustment across 4 years.

AB This research examines whether siblings in domestically violent families differ in experiences of interparent conflict and whether such differences are associated with differences in children's adjustment. Participants included 112 sibling pairs and their mothers temporarily residing in domestic violence shelters. Children completed measures of their experiences of interparent conflict, and children and mothers reported on children's adjustment problems. Cross-sibling correlations for experiences of interparent. conflict were low to moderate. Sibling differences in threat appraisals of interparent conflict were associated with sibling differences in internalizing problems. Differences in self-blame appraisals were associated with differences in internalizing and externalizing problems. The direction of the relations indicated that the sibling who felt more threatened by or more at fault for interparent conflict experienced more adjustment problems. These findings suggest the potential utility of individually assessing sibling experiences of interparent conflict and tailoring interventions individually.

ID BEHAVIORS
AB This study examined friendship quality as a possible moderator of risk factors in predicting peer victimization and bullying. Children (50 boys and 49 girls, ages 10 to 13 years) reported on the quality of their best friendship, as well as their bullying and victimization tendencies. Parents reported on their child's internalizing and externalizing behaviors, in addition to bullying and victimization tendencies. Results indicated that externalizing problems were related to bullying behavior; however firiendship quality moderated this relation such that among children with externalizing behaviors, a high-quality friendship significantly attenuated bullying behavior Internalizing problems and low friendship quality were significantly related to victimization; however, friendship quality did not moderate the relation between internalizing problems and victimization. Implications for interventions based on these findings are discussed.

AB The purpose of this cross-sectional study, conducted with a random sample of 166 students with emotional disturbance (ED), was to establish, with attention to age and gender differences, the extent to which students with ED served in public school settings experience language skill deficits. This study also examined particular types of problem behaviors related to language skills. Students with ED showed moderate to large language deficits, which appeared to be more pronounced in the expressive language domain. The language deficits of a majority of the students were clinically significant. These language deficits appeared to be relatively stable across age and gender. Furthermore, externalizing behaviors were related to receptive and expressive language skills, whereas internalizing ones were not.

AB Objective: The percentage of children with clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems before and after maternal death from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was contrasted with two comparison groups: children whose mothers were human immunodeficiency virus infected but continued to live and children whose mothers were not infected. Method: One hundred five 6- to 11-year-old African-American children from New Orleans and their mothers or caregivers participated. Mothers and caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: The findings indicated that, relative to those in one of the two control groups, more children in the orphans group had clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems before their mother's death and clinical levels of internalizing problems 2 years after her death. No differences emerged at 6 months after the mother's death. Conclusions: The differences that emerged and the high percentage of children in the orphans group in the borderline clinical or clinical range (52%-73% across the three assessments) indicate the importance of intervention efforts for these children beginning before the mother's death and continuing after her death.

AB Researchers have suggested that childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a distal risk factor for the development of emotion regulation difficulties in adulthood. The present study examined 20 females with and without a history of CSA on the dimensions of subjective emotional experience (positive and negative activation), facial expressivity, and disclosure (positive and negative emotion words) in response to positively and negatively valenced film stimuli. The CSA group reported experiencing reduced positive activation while no group differences were found for negative activation. The CSA group disclosed fewer negative emotion words to express their experience and exhibited a trend towards less facial expressivity. The results are interpreted within the context of CSA survivors' emotional responding difficulties, and their implications are discussed.

AB Evidence-based studies of drug, psychosocial and combined treatments for prepubertal internalizing disorders (depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], and non-OCD anxiety) were reviewed. No age effects were found. Although no combined studies met evidence-based criteria, efficacious and possibly efficacious psychosocial and pharmacological treatments were identified, along with safety concerns for drug treatments. Evidentiary support favored psychosocial treatment for non-OCD anxiety disorders and pharmacological treatments for OCD, with mixed results for depression. Cost-benefit considerations suggest psychosocial treatments should be considered the first choice for at least anxiety and depression, except in unusual cases where stabilization may require pharmacological intervention first.

AB Psychopharmacological treatments have been used with increased frequency to treat a variety of internalizing and externalizing disorders in children. Given the potential impact that medication has on children's school performance, school psychologists should be involved in helping physicians and families make effective decisions by assisting with (a) diagnostic decision-making and determining the need for medication; (b) evaluating medication effects and determining optimal dosage; and (c) integrating medical, psychosocial, and educational interventions. Potential barriers to the adoption of these roles are discussed as well as clinical, ethical, training, and legal implications.

AB Context International adoption involves more than 40000 children a year moving among more than 100 countries. Before adoption, international adoptees often experience insufficient medical care, malnutrition, maternal separation, and neglect and abuse in orphanages.
   Objective To estimate the effects of international adoption on behavioral problems and mental health referrals.
   Data Sources We searched MEDLINE, PsychLit, and ERIC from 1950 to January 2005 using the terms adopt* combined with (behavior) problem, disorder, (mal) adjustment, (behavioral) development, clinical or psychiatric (referral), or mental health; conducted a manual search of the references of articles, books, book chapters, and reports; and consulted experts for relevant studies. The search was not limited to English-language publications.
   Study Selection Studies that provided sufficient data to compute differences between adoptees (in all age ranges) and nonadopted controls were selected, resulting in 34 articles on mental health referrals and 64 articles on behavior problems.
   Data Extraction Data on international adoption, preadoption adversity, and other moderators were extracted from each study and inserted in the program Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA). Effect sizes (d) for the overall differences between adoptees and controls regarding internalizing, externalizing, total behavior problems, and use of mental health services were computed. Homogeneity across studies was tested with the Q statistic. Data Synthesis Among 25 281 cases and 80 260 controls, adoptees (both within and between countries) presented more behavior problems, but effect sizes were small (d, 0.16-0.24). Adoptees (5092 cases) were overrepresented in mental health services and this effect size was large (d, 0.72). Among 15 790 cases and 30 450 controls, international adoptees showed more behavior problems than nonadopted controls, but effect sizes were small (d, 0.07-0.11). International adoptees showed fewer total externalizing and internalizing behavior problems than domestic adoptees. Also, international adoptees were less often referred to mental health services (d, 0.37) than domestic adoptees (d, 0.81). International adoptees with preadoption adversity showed more total problems and externalizing problems than international adoptees without evidence of extreme deprivation.
   Conclusions Most international adoptees are well-adjusted although they are referred to mental health services more often than nonadopted controls. However, international adoptees present fewer behavior problems and are less often referred to mental health services than domestic adoptees.

AB Background: Many adolescents with alcohol and drug problems have mental health comorbidities. The literature suggests that patients entering chemical dependency (CD) treatment with co-occurring problems have less successful outcomes, including treatment dropout and relapse. We examined the impact of psychiatric services on treatment initiation, retention, and alcohol and drug abstinence outcomes for adolescents in CD treatment.
   Methods: Participants were 419 adolescents aged 12-18 years who were seeking treatment at four CD programs of a nonprofit, managed care, group model health system and a parent or guardian for each adolescent. We surveyed participants at intake and 6 months and examined clinical and administrative data on diagnoses and CD and psychiatric utilization. Six-month response rates were 91% for adolescents and 93% for parents.
   Results: Fifty-five percent of the patients with treatment intakes had at least one psychiatric diagnosis in addition to a substance use disorder. Compared with matched controls, patients with CD intakes had higher rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and conduct disorder including oppositional defiant disorder. Thirty-one percent of the full sample had psychiatric visits in the 6 months after intake; among those with a psychiatric diagnosis, 54% had a psychiatric visit. Girls and those with higher Youth Self-Report internalizing scores were more likely to have a psychiatric visit (OR = 2.27, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.05, p < 0.0001, respectively). Adolescents receiving psychiatric services were more likely to be abstinent from both alcohol and drugs than those not receiving these services (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 0.98-2.5) and more likely to be alcohol abstinent (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00-2.85). Those adolescents at colocated clinics had higher odds of abstinence from both alcohol and drugs (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.03-2.39) and drugs (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.87-2.85) and of returning after intake to initiate CD treatment (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.44-3.61, p < 0.001) than others.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the need for psychiatric treatment of adolescents in CD treatment and highlight the importance of their receiving such services.

AB Context: Little research has investigated possible effects of neighborhood residence on mental health problems in children such as depression, anxiety, and withdrawal.
   Objective: To examine whether children's mental health is associated with neighborhood structural characteristics (concentrated disadvantage, immigrant concentration, and residential stability) and whether neiahbor- hood social processes (collective efficacy and organizational participation) underlie such effects.
   Design and Setting: The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods is a multilevel, longitudinal study of a representative sample of children aged 5 to 11 years in the late 1990s recruited from 80 neighborhoods. A community survey assessing neighborhood social processes was conducted with an independent sample of adult residents in these 80 neighborhoods and is used in conjunction with US census data to assess neighborhood conditions.
   Participants: A total of 2805 children (18.1% European American, 33.8% African American, and 48.1% Latino) and their primary caregivers were seen twice.
   Main Outcome Measures: Child Behavior Checklist total raw and clinical cutoff scores for internalizing behavior problems (depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and somatic problems).
   Results: The percentages of children above the clinical threshold were 21.5%, 18.3%, and 11.5% in neighborhoods of low, medium, and high socioeconomic status, respectively. A substantial proportion of variance in children's total internalizing scores (intraclass correlation, 11.1%) was attributable to between-neighborhood differences. Concentrated disadvantage was associated with more mental health problems and a higher number of children in the clinical range, after accounting for family demographic characteristics, maternal depression, and earlier child mental health scores. Neighborhood collective efficacy and organizational participation were associated with better mental health, after accounting for neighborhood concentrated disadvantage. Collective efficacy mediated the effect of concentrated disadvantage.
   Conclusions: A large number of children in poor neighborhoods have mental health problems. The mechanism through which neighborhood economic effects operated was community social control and cohesion, which may be amenable to intervention.

AB Objective: Internalizing and externalizing disorders are frequently comorbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined type (ADHD-CT) and dysthymic disorder (DD) in referred primary school-age children, yet there has been relatively little systematic research of the nature of these comorbid disorders. We describe the characteristics of parent- and child-reported internalizing and externalizing disorders in primary school-age children with ADHD-CT and DD.
   Method: A cross-sectional study of 45 clinically referred medication naive children with ADHD-CT and DD, examining parent and child reports of internalizing and externalizing disorders, defined categorically and dimensionally.
   Results: Generalized anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder were increased in the DD groups, whether ADHD-CT was present or not. Major depressive disorder was increased in the ADHD-CT and DD group compared to the ADHD-CT alone and the DD alone groups. Conduct disorder was increased in the ADHD-CT alone group compared to the DD with and without ADHD-CT groups. Verbal and fullscale IQ were increased in the DD groups, whether ADHD-CT was present or not, compared to the ADHD-CT alone group.
   Conclusions: There is emerging evidence that DD and anxiety may represent a different phenotypic expression of a common underlying aetiological process, while the co-occurrence of ADHD-CT and anxiety disorders remains unclear. Only the ADHD-CT and DD group is significantly associated with major depressive disorder, which suggests an additive effect. In contrast, conduct disorder and decreased verbal and fullscale IQ are only associated with the ADHD-CT group, which may suggest a protective effect of DD when comorbid with ADHD-CT. From a research perspective, it is important to confirm these found associations in larger samples derived from epidemiological populations.

AB Objective: The purpose was to identify different operational definitions of maltreatment severity, and then to examine their predictive validity.
   Method: Children and their primary caregivers participating in a consortium of ongoing longitudinal studies were interviewed when they were approximately 4 and 8 years of age to assess behavior problems, and developmental and psychological functioning. Four different severity definitions were identified and applied to 519 children who were reported for alleged maltreatment between Birth and the Age 8 interview. A taxonomy for defining maltreatment characteristics (Barnett, Manly, & Cicchetti, 1993) was applied to Child Protective Service records to define severity as (a) Maximum Severity within each of five maltreatment types, (b) Overall Maximum Severity across the five types, (c) Total Severity or the sum of the maximum severity for each of five types, and (d) Mean Severity or the average severity for those types of maltreatment alleged, during each of two time periods-Birth to Age 4, and Age 4 to Age 8.
   Results: Regression analyses that controlled for socio-demographic factors, early maltreatment (Birth to Age 4), prior functioning (Age 4), and site revealed that (a) all four severity definitions for maltreatment reports between Age 4 and Age 8 predicted Age 8 behavior problems, (b) Maximum Severity by Type and Mean Severity predicted adaptive functioning at Age 8, and (c) only Maximum Severity by Type was related to anger, at Age 8. Followup regression analyses indicated that only Maximum Severity by Type, specifically physical abuse, accounted for outcomes, beyond maltreatment occurrence versus non-occurrence.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that maltreatment severity definitions that preserve ratings within types of maltreatment may be the optimal approach to measure the severity of children's experiences. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Family Connections was a demonstration Program specifically designed to prevent child neglect. -This article describes the development of prevention strategies and the assessment of outcomes for families who received two versions of the intervention. The sample included 154 families (473 children) in a poor, urban neighborhood who met risk criteria for child neglect and who were randomly assigned to receive either a 3- or 9-month intervention. Self-report and observational data were analyzed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures. Results for the entire sample indicated positive changes in protective factors (parenting attitudes, parenting competence, social support); diminished risk factors (Parental depressive symptoms, parenting stress, life stress); and improved child, suety (physical and psychological care of children) and behavior (decreased externalizing and internalizing behavior). Results further reflected no advantage of the 9-month intervention for improving parenting adequacy. Further testing of the intervention with other target populations is being conducted.

AB This study attempted to provide empirical support for conceptual definitions of child neglect. We identified 12 types of needs, conceptualizing neglect as occurring when children's basic needs are not adequately met. We examined measures administered to 377 children and caregivers at ages 4 and 6 years participating in longitudinal studies on child maltreatment to identify potential indicators of these needs. Indicators were found for latent constructs, operationalizing three of the basic needs (emotional support and/or affection, protection from family conflict and/or violence, and from community violence). These latent constructs were used in a measurement model; this supported the conceptual definitions of neglect. A structural equation model then assessed whether the latent constructs were associated with child adjustment at age 8 years. Low level of perceived support from mother was associated with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Exposure to family conflict was also linked to these problems, and to social difficulties. Finally, children's sense of experiencing little early affection was associated with subsequent externalizing behavior and social problems. The approach of conceptualizing neglect in terms of unmet child needs, developing a measurement model to define latent neglect constructs, and relating these constructs to subsequent adjustment can build our understanding of neglect.

Additionally, we investigated relations among disease-related parental stress, parental state anxiety, and children's behavioral and psychological maladjustment. Results demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and convergent validity for the PIP. Significant and positive relations of medium to large effect sizes between parenting stress and internalizing and externalizing maladjustment were found. Recommendations for use of the PIP in clinical settings and future research directions are discussed.

AB Background: Research has focused on maternal dysphoria and child adjustment. However, family process models indicate gaps in the study of paternal dysphoria, broader family functioning, and diverse child outcomes. Method: A community sample of 235 mothers and fathers of kindergarten children completed measures of depressive symptoms, family functioning and child adjustment. Teachers also provided measures of child adjustment. Results: Supportive of pervasive effects even in a community sample, increased parental depressive symptomatology was related to increased marital conflict, insecure marital attachment, less parental warmth, more psychological control in parenting, and multiple child problems. Child gender moderated child outcomes differently for paternal and maternal dysphoria. Marital relations, but not parenting, mediated child outcomes. Conclusions: Marital problems may be especially reactive to parental depressive symptomatology, so that mediational processes affecting child functioning become evident even in family contexts of relatively low risk.

AB One thousand twenty-four African American and Latino sixth graders participated in a study examining the moderating role of pubertal development on the relation between peer victimization and adolescent self-worth, depressed mood, and physical symptoms using peer and self-reported victimization. It was hypothesized that early-maturing girls who were victimized would experience heightened internalized distress. Among boys, two competing hypotheses were tested: (a) the imbalance of power hypothesis predicted that late-maturing boys who were victimized would experience more psychological distress and (b) the social misfit hypothesis predicted that early-maturing victims would experience more distress. Results indicated that African American and Latina early-maturing boys and girls who were viewed as victims by their peers reported elevated depressed mood and physical symptoms and lower self-worth. The moderating role of early puberty was documented with reputational (peer report) measures of victimization rather than self-report measures, which highlights the social consequences of early maturation.

AB Cognitive and psychological disorders are among the most frequently observed sequelae in brain tumor survivors. The goal of this work was to verify the presence of these disorders in a group of children and adolescents diagnosed with brain tumor before age 18 years, differentiate these disorders according to age of assessment, identify correlations between the two types of impairments and define possible associations between these impairments and clinical variables.
   The study involved 76 patients diagnosed with brain tumor before age 18 years. Three age groups were formed, and all the patients received a standardized battery of age-matched cognitive and psychological tests.
   According to our findings, all three groups present with cognitive and psychological-behavioral disorders. Their frequency varies according to age of onset and is strongly associated to time since diagnosis. The performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) was more impaired than the verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ). Internalizing problems, withdrawal and social problems were the most frequent psychological disorders. Correlations were found between cognitive impairment and the onset of the main psychological and behavioral disorders.
   These findings are relevant as they point out the long-term outcome of brain tumor survivors. Hence, the recommendation to diversify psychological interventions and rehabilitation plans according to the patients' age. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB Objective: Clinical studies of asthmatic children have found an association between lung disease and internalizing behavior problems. The causal direction of this association is, however, unclear. This article examines the nature of the relationship between behavior and asthma problems in childhood and adolescence. Methods: Data were analyzed on 5135 children from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its outcomes (MUSP), a large birth cohort of mothers and children started in Brisbane, Australia, in 1981. Lung disease was measured from maternal reports of asthma/bronchitis when the children were aged 5 and maternal reports of asthma symptoms when the children were aged 14. Symptoms of internalizing behaviors were obtained by maternal reports (Child Behavior Checklist) at 5 years and by maternal and children's reports at 14 years (Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self Report). Results: Although there was no association between prevalence of asthma and externalizing symptoms, asthma and internalizing symptoms were significantly associated in cross-sectional analyses at 5 and 14 years. In prospective analyses, after excluding children with asthma at 5 years, internalizing symptoms at age 5 were not associated with the development of asthma symptoms at age 14. After excluding children with internalizing symptoms at 5 years, those who had asthma at 5 years had greater odds of developing internalizing symptoms at age 14. Conclusion: Children who have asthma/bronchitis by the age of 5 are at greater risk of having internalizing behavior problems in adolescence.

AB Professional wrestling has become an internationally popular type of 'sport entertainment' among youth. The professional wrestling industry targets children as consumers for live events, televised programming and product merchandising. However, the nature of wrestling has changed in the last two decades and many educators are unaware of the themes and messages that wrestling promotes. This article provides a historical and contemporary overview of professional wrestling and discusses the psychological implications of the violence of wrestling on children. In an initial study, measures of wrestling involvement, aggressive response to shame and Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) scores were analysed for 121 male participants (ages 10 to 17). Results indicated that those participants reporting more wrestling involvement tended to respond more aggressively to shame, demonstrated moderately higher levels of school maladjustment, showed higher levels of internalizing problems such as anxiety and social stress and showed lower levels of self-esteem and perceived self-adequacy. Directions for future research and implications for school psychologists are discussed.

ID STRESSFUL LIFE EVENTS; ADJUSTMENT; COMPETENCE; ATTACHMENT; MOTHERS;
   SCHOOL
AB This study investigated the effects of hope, social support, and stress on behavioral problems in a high-risk group of 65 children of incarcerated mothers. Children with low levels of hope had more externalizing and internalizing problems. Children who perceived less social support had more externalizing problems, and children who had experienced more life stressors reported more internalizing problems. Regression analyses indicated that hope contributed unique variance to both internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems after social support and stress were controlled. These findings suggest that being confident in one's ability to overcome challenges and having a positive outlook function as protective factors, whereas being less hopeful may place a child at risk for developing adjustment problems. Whether it is possible to foster agency and teach pathways to children with lower levels of hope is discussed.

AB Many studies have demonstrated that boys are more aggressive than girls (see J. D. Cole & K. Dodge, 1997, for a review) and that emotion regulation difficulties are associated with problematic behaviors (N. Eisenberg & R. A. Fabes, 1999; M. Gilliom, D. S. Shaw, J. E. Beck, M. A. Schonberg, & J. L. Lukon, 2002). However, recent findings indicate that gender differences in aggressive behaviors disappear when assessments are broadened to include relational aggression-behaviors designed to harm the relationship goals of others by spreading rumors, gossiping, and eliciting peer rejection of others. Moreover, although difficulties regulating emotions have been reported for physically aggressive children, little research has examined these processes in relationally aggressive children. This article argues that investigation into the associations between emotion regulation and relational aggression is a critical direction for future research on the etiology and prevention of mental health problems in girls.

ID CHILDHOOD ANXIETY
AB Childhood anxiety disorders often have a poor prognosis. Despite this, there are currently no published treatment protocols for young children with anxiety difficulties. Individually focused therapies (e.g. CBT) are useful for older children, but likely to be less so for this group. This paper describes a pilot investigation of a new CBT based parenting intervention for the treatment of children aged 9 years and under. Sixteen parents of 11 anxious children took part in a 10-week intervention, completing the Child Behaviour Checklist at three time points. The intervention was based on a new cognitively enhanced parenting package, with an emphasis on coping with internalizing symptoms, and with additional modules on the specific skills needed for managing anxiety. All children were reported to experience substantial decreases in their internalizing symptoms by the end of the study. Parents' satisfaction with the intervention was high. This is a promising new intervention for the treatment of a currently neglected group.

AB Background: This study aimed to study how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during adolescence and to examine how self-esteem influences HRQoL.
   Methods: We compared self-esteem, anxiety, and parental reports on behavioral problems in a group of IBD patients to a healthy norm group. Forty children and 38 parents filled out questionnaires separately. Trait anxiety, self-perception, and the data on the Child Behavior Checklist were taken to compare the IBD population with healthy norms, using Student's t tests and 1 -sample t tests. Effect sizes were calculated to show the clinical relevance of the differences. Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the association between disease-related variables and self-perception with HRQoL, anxiety, and problem behavior.
   Results: The results of this study show that adolescents with IBD, especially boys, have a significantly worse HRQoL and show more internalizing problem behavior compared with healthy peers. An important predictor of HRQoL is self-esteem.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, adolescents with IBD are at risk for experiencing problems with their illness. Because self-esteem is an important predictor of HRQoL, it should be taken into account in future interventions for these children.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the associations between persistent childhood sleep problems and adulthood anxiety and depression. Parents of 943 children (52% male) participating in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study provided information on their children's sleep and internalizing problems at ages 5, 7, and 9 years. When the participants were 21 and 26 years, adult anxiety and depression were diagnosed using a standardized diagnostic interview. After controlling for childhood internalizing problems, sex, and socioeconomic status, persistent sleep problems in childhood predicted adulthood anxiety disorders (OR (95% CI) = 1.60 (1.052.45), p =.030) but not depressive disorders (OR (95% CI) =.99 (.63-1.56), p =.959). Persistent sleep problems in childhood may be an early risk indicator of anxiety in adulthood.

AB The primary aim of this pilot study was to ascertain if psychiatric medications could be reduced in a convenience sample of seriously emotionally disturbed children and adolescents over the course of residential treatment. We also sought to understand factors correlated with reduction in the number of medications during treatment. A review of the treatment of 141 patients (n = 112 admitted on medication and n = 29 admitted on no medication) admitted to, and discharged from, a residential treatment setting between 1992 and 2001 was undertaken. Significantly more children were discharged from treatment on no medications than were admitted to residential treatment on no medications. In children receiving more than 1 medication at admission, the number of combine d,medications was significantly reduced over the course of residential treatment. However, the majority of children admitted on medications continued on some psychiatric medications, indicating that psychopharmacology continued to play an important role in their treatment. In 112 patients admitted on psychoactive medications, our pilot data suggests that improvement in externalizing, internalizing, psychotic, and autistic psychopathology while in residential treatment, the presence of an intact family (adoptive or biological), the absence of a history of either sexual or physical abuse, and the type of medication used appear to be factors that correlate with a reduced use of medications in this population.

AB The authors describe psychometric characteristics of the new Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance scale (TPOCS-A; B. D. McLeod, 200 1) and illustrate its use in the study of treatment as usual. The TPOCS-A uses session observation to assess child-therapist and parent-therapist alliance. Both child and parent forms showed acceptable interrater reliability and internal consistency; when applied to cases treated for internalizing disorders, both forms were associated with youth outcomes. Child-therapist alliance during treatment predicted reduced anxiety symptoms at the end of treatment. Parent-therapist alliance during treatment predicted reduced internalizing, anxiety, and depression symptoms at the end of treatment. The findings held up well after confounding variables were controlled, which suggests that both child-therapist and parent-therapist alliance play key (and potentially different) roles in the outcome of treatment as usual.

AB As part of a longitudinal study of the outcomes of very low birth weight children (< 1.5 kg), we sought to examine the perinatal, childhood, and young adult predictors of internalizing symptoms among very low birth weight young women and their normal birth weight controls. The cohort included 125 very low birth weight and 124 normal birth weight 20-year-old subjects. Perinatal, childhood, and young adult predictors were examined via stepwise multivariate analyses. Results revealed very low birth weight to be a significant predictor of parent-reported internalizing symptoms of their daughters but only among white subjects who had mothers with high levels of psychological distress. Additional significant predictors of 20-year internalizing symptoms included child I.Q. and internalizing symptoms at age 8 years and family expressiveness. When the results were analyzed according to the young adult self-report, additional predictors of internalizing symptoms included a history of asthma and exposure to violence. Perinatal risk factors were not found to be predictive of internalizing symptoms at age 20 years. Future studies should prospectively examine social and environmental factors associated with the neonatal intensive care experience that might explain the effect of very low birth weight on later psychopathology.

AB This study compared the psychological adjustment between children with short stature and youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). The Child Behavior Checklist, Children's Depression Inventory, Social Anxiety Scale for Children - Revised, and Asher Loneliness Scale were administered to 58 children (26 with short stature and 32 with DM1) and a parent during a regularly scheduled clinical appointment for endocrinology care. Results show that the parents of children with short stature rated their children as having more social, thought, and attention problems, and exhibiting greater delinquent behavior, as compared to parental ratings of children with DM1. No diagnostic group differences in child or parent-rated internalizing symptoms were found. Implications of these findings for personnel working with children with short stature are discussed.

AB To contribute to the case for a dimensional conceptualization of psychopathology in general and maladaptive personality or personality disorders in particular, the present paper reviews the evidence for a dimensional representation of childhood temperament and personality. The review of temperament and variable-centered as well as person-centered approaches to childhood personality leads us to propose five broadband dimensions that capture individual differences in children and adolescents: extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness/intellect. Our analysis of the CBCL (Achenbach, 1991) and the DIPSI (currently under development at Ghent University), two dimensional models for childhood psychopathology, suggests two common broadband factors, internalizing and externalizing. The relations between the dimensional representation of childhood temperament/personality and psychopathology are documented with data from general population and clinical samples of children and adolescents. The article concludes with a proposal on how the higher-order dimensions emerging from studies of adaptive and maladaptive individual differences in childhood could be integrated in a common dimensional model.

AB Objective: To examine gender differences in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD") symptom comorbidity with "oppositional defiant disorder", "conduct disorder', "separation anxiety disorder", "generalized anxiety disorder", speech therapy, and remedial reading in children. Method: From 1994 to 1995, data from a large sample (N = 4,371) of twins and siblings studied in the Australian Twin ADHD Project were obtained by mailed DSM-IV-based questionnaires, investigating patterns of comorbidity in the three subtypes of "ADHD": "inattentive", "hyperactive/impulsive", and "combined". A total of 1,550 questionnaires were returned (87%) over the next 12 to 18 months. Results: Analysis of variance showed significant between-group differences in males and females for inattention and hyperactive/impulsive symptom counts with higher rates of "oppositional defiant disorder" and "conduct disorder" in males, and higher rates of "separation anxiety disorder" in females indicating internalizing disorders are more common in females and externalizing disorders are occurring more often in males. Differences were found between the "ADHD" subtypes and the no ADHD category for all comorbid conditions, for both males and females. Children without ADHD consistently had fewer symptoms, while children with the combined subtype showed consistently more comorbid symptoms indicating a strong relationship between high rates of externalizing symptoms and high rates of internalizing symptoms. Gender differences in speech therapy were significant only for the children without ADHD. The rates of "separation anxiety disorder" were higher in females with the "inattention" subtype and the rate of "generalized anxiety disorder" higher for females with the "combined" subtype, indicating that the subtypes of ADHD were associated with these internalizing disorders in different ways. Conclusions: Although comorbidity differs among ADHD subtypes, there were no significant gender differences in comorbidity for externalizing disorders. Inattentive girls may present with anxiety. Clinical approaches for both males and females should be sensitive to possible language and reading problems.

AB Contributions of 3 dimensions of parenting (psychological control, warmth, and behavioural control), marital conflict, and attachment style (anxiety and avoidance) to adjustment from early to middle adolescence were assessed. Mediation of marital conflict effects by parenting, and of parenting effects by attachment were examined. Adolescents (n = 175) initially age 13 years reported parenting practices, attachment styles, school grades, self-esteem, and internalizing and externalizing problems twice (T1, T2) 2 years apart. T1 marital conflict was associated with tower self-esteem, more externalizing symptoms, and lower academic achievement at T2, all but the latter mediated by parental wan-nth. T1 parental psychological control was associated with increases in internalizing symptoms over time, an effect not mediated by attachment insecurity, which contributed independently. T1 parental warmth was associated with decreases in externalizing symptoms and increases in self-esteem over time, the latter mediated by attachment security.

   BEHAVIOR; SOCIALIZATION; MALTREATMENT; PERCEPTIONS; COMPETENCE; CONTEXT
AB Intercultural research indicates that two dimensions of parental behavior can be identified in human societies: acceptance and rejection. According to Rohner, parental behavior can be defined as a continuum. In one end of the continuum we could find parents that manifest love and affection towards their children, both verbally and physically In the other, we could find parents with aversive feelings towards their children, who use severe and abusive practices. Parental rejection is, according to Rhoner, the absence or the significant withdrawal of warmth, affection or love from parents toward their children.
   Rohner's framework proposes three dimensions of parental rejection: a) hostility and aggression; b) indifference and negligence and, c) indifferenciated rejection. A long research tradition has demonstrated that parental styles characterized by anger, aggressiveness, and rejection, are related with children's mental health problems. Normally, this field of research has analyzed the relationship between parents and children without differentiating the father from the mother. However, recent research suggests that fathers and mothers, behaviors can have differential effects on the psychological adjustment of their children. Also, research on parents-children relationships, has traditionally used perceptions or observations of either parents or children.
   The definition of a parent as hostile or as rejecting or affectionate and warm can not be made only by observing parents' behavior, since acceptance and rejection are not fixed qualities of behavior. From this point of view the effects of parental behavior on their children depends not only from objective elements but also from children's perceptual and inferential processes. Parents and children do not necessarily perceive in the same fashion parental acceptance, demands or punishments. These caveats underlie the importance of analyzing parental behavior both from parents' and children's perspectives.
   On behalf of these ideas, the aim of this paper is to analyze the relationships between parental and maternal rejection and the psychological and social adjustment of their children. In order to do so, this study will use both children and parents perceptions. That is, this study will observe the children's perceptions of their mothers and fathers behaviors towards them, as well as the perception of their own psychological adjustment. Also, this study will examine parents perceptions of their parental practices as well as parents perceptions of their childrens' psychological and social adjustment.
   Participants in this study are a total of 444 families distributed into two groups (risk and comparison groups). The first group (risk group) consists of 100 families in which parent-child relationships were considered as disfunctional or not adecuate. The second group of families (comparison group) consists of 344 families in which parent-child realtionships were considered as adecuate. The group of families considered at risk were identified by school teachers in public schools (Valencian Community, Spain). Children ranged in age from 7 to 13 years. Of the children 54% were male and 46% female. All the children were amending school at the time of the research. Teachers had also to contact parents to obtain their agreement to collaborate in the study. Of the parents'questionnaires, 77% were completed by mothers and 23% by fathers.
   Measures were the following:
   Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire (PARQ). This self-report questionnaire (Rohner et al.) measures perceptions of parental treatment of the child in terms of four dimensions, a) parental warmth and affection, b) parental hostility and aggression, c) parental indiference and neglect, and c) parental undifferentiated rejection. The two forms used in this study allowed us to obtain three measures of parental acceptance-rejection: parents perceptions of their treatment of their children, and children's perceptions of the way they are treated by both their mothers and fathers. Personality Assesment Questionnaire (PAQ. This self-report questionnaire (Rohner et al.) asseses the way in which children perceive their own personality and behavioral dispositions. The following scales constitute the child PAQ: a) hostility/aggression, b) dependence, c) negative self-esteem, d) negative self-adequacy, e) emotional irresponsiveness, f) emotional uncertainty, and g) negative world views.
   Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). This checklist (Achenbach & Edelbrock) evaluates the behavior problems and social competencies of children as reported by their parents. The behavior problems measure used in this study is composed of two broad dimensions: internalizing and externalizing. Internalizing includes anxious, obsessive, somatic complaints, schizoid behavior, depressed withdrawal, being immature, and being uncommunicative. Externalizing includes being delinquent, aggressive, cruel, or hyperactive.
   Results show that rejected children are psychologically and socially different from those children who have adequate relationships with their parents (characterized by parental acceptance). Rejected children, when compared to children in the comparison group, manifested significantly more problems. The personality of these children was characterized by dependency, low self-esteem and self adjustment, emotional instability, and a negative world view.
   Because an alternative explanation is that those children with Psychological and social problems could bias their perception of their parents behavior as rejecting, this study included also an analvsis of parents perceptions of their treatment of their children, as well as their perceptions of their children behavior. By including both perceptions (parents and children) in the study design, the parent-child interaction can be better defined (in terms of acceptance and rejection), and possible biases in the definition of parental behavior can be avoided.
   These analyses showed that parents from the risk group, when compared to the comparison group, perceive their children as having more behavior problems expressed both in an externalizing fashion (i.e., being aggressive, hyperactive, disobedient, overactive, and destructive), and in an internalizing fashion (i.e., being anxious, uncommunicative, immature, submissive, and withdrawn).
   The results obtained in this study show clearly that rejected children are "different", in both psychological and social dimensions, from other childrens whose parent-child relationships are characterized by parental acceptance. These findings would be consistent with Rohner's parental acceptance-rejection theory according to which these characteristics are manifested by children who experience rejection. Children in the risk group perceive less warmth and affection (expressed psysically or verbally), and more rejection (manifested by hostility and agression, indifference and neglect, and undiferentiated rejection) in the way they were treated by their parents. Also it is interesting to note that these results hold, independently from who is reportimg parental behavior (Parents or children).
   This study has shown that childrens perceived rejection, either from the mother or the father has a negative outcome for their psychological and social adjustment.

DT Article
AB THE PREVALENCE OF mental health problems among youth with hearing loss was assessed with an adjusted version of the Dutch rendition of the Youth Self Report, or YSR (Achenbach, 199 1). The sample totaled 202 youth, aged 11-18 years, with auditory disabilities. The prevalence rates of externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and moderate to severe overall mental health problems were found to be 2-3 times higher than in a normative sample. Deaf participants scored significantly higher than hard of hearing participants in these areas. Main streamed participants scored significantly lower than peers in schools for the deaf or for the hard of hearing. Participants with low IQ scores showed significantly more internalizing and social problems than those with moderate to high scores. The adjusted YSR is recommended for screening in schools and in mental health services for youth with hearing loss for prevention and early intervention.

AB Objective: The cross-cultural applicability of the concept of posttraumatic stress was investigated by assessing symptom frequency and levels of comorbid psychopathology in adolescents from the United States and Russia.
   Method: A self-report survey was conducted in representative samples of 2,157 adolescents 14 to 17 years old from urban communities of the United States (N = 1,212) and Russia (N = 945).
   Results: In both countries, the levels of all three major clusters of posttraumatic symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, and arousal), as well as of internalizing psychopathology, increased along with the level of posttraumatic stress. Expectations about the future had a tendency to decrease with increasing posttraumatic stress. No differences between countries in significant interaction effects for symptom levels were found.
   Conclusions: The current findings suggest that posttraumatic symptoms and their associations with other adolescent mental health problems are not culture bound and that the psychological consequences of trauma follow similar dynamics cross-culturally.

AB This study examined whether attachment theory could be used to shed light on the often high degree of discordance between self- and observer ratings of behavioral functioning and symptomatology. Interview-based assessments of attachment organization, using the Adult Attachment Interview, were examined as predictors of the lack of agreement between self- and other reports of behavioral and emotional problems among 176 moderately at-risk adolescents. Lack of agreement was measured in terms of concordance of adolescent and parent or close friend report on equivalent measures of behavioral and emotional adjustment. Insecure-dismissing attachment was linked to less agreement in absolute terms between self- and mother reports of externalizing symptoms, and between adolescent and close friend reports of behavioral conduct. Insecure-preoccupied attachment was associated with higher levels of adolescent reporting of internalizing and externalizing symptoms relative to parent reports of adolescent symptornatology. The findings suggest that attachment organization may be one factor that accounts for individual differences in the degree of discordance between self- and other reports of symptoms in adolescence.

AB This study compared the structure and quality of emotion language in adolescents with externalizing disorders (N = 21), internalizing disorders (N = 18), and without a behavioral or emotional disorder (N = 16). Emotion language was elicited in response to vignette material prototypical for anger/sadness and fear, to autobiographical experiences, and to an actual emotional challenge. The findings reveal different emphases in the emotion language of internalizing and externalizing youth rather than a relative weakness for externalizing adolescents. Overall, clinical adolescents used fewer emotion terms that were semantically specific for anger, sad, or fear than typical adolescents. The results also show that emotion language is affected differentially for externalizing and internalizing adolescents depending on the emotion domain. Internalizing youth's emotion language to anger/sad events used inner-directed terms, situational references, and reduced intensity while their representation of emotions in response to salient threatening material was dominated by terms with a cognitive focus. Externalizing adolescents' emotion language responses to anger/sad events were more outer directed and intense, and their emotion language in a salient threat situation more orientated to direct affective terms. The results suggest that examining emotion language for specific emotion domains in adolescents with specific disorders will better clarify the role of emotion language in the regulation of emotions than approaches that globalize emotion language competencies or deficits.

AB A model linking children's peer acceptance in the classroom to academic performance via academic self-concept and internalizing symptoms was tested in a longitudinal study. A sample of 248 children was followed from 4th to 6th grade, with data collected from different informants in each year of the study to reduce respondent bias. A path analysis supported the model; a lack of peer acceptance in the classroom in 4th grade predicted lower academic self-concept and more internalizing symptoms the following year, which in turn, predicted lower academic performance in 6th grade. An alternative path with internalizing symptoms predicting declines in peer acceptance was tested and received some support as well. Implications of the findings for schools are discussed.

AB Aims. - To evaluate the effects of internal displacement and resettlement within Turkey on the emotional and behavioral profile of children, age 5-18 after controlling for possible confounding and demographic variables.
   Method. - We conducted a national population survey using a self-weighted, equal probability sample. We compared the CBCL, TRF and YSR responses regarding children with (n = 1644) and without (n = 1855) experience of internal displacement. We examined the effects of gender, age, paternal employment, resettlement, urban residence and physical illness.
   Results. - The children and adolescents with internal displacement had significantly higher internalizing, externalizing and total problem scores on the CBCL and YSR, and higher internalizing scores on the TRF. The effect of displacement was related to higher internalizing problems when factors like physical illness, child age, child gender and urban residence were accounted. The overall effect was small explaining only 0.1-1.5% of the total variance by parent reports, and not evident by teacher reports.
   Discussion. - To our knowledge the present study is the first to examine Turkish children and adolescents with and without experience of internal displacement. The results are consistent with previous immigration studies: child age, gender, presence of physical illness and urban residence were more important predictors of internalization and externalization problem scores irrespective of informant source.

AB Introduction: Our goal was to evaluate the impact of depressed mothers' marital intimacy and attachment security in romantic relationships on children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Method: Forty-six clinically depressed mothers rated attachment security, marital intimacy, and symptoms shown by their children aged 8 to 12. Results: Maternal avoidance of closeness predicted increases in children's internalizing symptoms over a 6-month period. Discussion: Avoidance of closeness in depressed mothers may be implicated in the development of internalizing symptoms in their children, possibly because individuals who are avoidant of closeness are poor caregivers.

AB This study tested interactive effects of quantity and type (center-based versus other) of non-parental care, and infant temperament, on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors at 2(1)/(2), controlling for childcare quality. Sixty-four mothers and children participated. Mothers rated depressive symptoms prenatally, infant temperament at 5 months, childcare quality and child behavior at 2(1)/(2) years, and reported childcare arrangements. At 6 months, infants were videotaped to obtain a measure of activity in response to novelty. Based on ANCOVA, long hours in non-parental care were associated with: (1) more externalizing for children in center care identified as easily frustrated as infants; and (2) more internalizing for children identified as both highly distressed and highly active in response to novelty as infants. Children in higher quality childcare were less externalizing and internalizing than those in lower quality childcare; this effect remained significant with all other variables controlled.

AB The purpose of the present study was to clarify behavioral and emotional characteristics of abused children who had been placed in children's-homes. We asked children's-home caretakers to complete Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) forms for 142 children (40 boys aged 4-11; 45 boys aged 12-18; 25 girls aged 4-11; 32 girls aged 12-18). The results revealed that the girls had higher Internalizing scores than the boys. Most notably the 12-18-year-old girls had higher scores for Somatic Complaints and Social Problems. Comparison between the children who had been abused (N = 91) and those who had not (N = 51) showed that the former had significantly higher scores for Social Problems, Thinking Problems, Attention Problems, Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive Behavior, Externalizing, and Total Problems. The abused group had more children who were considered to be clinically significant because of their scores on Social Problems, Attention Problems, Aggressive Problems, Externalizing, and Total Problems. The present results reveal the behavioral and emotional problems of children who have been abused and indicate the necessity of providing psychological care for them.

After controlling for seventh grade functioning, recent exposure to violence uniquely predicted worsening of functioning from seventh to eighth grade across multiple self- and teacher-reported measures including self-reported internalizing symptoms, self-reported aggression, and teacher-reported competencies. Adolescents who felt more connected to school showed decreased psychological problems front seventh to eighth grade. Perceived school connection, however, did not moderate the relationship between exposure to violence and psychological functioning. Findings highlighted family support as a moderator of the relationship between exposure to violence and adolescent mental health. Implications for interventions to promote healthier adolescent functioning under stress are discussed.

AB Objective: The identification of specific temperament dimensions as correlates or risk factors for psychopathology in infancy, childhood and adolescence might provide key information to elucidate causal mechanisms that underlie these relationships. Methods: A non-clinical sample of 1010 students (518 males and 492 females) without major psychiatric disorders was given psychometric assessment using TEMPS-I (the Italian Semi-structured Interview version of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, and San Diego) and EBC (Emotional and Behavioral Checklist in Infancy, Childhood and Adolescence). Grouping the subjects on the basis of the highest z-score obtained on each of the four temperament scales of TEMPS-I, it was possible to identify the dominant affective temperamental (AT) inclination of each individual: 283 (28.0%) subjects were classified as dominant depressive temperament, 446 (44.2%) as dominant hyperthymic, 221 (21.9%) as dominant cyclothymic, and 60 (5.9%) as dominant irritable. The effects of AT dominant groups oil EBC scores were tested by one-way analysis of variance. To control for age and sex effects, we tested the differences within dominant AT groups by a multiple classification analysis (MCA). Results: As expected, subjects with depressive temperament traits were characterized by social inhibition and lack of antisocial and hyperactive behavior. Cyclothymic subjects reported the highest number of emotional and behavioral problems, compared with the other dominant ATs (depressive, hyperthymic and irritable). In particular, a cyclothymic disposition was most frequently associated with anxiety-sleep disturbances, sensitivity to separation. eating disturbances in females and antisocial-aggressive behavior in males. The relationship between cyclothymic temperament and anxiety-sleep disturbances and antisocial-aggressive behavior increased with age. Limitations: Cross-sectional study based on retrospective evaluation. Conclusions: Within a juvenile population, depressive temperament is a construct partially overlapping with behavioral inhibition, while extremes of emotionality and behaviors occur preponderantly in those with cyclothymic traits. The cyclothymic disposition turned out to be the most 'morbid', and associated with both internalizing and externalizing disturbances. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Cumulative risk research has established the deleterious effects of co-occurring risk factors on child behavior outcomes. However, extant literature has not addressed potential differential effects of cumulative risk at different points in development and has left open questions about whether a threshold model or a linear risk model better describes the impact of cumulative risk on behavior outcomes. The current study examined the impact of cumulative risk factors (i.e., child maltreatment, inter-parental violence, family disruption, low socioeconomic status, and high parental stress) in early and middle childhood on child behavior outcomes in adolescence. Methods: Using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of at-risk urban children (N = 171), the cumulative effects of these five risk factors across early and middle childhood were investigated. Results: The findings support the cumulative risk hypothesis that the number of risks in early childhood predicts behavior problems in adolescence. Evidence for a linear but not a threshold model of cumulative risk was found; the more risks present, the worse the child outcome. Moreover, the presence of multiple risks in early childhood continues to explain variations in predicting adolescent behavior outcomes even after including the effects of risk in middle childhood. Conclusions: The results support the need for comprehensive prevention and early intervention efforts with high-risk children, such that there does not appear to be a point beyond which services for children are hopeless, and that every risk factor we can reduce matters.

AB This study examined hostile intent and causal, critical self-referent attributions for ambiguous peer cues to examine the hypothesis that these latter interpretations would be uniquely associated with symptoms of depression, social anxiety, and loneliness. Critical self-referent attributions were assessed in 116 kindergarteners (Study 1) and 159 adolescents (Study 2) using a hypothetical vignette procedure, replicating past work on social information processing. In both samples, critical self-referent attributions were concurrently associated with depressive symptoms as reported by teacher (Study 1), peer and self-report (Study 2). Critical self-referent attributions also were concurrently associated with loneliness and with actual peer experiences, including peer rejection in both studies. Results from both studies support a cognitive vulnerability-stress model, suggesting that the tendency to derive critical self-referent attributions from ambiguous peer experiences is most closely associated with depressive symptoms when accompanied by high levels of peer victimization. Longitudinal findings (Study 2) offers preliminary evidence for this cognitive vulnerability-stress model as a predictor of adolescents' depressive symptoms over a 17-month interval.

AB We investigated the relations between affiliation with Mexican culture and self-esteem at baseline (Time 1 [T1]), and internalizing symptoms 2 years later (Time 2 [T2]) among a sample of high-risk Mexican American adolescents. Results indicated that T1 affiliation with Mexican culture was not related to T2 internalizing symptoms, controlling for T1 internalizing symptoms. The relation between T1 self-esteem and T2 internalizing symptoms was significant, controlling for T1 internalizing symptoms. Regression analyses revealed, for girls only, a significant interaction between affiliation with Mexican culture and self-esteem in the prediction of T2 internalizing symptoms. Specifically, low self-esteem was a risk factor for internalizing symptoms only among those girls minimally affiliated with Mexican culture. There was no significant interaction between cultural affiliation and self-esteem among Mexican American boys. Findings high light the importance of gender and culture in risk processes for internalizing symptoms.

AB College students and a subsample of their mothers and fathers participated in a study examining their retrospective reports of childhood emotional and behavioral problems experienced by college students. College students and their mothers and fathers exhibited moderate correspondence in their recollection of internalizing and externalizing problems that college students experienced during their childhood. In contrast, college students tended to endorse significantly greater levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems relative to their mothers and fathers. Current psychological symptoms predicted the greater endorsement of childhood internalizing and externalizing problems by college students and the greater endorsement of college students' childhood internalizing problems by their mothers. Further, college students' current perceptions of their parents predicted their endorsement of childhood internalizing problems, and college students' current masculinity and femininity predicted their endorsement of childhood externalizing problems. Results of this study emphasized the importance of noting factors that may be related to retrospective reports. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Examined 6-month post-recruitment clinical and placement outcomes for 31 youths with serious emotional disturbance (SED) at imminent risk of out-of-home placement in the Hawaii Continuum of Care (COC). Youths were randomly assigned to multisystemic therapy (MST) adapted for SED populations or to Hawaii's existing COC services. Assessments were conducted at intake and 6 months after referral. In comparison with counterparts in the comparison condition, youths in the MST condition reported significant reductions in externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and minor criminal activity; their caregivers reported near significant increases in social support; and archival records showed that MST youths experienced significantly fewer days in out-of-home placement. The findings generally replicate the favorable short-term outcomes observed previously for MST with youths experiencing SED.

AB Objective To examine psychosocial predictors of distress (mood disturbance, perceived stress, caregiver burden) in parents of children undergoing stem cell or bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Method Measures of prior illness experiences, premorbid child behavior problems, family environment, social support, and parental coping behavior were obtained from the resident parents of 151 children prior to the children's admission for BMT. Parents subsequently completed assessments of their mood disturbance, perceived stress, and caregiving burden on a weekly basis through week +6 post-BMT, and then monthly through month +6 post-BMT. Results Significant changes were observed in parental distress across the course of BMT. After correcting for demographic and medical factors, several significant predictors of parental distress trajectories were identified, including prior parent and patient illness-related distress, premorbid child internalizing behavior problems, the family relationship dimensions of the family environment, and parental avoidant coping behaviors. Multivariable models were developed using a hierarchical modeling approach. The best-fit model accounted for approximately 50% of the variance in parental global distress. Conclusions Subgroups of parents at higher risk for increased distress during the acute phase of transplant have been identified. These findings can help target parents who may be in greater need of intervention aimed at reducing transplant-related distress.

AB Fifteen children with selective mutism (SM), 15 children with anxiety disorders (AD) without selective mutism, and 15 children without anxiety disorders or selective mutism (CN) were compared to examine the relationship between selective mutism and anxiety. Data were collected from children (age 4-10 years), parents, teachers, and clinicians. Results indicated that children with SM closely resemble children with AD. All children with SM received a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and 53% received a diagnosis for an additional anxiety disorder. In addition, the SM and AD groups differed substantially from controls with respect to parent- and teacher-rated internalizing behavior problems. No differences among the groups were found with respect to parent- and teacher-reported externalizing behavior problems. The results are consistent with prior research emphasizing the association between selective mutism and anxiety disorders, and suggest that selective mutism may be conceptualized, assessed, and treated as an anxiety-related problem.

AB This study examined the psychometric properties of an age-downward version of the Carver and White (1994) BIS/BAS scales. Normal school children (N = 284) aged 8-12 years completed the BIS/BAS scales as well as scales of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and psychopathological symptoms. Results showed that the BIS/BAS scales for children had a theoretically meaningful factor structure and satisfactory reliability. Relationships with Eysenck's personality traits of Neuroticism, and Extraversion, and psychopathological symptoms were generally as expected. That is, Neuroticism was positively associated with both BIS and BAS. whereas Extraversion was negatively related to BIS but positively to BAS. Further, BIS was convincingly connected to higher levels of internalizing symptoms, whereas BAS was to a certain level related to externalizing symptoms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study examined the cross-ethnic measurement equivalence of the Shortform Assessment for Children (SAC) using a sample of 562 African American and 692 White children. Method: A prospective, two-panel survey design was used in this study. Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were used to conduct analyses of the reliability and validity of the SAC for each group. Results: Alpha reliabilities and test-retest reliabilities for the full scale and for each subscale (i.e., externalizing and internalizing) were good for both groups. There were more similarities than there were differences between the two groups in terms of criterion validity. Factorial equivalence findings suggested that the factor structure of the SAC was equivalent across the two groups. Conclusions: The SAC is a valid behavioral rating scale that can be used by social work practitioners and service providers working with African American and White children in the child welfare and juvenile system.

AB The 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome) is associated with elevated rates of psychosis, and is also characterized by severe attentional difficulties and executive dysfunction. Behavioral manifestations of this syndrome could result from haploinsufficiency of the catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT) gene, located within the 22q11 region. The goal of the present study was to examine COMT genotype in relation to behavioral symptomatology in this syndrome. Val(158/108)Met was genotyped in 38 patients ( 16 Met/ -, 22 Val/-) with confirmed 22q11.2 deletions who had received the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as part of a comprehensive evaluation. Results indicated that the Val genotype was associated with significantly greater internalizing and externalizing behavioral symptomatology in children with 22q11.2 deletions. Val allele status was associated with a greater-than-four-fold increase in risk for clinically significant behavior problems in children with this syndrome. These data are consistent with previous findings of increased psychopathology associated with the Val genotype in normal individuals and suggest that a functional genetic polymorphism in the 22q11 region may influence behavior in individuals with COMT haploinsufficiency.

AB This study examined the relations between maternal criticism and externalizing and internalizing symptoms in adolescents who varied in their risk for psychopathology. Both maternal-effects and child-effects models were examined. The sample consisted of 194 adolescents (mean age = 11.8 years) and their mothers; 146 mothers had a history of depressive disorders and 48 did not. When adolescents were in 6th and 8th grade, maternal criticism was measured with the five-minute speech sample and adolescents' symptoms were assessed with the. Child Behavior Checklist. Maternal criticism was significantly associated with both adolescents' externalizing and internalizing symptoms, beyond the contribution of the chronicity/severity of mothers' depression history. Maternal criticism did not mediate the relation between maternal depression and adolescent symptoms. In contrast, adolescent externalizing behaviors mediated the relation between chronicity/severity of maternal depression history and maternal criticism in 6th grade. Prospective analyses showed that adolescents' externalizing symptoms in 6th grade significantly predicted maternal criticism in 8th grade, controlling for maternal depression history and prior maternal criticism. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of examining child-effects models in studies of maternal criticism.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the point prevalence of psychotropic medication use, and to describe relationships between child-level characteristics, provider type, and medication use among children in the child welfare system.
   Methods: The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being is the first nationally representative study of children coming into contact with the child welfare system. We used data from its baseline and 12-month follow-up waves, and conducted weighted bivariate analyses on a sample of 3114 children and adolescents, 87% of whom were residing in-home.
   Results: Overall, 13.5% of children in child welfare were taking psychotropic medications in 2001-2002. Older age, male gender, Caucasian race/ethnicity, history of physical abuse, public insurance, and borderline scores on the internalizing and externalizing subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist were associated with higher proportions of medication use. African-American and Latino ethnicities, and a history of neglect, were associated with lower proportions of medication use.
   Conclusions: These national estimates suggest that children in child welfare settings are receiving psychotropic medications at a rate between 2 and 3 times that of children treated in the community. This suggests a need to further understand the prescribing of psychotropic medications for child welfare children.

AB Background: The aim of this investigation was to examine the construct validity and distinctiveness of the inattentive type (IT) and combined type (CT) of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in a Latino/Hispanic sample. Method: A comprehensive assessment was conducted with a clinically diagnosed school-based sample of 98 children aged 6 to 11 (CT = 44; IT = 25; control group = 29). Results: Both ADHD groups were impaired on academic achievement measures, presented more ADHD-type behaviors during math and vigilance tasks, and exhibited greater internalizing symptoms. The IT group had a later onset of inattention symptoms, presented more sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms, was less prone to initiate social interactions or to be assertive and more self-controlled in social interchanges, was less likely to have externalizing behaviors, had mothers who reported less child-related family stress, and was less impaired in their adaptive functioning. Conclusions: Findings supported the construct validity of ADHD in this culturally different sample and suggested that the CT and IT represent distinct disorders.

AB Objective: This evaluative study assessed the effect of a creative expression program designed to prevent emotional and behavioral problems and to enhance self-esteem in immigrant and refugee children attending multiethnic schools. Method: The 12-week program involved 138 children, aged 7 to 13, registered in both integration classes designed for immigrant children and regular classes at two elementary schools. Pretest and posttest data were collected from the children themselves and from their teacher. Teachers used Achenbach's Teacher's Report Form to assess the emotional and behavioral symptoms of their pupils whereas children self-reported their symptoms with the Dominic, a computerized questionnaire. Self-esteem was measured with the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale administered by inter-viewers to the children. Results: At the end of the program, the children in the experimental groups reported lower mean levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and higher mean levels of feelings of popularity and satisfaction than the children in the control groups, when controlling for baseline data. In integration classes, the effect on self-esteem was especially notable in boys. The intervention's effect on internalizing and externalizing symptoms was not modified by gender, age or fluency in the mainstream language. Conclusion: The study provides some evidence that creative workshops in the classroom can have a beneficial effect on the self-esteem and symptomatology of immigrant and refugee children from various cultures and backgrounds. These quantitative results support previous qualitative analysis showing that the workshops participate in the reconstruction of a meaningful personal world while simultaneously strengthening the link of the child to the group. They also transform the teachers' perceptions of newcomers by placing an emphasis on their strength and their resilience, while not negating their vulnerabilities.

AB This study examines the ways in which different family processes and personal experiences of social contexts are related to the adjustment of adolescents in a subsample of 755 mother-child dyads drawn from the National Survey of Families and Households. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine a model in which joint family contexts (socioeconomic resources), mothers' and adolescents' experiences of outside-family contexts (perceived social network quality and experience of school stress, respectively), and individual characteristics of mothers (distress) were expected to relate to adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behaviors through their association with within-family contexts (mother-adolescent conflict, family warmth). This conceptual model was supported by the data. Pathways were consistent for boys and girls.

ID ADOLESCENT PSYCHOTHERAPY; CHILDREN
AB Teacher ratings of 336 preschool children ( mean age = 48 months) attending two urban Head Start programs were collected to examine the influence of contextual variables of teacher training, classroom, and site on the prevalence of significant problems. The prevalence of externalizing behaviors in the "problem range" was higher than expected and fewer children were rated in the "well-adjusted range" on social competence measures. Psychometric characteristics of the ratings indicated that teachers in this urban setting were less consistent in their ratings of internalizing problems, calling into question the lack of elevation of such problems in this population. Ratings by teachers and teacher assistants of the same children showed low agreement; the level of ratings was not affected by differences in training but did vary across classrooms. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses of the entire sample showed significant effects of classroom and site on problem behaviors and social competence. These results reveal the wide variation in problem frequency across classrooms, which needs to be considered in the implementation and evaluation of evidence-based interventions. Further, these results point to the importance of studying possible lasting effects on children exposed to these differing contexts.

AB Fear and anxiety are common experiences throughout childhood and adolescence. Anxiety disorders, along with depression and dysthymia, are characterized as internalizing disorders; they stand in distinction from the externalizing disorders representing such conditions as oppositional-defiant disorder and conduct disorder. Clinicians evaluating anxiety disorders in college youth face the task of differentiating normal, transient, developmentally appropriate expression of anxiety from pathologic states of anxiety. The developmental course of anxiety and depression, its appropriateness, and its boundaries are areas of research and interest. A wide clinical perspective is necessary to effectively engage the assessment process. The treatment of anxiety and depression in youth is ideally multi-modal, involving medication, psychotherapy, and psychosocial interventions. This article focuses on assessment and treatment of anxiety and depression. These are presented separately, although areas of overlap often are encountered in practice.

AB 71 Abstract Background Few studies of the time to remission and first relapse in severe bipolar disorder have been based on epidemiologically defined samples or have examined patient characteristics and time-varying indicators of medication use simultaneously. Using a cohort from the Suffolk County Mental Health Project, we describe these temporal patterns and their relationships with childhood, illness, and treatment characteristics. Method A multi-facility cohort of 123 first-admission inpatients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder with psychotic features was followed for 4 years. Dates of the first complete remission (lasting at least 2 months), subsequent relapses, and use of antimanic (AM), antipsychotic (AP), and antidepressant (AD) medications were recorded. Childhood and illness characteristics were ascertained at baseline using standard instruments. Results By the 4-year point, 83.7% had achieved a full remission, with 42.3 % remitting within 3 months, 63.4 % within 6 months, and 74.8 % within I year. Overall, younger age of onset, history of childhood psychopathology, and higher Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) anxiety/depression scores were significantly associated with longer time to remission. Discontinuing AM, AP and AD (compared to never using) and taking AP and AD (compared to never using) were significantly associated with remission in the multivariate analysis. Of the 103 participants with complete remission, 61.2 % suffered a relapse; 24.3 % relapsed within 6 months of remission, and 35.9 % within a year. Overall, 32.5 % of the 123 participants had a single episode followed by full remission. Childhood internalizing-type problems, higher BPRS anxiety/depression and Hamilton depression scores, and an admission episode not involving mania, but not patterns of medication use, were associated with shorter time to relapse. Conclusion By 4-year follow-up, the majority of severely ill bipolar patients had remitted from their initial episode, but more than half subsequently relapsed. illness characteristics, especially depressive symptoms, and medication treatment were associated with the early course, although medication use after remission was not associated with relapse.

AB Very little is known about the intellectual abilities and adaptive behavior of individuals who have Kabuki syndrome, beyond the fact that most individuals with this syndrome have mental retardation. To fill this gap, we have completed psychological assessments of 11 children and adolescents with Kabuki syndrome. Results indicated that most of the participants functioned in the range of mild mental retardation, with both intellectual and adaptive behavior in the mildly deficient range and problem behaviors, if any, limited to mild difficulties with inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity and mild problems with obsession/anxiety. At the lower extreme, one child evidenced severe mental retardation and profound adaptive behavior impairment accompanied by serious externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. At the upper extreme, one adolescent had average intelligence and adaptive behavior, with problem behaviors well within the normal range for his chronological age. Most participants evidenced relative intellectual strengths in verbal and reasoning abilities and a relative weakness in visuospatial construction abilities. This pattern affected adaptive behavior as well, yielding a relative strength in Social Interaction and Communicative Skills and considerable weakness in Motor Skills and Personal Living Skills.

AB Previous research findings suggest that depressive symptoms at children may co-occur with problem behaviors such as conduct disorder, hyperactivity or social problems. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between the self-reported depressive symptoms measured by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and degree of problem behaviors assessed by the Youth Self-Report Form of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Non-referred sample of 130 children and adolescents aged from 12 to 16 years was examined. Children with depressive symptoms displayed more internalizing as well as externalizing problems; particularly, they scored higher than non-depressive children in social problems, attention problems, thought problems, and aggressive and delinquent behavior scales. Our results support the expected linkage of child and adolescent depression.

AB In this study, 126 children were observed at 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years. During infancy, latencies to reach for novel objects were measured. At 2 years, positive and negative affect, and behavioral approach-inhibition to low- and high-intensity situations were coded, and mothers assessed behavior problems. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a 3-dimension model of positivity, negativity, and behavioral approach-inhibition. Positivity was related to low- and high-intensity behavioral approach-inhibition, whereas negativity was linked only to low-intensity behavioral approach-inhibition. Shorter 12-month latencies to reach were predictive of low negativity, high positivity, and behavioral approach at 2 years. Positivity and negativity were correlated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors, respectively. Finally, cluster analysis identified an exuberant group high in externalizing and an inhibited group high in internalizing.

AB Individuals with tic disorders are at risk for experiencing functional impairment in a variety of domains. However, the impact of tic disorders on family functioning remains unclear partly because psychometrically sound assessment instruments with normative data from a tic disorder population do not exist. The current study provides preliminary normative, descriptive, and internal consistency data for the Impact on Family Scale (IFS): an instrument designed to measure the impact of children's chronic illness on family functioning. Parents of 45 children diagnosed with a tic disorder completed the IFS. The relationship between IFS scores, tic severity, and measures of comorbid symptomology was also investigated. Significant correlations were found between the IFS Total score and measures of ADHD symptomology, tic severity, depressive symptoms, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Regression analyses show that tic severity did not significantly predict family impact after accounting for variance associated with ADHD and internalizing symptoms.

AB Improving parental discipline practices is a central target of behavioral parent training programs, but little research has examined how discipline varies as a function of gender. Based on the assumption that socialization practices might be related to gender differences in psychopathology, we examined relations: between parenting and problem behaviors in children. We predicted that parents would be overreactive toward children displaying symptoms inconsistent with gender stereotypes and lax towards those with gender stereotype-consistent behavior. Parents of 112 preschool-aged children reported on their children's externalizing and internalizing symptoms, and their own lax and overreactive parenting. As hypothesized, internalizing symptoms in girls and externalizing symptoms in boys predicted lax parenting, while externalizing behaviors in girls and internalizing symptoms in boys were associated with overreactive parenting. Exploratory analyses suggest that relations differed somewhat as a function of sociocultural status, pointing to the need for future studies to consider social context.

AB In an effort to understand the reasons that young children might be referred for psychological services, ratings provided by mothers who had contacted a psychology clinic were compared to those provided by mothers who were college Students. Results Of this Study suggest that children who were referred for psychological services were rated as. having significantly higher levels of internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems as well as significantly lower levels of competence. Mothers of referred children rated themselves as having significantly lower levels of positive perceptions and higher levels of negative perceptions toward their children. These mothers also endorsed significantly lower levels of limit setting and higher levels of parenting stress. Mothers did not differ in their own characteristics. These findings suggest that interventions for young children and their families should be designed to address the emotional and behavioral functioning of the children as well as the parent-child relationship.

AB As part of a larger longitudinal study, a sample of 269 predominantly low-income and minority caregiver-child dyads were recruited when the children were infants, and received annual interviews from ages 2 to 7. Almost two-thirds of the sample had been reported as maltreated. Over the course of the study, 49.4% of the children were reported by their parents as needing services at some point in time and most of these eventually received services; the probability of needing and receiving services increased with child age. Far fewer children received services for internalizing (6.7%) and life stress (5.6%) problems than for externalizing (22.3%) or other psychosocial problems (23.4%). Maltreatment did not predict receipt of services, nor did most demographic factors. However, girls and African American children had reduced likelihood of receiving services, especially for externalizing problems. Girls were less likely than boys to be perceived as needing mental health treatment, but there was no discrepancy in perceived need between African American and white children. Child gender and ethnicity are associated with parent-identified child mental health needs and with the receipt of mental health services. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Parents and teachers completed measures of children's (N = 185; ages 6 through 9 years) adjustment, negative emotionality. regulation, and behavior control; behavioral measures of regulation also were obtained. In general. both internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with negative emotionality. Externalizers were low in effortful regulation and high in impulsivity, whereas internalizers, compared with nondisordered children, were low in impulsivity but not effortful control. Moreover, indices of negative emotionality. regulation. and impulsivity with the level of the same variables 2 years before controlled predicted stability versus change in problem behavior status.

ID ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; DISORDER SYMPTOMS; SEIZURES
AB Purpose: Children with epilepsy experience sleep disturbances, behavioral and attentional problems at higher rates than their peers. However, the relation between sleep disturbances and the observed behavioral and attentional abnormalities is poorly defined.
   Methods: Children with primary generalized epilepsy who were seizure free and between the ages of 5 and 18 years were matched with age- and gender-matched healthy controls and underwent two consecutive nights of nocturnal polysomnography with extended electroencephalography. Connor's Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was administered to assess daytime attentional function. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess their emotional-behavioral status. Two sample t tests were used to examine group differences. Spearman correlations were used to examine the relation between sleep variables and behavior and attention variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of abnormal behavior and attention among patients.
   Results: Eleven children with primary generalized epilepsy and eight age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. Children with epilepsy had longer stage 1 sleep percentage (7.19 +/- 3.2 vs. 4.8 +/- 3.5; p = 0.05) and latency to rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (123.5 +/- 40.1 vs. 101.75 +/- 24.3; p = 0.018) compared with controls. Children with epilepsy had worse attention (CPT index, 10.94 +/- 6.55 vs. 3.42 +/- 4.04; p = 0.004) and exhibited significantly higher CBCL Total Behavior and Internalizing Behavior Problem scales. Whereas regression analysis showed no independent predictors of abnormal behavior and attention, a tendency toward association between CBCL total behavior scale and REM percentage (r = 0.55; p = 0.07), and between CPT overall index and stage 1 sleep percentage (r = 0.40; p = 0.10) was noted.
   Conclusions: Sleep architecture is abnormal in children with primary generalized epilepsy. Further studies are needed to determine whether abnormalities in sleep architecture contribute to poor daytime behavior and attention.

AB Similarity in personality between adolescents and their parents may have considerable implications for adolescent well-being. We studied how the similarity in personality between 288 adolescents and their parents is linked to adolescent problem behaviour and whether this link is mediated by warmth and control in the parent-child relationship and moderated by the personality type of the adolescent. Similarity in personality between adolescents and their parents was negatively related to internalizing and externalizing problem behaviour both concurrently and over time. This relation was not mediated by the parent-child relationship. The effects were present for overcontrolled but not for resilient or undercontrolled adolescents.

AB Short stature is not the only problem faced by children born small for gestational age (SGA). Being born SGA has also been associated with lowered intelligence, poor academic performance, low social competence and behavioural problems. This paper summarizes the results of a randomized, double-blind, growth hormone (GH) dose-response study (1 or 2 mg/m(2)/day [similar to 0.035 or 0.07 mg/kg/day]) on growth, intelligence quotient (IQ) and psychosocial functioning in 79 children born SGA at the start, and after 2 and 8 years of GH therapy, and addresses the associations with head circumference. Mean age at start of therapy was 7.4 years; mean duration of GH treatment was 8.0 years. In 2001, 91% of children born SGA had reached a normal height (> -2.0 standard deviation score [SDS]). Block-design s-score (Performal IQ) and Total IQ score increased (p < 0.001 for both indices) from scores significantly lower than those of Dutch peers at the start of therapy (p < 0.001) to scores that were comparable to those of Dutch peers in 2001. Vocabulary s-score (Verbal IQ) was normal at the start of therapy and remained so overtime. Externalizing Problem Behaviour SIDS and Total Problem Behaviour SDS improved during GH therapy (p < 0.01-0.05) to scores comparable to those of Dutch peers. Internalizing Problem Behaviour SIDS was comparable to that of Dutch peers at the start of therapy and remained so, whereas Self-Perception improved from the start of GH therapy until 2001 (p < 0.001), when it reached normal scores. Head circumference SIDS at the start of GH therapy and head growth during GH therapy were positively related to all IQ scores (p < 0.01), whereas neither were related to height SDS at the start of, or to its improvement during, GH therapy. A significant improvement in height and head circumference in children born SGA was seen after only 3 years of GH therapy, in contrast to randomized SGA controls. In conclusion, most children born SGA showed a normalization of height during GH therapy and, in parallel to this, a significant improvement in Performal IQ and Total IQ. In addition, problem behaviour and self-perception improved significantly. Interestingly, Performal, Verbal and Total IQ scores were positively related to head circumference, both at the start of, and during, GH therapy; head circumference increased in GH-treated children born SGA, but not in untreated SGA controls. These results are encouraging but also warrant confirmational studies and further investigations into the effects of GH on the central nervous system. Copyright (c) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB This study examined longitudinal associations between child temperament (fearfulness, irritability, positive emotionality, self-regulation) and parenting (acceptance, involvement, inconsistent discipline) in predicting children's internalizing and externalizing problems using a community sample (N = 92) of children (ages 8 - 11) and their mothers. Cross-reporter measures of all variables were created using mother and child report on questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses were used to test whether parenting predicted later temperament, controlling for prior levels of temperament and parenting, whether temperament predicted later parenting, controlling for prior levels of temperament and parenting, and whether temperament and parenting together accounted for subsequent adjustment problems. Child irritability predicted greater inconsistent discipline. Child fearfulness and positive emotionality predicted greater maternal acceptance. Maternal inconsistent discipline predicted greater fearfulness and irritability. The evidence suggests bidirectional relations between temperament and parenting such that inconsistent discipline may increase negative emotionality in children, and child irritability may evoke inconsistent discipline by parents. Fearfulness, irritability, acceptance, and inconsistent discipline demonstrated unique effects above all other temperament and parenting variables in predicting adjustment problems, suggesting that temperament and parenting are additive in their effects on child adjustment.

Seventy-four parent-adolescent dyads completed a structured interaction task prior to the start of treatment that was coded using an established autononous-relatedness measure. Adolescent drug use, externalizing, and internalizing behaviors were assessed. Parents and adolescents completed assessment instruments measuring parenting style and family conflict.Confirmatory factor analysis found significant differences in the underlying dimensions of parent and adolescent autonomous-relatedness in this sample versus previous samples. It was also found that autonomous-relatedness was associated with worse adolescent symptomatology and family impairment. Results based on both self-report and observational measures contribute to the understanding of key family constructs in this population and provide insight for both researchers and the treatment-community.

AB Background: The purpose of the present study was to test components of Raine's (2002) biosocial model, specifically the interactive effects of perinatal complications, rejecting parenting, and family adversity on the development of early-onset antisocial behavior (ASB). Boys' internalizing problems were also tested to investigate the specificity of the model. Methods: Birth records in addition to longitudinal data were collected on 310 low-income boys followed from birth until 10 years of age. Results: Findings demonstrated support for a biosocial framework in predicting ASB but not internalizing problems. Family adversity, and to some extent rejecting parenting,. consistently predicted youth outcome. Perinatal complications emerged as a predictor of ASB but only in the context of other family risk factors. According to maternal report, boys experiencing high levels of perinatal complications, rejecting parenting, and family adversity showed significantly higher levels of ASB than boys with lower levels of these risk factors. This finding was partially corroborated by youth self-report, such that boys experiencing high levels of perinatal complications and family adversity reported more antisocial activity than boys experiencing no risk or risk in only one domain. Conclusions: This study supports the specific prediction of ASB in middle childhood from a biosocial model. Findings also highlight the salience of a negative psychosocial environment on childhood maladjustment. Intervention efforts including parenting skills and coping strategies for mothers of children from multiple risk environments are advocated.

AB In the present study the neuropsychological, academic and social-emotional profiles were examined in Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) children
   Subjects 17 NF1 children (ages 7-11) with NF1 without serious medical problems and with a full scale IQ (FSIQ) above 70.
   Methods Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), academic tests and an exhaustive neuropsychological test battery were administered in all children. Parents and teachers filled out the Child Behavioural Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF), respectively, the NF1 children the Experienced Competence Scale for Children (ECSC).
   Results and discussion Nearly 50% (8/17) of the children showed learning disabilities, when corrected for IQ in the academic evaluations. Isolated impaired literacy skills, particularly spelling problems, were most frequent (4/8), whereas a pure arithmetic learning disability was rare (1/8). Three children presented both learning disabilities. Results on academic and neuropsychological tests did not fit the well-known types of learning disabilities - nonverbal learning disability (NLD) and dyslexia. Nearly all NF1 children showed visual perceptual and executive dysfunctions. In this study, teachers more frequently reported behavioural problems in NF1 children than parents, as opposed to literature data in a general population. The correspondence of the perception of internalizing problems between the children and teachers was greater than between children and their parents. No correlation was found between the performances on the WISC-R, specific neuropsychological results, academic performances and behavioural problems. The Deficiency in Attention, Motor and Perception (DAMP) concept seems most appropriate in order to describe the neuropsychological deficits and their repercussions on behavioural and academic performances seen in NF1 children.

AB A substantial body of research points to several variables relevant to the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD), notably childhood physical and sexual abuse, childhood family environment, and familial aggregation of both internalizing and externalizing disorders. However, these variables tend to be correlated, and few studies have examined them simultaneously. A national sample of randomly selected psychologists and psychiatrists described 524 adult patients with personality disorders. Family environment, parental psychopathology, and history of abuse all independently predicted BPD symptoms in multiple regression analyses. Sexual abuse contributed to the prediction of BPD symptoms over and above family environment, although family environmental factors such as instability partially mediated the effect. The results converge with recent studies using very different samples and methodologies.

ID SOCIAL-RELATIONS MODEL; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT
AB The present study examined the relation between perceived justice and trust within family relationships and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problem behavior. Data were gathered from the father, the mother, and two of their adolescent children in 288 families. The social relations model was used to assess perceived justice and trust at the family level and the individual level. Adolescent internalizing and externalizing problem behavior turned out to be best predicted at the family level. Adolescents from families with less just or trustworthy climates showed more of these problem behaviors. Also associations between adolescent problem behavior and individual characteristics of the adolescents were found: adolescents who were generally viewed as less just/trustworthy were reported to have more problems. Our findings suggest that processes at different levels of family functioning (i.e., individual, whole-family) should be taken into account when investigating associations between family characteristics and children's outcomes.

AB Current tools for assessing children's social behavior in school psychology research and practice typically do not adequately measure issues most salient for young girls (e.g., experiences of relational victimization). The relation among teacher, peer, and self-reports of relational and physical peer victimization was examined for 119 fourth grade boys (n = 58) and girls (n = 61) as part of a larger, longitudinal study. Girls were more likely to be victims of relationally aggressive acts, whereas boys were more often targets of physical victimization. Teacher reports added unique information in the prediction of social-emotional adjustment (acceptance, rejection, internalizing, and externalizing) beyond that accounted for by peer and self-reports. Teacher reports of relational victimization differentially contributed to the prediction of adjustment beyond that accounted for by physical victimization for boys and girls. The need for further research and implications of these findings is discussed.

AB This study examined longitudinal patterns of affiliation with delinquent friends during late childhood and early adolescence, i.e., from ages 10 through 13, in a sample of 376 participants of both genders. Four groups with distinct affiliation profiles were found: an early affiliative group, a late affiliative group, a declining group (i.e., a group that affiliates with delinquent friends early on but much less so thereafter), and a group of children who did not affiliate with delinquent friends throughout the period covered in this study. There was also a fifth group of children who had no mutual friends throughout. The proportion of boys and girls varied in some groups but not in others. Participants' own delinquency and depression trajectories as well as other behavior- , peer- , school- , and family-related correlates were examined in association with group membership through the use of growth curves analysis. The results are discussed in light of prevalent theories about the role of delinquent friends with respect to externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB Role reversal is a relationship disturbance in which a parent looks to a child to meet a parent's need for comfort, parenting, intimacy or play, and the child attempts to meet these needs. The current study examined, within a developmental psychopathology framework, the effect of father and mother role reversal with toddlers on the development of attention problems, externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and social problems in kindergarten. In a normative sample, N=57, role reversal was assessed in an observational paradigm, and teachers rated behavior problems. Father role reversal predicted attention problems and externalizing symptoms, whereas mother role reversal predicted social problems. Gender was an important moderator such that father role reversal predicted social problems for boys and mother role reversal predicted social problems for girls. The importance of a developmental psychopathology perspective, the role of fathers, and implications for the development of diagnosable disorders and for preventive interventions are discussed.

AB The impact of adverse life events and chronic stressors on the development of selected internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders in adolescence was examined in a longitudinal study. Data from 489 Ss, 304 females and 185 males, aged between 12 and 17 years, were collected at two occasions from 1996 to 1998 (retest 15 months later), in the framework of the Bremen Youth Study (Petermann & Essau, 1995). The occurrence of life events and chronic stressors were assessed with the help of the "Bremer Ereignisliste" (Bremen Life Event List; BEL), asking for 55 positive, adverse and neutral life events in different life areas. Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and conduct disorders were assumed with the DSM-IV-Version of the Munich Composite Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) and additional inventories. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined a significant association between current symptoms and negative life events (retrospective design). In our longitudinal design, however, life events did not independently predict depressive, anxiety or conduct disorders. Our results stress, that moderating factors in the context of life events are important, if not even play a more crucial role in the formation of affective and behavioral disorders in adolescence.

AB Aims To examine the prospective relationships between childhood externalizing and internalizing disorders and substance use in early adolescence.
   Design Longitudinal, community-based study of twins (aged 11 at intake; aged 14 at follow-up).
   Setting and participants The sample was composed of twins participating in the Minnesota Twin Family Study, an epidemiological sample of twins and their families representative of the state population of Minnesota. A total of 699 twin girls and 665 twin boys participated at both time-points.
   Measurements Twins participated in in-person, life-time diagnostic assessments of the following childhood DSM III-R externalizing and internalizing disorders at age 11: conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder and in addition, for girls only, overanxious disorder and separation anxiety disorder. At ages 11 and 14, substance use and abuse were assessed.
   Findings Externalizing psychopathology predicted having tried alcohol, nicotine and cannabis by age 14 as well as regular and advanced experience with these substances. Internalizing disorders showed weak effects, with only major depression at age 11 showing a significant relationship with substance use at age 14.
   Conclusion The results suggest that externalizing psychopathology is a robust prospective predictor of a variety of early onset substance use behaviors and is systematically related to degree of substance use involvement. The results also suggest that depression may predict initiation of licit substance use in early adolescence.

Middle class divorced single mother families (n = 35) and 2-parent families (n = 174) with a child in the fourth grade participated. Mothers and teachers completed yearly questionnaires and children were interviewed when they were in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. Structural equation modeling suggested that the association between divorce and child externalizing and internalizing behaviour was partially mediated by depressive/withdrawn parenting when the children were in the fourth and fifth grades.

AB Select research and practice issues that merit further attention are described. Specifically, we argue that the Pathways for profitable research include studies of normative development, assessment and diagnostic considerations, the role of parents, and the ways to optimize the conduct and evaluation of treatment. At present, the field is too uninformed about the development of emotions (e.g., anxiety) and emotion regulation, about adolescence and particular vulnerabilities associated with adolescence, and about the longitudinal course of anxiety in youth. Improved measures, as well as a better understanding of and recommended solutions for parent-child disagreements are needed. How do parents maintain distressing anxiety in their children, and what is the optimal role for parents in the treatment Of anxious children? The role of parents may vary across development, and there may be differential advantages and disadvantages for younger children, middle-aged children, and adolescents, and for the different types of anxiety disorders. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy is a probably efficacious treatment, and well on its way to becoming a well-established treatment, much more information is needed about the potential role of medications and the merits of enhancing the therapeutic alliance. Our discussion focuses on mapping the further evolution and maturation of the field of child anxiety.

AB Behavioral genetic studies indicate that nongenetic factors play a role in the development of bipolar and major depressive disorders. The trait of neuroticism is common among individuals with major affective disorders. We hypothesized that high neuroticism among parents affects the family environment and parenting practices and thereby increases the risk of psychosocial problems among offspring. This hypothesis is tested in a sample of participants at high and low risk for major affective disorders, which contained parents with bipolar disorder (55), major depression (21), or no mental disorder (148) and their 146 children between 4 and 14 years of age. Parents with high neuroticism scores were characterized by low psychosocial functioning, poor parenting, more dependent stressful life events, and the use of more emotion-focused and less task-oriented coping skills. High neuroticism in parents was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among the children, as assessed by parent and teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist and clinician ratings. The results suggest that high neuroticism in parents with major affective disorders is associated with inadequate parenting practices and the creation of a stressful family environment, which are subsequently related to psychosocial problems among the offspring.

AB Behavioral rigidity is a common feature of many psychopathologies, yet the association between rigidity and the development of childhood psychopathology has not been studied. State space grids ( a dynamic systems [DS] method) were used to examine the relation between rigidity in parent-child interactions and childhood externalizing and internalizing problems. High-risk kindergarten children (n = 240) and their parents were observed for 2 hr engaging in a variety of tasks that were expected to elicit a range of affect. State space grid analysis of the observational data revealed an association between rigidity in parent-child interactions and child externalizing behavior problems in the fall and spring of kindergarten and 1st grade, and with growth in those problems over time. Rigidity was associated with concurrent levels and with chronic high-level internalizing problems. Strengths and limitations of the new DS methodology in relation to understanding child psychopathology are discussed.

AB Three studies examined whether different types of withdrawal among young children could be assessed with a short checklist. In Study 1, kindergarten teachers rated 487 children on a modified version of the Behavior Questionnaire for Two- to Six-Year-Olds (BQTSYO). Exploratory factor analyses yielded 2 withdrawal factors, Social Inhibition and Solitary Behavior, and a factor of Emotional Dysregulation. In Study 2, an adjusted version of the checklist was completed for 858 kindergartners. The 3 factors of Social Inhibition, Solitary Behavior, and Emotional Dysregulation were identified in one half of the sample and confirmed in the other They could be measured with 3 internally consistent scales. No gender differences were found on the scales. Their content validity was supported by unique associations with teachers' free descriptions of children's behaviors in Study 3. Results suggest that the instrument is adequate for the assessment of different types of withdrawal.

AB This paper uses longitudinal data to examine negative child outcomes among young, children in Canada. In following a cohort of children as they move through their early elementary school years, a slight decline in hyperactivity is documented, as is a slight increase in internalizing difficulties. After introducing a longitudinal dimension to our analysis, both family structure and income poverty are found to have a weaker effect on child outcomes than was initially anticipated. The current Analysis also demonstrates the utility of LISREL's "weighted least squares" estimation procedure in the development of structural equation models while working with ordinal and/or censored variables.

AB Research has consistently shown low to moderate correlations between parent and teacher reports on children's behavioral problems in Western samples. Little is known about the agreement between parent and teacher reports on behavioral problems among Chinese children. The authors examined the agreement on behavioral and emotional problems in a community sample of 2836 Chinese children aged 6 to 11 years from Mainland China. Children's behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Consistent with most previous studies in Western samples, our results indicated that parent-teacher agreement was low to moderate for attention, externalizing, and internalizing problems. Parent-teacher agreement was higher for attention and externalizing problems than for internalizing problems and decreased with increased behavioral problems. Child's gender, age, and academic performance and father's age were correlated with parent-teacher agreement on ratings of behavioral problems.

AB This research investigated whether father involvement in infancy may reduce or exacerbate the well-established adverse effect of maternal depression during a child's infancy on behavior problems in childhood. In a community sample (N = 350), the authors found that fathers' self-reported parenting styles interacted with the amount of time fathers spent caring for their infants to moderate the longitudinal effect of maternal depression during the child's infancy on children's internalizing, but not externalizing, behaviors. Low to medium amounts of high-warmth father involvement and high amounts of medium- or high-control father involvement at this time were associated with lower child internalizing behaviors. Paternal depression during a child's infancy exacerbated the effect of maternal depression, but this moderating effect was limited to depressed fathers spending medium to high amounts of time caring for their infants. Results emphasize the moderating role fathers may play in reducing or exacerbating the adverse long-term effects of maternal depression during a child's infancy on later child behavior problems.

AB The purpose of this study was to test a strength-of-association model regarding possible longitudinal and bidirectional associations between parent functioning and child adjustment in families of children with spina bifida (n = 68) and families of able-bodied children (n = 68). Parent functioning was assessed across 3 domains: parenting stress, individual psychosocial adjustment, and marital satisfaction. Child adjustment was indexed by teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms, self-reported depressive symptoms, and observed adaptive behavior. Findings revealed that all 3 parent functioning variables predicted child adjustment outcomes, and that such results were particularly strong for externalizing symptoms. Associations between parent functioning and child adjustment tended to be in the direction of parent to child and were similar across both groups. These findings have implications for potential interventions targeted at helping families manage the transition into early adolescence in families of children with spina bifida as well as families of healthy children.

AB Objective To document follow-up care received by children identified with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by primary care clinicians (PCCs).
   Study design We surveyed families of children 4 to 15 years of age who had been diagnosed with ADHD. At an index office visit, parents and clinicians completed questionnaires. Six months after the index visit, parents completed a questionnaire (NT = 659 returned. surveys, 68% return rate). The main outcome measure was the number of visits with the patients' PCCs or mental health specialists during the 6 months after the index visit.
   Results Children had a median of one visit PCC over a period of 6 months. Children who had prescriptions for psychotropic medications (78%) did not differ from others in the number of visits. Follow-up visits with the child's own doctor were more common when the PCC had completed mental health training. Only 26% of patients saw a mental health specialist. Children who were black, on Medicaid, or with higher levels of internalizing symptoms were more likely to see a mental health specialist.
   Conclusions Children treated for ADHD need more follow-up visits to permit adjustment of medication and support continuation of patients in treatment. Systematic quality improvement efforts are warranted.

AB Objective To examine the relation between victimization by peers and child and parent reports of social-psychological adjustment.
   Study design The Social Experience Questionnaire, Children's Depression Inventory, Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised, and Asher Loneliness Scale were administered to 93 children diagnosed with various endocrine disorders. The child's parent/guardian completed the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results For the entire sample, peer victimization was positively related to child-reported depression, social anxiety, loneliness, and parent-reported externalizing symptoms. Those children with endocrine disorders without observable features had a stronger relation between peer victimization and depression and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than did those who had endocrine disorders with observable physical features.
   Conclusions Recognition of the magnitude of the problem and means of evaluating for peer victimization is important for clinicians who see children with chronic diseases.

AB Objective To describe clinical and behavioral features of 10 men from 2 families with Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndnome (BFLS) and missense mutations in the PHF6 zinc-finger transcription factor gene.
   Study design BFLS behavioral features were compared with other age-matched men with other syndromes and similar intellectual functioning through the use of standardized questionnaires: the Child Behavior Checklist, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, and the Reiss Personality Profile. Participants included 10 with BFLS, 10 with Prader-Willi syndrome, and 23 with Klinefelter syndrome variants (13 with 48,XXYY, 4 with 48,XXXY, and 6 with 49,XXXXY).
   Results Contrary to initial reports, our men with BFLS had no microcephaly, seizures, or short stature. They manifested deep-set eyes with large ears, coarse facial features, small external genitalia, gynecomastia, and obesity. Family A had mild to moderate mental retardation, whereas family B was more severely affected. On Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, men with BFJLS had higher daily living and social skiffs than communicative skills. Men with BFLS also had lower internalizing and externalizing symptoms and appeared more social and helpful than men with Prader-Will syndrome or Klinefelter syndrome variant.
   Conclusions Men with BFLS from 2 families with mutations in the PHF6 gene manifested distinctive clinical features and a low risk for maladaptive behaviors.

AB This study examines pathways to chemical dependency (CD) treatment for adolescents in a prepaid health plan, including factors influencing treatment referral and access. Data were collected from 419 adolescent CD treatment intakes ages 13 to 18 in a large, private health plan. The study examines predictors of referral from different sources and of mental health treatment prior to CD treatment. Referral patterns, problem severity, and psychiatric comorbidity differed by gender. Being male (p < .05) and higher scores on the Youth Self-Report (YSR) externalizing scale (p < .01) predicted a justice system referral. Using more types of substances predicted referral by medical and mental health providers (p < .05) and self-referral (p < .01). Higher YSR internalizing scores predicted referral from mental health (p < .01) and self-referral (p < .01). Being White versus African American (p < .05) or Latino (p < .01), older (p < .05), and having higher YSR internalizing scores (P < .05), a conduct disorder (p < .01), or a family member with a substance use problem (P < .01) predicted a mental health visit prior to CD intake. The findings raise questions regarding the role of health plans, clinicians, families, schools, and community agencies in referring and treating adolescents with substance use problems. They suggest that improved coordination of care may promote more integrated treatment practices, which could decrease substance use, mental health, and medical problem severity.

AB Two studies addressed the psychometric properties of the Children's Hope Scale (CHS; Snyder et al., 1997). A sample of 460 high school students was administered the CHS along with measures of life satisfaction, extraversion, neuroticism, social support, and externalizing and internalizing behaviors. The results revealed adequate internal consistency for the CHS for research purposes. Furthermore, confirmatory factor analysis procedures supported the correlated, two-factor conceptual model underlying the CHS. Finally, evidence of criterion-related validity was provided. The findings were replicated with a sample of 531 middle school students. Taken together, the studies extend support for the reliability and validity of the CHS with adolescents.

AB Relations between adolescent violence exposure, daily stress, and psychological outcome were examined. Parent/adolescent dyads (N = 80) completed questionnaires, which included parent ratings of adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems and adolescent self-ratings of emotional adjustment. Severity of daily stress moderated the relation between levels of violence exposure and extent of adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems. The relation was significant at higher levels of daily stress, but nonsignificant at lower levels of stress. In contrast, daily stress did not emerge its a moderator in the relation between violence exposure and adolescent emotional adjustment. Results suggest that adolescents experiencing high levels of violence exposure and daily stress should be considered at great risk for poor psychological outcome.

AB This article reviews the literature on peer relations and social skills of children with learning disabilities (LD). Two risk models are discussed. The single-risk model suggests that for some children with LD, social skills deficits are inherent in the disability. These deficits lead to problems with social relationships, which foster internalizing behavior problems. The multiple-risk model suggests that internalizing and externalizing behavior problems typically result when more than one risk factor is present. These additional risks might include comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, poverty, English as a second language, inadequate educational accommodations, and ineffective parenting. However, the risk of behavior problems is reduced if children with LD are able to establish healthy social relationships.

AB Objective. To assess whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with increased behavioral morbidity.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11 years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2 well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Long.
   Results. Forty (5%) children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per hour; inter-quartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains: externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive, internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems.
   Conclusions. Children with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.

AB Objective. To compare academic and cognitive ability, attention, attitudes, and behavior of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) adolescents who are free of major impairments at 17 years of age with term-born control subjects.
   Methods. Between January 31, 1981, and February 9, 1986, 250 infants of less than or equal to800 g were admitted for intensive care in British Columbia, 98 (39%) of whom survived to late adolescence. Teens with major sensorimotor handicaps and/or IQ <70 were excluded (n=19). Of the 79 eligible ELBW teens, 53 (67%) were assessed at 17.3 (16.3-19.7) years (birth weight: 720 [520-800g]; gestation: 26 [23-29] weeks). The test battery screened the following areas: cognitive (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults Third Edition, 3 subtests), academic (Wide Range Achievement Test-3), attention (Connors' Continuous Performance Task), self-report (Harter Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents; Job Search Attitude Inventory), and parent report (Child Behavior Check List). A comparison group of term born control subjects (n=31) were also assessed (birth weight: 3506 [ 3068-4196] g; gestation: 40 [39-42] weeks) at age 17.8 (16.5-19.0) years. Multivariate analysis of variance (group x gender) was conducted for each domain (cognitive, academic, self-report, and parent report).
   Results. The ELBW group showed lower cognitive scores (vocabulary, block design, and digit symbol) and academic skills (reading and arithmetic) compared with control subjects, with no gender differences. There were no differences in attention between the 2 groups using a repetitive computer task. ELBW teens reported lower scholastic, athletic, job competence, and romantic confidence and viewed themselves as more likely to need help from others in finding a job. In the behavioral domain, parents reported their ELBW teens to display more internalizing, more externalizing, and more total problems than the control teens, with ELBW boys showing more problems. ELBW teens showed a higher percentage of clinically significant behavior problems than control subjects.
   Conclusions. In a provincial cohort of unimpaired survivors of birth weight <= 800 g, psychosocial and educational vulnerabilities persist into late adolescence and may complicate the transition to adult life compared with their peers.

AB The prevalence and persistence of adolescent substance use and abuse is a national health issue, and substance use among adolescents is frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. Most studies in this area utilize samples of middle or high school students or from inpatient settings. Less is known about substance use and psychiatric comorbidity among delinquent adolescents. The present study examined data from two cohorts of juvenile offenders collected over a 2-year period (n=245, n=299). Participants reported frequency of cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and other substance use. Participants' parents completed a measure of behavior problems. Path analyses suggested that parental reports of externalizing problems were significantly related to self-reported substance use while parental reports of internalizing problems were not. Results also suggested that smoking and alcohol use act as mediators between externalizing problems and marijuana and other drug use. Although there were some mean differences by gender, the pattern of relationships amongst the variables did not differ by gender. Implications of the findings and future directions are discussed.

AB Using behavioral genetic analyses, we investigated and present a possible relationship between adolescent alcohol use and six domains of common problem behaviors in a community-based sample of 633 twin pairs who were under the legal drinking age of 21 (mean age = 15.0 years). The underlying etiology of the six problem behavioral domains, classified as conduct problems, hyperactivity, school problems, low self-esteem, neuroticism, and social withdrawal, was previously described (Siewert et al., 2003) as two heritable and genetically distinct dimensions of problem behavior. We took the two best-fitting models from that study (one that proposed a generalized behavior problem factor along with an internalizing behavior factor, and one that proposed an externalizing behavior factor along with an internalizing behavior factor) and extended the analyses in this study to include an index of alcohol use. Our results suggest that there is a strong genetic relationship between adolescent alcohol use and a broad spectrum of both externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems. The individual who seems to be at risk for either generalized or specifically externalizing behavioral problems is also at risk for adolescent alcohol use. However, the individual who exhibits internalizing problem behaviors appears to be protected from adolescent alcohol use. We propose that adolescent alcohol consumption needs to be understood in the context of these genetically influenced externalizing and internalizing propensities.

AB This study examines the relationships among three major subtypes ofneglect (physical, psychological, and environmental), a summary measure ofneglect, and neglect as defined by Child Protective Services (CPS). The predictive validity of the subtypes of neglect assessed when children were 5 years of age was examined using children's behavior at age 6. Studyfindings include modest to moderate correlations among the neglect subtypes, CPS neglect, and children's behavior. After controllingfor CPS neglect, the subtypes remained predictive of children's behavior. The set of three subtypes was more strongly related to children's behavior, particularly maternal report of internalizing problems, than was the summary neglect measure. These findings suggest that considering the subtypes of neglect may enhance our understanding of neglect and lead to interventions tailored tofamilies'specific needs.

AB Parenting x Child Personality interactions in predicting child externalizing and internalizing behavior were investigated in a variable-centered study and a person-centered study. The variable-centered study used data from a 3-year longitudinal study of 600 children 7 to 15 years old at Time 1 and 512 children 10 to 18 years old at Time 2. Parents rated child personality (five factor model), negative control, positive parenting, and child problem behavior, whereas children rated parental behavior. Hierarchical moderated regression analyses showed significant Parenting x Child Personality (benevolence and conscientiousness) interactions, principally for externalizing behavior. The interactions were largely replicable across informants and across time. The person-centered study, which classified participants into 3 types, showed that negative parental control was more related to externalizing behavior for undercontrollers than for resilients. Negative parental control enhanced internalizing behavior for overcontrollers.

AB To study the social-emotional development of triplets, 23 sets of triplets, 23 sets of twins, and 23 singleton infants (N = 138) were followed from birth to 2 years. Maternal depression and social support were assessed in the postpartum period, mother-infant and father-infant interaction and the home environment were observed at 3 months, a separation-reunion episode and a maternal interview were conducted at 12 months, and infant behavior problems were evaluated at 24 months. Lower parent-infant synchrony was observed for triplets. Triplets showed less distress during maternal separation and less approach at reunion. Mothers reported lower adjustment and differentiation among siblings for triplets than for twins. Higher internalizing problems were reported for triplets, and the triplet with intrauterine growth retardation showed the poorest outcomes. Behavior problems were predicted by medical risk, maternal depression, parent-infant synchrony, infant approach, and mother adjustment. Discussion focuses on developmental risk when the exclusivity of the parent-infant relationship is compromised.

AB The purpose of this follow-up study was to examine whether a group of 28 clinic-referred infants with colic, excessive crying, or both at 4 to 12 weeks demonstrated sensory processing, coping, and behavioral/attention regulation difficulties at 3 to 8 years of age. Seventy-five percent of the sample demonstrated atypical behavioral responses to sensory experiences. Hours of fussing during infancy significantly correlated with inattention, emotional reactivity, touch processing, environmental coping, and externalizing behavior at 3 to 8 years, but not hours of crying. The most striking result was that children with more hours of early fussing showed less efficient sensory processing, poorer coping with the environment, and more attention/hyperactivity problems compared to those with less hours of fussing. Results suggest that hours of fussing rather than crying could be an early marker for infants at risk.

AB This study replicated and extended prior findings of internalizing and externalizing subtypes of posttraumatic response (M. W. Miller, J. L. Greif, & A. A. Smith, 2003). Cluster analyses of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Personality Psychopathology-Five (MMPI-2 PSY-5; A. R. Harkness, J. L. McNulty, Y. S. Ben-Porath, 1995) profiles obtained from 736 veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) partitioned the sample into a low pathology cluster defined by personality scores in the normal range, an externalizing cluster characterized by low constraint and high negative emotionality, and an internalizing cluster with high negative emotionality and low positive emotionality. Externalizers showed the highest rates of alcohol-related and antisocial personality disorders; internalizers, the highest rates of panic and major depressive disorder. These findings support the development of a personality-based typology of posttraumatic response designed to account for heterogeneity in the expression of PTSD and associated psychopathology.

AB Rates and cooccurrence of internalizing and externalizing syndromes were examined in a sample of 1,520 low-income urban early adolescents. Results indicate higher rates of clinically elevated internalizing and externalizing symptoms in this sample relative to normative data. In particular both boys and girls were more likely to score in the clinical range on the broad-band internalizing and externalizing subscales of the Youth Self-Report and on the anxious-depressed, withdrawn, somatic, delinquency, and aggression narrow-band subscales. Girls reported higher rates of internalizing symptoms oil the broad-band internalizing subscale and on narrow-band anxious-depressed, withdrawn, and somatic complaints. subscales. Contrary to expected, boys did not report higher rates of externalizing symptoms on any of the externalizing subscales. Results of bidirectional comorbidity analyses indicate that cooccurrence of aggressive with somatic symptoms and cooccurrence of aggressive with delinquency symptoms were significantly more common in this sample than in normative samples.

AB Structural equation modeling techniques were used to test a conceptual framework,for improved understanding of the relationships involved in adolescent risk and protective factors. Specifically, the model examined the direct and indirect associations, via adaptive coping strategies, that acute life stressors and contextual support and conflict have with psychological adjustment (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and school competencies (GPA, classroom-conduct scores, and peer ratings of social competence). Participants were 304 inner-city Latino 6th- and 7th-grade middle school students (133 boys, 171 girls). Results found both acute stressors and social conflict to be positively associated with psychological symptomatology and negatively associated with school competencies. In addition, both social support and adaptive coping strategies were negatively associated with symptomatology; social support was positively associated with school competencies. Moreover, support and conflict were associated with psychological symptomatology and school competencies indirectly, mediated by adaptive coping strategies. Adaptive coping strategies were inversely related to school competencies, an unexpected finding. Implications, limitations, and future areas of study ore discussed.

AB This research studied the role of ethnic identity as a protective factor among European American (n = 77) and African American (n = 82) adolescents identified either as high risk or successful. Adolescents participated in a multiagent, multimethod assessment of depression, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, competence, and academic achievement. The levels of ethnic identity were the same across ethnic groups but were higher among successful adolescents. Bivariate correlations revealed that ethnic identity was significantly associated with all measures of adjustment in the expected directions. Predicted validities were statistically higher among African American youth than for European Americans on depression, total competence, and GPA. Similar associations were found when comparing ethnic identity to a construct of socioeconomic disadvantage. Findings suggest that ethnic identity, is central to the self-system and motivation for youth who develop in contexts that potentially undermine children's socioemotional adjustment.

AB Background: Siblings may support each other, but also reveal fierce rivalry and mutual aggression. Supportive sibling relationships have been linked to the development of psychosocial competence of children. In the present longitudinal study, we will focus on the development of perceived support in sibling dyads and on the influence of sibling support and sibling problem behavior on psychosocial adjustment in adolescence. Method: In a three-wave longitudinal sample of 285 Dutch families with two adolescent children (11- to 15-year-olds), these two siblings judged the support perceived from each other. In addition, they themselves and their parents judged their internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. The relation of sibling support and sibling problem behavior with internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors was examined while controlling for support from parents and friends and, over time, controlling for the autoregressive effects of problem behavior. Results: Support perceived from a sibling is mostly negatively related to externalizing problems; sibling problem behavior is strongly related to internalizing problems. Differential developmental trajectories of adolescents' adjustment are associated with siblings' support and problem behavior. Conclusion: The results indicate that adolescents' relationships with both older and younger siblings arc characterized by modeling processes.

AB Background: The present study extends existing studies on the role of differential parental treatment in explaining individual differences in adolescent problem behaviors above the absolute level of parenting and clarifies the function of gender of the child, birth rank and gender constellation of the sibling dyads. Method: The absolute level of parenting practices and differential treatment were examined in a sample of 288 Dutch families consisting of two parents and two adolescents. Parents reported on adolescent internalizing and externalizing problem behavior and adolescents reported on parental warmth and coercive control. Results: Parenting dimensions were related to problem behavior for same- and mixed-gender sibling pairs, with coercive control as the strongest predictor. No direct association was found between differential parental treatment and child outcomes above the absolute levels of parenting in same-gender sibling pairs. However, differential maternal and paternal control was related to internalizing behavior of girls and differential paternal warmth was linked to externalizing behavior of the older siblings in mixed-gender sibling pairs. Conclusion: Differential parental treatment is uniquely associated with child problem behavior above the absolute level of parenting for girls and early-born children in mixed-gender sibling pairs. Any examination of the effects of differential treatment should not be undertaken without considering the gender and birth rank of the sibling pairs.

AB Short stature is not the only problem faced by small for gestational age (SGA) children. Being born SGA has also been associated with lowered intelligence, poor academic performance, low social competence, and behavioral problems. Although GH treatment in short children born SGA can result in a normalization of height during childhood, the effect of GH treatment on intelligence and psychosocial functioning remains to be investigated. We show the longitudinal results of a randomized, double-blind, GH-dose response study initiated in 1991 to follow growth, intelligence quotient ( IQ), and psychosocial functioning in SGA children during long-term GH treatment.
   Patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups ( 1 or 2 mg GH/m(2) body surface.d, or similar to 0.035 or 0.07 mg/kg.d). Intelligence and psychosocial functioning were evaluated at start of GH treatment (n = 74), after 2 yr of GH treatment (n = 76), and in 2001 (n = 53). IQ was assessed by a short-form Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Block-design and Vocabulary subtests). Behavioral problems were measured by the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist or Young Adult Behavior Checklist, and self-perception was measured by the Harter Self-Perception Profile.
   Mean (SEM) birth length SD score was -3.6 (0.2), mean age and height at start was 7.4 (0.2) yr and -3.0 (0.1) SD score, respectively, mean duration of GH treatment was 8.0 (0.2) yr, and mean age in 2001 was 16.5 (0.3) yr. After 2 yr of GH treatment, 96% of both GH groups showed a height gain SD score of 1 SD from the start of treatment or more, resulting in a normal height (i.e. height greater than or equal to -2.0 SD for age and sex) in 70% of the children. In 2001, 48 (91%) of the 53 children participating in this study had reached a normal height. Block-design s-score and the estimated total IQ significantly increased (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) from scores significantly lower than Dutch peers at start ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) to comparable scores in 2001. The increase over time for the Vocabulary s-score was not significant. Internalizing Behavior SD scores remained comparable to Dutch peers, whereas Externalizing Behavior SD scores and Total Problem Behavior SD scores improved significantly during GH therapy (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) to scores comparable to Dutch peers. Self-perception SD scores improved from start of GH treatment until 2001 ( P < 0.001) to scores significantly higher than Dutch peers ( P < 0.05). No significant differences between the two GH dosage groups were found. Improvement in Externalizing and Total Problem Behavior SD scores over time was significantly related to change in height SD score (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), whereas scores over time for Vocabulary, Block-design, Internalizing, or total Harter Self-Perception score were not related to change in height SD scores.
   In conclusion, parallel to a GH-induced catch-up growth in adolescents born SGA, IQ, behavior, and self-perception showed a significant improvement over time from scores below average to scores comparable to Dutch peers. In addition, children whose height over time became closer to that of their peers showed less problem behavior.

AB Fifth-graders'(N = 162; 93 girls) relationships with parents and friends were examined with respect to their main and interactive effects on psychosocial functioning. Participants reported on parental support, the quality of their best friendships, self-worth, and perceptions of social competence. Peers reported on aggression, shyness and withdrawal, and rejection and victimization. Mothers reported on psychological adjustment. Perceived parental support and friendship quality predicted higher global self-worth and social competence and less internalizing problems. Perceived parental support predicted fewer externalizing problems, and paternal (not maternal) support predicted lower rejection and victimization. Friendship quality predicted lower rejection and victimization for only girls. Having a supportive mother protected boys front the effects of low-quality, friendships on their perceived social competence. High friendship quality buffered the effects of low maternal support on girls' internalizing difficulties.

AB The contributions of temperamental styles and emotional coping strategies to the development of preschoolers' social competence and behavior problems were investigated. The ability to cope with emotion was found to be more important than temperament alone in the development of prosocial behavior. Our results indicate that the use of passive coping strategies may play a significant role in the development of maladaptive behaviors in young children. Specifically, the use of passive coping strategies was found to moderate the relationship between temperament dimensions in predicting externalizing and internalizing maladaptive behaviors. When combined with extremely negative temperamental dispositions, just facing the problems was discovered to be beneficial for preschoolers, which encourages the use of preventative or interventional strategies in the classroom to develop constructive emotion regulation skills in young children.

AB Objective: To examine associations between resilience in children of injection drug users and children's coping strategies, parenting stress, and children's social support. Method: Injection drug-using parents (n = 91) and their children aged 6 to 11 (n = 117) were recruited in Baltimore (1997-1999). Resilience was defined as scoring in the lowest quartile of the Child Behavior Checklist total psychopathology score. Coping strategies used by resilient and nonresilient children, the extent and types of social support that they received, and the level of parenting stress reported by their parents were compared and contrasted. Results: Rates of depressive, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders were 15.4%, 22.2%, and 21.4%, respectively, for the entire sample. Compared with the nonresilient, resilient children were less likely to use two avoidance coping strategies (internalizing [p = .002] and externalizing [p = .017]). The level of actual support received by resilient and nonresilient children did not differ significantly (p = .202). Perceived support was greater among resilient children (as reported by their parents; p < .001), and their parents reported lower parenting stress (p = .042). Conclusions: A significant proportion of children of injection drug users are in need of clinical care. Interventions to help children of substance-abusing parents modify their coping style merit exploration.

AB The primary goal of the present study was to determine whether male and female adolescents experience different levels of stressful events and report different levels of internalizing symptoms over the age range from 11 to 20 years. The secondary goal was to determine whether females appraise events as more intensely stressful than males. Questionnaire measures of stress frequency and intensity, and internalizing (i.e., depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and self-esteem) were obtained from 1012 boys and 1493 girls. Consistent with past studies, gender and age differences were found in the self-reported occurrence of everyday stressors and in levels of internalizing symptoms. Girls reported significantly more stressful events from age 12 to 17 than boys, and girls showed higher levels of internalizing from age 13. We also found that girls reported higher perceived stressor intensity than boys.

AB Internalizing and externalizing problems based on Youth Self-Report (YSR) were investigated in an empirical sample of 371 students at the age of 13 until 18 years from common secondary and vocational schools in Rostock (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) in 2000/2001. Considering syndromes in comparison with other german and international empirical studies, internalizing and externalizing problems show high prevalence for both girls and boys. Nearly every fifth student judges themselves as within clinical range for psychiatric problems. Girls reported significant more internalizing problems (social withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed). An interaction effect by age and sex for aggressive and delinquent behaviour was found with highest prevalence for boys at age 15/16. The frequency of internalizing problems and attention problems increases with adolescent's age. Low adolescent's education level, parental divorce and big size of siblings were associated with externalizing problems, whereas unemployment of the father was associated with depressive and social problems. Delinquent behaviour and attention problems are the most important predictors for negative school outcome like comparatively bad school achievement and low reading ability. The results suppose a possible increase in psychosocial problems of juvenile persons in eastern Germany one decade after German Unification, indicated the necessity of higher supply for preventive and therapeutic programs.

AB The authors examined the association between exposure to violence and different indexes of mental health among 95 extremely poor children (age range = 8-17 years) and analyzed potential moderators and mediators. Findings indicated that 62% of youths had been exposed to at least 1 form of violence. Controlling for other explanatory factors, exposure to violence was significantly associated with internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) across all children, but the relation was stronger for girls compared with boys. Externalizing problem behaviors were also associated with exposure to violence, but subgroup differences were not detected. Regression analyses indicated that self-esteem and a measure of perceived chronic danger may partially mediate the link between violence exposure and mental health symptoms.

AB Do childhood emotional and behavioral problems diminish the probability of graduating from high school and attending college? If so, are their effects primarily attributable to the persistence of those problems over time, to continuities in social environments, or to the cumulative effects of early academic failures? We provide answers to these questions using data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set (1986-2000). Internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 6-8 significantly and strongly diminish the probability of receiving a high school degree. Among youth who receive a high school degree, externalizing problems also diminish the probability of subsequent college enrollment. In the case of high school degree receipt, the educatioral disadvantages associated with child emotional and behavioral problems result from the association of those problems with academic failures in middle and high school. In contrast, the association of childhood behavior problems with college enrollment appears to reflect the persisting effects of early behavioral and academic predispositions. Our results add to a growing body of research that demonstrates that social selection processes contribute to socioeconomic disparities. They also suggest new directions for research concerned with socially-structured, transactional, person-environment interactions.

AB Objective. Using data from a larger study on new-onset seizures, we reported preliminary findings concerning relationships between family factors and child behavioral problems at baseline and 24 months. We also explored which baseline and changes in family factors were associated with changes in child behavioral problems over the 24-month period.
   Methods. Subjects were 224 children and their primary caregivers. Data were collected using structured telephone interviews and analyzed using multiple regression.
   Results. Deficient family mastery and parent confidence in managing their child's discipline were associated with behavior problems at baseline and at 24 months; they also predicted child behavior problems over time. Decreasing parent confidence in disciplining their child was associated with increasing child behavior problems. Decreases in parent emotional support of the child were associated with increases in child internalizing problems.
   Conclusion. Child behavior problems, family environment, and parenting behaviors should be assessed when children present to the clinical setting with new-onset seizures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of short stature on psychological adaptation in childhood and adolescence is controversial. GH is currently used to treat children with idiopathic short stature (ISS, also known as non-GH-deficient short stature). This study represents the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of GH on the psychological adaptation of children and adolescents with ISS, treated with GH until adult height was attained.
   Sixty-eight children (53 males, 15 females), 9-16 yr old, with marked ISS (measured height or predicted adult height -2.5 SD or less) received either GH 0.074 mg/kg or placebo sc three times per week until height velocity decreased to less than 1.5 cm/yr. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and children the Self-Perception Profile (SPP) and Silhouette Apperception Technique at baseline and annually thereafter.
   Baseline behavioral/emotional adjustment (CBCL) and self-concept (SPP) scores for children with ISS were within the normative range. The two study groups exhibited similar behavioral and self-concept profiles (CBCL) during the first 2 yr of the study. However, CBCL behavior problems (internalizing, externalizing, and total problems) appeared to decline, in yr 3 and 4, in the GH-treated group relative to the placebo-treated group. Group differences in CBCL competency domains and the SPP were not observed at any point during the study.
   Short stature among children with ISS enrolled in this long-term, placebo-controlled study was not associated with problems in psychological adaptation or self-concept with the psychological instruments employed. GH treatment was associated with a trend toward improvement in problem behaviors, as measured by questionnaires ( CBCL) completed by study participants' parents. It remains to be determined whether GH treatment significantly impacts adaptation, psychosocial function, or quality of life in children with ISS.

AB This research examined the emotional, social, and behavioral functioning of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and classroom comparison peers from the perspective of primary and secondary caregivers. It was hypothesized that children with SCD would have more internalizing (emotional) and social problems and fewer externalizing (behavioral) problems than comparison peers. Caregivers of 70 children with SCD and 67 comparison peers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) during visits to the children's homes. Relative to comparison peers, children with SCD were perceived by primary caregivers as having more total and internalizing problems and less total competence. Additionally, significantly more children with SCD exceeded clinical cutoffs on the CBCL. While caregivers of children with SCD perceive these children to be at a slightly elevated risk for problems across multiple domains, a significant number of children with SCD have problems in the clinical range. The authors recommend that vigorous screening programs for mental health problems should be included in the routine care of children with SCD, and programs of psychosocial intervention research should be implemented to ameliorate problems for the children at greatest risk.

AB Objective: To assess the potential efficacy, tolerability, and safety of citalopram in the treatment of functional pediatric recurrent abdominal pain and comorbid internalizing disorders. Method: Twenty-five clinically referred children and adolescents with recurrent abdominal pain aged 7 to 18 years, inclusive, participated in a 12-week, flexible-dose, open-label trial of citalopram. Primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement, with responders defined by ratings of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Secondary measures included self- and parent reports of abdominal pain, anxiety, depression, other somatic symptoms, and functional impairment. Side effects were assessed using a standardized checklist. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat format and the last observation carried forward procedure. Results: Twenty-one subjects (84%) were classified as responders (Clinical Global Impression Scaled improvement score 52). Citalopram was generally well tolerated. Four subjects withdrew prematurely, one due to reported visual side effects. Ratings of abdominal pain, anxiety, depression, other somatic symptoms, and functional impairment all improved significantly over the course of the study compared with baseline. Conclusions: Citalopram is a promising treatment for functional pediatric recurrent abdominal pain and deserves additional study with a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

AB Objective: To study prevalence and factors associated with mental health service use among 18-year-old adolescent boys. Method: Predictors at age 8 and factors at age 18 associated with mental health service use during the preceding 12 months were studied in a general population sample of 2,316 Finnish boys born in 1981 attending military call-up (79% of the original sample). Results: Within the preceding 12 months, 2.1% of the boys had used mental health services. At age 18, internalizing, anxious-depressive, and withdrawal symptoms; health problems; not living with parents; use of illicit drugs; high level of alcohol use; and regular smoking were independently associated with service use. At age 8, a high level of emotional and behavioral symptoms, need for referral, and low school performance according to teacher evaluations predicted service use 10 years later. Conclusions: Only a minority of adolescents with severe problems had used mental health services. Because of the wide range of problems and comorbidity among service users, there is a need for integration of different services. Education services have a central role in the early detection of those who will later use mental health services.

AB Children and adolescents (n = 25) with galactosemia homozygous for the common Q188R mutation (substitution of glutamine codon 188 with arginine) were group matched for sex and age with healthy control participants (n = 20). Participants were administered an abbreviated neuropsychological battery by a doctoral-level psychologist. Results indicate that children and adolescents with galactosemia function generally within the low average IQ range, with a small standard deviation (indicating a relatively homogeneous IQ profile), and have many features suggestive of left-hemisphere dysfunction. Word retrieval difficulties are a primary component of the galactosemia profile. In addition, participants with galactosemia have less well-developed executive functions. Child and parental reports of behavioral symptoms differ; parents reported that their children had more internalizing symptoms than the children with galactosemia self-reported. Cognitive complications in galactosemia appear to emerge even in well-treated children.

   Objective: To determine the prevalence of psychological maladjustment in clinic-based treatment-seeking obese children and adolescents (BMI greater than or equal to 95th percentile) and the degree to which maternal, demographic, and youth factors correlate to the youths' psychological adjustment.
   Research Methods and Procedures: Anthropometrics, demographics (race, sex, insurance status), measures of youth psychological adjustment (self- and mother-report; Behavior Assessment System for Children), and maternal self-report of psychological distress (Symptom Checklist 90 Revised) were collected from 121 obese children and adolescents (55% white, 45% black) and their mothers.
   Results: Approximately one-third of youths self-reported some psychological maladjustment, but two-thirds of youth were described by their mothers as experiencing some degree of psychological maladjustment. Adjustment difficulties were specific to social functioning, low self-esteem, and internalizing symptoms. Forty-one percent of mothers of child participants and 56% of mothers of adolescent participants reported clinically significant psychological distress. Youth self-report and mother-report of youths' psychological difficulties were often most strongly associated with mothers' level of psychological distress and/or family socioeconomic status rather than to youth characteristics (e.g., percent overweight, race).
   Discussion: Psychological maladjustment levels among obese youth and their mothers were higher in this clinic-based sample than in treatment research-based samples. Present correlate findings extended to obese adolescents and reaffirm a potent association between youth self-report of their own psychological adjustment and their mother's level of psychological distress. Demographic characteristics and youth weight status were not consistent correlates of youths' psychological functioning. Findings have implications for the translation of empirically supported pediatric obesity interventions to clinic-based treatment samples.

AB Objective. Information on the mental health of very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g) children in young adulthood is sparse. We thus sought to examine gender-specific behavioral outcomes and evidence of psychopathology in a cohort of VLBW young adults at 20 years of age.
   Methods. We compared a cohort of 241 survivors among VLBW infants who were born between 1977 and 1979 ( mean birth weight: 1180 g; mean gestational age at birth: 29.7 weeks), 116 of whom were men and 125 of whom were women, with 233 control subjects from the same population in Cleveland who had normal birth weights ( 108 men and 124 women). Young adult behavior was assessed at 20 years of age with the Achenbach Young Adult Self-Report and the Young Adult Behavior Checklist for parents. In addition, the young adults and parents completed the ADHD Rating Scale for Adults. Gender-specific outcomes were adjusted for sociodemographic status.
   Results. VLBW men reported having significantly fewer delinquent behaviors than normal birth weight (NBW) control subjects, but there were no differences on the Internalizing, Externalizing, or Total Problem Behavior scales. Parents of VLBW men reported significantly more thought problems for their sons than did parents of control subjects. VLBW women reported significantly more withdrawn behaviors and fewer delinquent behavior problems than control subjects. Their rates of internalizing behaviors (which includes anxious/depressed and withdrawn behaviors) above the borderline clinical cutoff were 30% versus 16% (odds ratio: 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-4.1). Parents of VLBW women reported significantly higher scores for their daughters on the anxious/depressed, withdrawn, and attention problem subscales compared with control parents. The odds ratios for parent-reported rates above the borderline-clinical cutoff among women for the anxious/depressed subscale was 4.4 (95% CI: 1.4-13.5), for thought problems was 3.7 (95% CI: 1.2-11.6), and for attention problems was 2.4 (95% CI: 1.0-5.5). There were no differences in the young adult self-report of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD). Parents of VLBW men reported higher mean scores on the attention subtype of ADHD but not higher rates of ADHD.
   Conclusion. The increase in psychopathology among VLBW survivors in young adulthood indicates a need for anticipatory guidance and early intervention that might help to prevent or ameliorate potential psychopathology.

AB Objective. To examine the association of teacher- and parent-rated behavior with headache in a prospective follow-up study of adolescent Finnish twins.
   Methods. Questionnaire data were collected during 1995-2001 from a nationwide sample of Finnish families of 11-year-old twins who were born 1983-1987 (n = 5393) and again at age of 14. Psychological factors were measured by using parents' and teachers' ratings of a 37-item multidimensional rating instrument at the ages of 11 and 14.
   Results. At age 11, headache frequency ( 5 categories) was associated with total scales of externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors and adaptive behaviors, assessed by parents, but only with externalizing problem behaviors assessed by teachers. Results were similar at age 14. The incidence of at least monthly headache between the ages of 11 and 14 years was predicted by externalizing problem behaviors and 2 subscales of adaptive behaviors: constructiveness and poor compliance. In twin pairs discordant for headache, externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors were more common among headache sufferers than among headache-nonsufferers. Headache-discordant monozygotic co-twins confirmed the association of externalizing problem behaviors with headache.
   Conclusions. The frequency of adolescents' headache is predicted by psychological factors, especially by externalizing problem behaviors. This seems to be independent of genetic or familial influences on behavior and headache. Behavioral problems may be a sign of worsening of headache or vice versa.

AB This study examined three dimensions of ethnic identity (level of ethnic identity, attitudes toward other groups, and perceived discrimination) as predictors of adolescent problem behaviors among Korean American adolescents. Multiple regression analyses were carried out, and the results indicated that level of ethnic identity, perceived discrimination, and academic performance were significant predictors of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Implications for the provision of mental health services and strengthening multicultural education are discussed.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the factor structure of Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist, using confirmatory factor analysis, in a group of pediatric oncology patients in Taiwan and to compare the competence and behavioral/emotional problems scores of these children with normative scores to assess competence and emotional/behavioral problems of Taiwanese children with cancer. Subjects included parents (124 mothers and 22 fathers) of 146 pediatric oncology patients who completed the measures. Factor loadings of the overall fit indices for the study subjects yielded or approached satisfactory results for all syndromes, except for aggressive behavior. The indices for both internalizing and externalizing syndromes also showed good model fit. Taiwanese children with cancer had significantly lower competence scores on the Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 than did Achenbach's sample, expect Taiwanese girls with cancer, who had higher activity competence scores, but these scores were not statistically significant. Taiwanese boys with cancer had significantly higher scores on all of the emotional/behavioral problems, but had lower delinquent behavior, aggressive behavior, and externalizing syndrome scores. In contrast, girls with cancer had significantly higher scores on somatic complaints and internalizing syndrome, but significantly lower aggressive behavior and externalizing syndrome scores. Taiwanese adolescents with cancer had significantly lower competence scores compared with normative scores, with the exception being that the adolescents in the current study had significantly higher school competence scores. These adolescents also had significantly fewer attention problems but tended to have more somatic complaints. These findings clearly indicate that healthcare for children with cancer should include psychological services to prevent long-term emotional/behavioral problems.

AB Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in as many as 4% of adults yet it is often not recognized in clinical settings because the presenting symptoms may resemble those seen in other disorders or because symptoms may be masked by commonly comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic utility of instruments commonly used in the assessment of adults presenting with symptoms of ADHD.
   Methods: We reviewed several widely used self-report and laboratory measures and empirically examined the utility of the Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale for Adults (Brown ADD Scale) and the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in differentially identifying adults with ADHD and those with other Axis I disorders.
   Results: Ninety-three adults who self-referred to the ADHD program for adults at a university medical center participated in the study. Of these, 44 had ADHD combined subtype (ADHD-CB), and 26 had ADHD, predominantly inattentive subtype (ADHD-IA). Thirty-three non-ADHD adults diagnosed with Axis I mood or anxiety disorders comprised an "Other Psychiatric" group. Rates of comorbid disorders, including substance abuse, in the ADHD groups were typical of those reported in the adult ADHD literature. Data on the Brown ADD Scale and on the CPT were available for subsets of 61 and 46 participants, respectively. Analyses showed that the ADHD-CB, ADHD-IA, and Other Psychiatric groups all received mean scores in the clinical range on the Brown ADD Scale, with a trend toward even higher elevations in the two ADHD groups. Among 12 CPT variables assessed for the three groups, the mean scores on only two variables for the ADHD-IA group were clinically elevated. Neither the Brown ADD Scale nor CPT scores evinced sufficient sensitivity and specificity to qualify them to assist in differential diagnosis of ADHD vis-a-vis other, predominantly internalizing, psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusion: The results indicate a need for closer examination of executive and adaptive functioning in adults with ADHD compared with those with internalizing disorders in order to identify features that could assist in differential diagnosis.

In addition, this study examined particular types of problem behaviors related to academic achievement. Results indicate that students with E/BD showed large academic achievement deficits across all of the content areas, and the deficits appeared to be stable or worsen in the case of mathematics across age. There appeared to be no gender differences. Additionally, externalizing behaviors were related to reading, mathematics, and written language achievement; whereas, internalizing ones were not.

AB Data from an ongoing longitudinal study examined resilience (competent performance under adverse conditions) in a community sample of children of alcoholics (COAs n = 216) and matched controls (n = 201). The study examined the prevalence of competence and whether the relation of competence to internalizing and positive affect differed for COAs and controls. COAs were less likely to be highly competent in the conduct/rule-abiding and academic domains and more likely to be low competent. Controlling for previous levels of internalizing, highly competent children in the conduct/rule-abiding and overall competence domains endorsed significantly lower levels of internalizing symptomatology. For the social, conduct/rule-abiding, and overall competence domains, competence was associated with increased positive affect. The relation between competence and internalizing, and competence and positive affect did not differ for COAs and controls. Results suggested that behavioral resilience is not associated with psychological costs but is associated with decreased internalizing and increased positive affect. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This study examined recent exposure to violence in the community and in other settings, protective factors, and current psychological functioning among 349 young adolescents from 9 urban middle schools. The majority (76%) of adolescents reported witnessing or being victimized by at least I violent event in the prior 6 months. Nearly half of adolescents who had talked about their experience of a violent event reported feeling constrained from sharing their thoughts or feelings because of others' reactions. After controlling for daily hassles, more exposure to violence was associated with more self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms. Exposure to violence was not a significant predictor of teachers' ratings of adaptive functioning or internalizing symptoms. Support from specific individuals, perceived school safety, and lower constraints for discussing violence showed protective effects in the relation between exposure to violence and specific dimensions of psychological functioning. The implications of this research for school-based interventions are discussed.

The sample included 412 children (206 participants and 206 siblings) participating in a family study of attention and aggressive behavior problems. Criterion validity analyses included (a) correlations between temperament scales and emotional and behavioral scales and (b) correlations between temperament and intelligence and achievement scales. Temperament scales displayed strong convergent and discriminant validity. Across informants and samples, JTCI scales assessing novelty seeking and harm avoidance discriminated between internalizing and externalizing problems. Reward dependence, persistence, cooperativeness, and self-directedness displayed similar patterns of negative relations to emotional and behavioral scales and positive relations to intelligence, achievement, and competence.

AB The authors examined the influence of race/ethnicity on patterns of ratings of adolescent psychopathology completed by adolescents, parents, and teachers in a sample of 600 adolescents. Robust racial/ethnic differences in behavior problems emerged with parent and teacher reports, but not with adolescent self-reports. Discrepancy scores revealed that minority parents reported fewer behavior problems than did youth. Such findings have important implications for treatment seeking,as parents are often the initiators of service use for youth. Compared to other informants, teachers reported fewer internalizing problems among minority adolescents in general, fewer externalizing problems in Asian/Pacific Islanders, and more externalizing problems for African Americans. These findings are consistent with a number of explanations, including cultural differences in adult distress thresholds, racial/ethnic bias among teachers, and cultural differences in symptom expression.

AB Objective. Healthy People 2010 calls for reductions in rapid repeat births (RRBs), defined as births occurring within 24 months after a previous birth for women of all ages, and prevention of repeat births during adolescence, regardless of the birth interval. Home visiting has been promoted as a mechanism to prevent child abuse and neglect and to improve pregnancy outcomes. This study aims to assess the impact of home visiting in preventing RRB and its malleable determinants and assesses the influence of RRB on the mother and the index child. We hypothesized that maternal desire to have a RRB, access to a family planning site, and use of birth control would be significant malleable determinants and that the effects of the program in preventing RRB would be mediated through its influence on these variables. We also hypothesized that the occurrence of RRB would result in increased stress and family dysfunction, resulting in adverse maternal and child outcomes such as severe maternal stress, maternal neglect of the index child, decreased maternal warmth toward the index child, and increased behavior problems of the index child.
   Methods. The Healthy Start Program (HSP) is a home visiting program to prevent child abuse and neglect and to promote child health and development among newborns of families identified as being at risk for child maltreatment. This study was a randomized, controlled trial of Hawaii's HSP, in which eligible families were randomly assigned to home-visited and control groups. A total of 643 families at risk for child abuse were enrolled between November 1994 and December 1995. Data to measure RRB and malleable determinants were collected through structured maternal interviews and observation of the home environment. We measured RRB through maternal self-report by asking about a subsequent birth in follow-up interviews at 1, 2, and 3 years. To measure the malleable determinants, we measured the mother's desire for a RRB at baseline and at the 1-year interview and determined whether she had access to a family planning site. The mother was also asked which contraceptive methods she had ever used in the past and which methods, if any, she used in the year following the index child's birth. We measured 3 maternal parenting outcomes at the year 3 follow-up interview, ie, parenting stress, neglectful behavior toward the index child, and warmth toward the index child. We used odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to measure the strength of associations. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess 1) program effects on RRB and its malleable determinants, 2) the impact of the malleable determinants on RRB, and 3) the association between RRB and adverse maternal and child outcomes.
   Results. Each year, 88% of the sample completed a follow-up interview; 81% completed all 3 follow-up interviews. There was no program impact on RRB for mothers overall (HSP: 21%; control: 20%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.69 - 1.58). HSP and control groups did not differ significantly in any of the malleable determinants of RRB. When we combined the 2 study groups, malleable determinants had significant effects on RRB. Mothers with a desire to have a child within 2 years after the index birth were significantly more likely to have a RRB, whether this desire was expressed at baseline ( AOR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.32 - 4.64) or at the year 1 interview ( AOR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.57 - 5.22). Lack of access to a family planning site at baseline was not associated with RRB, but there was a trend toward a greater likelihood of RRB among those lacking a site at 1 year ( AOR: 1.61; 95% CI: 0.93 - 2.79). Women who had never used birth control before the index birth were more likely to have a RRB ( AOR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.20 - 2.98), and there was a trend toward a greater likelihood of RRB among women who did not use birth control in the year following the index child's birth ( AOR: 1.67; 95% CI: 0.98 - 2.82). At the 3-year follow-up interview, mothers with a RRB were more likely to have adverse maternal and child outcomes. There was greater likelihood of severe maternal parenting stress ( AOR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.17 - 4.48), neglectful behavior toward the index child ( AOR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.41-4.18), and poor warmth toward the index child ( AOR: 2.84; 95% CI: 1.71 - 4.42). In families with a RRB, the index child was more likely to exhibit internalizing behavior ( AOR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.04 - 2.58) and there was a trend toward higher odds of externalizing behavior ( AOR: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.98 - 2.49).
   Conclusions. Overall, 20% of the mothers in our sample of at-risk families had a RRB, which was far greater than the national average of 11%. RRB was associated with a greater likelihood of adverse consequences for both the mother and the index child. The lack of program effects can be traced to shortcomings in the program's design and implementation system. HSP contracts required only that family planning be introduced any time during a family's first year of enrollment. Because conception can occur very soon after the index birth, a better design would be to introduce family planning counseling early in a family's enrollment in home visiting. Another shortcoming was that, although fathers could be included in counseling, they took part in only approximately one-fifth of home visits. It is possible that program effects were attenuated in families in which the father wanted a child. In conclusion, the Hawaii HSP did not reduce RRB or alter its malleable determinants. RRB was associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the index child. This is particularly relevant for this population of families that are already at risk for child maltreatment, for which we have found parenting stress to be associated with abusive parenting behavior by the mother. Our findings support and broaden the rationale for the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce RRB. We think our findings are valuable for guiding the future development of home visiting in general and this widely replicated paraprofessional model in particular.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to examine associations between different child characteristics and conflict, closeness, and dependency within teacher-student relationships. The participants were primarily students of color from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds in a large urban school district. The strength of associations between student demographic variables, academic orientations, behavioral orientations, and aspects of teacher-student relationships was examined. Findings indicated that these variables accounted for a significant amount of variance in teacher ratings of conflict and dependency in teacher-student relationships. Externalizing and internalizing symptomology demonstrated the strongest associations with the conflict and dependency relationship constructs. Preliminary implications of these findings for teachers and school psychologists are explored. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Few studies have examined the effects on children of maternal mental health symptoms other than depressive symptoms or have examined the joint effects of mothers' and fathers' mental health symptoms.
   Objective: To examine whether the father's mental health symptoms may modify the association between the mother's mental health and the child's behavioral and emotional health.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from a national longitudinal survey of families provided information on 822 children aged 3 to 12 years who were living with both parents. The main child outcomes were the Behavior Problems Index-Externalizing (BPI-EXT) and-Internalizing (BPI-INT) subscales. The mother's and father's mental health were each assessed by self-report using the K10, a new, validated 10-item screen for serious mental illness, including mood or anxiety disorder. Parents with scores in the upper quartile were considered to be in poorer mental health and those with scores in the other 3 quartiles were considered to be in better mental health.
   Results: Adjusted for covariates, having both parents in poorer mental health was associated with a 1-SD increase in the children's BPI-EXT scores (beta coefficient, 5.2; SE, 0.9; P<.001) compared with neither parent reporting poorer mental health. This effect was substantially weakened if the mother was in poorer mental health but the, father was not (beta coefficient, 1.8; SE, 0.5; P<.01). There was no statistically significant effect if only the father was in poorer mental health (beta coefficient, 0.1; SE, 0.6; P = .88). The risk of a child having a high BPI-EXT score (greater than or equal to90th percentile for the cohort) was elevated if both parents reported poorer mental health (odds ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-17.8), but was less elevated if only the mother reported poorer mental health (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9), and was not elevated if only the father reported poorer mental health (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.2-1.9). Similar patterns emerged for children's BPI-INT scores.
   Conclusions: A father in better mental health may buffer the influence of a mother's poorer mental health on a child's behavioral and emotional problems, and these problems seem to be most severe for children who have 2 parents with poorer mental health. The form and intensity of pediatric approaches to mothers with poorer mental health may need to consider the mental health of fathers.

AB Objectives: To determine if there is a relationship between overweight and behavior problems among children as young as 5 years old by studying the association between overweight and behavioral health at entry into kindergarten and to determine whether overweight status is a risk factor for the onset of new behavior problems during the first 2 years in school.
   Design: We use data from a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in the United States-the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten class. Data on height, weight, and parent- and teacher-reported behavior problems were collected 3 times during their first 2 years in school for 9949 children. We use a multivariate regression analysis that controls for sociodemographic characteristics, parent-child interaction, birth weight, and mother's mental health.
   Results: Among girls, but not boys, there is a significant association between overweight and teacher-reported externalizing behavior problems (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-2.68), teacher-reported internalizing behavior problems (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.17), and parent-reported internalizing behavior problems (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.06) at the beginning of kindergarten. However, overweight status was not a risk factor for the onset of new behavior problems over time for either girls (teacher-reported externalizing behavior problems: OR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.25-1.33]; teacher-reported internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.88-2.03]; and parent-reported internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.82-2.01]) or boys (teacher-reported externalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.67-1.57]; teacher-reported internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.68-1.52]; and parent-reported internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.42 [95% CI, 0.94-2.15]), whereas low family income and maternal depression were strong predictors of such problems.
   Conclusions: Childhood overweight is already associated with behavior problems when girls start school, but not boys. In contrast to common belief, overweight status does not predict the onset of new internalizing or externalizing behavior problems during the first 2 years of school.

AB The aim of the present investigation was to study the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a sample of delinquent adolescents of both genders and to compare the prevalence between genders. A total of 116 adolescents (99 males and 17 females) aged 12 to 19 on parole in the State of Rio de Janeiro were interviewed using the screening interview based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children - Present and Lifetime (KSADS-PL). Data were collected between May 2002 and January 2003. Of 373 male and 58 female adolescents present in May 2002 in the largest institution that gives assistance to adolescents on parole in the city of Rio de Janeiro, 119 subjects were assessed (three of them refused to participate). Their average age was 16.5 years with no difference between genders. The screening interview was positive for psychopathology for most of the sample, with the frequencies of the suggested more prevalent psychiatric disorders being 54% for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 77% for conduct disorder, 41% for oppositional defiant disorder, 57% for anxiety disorder 57, 60% for depressive disorder 60, 63% for illicit drug abuse, and 58% for regular alcohol use. Internalizing disorders (depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and phobias) were more prevalent in the female subsample. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of illicit drug abuse between genders. There were more male than female adolescents on parole and failure to comply with the sentence was significantly more frequent in females. The high prevalence of psychopathology suggested by this study indicates the need for psychiatric treatment as part of the prevention of juvenile delinquency or as part of the sentence. However, treatment had never been available for 93% of the sample in this study.

AB There is considerable evidence that attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with conduct problems, social maladaptation and delinquent behavior. The "Ottweiler Study" was performed to elaborate the prevalence of ADHD and comorbid disorders in 129 young adult detainees of the juvenile prison of Ottweiler (Germany) according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. Here we report psychopathological characteristics of 28 inmates, who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for persisting ADHD, and 37 individuals with neither a history nor current ADHD symptoms. Childhood ADHD symptoms but no current ADHD were present in 64 individuals. The Wender-Reimherr Interview (WRI) based, on the Utah criteria for adult ADHD, the NEO-five factor personality inventory (NEO-FFI) and the youth self report/young adult self report (YSR/YASR) according to Achenbach were used for the assessment of psychopathology and the description of behavioral problems. Regarding WRI and YSR/YASR we found a significant increase of emotional and internalizing problems in the ADHD group compared to delinquents without ADHD or ADHD history. ADHD delinquents scored higher on the personality dimension neuroticism, and showed lower scores on the dimensions agreeableness and consciousness. Using discriminant analysis, high scores on the WRI subscales disorganization and attention difficulties and NEO-FFI neuroticism were the best predictors of ADHD diagnosis. The results support prior findings of high ADHD prevalence in prison inmates and suggest that emotional and internalizing abnormalities are prominent problems in this population. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of ADHD as an independent factor for life-persistent criminality, since specific treatment may help to ameliorate the legal prognosis.

AB Self-evaluation is crucial to mental and social well-being. It influences aspirations, personal goals and interaction with others. This paper stresses the importance of self-esteem as a protective factor and a non-specific risk factor in physical and mental health. Evidence is presented illustrating that self-esteem can lead to better health and social behavior, and that poor self-esteem is associated with a broad range of mental disorders and social problems, both internalizing problems (e.g. depression, suicidal tendencies, eating disorders and anxiety) and externalizing problems (e.g. violence and substance abuse). We discuss the dynamics of self-esteem in these relations. It is argued that an understanding of the development of self-esteem, its outcomes, and its active protection and promotion are critical to the improvement of both mental and physical health. The consequences for theory development, program development and health education research are addressed. Focusing on self-esteem is considered a core element of mental health promotion and a fruitful basis for a broad-spectrum approach.

AB This study examined the concurrent and longitudinal relations of mother - child relationship quality, self-esteem, social competence, and maladjustment among maltreated (n = 206) and nonmaltreated ( n = 139) school-aged children from low-income families. Results of the path analysis using structural equation modeling revealed that maltreatment at Time 1 was related to internalizing and externalizing symptomatology at Time 1, both directly as well as indirectly, through its influence on social competence at Time 1. Regardless of maltreatment status, secure mother - child relationship quality was negatively related to internalizing symptomatology at Time 1 and to internalizing and externalizing symptomatology at Time 2 via its influence on self-esteem at Time 1. The results are discussed as suggestive of the role of self-esteem and social competence as mediating mechanisms in the link between relational risks and children's maladjustment.

AB The goal of the present study was to identify preschool children with "age-inappropriate" less positive self-perceptions, and to explore their parental and peer relationships as compared to their classmates with "age normal" self-perceptions. Participants were n = 127 preschool children (M-age = 54.98 mos., SD = 8.21). Data were collected from multiple sources including parental ratings, child self-reports, and teacher ratings. Results indicated that as compared to their peers, children with less positive self-perceptions demonstrated more internalizing problems (i.e., loneliness, social-withdrawal), were more excluded by peers, and had mothers with less positive parenting styles. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of poorer self-perceptions in early childhood.

AB The Behavioral Approach System (BAS) and Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) are widely studied components of Gray's sensitivity to reinforcement model. There is growing interest in integrating the BAS and BIS into models of risk for psychopathology, however, few measures assess BAS and BIS functioning in children. We adapted a questionnaire measure and reaction time task from adult studies to assess the BAS and BIS in a sample of 9 - 12 year olds (N = 63; 42% female). A continuous performance task was also administered to assess physiological correlates of the BAS and BIS. Factor analysis supported 3 subdimensions of the BAS ( Drive, Reward Responsivity, and Impulsivity/ Fun seeking), and one dimension of the BIS ( sensitivity to punishment). Results supported the utility of the questionnaire measures and reaction time task as assessments of BAS and BIS functioning. Moreover, these measures were associated with internalizing and externalizing problem behavior as expected. High levels of impulsivity/fun seeking, but not drive or reward responsivity, were associated with high levels of externalizing problems, whereas high levels of sensitivity to punishment were associated with high levels of internalizing behavior problems. The relation between physiological indices and caregiver reports of the BAS, BIS, and problem behavior were complex and not consistent with expectation.

AB Clinic and forensic studies have reported high rates of language impairments in conduct disordered and incarcerated youth. In community samples followed to early adolescence, speech and language impairments have been linked to attention deficits and internalizing problems, rather than conduct problems, delinquency, or aggression. This study examines the young adult antisocial outcomes of speech or language impaired children. Language impaired boys had higher levels of parent-rated delinquency symptoms by age 19 than boys without language impairment, controlled for verbal IQ and for demographic and family variables. Language impaired boys did not differ from controls in self-reported delinquency or aggression symptoms on a standardized checklist; however, language impaired boys reported higher rates of arrests and convictions than controls. Language impairment was not related to aggression or delinquency in girls. We examine alternate models of the interrelationships between language, academics, and behavior, at ages 5, 12, and 19.

AB The aim of this study was to test the cognitive content-specificity hypothesis in children and adolescents aged 7-16 years. Participants consisted of a community sample of 200 youth and a clinical sample of 160 youth with anxiety, depressive, or disruptive behavior disorders. Participants completed several self-report measures assessing a wide range of negative beliefs and symptoms of internalizing and externalizing problems. Multivariate analyses examining the interrelationships between beliefs and noncognitive symptoms revealed that thoughts on loss or personal failure were the strongest predictors of depressive symptoms, thoughts on social threat were the strongest predictors of anxiety symptoms, and thoughts on hostility or revenge were the strongest predictors of aggression. Results showed clear evidence of cognitive-affective specificity across both internalizing and externalizing problems in youth.

AB The authors examined associations among parental and child adjustment, child syncope, somatic, and school problems. Participants were children (N = 56) ages 7-18 years with syncope. Measures included syncope severity, parental distress, and children's internalizing symptoms. For children diagnosed negative for neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), their fathers' and their own psychological symptoms were positively associated with the severity of syncope, whereas their mothers' functioning was negatively associated with the severity of syncope. Also, for the negative NCS group, fathers' psychological functioning was associated with children's nonsyncope somatic complaints but not with their school problems. For the positive NCS group, few significant father-child associations were found, but several significant positive associations were revealed between mothers' psychological symptoms and their children's syncope as well as somatic and school problems.

AB This study presents a reanalysis of data from an effective preventive intervention for children from divorced families (S. A. Wolchik et al., 2000) to test mediation of program effects. The study involved 157 children, age 9-12 years, who were randomly assigned to a parenting program or a literature control condition. Program effects to reduce posttest internalizing problems were mediated through improvement in mother-child relationship quality. Program effects to reduce externalizing problems at posttest and 6 months were mediated through improvement in posttest parental methods of discipline and mother-child relationship quality. The study also describes a new methodology to test mediation of Program X Baseline Status interactions. Analyses demonstrate mediation effects primarily for children who began the program with poorer scores on discipline, mother-child relationship quality, and externalizing problems.

AB The current investigation examined the role of cumulative risk, family routines, maternal monitoring, mother-child relationship quality, and youth socioemotional competence in adjustment outcomes of 521 10- to 14-year-old low-income Latino early adolescents. Results showed that, as the number of risk factors increased, levels of externalizing and internalizing problems also increased. Furthermore, findings indicated that socioemotional competence was predictive of fewer externalizing and internalizing problems for females independent of the level of cumulative risk. Maintenance of family routines protected females exposed to elevated levels of cumulative risk from heightened levels of externalizing problems. Despite exposure to multiple risk factors, boys high in socioemotional competence and those boys reporting a good quality mother-son relationship were protected from elevated levels of adjustment problems. Results underscore the importance of examining within-group variability among young Latino adolescents.

AB Using data from Wave 1 (n = 5,070) and Wave 2 (n = 4,404) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined the relationship between cumulative risk exposure and youth problem behavior. Cross-sectional analyses revealed a positive, linear association between cumulative risk and problem behaviors. The association between cumulative risk and externalizing problems was stronger for White youth than for Black youth. The association between cumulative risk and internalizing problems was stronger for girls than for boys, and stronger for White youth than for Black and Hispanic youth. Cumulative risk predicted change over time in internalizing problems. Findings support the theoretical notion that adolescents experience diminished psychological comfort when risk factors are present across several social domains.

AB This review provides an examination of the current empirical literature on the topic of childhood bullying. In order to illustrate the theoretical background from which the construct of bullying has developed, a brief discussion of the general construct of aggression is first provided and subtypes of aggression described. Bullying is characterized as a subset of proactive aggressive behavior. Various definitions of terms as well as approaches to the measurement of bullying are described. Prevalence estimates, characteristics of bully subtypes (e.g., passive, provocative), and related psychological findings (e.g., internalizing and externalizing disorders) are offered. Limitations of current research methodology are identified, and future recommendations for research and intervention are provided. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective.-Previous research documents an association of poor parental mental health with asthma in children. This study aims to determine whether the associations between parental mental health problems and childhood asthma attacks persist after controlling for childhood anxiety and depression and other confounding factors.
   Design/Methods.-A community household sample of youth ages 4 to 17 years and their primary caregivers from the US Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was studied to determine the associations between parental mental health and childhood asthma attacks. Regression models that predicted asthma attacks in youth controlled for parental mental health problems, childhood anxiety and depression, zone Of residence, and parents' age, education, and perception of poverty.
   Results.-After adjusting for children's depressive and anxiety disorders as well as other important confounders, associations between parental depression, suicide attempts, ataque de nervios, and history of mental health treatment and asthma attacks in offspring, by parental report, persisted. Additionally, the frequency of parental mental health problems was associated with children's asthma attacks.
   Conclusion.-Parents with mental health problems were more likely to report histories of asthma attacks in their children compared with parents without mental health problems in Puerto Rico. These associations were not attributable to internalizing disorders in youth but persisted independent of childhood psychopathology and other confounding factors. Clinicians and researchers should recognize the relations between poor parental mental health and childhood asthma and explore the potential role of family psychosocial and behavioral factors related to the manifestation of the disease.

AB This study examined the psychometric properties of the parent version of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS-P); 484 parents of anxiety disordered children and 261 parents in a normal control group participated in the study. Results of confirmatory factor analysis provided support for six intercorrelated factors, that corresponded with the child self-report as well as with the classification of anxiety disorders by DSM-IV (namely separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, social phobia, panic/agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and fear of physical injuries). A post-hoc model in which generalized anxiety functioned as the higher order factor for the other five factors described the data equally well. The reliability of the subscales was satisfactory to excellent. Evidence was found for both convergent and divergent validity: the measure correlated well with the parent report for internalizing symptoms, and lower with externalizing symptoms. Parent-child agreement ranged from 0.41 to 0.66 in the anxiety-disordered group, and from 0.23 to 0.60 in the control group. The measure differentiated significantly between anxiety-disordered children versus controls, and also between the different anxiety disorders except GAD. The SCAS-P is recommended as a screening instrument for normal children and as a diagnostic instrument in clinical settings. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to further the validation process of the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale (A-DES). In this study, a 6-item Likert response format with descriptors was used when responding to the A-DES rather than the 11-item response format used in the original A-DES.
   Method: The internal reliability and construct validity of the A-DES were examined by analyzing the relationships between A-DES scores, sexual abuse, and behavior. The sample consisted of 65 females ranging in age from 11 to 18 who were categorized into two groups. Thirty-four adolescents who were not in therapy and who denied a history of traumatic experiences formed the nonclinical group. Thirty-one sexually abused adolescents who were currently receiving therapy formed the clinical group. The adolescent participants completed the A-DES, their parent or guardian completed a measure of behavior (the Child Behavior Checklist-CBCL), and the therapists of the clinical adolescents completed a Trauma History Form.
   Results: The A-DES discriminated between the nonclinical and clinical sexually abused adolescents. However, in post hoc analyses, the A-DES did not discriminate between PTSD adolescents and those with other psychiatric diagnoses. Significant moderate correlations were found between the A-DES and the CBCL Total behavior problem scale and Internalizing and Externalizing scales.
   Conclusions: The A-DES items are internally consistent, and the A-DES shows promise for screening adolescents for pathological dissociation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research on parental depression is beginning to recognize the importance of studying fathers in relation to maladaptive outcomes in their offspring. Paternal depression is hypothesized to correlate with internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in children and adolescents and to compromise adaptive parent-child relationships (e.g., increased conflict). In the present paper, meta-analytic procedures were applied to this literature to address the magnitude and direction of covariation between paternal depression and children's functioning. In addition, we tested whether variation in findings could be accounted for by study characteristics. Results indicated that paternal depression was significantly related to offspring internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and father-child conflict. Larger effects for internalizing symptoms were associated with the use of community samples and symptom rating scales of internalizing problems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Preschool to school-age trajectories of 242 children, including 37 with insecure-disorganized and 66 with insecure-organized attachment patterns. were examined. Child attachment and stressful life events (the latter retrospectively) were measured at ages 5-7, and mother-child interactive quality, parenting stress, marital satisfaction, and teacher-reported behavior problems were evaluated concurrently and 2 years earlier. Results indicated that all three disorganized subgroups had poorer mother-child interactive patterns and more difficult family climates than secure or insecure-organized children. The controlling-punitive group showed significant increases in maternal reports of child-related stress between preschool and school age. The controlling-caregiving group showed greater likelihood of loss of a close family member, and mothers of the insecure-other group reported lower marital satisfaction and greater likelihood of their own or a spouse's hospitalization. Controlling-punitive children had higher externalizing scores, and controlling-caregiving children higher internalizing scores, than secure children.

AB This study examined influences of gender identity on change in preadolescents' adjustment over time. In each of two successive years, three measures of gender identity (felt gender typicality, contentment with gender assignment, and felt pressure for gender conformity) and four measures of adjustment (self-esteem, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and acceptance by peers) were collected. Low gender typicality, low gender contentedness, and high felt pressure all foreshadowed deterioration on one or more indexes of adjustment. The combination of low gender typicality with high felt pressure was especially conducive to internalizing problems, underscoring the importance of the cognitive organization of the gender identity variables. The advantages of a multidimensional perspective on gender identity are discussed.

AB Objective: To evaluate the role of food habits and nutrient intake in children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) considering their association with psychosocial factors.
   Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: A rural town in Mid-Western Finland.
   Subjects: After excluding organic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, a total of 49 children with FGID and 78 control children without GI symptoms from a cohort of 422 children were studied.
   Methods: Food frequency questionnaire, GI-symptoms questionnaire and the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) filled in by parents together with their child, and 24-h dietary recall and anthropometric and haematological measurements.
   Results: Compared to control children, fewer children with FGID had daily family dinner (77 vs 91%, P = 0.030) and they used less often vegetables (P = 0.023), fruits (P = 0.027) and berries (P = 0.011), but more often ice cream (P = 0.018) and soft drinks (P = 0.027) and had a higher sucrose intake (9 vs 7E%, P = 0.032) and lower lactose intake (27 vs 36 g, P = 0.001). Reported food-related symptoms were more common among FGID group (69 vs 11%), as well as restricted milk use (31 vs 0%). Children with FGID had higher total problem scores in CBCL (P = 0.002), and the behavioural/emotional problems associated with occurrence of FGID (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.07-1.076) as did the sugar intake (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.004-1.215).
   Conclusions: This population-based study suggests that school-aged children with FGIDs have less-organized food habits and higher milk avoidance, and they display internalizing psychological characteristics.

The participants' raw scores on the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) Parent Scale, Teacher Rating Scale, and Self-Report of Personality (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992) along with the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (Reynolds & Richmond, 1985) were compared to the normative sample for each respective measure. The results found that ADHD children presented with significantly (p < .05) higher levels of both anxiety and depression on the BASC and anxiety on the RCMAS when ratings were completed by parents, teachers, and self-report. The results were discussed in terms of the comorbidity of internalizing disorders with ADHD children and need to consider differential behavioral and medical intervention.

AB This study examined preschoolers' self-reported coping strategies in response to several stressor contexts, the relations of coping and family environment to children's problem behavior, and the extent to which coping moderates the relation between family environment and preschoolers' psychological adjustment. Fifty-eight preschool children and their caregivers participated in this project. Caregivers completed measures of family environment and child behavioral problems. Children's cognitive development, behavioral maturity, and coping strategies were assessed at their daycare center. Children's responses to vignettes describing mastery, parent-child, peer, and separation stressor situations were coded. Age effects in coping were found. Problem approach coping, total coping efforts, and family expressiveness and cohesion were negatively related to children's problem behavior, whereas children's no-coping responses were positively related to problem behaviors. Results showed that coping responses did not vary substantially across stressor contexts. Regressions revealed some support for coping as a moderator of the relation between family conflict and children's externalizing problems, and cohesion and internalizing problem behaviors. The findings suggest that children's coping, and family expressiveness and cohesion serve a protective function. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To study the psychopathology of both young children with accidental poisoning and their mothers, measure the poisoned children's trends of behaviour and explore whether there is an association between parental smoking and poisoning in children. Methods: The psychopathology of 150 poisoned and 150 matched control young children, and their mothers was studied according to DSM-IV criteria. Children's perceptions of behaviour were examined by a measure assessing internalizing and externalizing behaviour. Results: Psychiatric disorders were by 4.3-fold more frequent in the poisoned than in the control children. Also, the study children exhibited higher levels in all aspects of behaviour. In the poisoned children's mothers the frequency of psychiatric disorders was threefold greater than in the control. Also, "parent-child relational problem" and "psychosocial and environmental problems" were more frequent in the study than the control groups. Smoking was more frequent in both parents of the poisoned than of the control children. Conclusions: Findings show that risk factors for accidental poisoning are localized on the children, their parents or may have a psychosocial-environmental origin. The presence of certain psychiatric disorders in young children (attention-deficit and disruptive behaviour disorders) or their mothers (anxiety, personality and mood disorders) requires the implementation of early measures for reducing the risk of poisoning.

AB Structured checklists have been used to supplement psychiatric assessment of children with normal intelligence, but for children with intellectual disability, only a few checklists exist. We evaluated the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in the assessment of psychopathology in Finnish children with intellectual disability. The CBCL was completed by parents or other carers of 90 children aged 6-13 years. Of the 118 CBCL problem items, the lowest scores were for 'Suicidal talks' and 'Alcohol, drugs', and the highest score for 'Acts too young'. Total Problem, Internalizing, and Externalizing scores were highest among children with moderate intellectual disability and lowest among those with profound intellectual disability. Externalizing scores were significantly higher among children with mild or moderate intellectual disability than among those with severe or profound intellectual disability. Compared with the original non-native samples, Total Problem scores were higher in the present study. With a T-score cut-off point of 60, the rated frequency of psychiatric disorders was 43%. We conclude that, despite certain limitations, the CBCL can be used in the assessment of psychopathology among children with mild intellectual disability but is less reliable for those with moderate, severe, or profound intellectual disability.

AB Psychological factors play an important role in nocturnal enuresis and functional urinary incontinence. The comorbidity of enuresis/urinary incontinence and clinical mental disorders as well as subclinical psychological symptoms is reviewed. In epidemiological as well as clinical studies, 20-40% of all children with nocturnal enuresis have a manifest clinical disorder-two to four times higher than nonwetting children.
   Children with secondary nocturnal enuresis and voiding postponement carry the highest risk for a mental disorder and those with urge incontinence and primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis the lowest.
   Internalizing disorders (such as depressive and anxiety disorders) are less common than externalizing ones (such as ADHD). In addition, subclinical emotional and behavioral symptoms are common. These will often recede upon attaining dryness and self-esteem can increase. General screening for psychological symptoms and disturbances is recommended.

AB The association between early parent-child attachment security and peer rejection among preschool children was examined. Children in three preschool classrooms (N = 37) participated. Mothers rated their children's attachment security at age 3 years on the Attachment Q-Set (Waters, 1987). Sociometric ratings were collected from classmates at age 4 years through individual picture interviews. Teachers rated externalizing and internalizing behaviour exhibited at preschool. Lower attachment security was associated with greater subsequent peer rejection and higher externalizing and internalizing behaviour scores. An exploratory path model suggested that the linkage between early insecure attachment and later peer rejection may be mediated by externalizing behaviour.

AB Objective: To determine factors influencing the use of outpatient mental health services provided by mental health professionals (OMHS) for children in foster care using a national probability sample in the United States.
   Method: As part of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being, detailed survey data were collected on 462 children, ages 2-15, who had been in out-of-home care for approximately 12 months at the time of sampling. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine how clinical need, as measured by a Total Problem, Externalizing, or Internalizing Scale T-score of 64 or greater on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and non-clinical factors affected OSMHS use.
   Results: Over half of the children in the sample received at least one OMHS. Need, older age, and history of sexual abuse history all positively predicted OMHS. A history of physical neglect negatively predicted OSMHS. African-Americans used fewer services than children of Caucasian ancestry at all values on the CBCL. This finding was particularly salient at lower levels of CBCL scores; at higher levels, the discrepancy in the use of services diminished but the proportion of children receiving services remained lower for African-American children.
   Conclusions: This national study confirms previous findings regarding the use of mental health services based on regional data. Limitations in the use of services imposed by non-clinical factors, specifically, age, race/ethnicity and type of abuse, need to be examined in order to address implicit and explicit policies and practices that may result in inequitable distribution of services.

AB This study was designed to delineate pathways between systems profiles of family functioning, children's emotional insecurity in the interparental relationship, and their psychological adjustment in a sample of 221 children and their parents. Consistent with family systems theory, cluster analyses conducted with assessments of marital, coparental, and parent-child functioning indicated that families fit into one of four profiles: (a) cohesive families, characterized by warmth, affection, and flexible well-defined boundaries in family relationships; (b) disengaged families, reflected in high levels of adversity and low levels of support across family subsystems; (c) enmeshed families, evidenced by high levels of discord and weak maintenance of relationship boundaries in the family unit; and (d) adequate families, defined by elevated parental psychological control within a larger family context of low discord and high warmth. In comparison to children in cohesive families, children in enmeshed and disengaged families exhibited greater signs of insecurity in the interparental relationship concurrently and internalizing and externalizing symptoms both concurrently and I year later. Structural equation models revealed that a latent, multimethod measure of insecurity in the interparental relationship partially mediated associations between family enmeshment and disengagement and children's psychological symptoms I year later. Results are discussed in relation to how they inform and refine a family-wide model of the emotional security hypothesis.

AB Power dynamics in the marital dyad and systemic elements of whole-family functioning (cohesion, subsystem boundary formations) were examined in relation to each other and also in relation to child adjustment in a multiethnic sample of families. Support was found for a mediational model, such that family functioning was found to mediate the relationship between marital power dynamics and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior. Some support also was found for ethnicity as a moderator of the association between systemic family processes and children's adjustment. Disturbances in family cohesion and subsystem boundaries were more strongly related to internalizing symptomatology for children in European American families compared to children in Hispanic American families.

AB Parent-child conflict and perceived attachments to parents were examined as predictors, mediators, and moderators in the marital conflict-child adjustment connection in a sample of older children and young adolescents. After controlling for marital conflict, parent-child conflict predicted additional unique variance mainly for children's externalizing problems, and attachments to parents accounted for unique variance in children's externalizing and internalizing problems. Moderation effects illustrated that a higher level of parent-child conflict was a vulnerability factor, whereas a secure attachment was a protective factor, for behavior problems associated with marital conflict. Mediation effects were also evident and supported the proposition that parent-child conflict and attachment to parents mostly are partial mediators of effects in the marital conflict-child outcomes link. The findings illustrate the aggregation, potentiation, and amelioration of risk for adjustment problems associated with marital conflict, and highlight the importance of assessing multiple systems within the family.

AB This study draws on the family systems concepts of triangulation and wholism to investigate how interparental conflict may affect adolescents' psychological adjustment. An ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample (N = 388) of 14- to 18-year-olds completed measures of interparental conflict, family relationships, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. We found that triangulation into parental disagreements mediated the association between parental conflict and both internalizing and externalizing problems. Adolescents exposed to more frequent, intense, and poorly resolved conflict were more likely to feel triangulated, but this association was moderated by the nature of the alliances they had with their parents. Specifically, at low levels of interparental conflict, adolescents who had substantially stronger alliances with one parent than the other reported greater triangulation than those with more balanced alliances. At high levels of conflict, these groups reported similar degrees of triangulation. We also found that supportive parent-child relationships reduced adolescents' appraisals of threat and self-blame for interparental conflict, while more empathic relationships with siblings increased these appraisals. Finally, close relationships with fathers acted as a protective factor that reduced symptoms of maladjustment.

AB Aim:. The aim of this study was to assess the psychopathological and behavioural problems in patients affected by any tic disorder and their relationship with the severity of tic symptomatology. Methods:. A cross-sectional assessment was made of 125 children and adolescents affected by any tic disorder, all at their first neuropsychiatric evaluation and all drug naive. Tic disorder diagnoses were established by using The Tourette Syndrome Classification Study Group criteria; the procedures included the administration of Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), Children Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Results:. The patients showed a mild to moderate tic disorder (mean YGTSS score = 27). Of the patients, 19% had Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but another 46% showed Obsessive-Compulsive (OC) symptoms. CBCL T total was pathologic in 17% of the children, with higher percentages in the Internalization and Attention Problems subscales. Statistical analysis pointed out a significant relationship between YGTSS and CY-BOCS scores as well as a significant relationship between the duration of tic symptomatology and several CBCL subscales (Internalization, Depressed/Anxious, Thought and Attention Problems). Conclusion:. Our data can be summarized in three main points: a large number of patients have milder tics without any psychopathological comorbidity; OC symptoms are frequently associated with tics, mainly in children with more severe symptomatology; psychopathological problems, in particular internalizing difficulties, are present in children with long standing tic disorders.

AB This study demonstrates the potential utility of the Behavioural Style Observational System (BSOS) as a new observational measure of children's behavioural style. The BSOS is an objective, short and easy to use measure that can be readily adapted to a variety of home and laboratory situations. In the present study, 160 mother-child dyads from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project (CLRP) were observed during an 11-min behavioural sample. Videotaped interactions were coded using the BSOS for children's mood, activity level, vocal reactivity, approach to toys, mood consistency and adaptability. Comparisons between the BSOS observational ratings and mothers' ratings of the child on the EAS Temperament Survey (EAS) provided support for modest congruence between these two measurement systems, and revealed a differential predictive pattern of children's functioning. Specifically, the observation-based BSOS predicted children's cognitive performance and adaptive behaviour during testing, whereas the mother-rated EAS predicted maternal ratings of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems. Both measures were found to independently predict mothers' ratings of parenting stress. Overall, the findings imply that neither observational measures nor maternal ratings alone are sufficient to understand children's behavioural style, and that comprehensive evaluations of children's temperament should optimally include both types of measures.

In this longitudinal study, 288 adolescents (mean age 13.5 years) reported on their attachment relationships with their parents and on problem behaviour three times, with 1-year-intervals between measurement waves. Results show that attachment and both indicators of adolescent problem behaviour remain stable over time, although there were differences in stability between constructs. Reciprocal negative effects were found between attachment and internalizing problem behaviour, and between attachment and externalizing problem behaviour.

A t-test analysis revealed that Everyday Discrimination Scale scores were not significantly different for males and females (p > 0.18). The alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87, with item-total correlations that ranged from 0.50 to 0.70 (mean = 0.61). The split-half reliability was 0.83 (p < 0.0001). A principal component analysis yielded one factor, which accounted for approximately 49% of the standardized variance. Correlation analyses indicated that the Everyday Discrimination Scale score was significantly related to internalizing and externalizing symptoms (ps < 0.0002).

Method: The GBI, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children, Kiddie-SADS-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR) were used to assess 117 adolescents of a bipolar parent twice with an interval of 14 months. Based on the K-SADS results, the bipolar offspring were assigned to one of three groups: with mood disorders, with non-mood disorders, and with no disorders. Results: Principal component analyses resulted in the same two-factor solution as reported for adults. The Depression scale of the GBI discriminated between adolescents with a DSM-IV mood disorder, a non-mood disorder and no disorder on Axis I. Significant correlations between GBI scales and the corresponding Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the YSR showed convergent validity. Conclusions: The GBI can be used in the adolescent age range as a self-report to discriminate mood disorders from non-mood disorders or no disorders. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we investigate peer relationships and participation in social and recreational activities among 235 adolescents and adults with autism who live at home. The prevalence of having friendships, peer relationships, and participating in social and recreational activities were all low and comparable to previous research. Both individual and environmental factors were investigated as predictors of having peer relationships and participation in social and recreational activities. Having peer relationships was predicted by individual characteristics (younger age, and less impairment in social interaction skills), but not by characteristics of the environment. Greater participation in social and recreational activities was predicted by characteristics of the individual with autism (greater functional independence, less impairment in social interaction skills, higher levels of internalizing behaviors) and characteristics of the environment (greater maternal participation in social and recreational activities, greater number of services received, and inclusion in integrated settings while in school).

AB This study examined the structure and symptom correlates of perfectionism in a sample of 6th-grade, urban, African American children using the Child and adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS; Flett, Hewitt, Boucher Davidson, & Munro, 2000). Confirmatory factor analysis showed inadequate fit of the original subscales. Exploratory factor analysis suggested 3 dimensions of perfectionism: A Socially Prescribed and a Self-Oriented-Critical factor were described as maladaptive, whereas a Self-Oriented-Striving factor was proposed as adaptive. Cross-sectional correlations among the perfectionism dimensions and symptoms of psychopathology fit well with the adaptive versus maladaptive model. In addition, Socially Prescribed Perfectionism, showed a robust predictive relation to 7th-grade internalizing symptoms, especially depression, in boys. Results are discussed in the context of the cultural and socioeconomic characteristics of this African American sample and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB We investigated bias in self-perceptions of competence (relative to parent ratings)for family, school, and peer domains as predictors of adjustment problems among 139 Young adolescents over a 1-year period using a prospective design. Regressions examined measures of bias at Time 1 (T1) as predictors of ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems at Time 2 (T2), controlling for T1 adjustment ratings. For the family domain, curvilinear trends were found. Follow-up analyses revealed that for this domain both negative bias (self-perceptions less favorable than parent ratings) and positive bias (self perceptions more favorable than parent ratings) predicted greater internalizing and externalizing problems as rated by youth, parents, and teachers. For the peer domain, higher scores on the measure of bias predicted greater internalizing and externalizing problems as rated by teachers. These findings are consistent with the view that accuracy in self-perceptions of competence can have important implications across multiple domains of development.

AB Research on personality vulnerability to depression is characterized by a "main effect" approach, often at the expense of examining interactions among various dimensions of vulnerability. To compare the "main effect" and "interactive-synergetic" approaches, we utilized data from a longitudinal study of adolescent adjustment. Focusing on dependency, self-criticism, and efficacy, the three factors of the adolescent version of the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ: Blatt, Schaffer, Bers, & Quinlan, 1992), we found support for the interactive-synergetic approach. Dependency and self-criticism interacted in predicting changes in depressive and internalizing symptoms (under low efficacy), and among boys-changes in internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results illuminate the synergetic interplay among dimensions of risk and resilience in clinical research and practice. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This reply to the comment by Cahill, Riggs, Zoellner, and Feeny (2004) on the article by Cloitre, Koenen, Cohen. and Han (2002) reiterates that an important goal of treatment research among chronically traumatized populations is to address problems that impair life functioning, including not only posttraumatic stress disorder but also emotion regulation difficulties and interpersonal problems. The need for further research on symptom exacerbation and drop-out rates in exposure-based treatment for child abuse survivors is discussed. An ongoing follow-up study is described, which is designed to assess the relative utility of STAIR and modified PE individually versus their combination in meeting "good outcome" standards as defined above.

AB In this study, the authors examined the long-term effectiveness of the PATHS (Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies) curriculum on the adjustment of school-age children with special needs. The PATHS curriculum focuses on promoting children's emotional development, self-regulation, and social problem-solving skills. Eighteen special education classrooms were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions in this controlled trial. Teachers received both training and ongoing consultation and provided PATHS to students in Grades 1 through 3. Data were collected before the intervention and for 3 successive years. Growth curve analysis indicated that the intervention reduced the rate of growth of teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors 2 years after the intervention and produced a sustained reduction in depressive symptoms reported by the children. Discussion focuses on the need for social-emotional learning (SEL) programs in special education and factors that can promote SEL among children with special needs.

AB Although the effects of paternal alcoholism on the psychosocial adjustment of children are well documented, the impact of fathers' illicit drug abuse on their children is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to compare the adjustment of children living in families with drug-abusing fathers (n = 40) with that of children with fathers who abused alcohol (n = 40) and children with non-substance-abusing fathers (n = 40). Children with drug-abusing fathers experienced more internalizing and externalizing symptoms than children with alcoholic or non-substance-abusing fathers. Interparental conflict and parenting behavior mediated the relationship between family type and children's adjustment. Interventions to improve fathers' parenting behavior and reduce partner conflict may lead to better adjustment among custodial children of drug-abusing fathers.

AB Evidence exists that there is low agreement between multiple informants reporting on children's and adolescents' behavior problems. Few studies, however, focus on agreement between informants in specific age groups. This study examined correspondence and disagreement between mother, father, and teacher reports of problem behavior by analyzing CBCL and TRF data of 2 nonclinical samples of 5- to 6-year-old preschool children (N = 424). Findings indicated that interrater agreement was low to moderate. This was shown by the intercorrelations, the explained variance in regression analyses and the little overlap in the number of children rated as behaviorally disturbed by all 3 informants. Agreement between mother and father reports was highest, whereas agreement between mother and teacher reports was lowest. Disagreement between informants was highest for internalizing problems. Potential explanations for the lack of agreement are discussed. Guidelines are formulated to refine assessment and optimize clinical decision-making processes.

AB Objective: Childhood depression is widely underrecognized in primary health care settings. This phenomenon appears to increase with younger age. Evidence has been provided for a valid depressive syndrome among preschool children. Based on the need for the earliest possible identification of depression, the development of a brief screening measure to capture young children with markers of depression from these community settings was developed and tested. Method: A group of 174 preschool children underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment. The majority of this study group was ascertained from primary care settings using a 20-item checklist designed to capture depressive symptoms in young children. The assessment included the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version modified for young children and the Child Behavior Checklist. Ratings on the checklist were subsequently compared with these independent measures of psychopathology using several analytic strategies. Results: The Preschool Feelings Checklist demonstrated high internal consistency, and 16 items showed strong associations with independent diagnostic measures of internalizing symptoms and major depressive disorder. The Preschool Feelings Checklist demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity for the identification of major depressive disorder at a cutoff score 3 or more. Conclusions: The Preschool Feelings Checklist is a brief and valid screening measure highly feasible for use in primary care settings. It demonstrated utility for the identification of preschoolers in need of formal mental health evaluation for depression.

AB Objective: To examine potential external validators for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and attention-deficient/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a Ukrainian community-based sample of 600 children age 10 to 12 years old and evaluate the nature of co-occurring ODD and ADHD symptoms using mother- and teacher-defined groups. Method: In 1997, parents, children, and teachers participated in extensive clinical assessments using standard Western measures. Four areas of functioning were assessed: child mental health, parent-child interactions, parental well-being, and school/cognitive performance. Results: Mother-defined ODD versus ADHD symptom groups were differentiated by a history of overactivity and tantrums, behavior in school, and maternal anxiety and hostility. Teacher-defined groups were differentiated by conduct problems, internalizing symptoms, mother-child interactions, and paternal alcohol use. The effects of co-occurring ODD and ADHD symptoms were greater than would be expected based on their separate effects for conduct problems, internalizing symptoms, social problems, academic performance, parent-child relations, and marital discord. Conclusions: Children with ODD versus ADHD symptoms were not significantly different from each other for the majority of variables examined, and group differences were dependent on the rater used to define symptom groups.

AB Purpose: We examine the internalizing problems (anxiety and depression) and self-esteem among 9 to 12-year old children with enuresis to determine whether enuretic children are more in the clinical range, and to study the correlation between child and parent report questionnaires.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 84 children with daytime and/or nighttime wetting were compared to 70 without enuresis using 5 psychometric instruments adjusted for gender and type of enuresis. Differences in mean scores, percentages of children beyond the clinical range, and correlations between child and parent report questionnaires were evaluated.
   Results: Parental report revealed more internalizing problems ("withdrawn" and "anxious/depressive") for children with enuresis compared to controls. A higher percentage of the study group were in the clinical range of the "total problem" scale of the Child Behavior Checklist. Child report inventories yielded no differences between groups. Moderate agreement was found between child and parent report.
   Conclusions: There is no evidence of internalizing problems (anxiety/depression) and low self-esteem in the self-report of enuretic children. In contrast parents rate enuretic children as having more internalizing problems. Different explanations for this contradictory data are offered. Further research is necessary to explain why parents report psychological symptoms in children with enuresis.

AB Purpose: Functional urinary incontinence and encopresis are common comorbid disorders in childhood. We analyze the specific somatic and behavioral symptoms associated with functional enuresis/urinary incontinence and encopresis when they occur together.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 167 consecutive children 5 to 10 year olds, with day and/or night wetting were examined prospectively with ultrasound, uroflowmetry, electroencephalography, the Child Behavior Checklist, Culture Fair Intelligence Test and ICD-10 child psychiatric diagnoses.
   Results: The main findings for the comorbid group (20 patients) with wetting and soiling were a significantly higher rate of daytime incontinence and micturition problems, thickened bladder walls and pathological electroencephalography. There were higher, although not significant, rates of previous urinary tract infections, antibiotic prophylaxis, residual volume and abnormal uroflow curves in this group. Behaviorally, hyperkinetic syndromes, and emotional and conduct disorders (according to ICD-10) were more common. Of the 20 patients 65% had a Child Behavior Checklist total score (greater than 90th percentile) in the clinical range. The externalizing, internalizing, delinquent and anxious/depressed problem scales were also significantly higher.
   Conclusions: This risk group requires detailed assessment and specific treatment. In addition to the symptomatic treatment of the wetting and soiling, many of these children are in need of specific behavioral, psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment.

AB Recent research and theory suggest narcissistic features contribute to aggression in adults. The present study examined the association of narcissistic features with aggression and internalizing symptoms in 233 students of 5th-8th grade at three inner-city schools. A factor analysis of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory in this sample revealed three factors: Adaptive Narcissism, Exploitativeness, and Exhibitionism. Regression analyses were used to predict the association of these three narcissistic features with self-, teacher-, and peer-reported aggression and self-reported internalizing symptoms. Results indicate narcissistic exploitativeness positively predicted self- reported proactive aggression, and narcissistic exhibitionism positively predicted internalizing symptoms. Narcissism and self- esteem interacted to predict teacher- reported aggression and self- reported internalizing symptoms. Results are discussed in the context of existing theories of narcissism, threatened egotism, and self- perception bias.

AB In a randomized prevention trial, 238 recently separated mothers and their young sons were assigned to either Parent Management Training (PMT) or a comparison group. Families were intensively assessed at baseline and at each 6-month interval through 30 months. To understand the effects of PMT, we first evaluated effect sizes among family variables over time. Second, because observed parenting was the target of PMT, we hypothesized a sequential pattern of structured changes within and between individuals. Using constructs with mismatched sources of data, we conducted a set of latent growth mediational analyses to test hypothesized mechanisms explaining change. Effect sizes indicated that parenting changed first within 12 months, followed by changes in boy behaviors and finally changes in maternal depression within 30 months. Unique follow-up findings indicated that intervention effects on reductions in maternal depression were mediated by reductions in boy externalizing; intervention effects on externalizing were mediated by reductions in boy depression. As expected, increases in effective parenting predicted reductions in child behavior problems. PMT effects on internalizing were direct and indirect, partially mediated by parenting practices. Results are discussed from a system's perspective on PMT amplifiers.

AB Treatment outcomes of 126 adolescents (13-18 years old) with comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs) and Axis I psychiatric disorders (mood, anxiety, conduct, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders) were compared to 81 SUD adolescents with no additional Axis I disorder. Participants completed structured interviews and symptom measures while participating in an adolescent treatment program and at 6 months following treatment. Results indicated that comorbid youth received more treatment during the outcome period; despite this, more comorbid SUD-Axis I disordered adolescents used substances following treatment than SUD-only youth, even after controlling for socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Among comorbid youth, internalizing disordered adolescents were less likely to use substances during the follow-up period, and externalizing disordered youth returned to substance use most rapidly after discharge from treatment.

Participants were 51 inner-city, substance-abusing adolescents receiving outpatient psychotherapy within a larger randomized trial. One session per case was evaluated using a 17-item observational measure of model-specific techniques and therapeutic foci. Exploratory factor analysis identified 2 subscales, Adolescent Focus and Family Focus, with strong interrater reliability and internal consistency. Process-outcome analyses revealed that family focus, but not adolescent focus, predicted posttreatment improvement in drug use, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms within both study conditions. Implications for the implementation and dissemination of individual-based and family-based approaches for adolescent drug use are discussed.

ID VALIDATION; QUALITY; SCALE; YOUTH
AB Psychologists within a positive psychology framework have proposed the existence of a set of psychological strengths that buffer against the development of psychopathology. To date, most research efforts in positive psychology have focused on adults. This longitudinal study tested the prediction that adolescents' judgments of life satisfaction moderate the influence of stressful life events on the subsequent development of psychopathological behavior. Using a sample of 816 middle and high school students, the study demonstrated support for the moderational model for externalizing behavior outcomes, but not internalizing behavior problems. Specifically, adolescents with positive life satisfaction (vs. those who were dissatisfied with their lives) were less likely to develop later externalizing behaviors in the face of stressful life events. The study also revealed that adolescent life satisfaction reports show moderate stability across a one-year time frame and independently predict subsequent externalizing behavior even while controlling for prior levels of externalizing behavior. Taken together, the findings offer preliminary support that life satisfaction operates as a protective psychological strength that provides a buffer against some effects of adverse life events in adolescence.

AB Numerous studies have documented gender differences in psychopathology; girls generally report more internalizing symptoms and boys generally report more externalizing symptoms. These gender differences are partially accounted for by the gender-typed personality characteristics of boys and girls. This study was designed to investigate how gender roles influence symptoms of psychopathology by examining the mediating effects of self-and peer-rated competencies. Using a multiple regression approach to path analysis with a sample of primarily White, middle-class high school students, gender roles significantly predicted symptoms of psychopathology and mediated the gender differences in those symptoms. In addition, the adolescents' self-and peer-rated competence in various domains helped to explain the effect of gender roles on symptoms of psychopathology. Specifically, self-rated social attractiveness and global self-worth fully mediated the relation between instrumentality (i.e., masculinity) and internalizing symptoms. Global self-worth and both self-and peer-rated achievement/conduct partially mediated the relation between expressivity (i.e., femininity) and externalizing symptoms. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB This study was carried out to describe strategies used to cope with stress and to explore the association between coping strategies and behavioral/emotional problems in a community sample of adolescents from Mainland China. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire incorporating the Chinese Trait Coping Style Questionnaire, the Chinese version of the Youth Self-Report of Child Behavior Checklist, and a number of demographic questions. Results indicated that Chinese adolescents often used multiple coping strategies when faced with stress. Principal factor analysis followed by oblique rotation revealed two dimensions of coping strategies in Chinese adolescents: active coping and avoidant coping. A series of logistic regression analyses showed that avoidant coping was significantly associated with increased risk for internalizing and externalizing problems, but active coping was associated with reduced risk, after adjustment for child's age and sex and father's occupation. These findings provide evidence of the association between coping and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Youths who report co-occurring substance use and suicidality are a particularly high-risk group. In this review, we explore four areas that are pertinent to research with substance-abusing and suicidal adolescent populations. First, we review epidemiological research that is relevant to the association between substance use and suicidal behavior. Results suggest that substance use heightens statistical risk for suicidal behavior in adolescent clinical and community populations. Alcohol intoxication may serve as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior among distressed youths through its psychopharmacological effects on the brain. Substance use may also serve as a distal risk factor for suicidal behavior by increasing stress and exacerbating co-occurring psychopathology. Second, we propose different theoretical models that might explain the high rates of co-occurring substance use and suicidal behavior among adolescents. Substance use may stem from an underlying syndrome of problem behavior among impulsive suicide attempters with predominant externalizing symptoms. In contrast, nonimpulsive suicide attempters with predominant internalizing symptoms may use substances to cope with negative affective states. Third, we explore the status of treatment research with substance abusing and suicidal adolescent populations. Studies of substance abuse treatment and suicidal behavior have neither adequately assessed nor incorporated treatment of the other co-occurring problem. Finally, we conclude with proposed directions for future research, including the development of integrated interventions tailored to adolescents with these co-occurring problems.

AB One hundred seventy U.S. (M = 16.1 years) and 125 middle-class Japanese (M = 16.6 years) adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing perceptions of who (adolescent or parent) controls the personal, conventional, prudential, and overlapping domain behaviors of the adolescent. Participants also completed an inventory assessing self-reported psychological symptoms. Adolescents in both countries indicated that they should have more say over personal issues and that parents should have more say over conventional and prudential issues. Self-reports of internalizing symptoms were positively correlated with amount of perceived control over personal issues for U.S. and Japanese students and for parental control over overlapping domain issues for Japanese students. There were no associations between parental control of conventional or prudential behaviors and psychological symptoms.

AB This study examined correlates of attachment at age 3 to further validate preschool separation-reunion measures. Three-year-olds (N = 150) and their mothers participated in a separation-reunion protocol, the Preschool Attachment Classification System (PACs; J. Cassidy & R. S. Marvin with the MacArthur Working Group on Attachment, 1992), and a mother-child interaction session during a laboratory visit. Mothers also completed psychosocial measures and, along with teachers, evaluated child behavior problems. The secure and disorganized groups received, respectively, the highest and lowest interaction scores. Disorganized children showed a higher level of teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing problems than did secure children. Mothers of insecure children reported higher child externalizing (all insecure groups) and internalizing (avoidant group) scores, more personal distress related to emotional bonding (disorganized group), childrearing control (ambivalent group), and child hyperactivity (avoidant group). Results strongly support the validity of the PACs as a measure of attachment in 3-year-olds.

AB Does persistent adversity over time have effects on children's behavior beyond the effects of intermittent or concurrent adversity? This study examined the relations between school behavior in 5th grade (mean age = 11 years 0 months) and indexes representing persistent poverty and contextual risk. The indexes described 2-year intervals of family adversity. The results showed effects for persistent risk over 2 consecutive intervals for several factors, but only for recent intervals 3rd and 5th grades). and the factors differed for externalizing behavior. internalizing behavior, and academic competence. The 3rd interval of risk added little to the outcomes, and most factors did not show persistence effects. The results highlight the need for caution in expecting and interpreting effects for persistent adversity.

AB This study evaluated the applicability of the family economic stress model (FESM) in understanding the influences of economic hardship on child mental health during a nationwide economic recession in Finland. The information was gathered from 527 triads of 12-year-olds and their mothers and fathers from a population sample. The structural equation models showed that the FESM fit the data well, indicating its generalizability in Finnish society. The results confirmed that a reduction in disposable family income constitutes a risk for child mental health through increased economic pressure and negative changes in parental mental health, marital interaction, and parenting quality. Controlling the children's prerecession mental health substantiated that economic hardship can lead to deterioration in children's mental health. Alternative models based on fully recursive analyses revealed reciprocal influences between parents and their children over time: Children's prerecession mental health problems predicted compromised parenting, which in turn contributed to children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms during the recession.

AB This study examined the associations of deviant features in early mother-infant interaction and parental psychopathology with symptoms of behavioral/emotional problems in the child 2 years later. Fifty mother-infant dyads were assessed in the study; mother-infant interaction was videotaped at infant's 8-11 weeks of age, parental psychopathology was assessed by a structured diagnostic interview. At 2 years the symptoms of behavioral/emotional problems were investigated by CBCL questionnaires. The results suggest that the mother's hostility and/or intrusiveness in early mother-infant interaction and parental psychopathology are related to and predict behavioral/emotional symptoms in the child but their influence varies. Father's psychiatric problems predicted high internalizing, externalizing and total problem scores and mother's psychiatric problems before the pregnancy predicted high externalizing scores in the child at 2 years. Mother's hostility and/or intrusiveness in early mother-infant interaction predicted high externalizing and total problem scores. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Many studies have documented that adopted children are at higher risk for behavior problems, but less is known about the correlates of their problem behavior. Method: The correlates of parent-reported and teacher-reported problem behavior in 7-year-old internationally adopted children (N = 176) were investigated by examining these children's ego resiliency, ego control, and sociometric status, and exploring possible risks factors in the home and racial influences. Results: Using the 25th percentiles lowest and highest scores on ego resiliency and ego control as cut-off criteria, we found that: (1) resilient children were almost free of behavior problems; (2) overcontrolling children showed predominantly internalizing behavior problems (33% at school, and 28% at home); (3) undercontrolling children showed high rates of externalizing behavior problems (50% at school, and 34% at home), and an elevated rate of comorbidity (21% at school, and 2 1 % at home). Adopted children identified by peer report as controversial or rejected had significantly higher externalizing problem scores than popular, average or neglected adopted children. The adopted children did not experience much (racial) discrimination. Nevertheless, children who wished to be white (46%) presented more mother-reported behavior problems. Conclusions: Our findings replicate R.W. Robins et al.'s (1996) work on three types of personality functioning: resilients, overcontrollers and undercontrollers (identified by J. Block, 197 1), extending the model from adolescent boys to school-aged boys and girls, adopted from Asia and South America. The wish to identify with white parents and white peers may constitute a potential risk factor for internationally adopted children in middle childhood.

AB Background: The purpose of the present study was to test a maternal attachment model of behavior problems in early childhood using phase I data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care, a prospective study of 1,364 children from birth through sixth grade. Methods: Mothers' and caregivers' ratings of children's internalizing and externalizing problems at age three were regressed separately on a set of fifteen predictors that included security and disorganization scores from 15, 24, and 36 months using hierarchical and logistical modeling. Results: There were three main findings. First, Q-set motherchild attachment security, based on home observations at 24 months, provided the best evidence that attachment was associated with behavior problems, especially above-average levels of problems. Second, insecurity in the 36-month modified Strange Situation predicted mothers' and caregivers' ratings of internalizing problems for boys and girls as well as their ratings of externalizing problems for boys. Third, maternal depressive symptoms predicted mothers'ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems. Conclusions: There are meaningful associations between attachment insecurity and behavior problems as assessed not only by mothers but also by caregivers.

AB Objective: The authors conducted a cost analysis for multisystemic therapy, an evidence-based treatment that is used as an intensive community-based alternative to the hospitalization of youths presenting with psychiatric emergencies. Methods: Data from a randomized clinical trial that compared multisystemic therapy with usual inpatient services followed by community aftercare were used to compare Medicaid costs and clinical outcomes during a four-month period postreferral and a 12-month follow-Up period. Data were. from 115 families receiving Medicaid (out of 156 families in the clinical trial). Results: During the four month's postreferral, multisystemic therapy was associated with an average net savings per youth treated of $1,617 compared with usual services. Costs during the 12-month follow-up period were similar between treatments. Multisystemic therapy demonstrated better short-term cost-effectiveness for each of the clinical outcomes (externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, a d global severity of sym In i inpatient care and community aftercare. The two treatments demonstrated equivalent long-term cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: Among youths presenting with psychiatric emergencies, multisystemic therapy was associated with better outcomes at a lower cost during the initial postreferral period and with equivalent costs and outcomes during the 12-month follow-up period.

AB Background. In previous studies of subthreshold conditions, co-morbidity has been largely ignored. The purpose was to examine rates of co-morbidity among subthreshold disorders and between subthreshold and full-syndrome disorders for the major non-psychotic classes of disorders from DSM-IV.
   Method. Participants came from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (mean age = 16-6 years; females = 52.1%). On the basis of a diagnostic interview (K-SADS), participants were assigned to eight subthreshold disorders (MDD, bipolar, eating, anxiety, alcohol use, substance use, conduct, ADHD).
   Results. Of the 1704 adolescents in the analyses, 52.5% had at least one subthreshood disorder. Of those, 40.0% had also experienced a co-morbid Subthreshold condition, and 29.9% of those had a second co-morbid subthreshold condition. Of those with a subthreshold, 36.4% also had a full syndrome. The Subthreshold forms of externalizing disorders were co-morbid with each other. As expected, subthreshold anxiety was co-morbid with Subthreshold MDD but subthreshold anxiety was also co-morbid with subthreshold alcohol, conduct, and ADHD. The pattern of co-morbidities was nearly identical for males and females.
   Conclusions. The hypotheses that externalizing disorders Would be co-morbid with other externalizing disorders and that internalizing disorders would be co-morbid with other internalizing disorders was partially supported. Co-morbidities between Subthreshold disorders and between Subthreshold disorders and full syndrome should impact future research and clinical practice. The assessment of subthreshold disorders needs to include the assessment of other subthreshold and full-syndrome conditions.

AB Using latent growth curve modeling, the current study investigated gender moderation of the longitudinal pathways from internalizing to both social competency (i.e., social assertiveness) and the initiation of substance use (i.e., tobacco, alcohol, marijuana), as well as the effect of a preventive intervention on that process. Rural Midwestern adolescents who were participating in a school-bascd preventive intervention study were an average of 12.3 years old at the pretest assessment conducted in 1998. A latent growth curve comparison analysis found that internalizing was related inversely to initial levels of social assertiveness skill among girls; further, internalizing was related positively to Substance use initiation growth trajectories among girls. Girls who participated in the preventive intervention demonstrated a slower increase over time in substance use initiation and a faster increase in social assertiveness. Gender moderation of the impact of internalizing and social assertiveness on substance use initiation and response to the intervention, as well as the utility of latent growth curve modeling in the study of longitudinal change, are discussed.

AB This article examines the relation among gender, social-emotional adjustment, and deviant behavior among serious juvenile offenders. A sample of]05 adolescent offenders completed questionnaires assessing social-emotional characteristics and self-reported involvement in deviant behaviors. Results indicate significant associations between distress and restraint in predicting deviance, a finding that was invariant across gender Analysis of four distinct social-emotional profiles found that membership in the reactive group was associated with the greatest amount of deviant behavior. Results also indicate that not only do serious offending girls internalize more than serious offending boys, they appear equally likely to externalize. However, although boys exhibit less distress than girls, those boys who report high rates of deviance may exhibit internalizing and externalizing problems similar to girls. The use of social-emotional measures in general, and distinct profiles in particular may aid in targeting specific programming and treatment in an effort to provide offenders with more effective interventions.

AB Program by risk interactions were assessed to evaluate whether the long-term effects of two preventive interventions for children from divorced families were moderated by baseline levels of risk. Six-year prospective relations between childhood (ages 9-12) and adolescence (ages 15-19) were examined in 68 children who comprised the control group of a randomized trial. Analyses indicated that two childhood variables predicted multiple adolescent outcomes: environmental stressors and externalizing problems. A risk index composed of these 2 variables was highly predictive of internalizing and externalizing problems, competence, substance use, and mental disorder 6 years later. Analyses of the full sample (N = 218) indicated that program effects were greater for children with higher risk scores and that the programs attenuated the relation between risk and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems, competence, and mental disorder.

AB Objective This prospective study examined how child behavior problems and family functioning predict adherence behavior and glucose regulation (glycemic control) in a sample of economically disadvantaged children. Methods Children with type 1 diabetes (N = 116; 58.6% African American) were assessed for externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and family adaptability and cohesion and followed for a mean of 3.8 years. Glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)]) was assessed at baseline and follow-up, and adherence was assessed at follow-up. Results Analyses controlled for baseline HbA(1c) and years to follow-up. Multivariate analyses indicated that better adherence was predicted by high family cohesion. Better glycemic control was predicted by high family cohesion, the absence of externalizing behavior problems, and the presence of internalizing behavior problems. In addition, tests of moderation indicated that better follow-up glycemic control occurred among girls from high cohesion families and younger children from low adaptability families. Although better adherence predicted better glycemic control, adherence did not mediate the relationships of behavior problems or family functioning with glycemic control. Conclusions A child's behavior problems and family functioning may influence both adherence to the diabetes regimen and glycemic control several years later, suggesting the potential value of interventions that address child behavior and family functioning.

AB Objective: To examine the association of psychiatric symptoms with migraine and tension-type headache in children. Method: A questionnaire completed by 1,135 Finnish children in the sixth grade identified 154 children with migraine, 138 with tension-type headache, and 407 children who were headache-free. Seventy children were randomly selected from each group and evaluated by a structured interview to confirm headache type, resulting in a sample of 59 children with migraine, 65 with tension-type headache, and 59 without headache. The children completed the Children's Depression Inventory, and the parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and General Functioning scale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device. Results: Children with migraine had significantly higher levels of total, internalizing, and somatic symptoms, as well as social and family problems, than those without headache and had higher levels of somatic symptoms than children with tension-type headache. Children with tension-type headache had significantly higher levels of somatic symptoms and family problems than those without headache. Conclusions: The association between psychiatric symptoms and headaches shows differences between different headache types. However, a minority of children with migraine or tension-type headache have high levels of psychiatric symptoms.

AB Objective: As awareness of the high prevalence of mental health problems among juvenile offenders has grown, researchers and practitioners have recognized the need for reliable and efficient methods of assessing such problems among large numbers of offenders to ensure that limited treatment resources are applied to those with the greatest need. Method: Between May 2000 and October 2002, 18,607 admissions were administered the computerized version of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument Version 2 (MAYSI-2) 24 to 48 hours after their arrival at detention centers throughout Pennsylvania. Results: Approximately 70% of the males and 81% of the females scored above the clinical cutoff on at least one of the following five MAYSI-2 scales: Alcohol/Drug Use, Angry-irritable, Depressed-Anxious, Somatic Complaints, and/or Suicide Ideation. Girls were more likely than boys to exhibit internalizing as well as externalizing problems. Mental health problems were most prevalent among white youths and least prevalent among African American youths. When youths repeated the screen upon subsequent visits to detention, their scores generally remained stable. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the MAYSI-2 is a promising triage tool for emergent risk. The use of such a screen may reduce bias in allocation of treatment resources and improves our understanding of the nature of mental health problems in delinquent populations.

AB The teacher relations and self-perception of children with externalizing (n = 26) and internalizing behavior problems (n = 25) and a nonproblematic group (n = 44) were studied prospectively. The children were assessed with the Rutter CBQ in 1st grade. Classroom observations of teacher-child interactions were performed in 2nd grade. The teacher relationship was assessed with the Pianta STRS and with child self-reports, and self-perception was assessed with a Swedish instrument in 3rd grade. Children with externalizing problems had more conflicts with teachers, as well as more negative attitudes in teacher relationships and a less positive self-perception, than did untroubled children. Children with internalizing problems had more dependent and conflictual teacher relationships than did untroubled children. There was little evidence of moderating effects of social competence on the teacher-child relations of children with behavior problems. Observed conflictual teacher interactions to some extent contributed to negative teacher relationships independently of problem status.

AB Research examining environmental factors associated with adolescents' life satisfaction (LS) has revealed that familial variables (e.g., parent-child conflict, family structure) are crucial correlates. The purpose of the current study was to identify particular dimensions of authoritative parenting (strictness-supervision, social support/involvement, and psychological autonomy granting) that are related to LS during early, middle, and late adolescence, as well as to explore the hypothesis that LS serves as a mediator between authoritative parenting and adolescent internalizing and externalizing behavior. A sample of 1201 middle and high school students completed self-report measures assessing these constructs. Results indicated statistically significant relationships between each authoritative parenting dimension and adolescent LS. Although all three parenting dimensions were positively related to LS, perceived parental social support emerged as the strongest correlate. Important developmental differences were revealed, including the finding that the association between parenting behaviors and adolescents' LS changed as children aged. Last, LS fully mediated the relationship between social support and adolescent problem behavior and partially mediated relationships between the remaining authoritative parenting dimensions (i.e., strictness-supervision, psychological autonomy granting) and maladaptive adolescent behavior.

   EARLY ADOLESCENCE; 3-YEAR-OLD TWINS; CONDUCT DISORDER
AB Previous studies have emphasized the importance of rater issues in studying the etiology of variation in internalizing and externalizing problems in children. Earlier results indicate only moderate agreement between parents, and assume that parents assess a specific aspect of their child's behavior. In comparable samples of younger children, additive genetic effects are the main factor explaining individual differences in both internalizing and externalizing behavior. It is unknown whether this pattern of rater influences and variance decomposition will be consistent in older children. Child Behavior Checklists (Achenbach, 1991), completed by both parents, were collected in a sample of 2956 Dutch 10-year-old twin pairs. The etiology of individual differences in internalizing and externalizing syndromes was examined using a model that corrected for possible rater bias, rater-specific effects and unreliability. The best fitting model suggested that disagreement between the parents is not merely the result of unreliability and/or rater bias, but each parent also provides specific information from his/her own perspective on the child's behavior. Significant influences of additive genetic, shared environmental and unique environmental factors were found for internalizing and externalizing syndromes.

AB Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the effects of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids on childhood behavior and disabilities, including cognitive delay and cerebral palsy.
   Study design: Nonrandomized regional cohort of 541 very preterm infants born in Western Australia from singleton pregnancies and alive at 3 years were included in the study.
   Main outcome measures: Physical, cognitive, and psychological assessments up to 6 years.
   Results: Increasing numbers of antenatal corticosteroid courses were associated with a reduction in the rate of cerebral palsy. Three or more courses were also associated with increased rates of aggressive/destructive, distractible, and hyperkinetic behavior and these effects were present at both ages 3 and 6 years. Measures of internalizing behavior and intelligence quotient were unaffected by antenatal corticosteroid use.
   Conclusion: Repeated antenatal courses of corticosteroids-may protect against cerebral palsy but are associated with hyperactivity later in childhood. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Borrowing from recent dimensional models of psychopathology, the authors conducted analyses that optimized the common variance shared by internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (antisocial personality, substance dependence) disorders in statistically predicting suicidal behaviors. These relationships were analyzed in a large epidemiological sample, thus allowing for the examination of gender differences in risk for suicide attempts associated with psychopathology.
   Method: The data were obtained from the Colorado Social Health Survey. Participants (N=4,745) were a community sample recruited by household address. Structured clinical interviews were used to obtain lifetime diagnostic and symptom count information. Symptom counts were included in a factor analysis that yielded two main dimensions of psychopathology: internalizing and externalizing. These factors were used in hierarchical logistic regression analyses to predict history of suicide attempts associated with the presence of internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Results: After the investigators controlled for the presence of internalizing symptoms and the comorbidity of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms were related to suicidal behavior in both men and women, although comorbidity was most predictive of suicide attempts among women, compared to men.
   Conclusions: Suicidal behavior among individuals with externalizing symptoms is not necessarily a result of comorbid depressive or other internalizing disorder. Thus, persons exhibiting antisocial behaviors should receive rigorous assessment for suicidal ideation and behavior.

AB Background Clinicians and researchers primarily measure behavioural and emotional problems of children in foster care from carer-report checklists. Yet the reliability of these reports is not adequately established. The present study examines one indicator of reliability for foster parent checklist reports: interrater agreement between foster parents and teachers.
   Methods Estimates of interrater agreement of foster parent and teacher responses on the cross-informant scales of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) were obtained for 47 children in long-term foster care, aged 5-11 years. The estimates included calculations of agreement for continuous measures of problem behaviour, as well as for categorical determinations of clinically significant behaviour.
   Results Correlations of CBCL and TRF mean raw scores for the total problems (r = 0.71) and externalizing (r = 0.78) scales exceeded those described in prior studies of parent-teacher agreement, while correlation for internalizing scores (r = 0.23) was similar to that found previously. Teachers and foster parents demonstrated moderate to good agreement (kappa = 0.70-0.79) in identifying clinically significant total problems and externalizing problems, but poor agreement in identifying internalizing problems.
   Conclusions Discrepancies between these and prior findings are discussed. For children in long-term foster care, foster parents or teachers may be used as informants for total problems, externalizing problems, and social-attention-thought problems. The reliability of data on internalizing symptoms is less certain.

AB Emotion regulation cannot be temporally distinguished from emotion in the brain, but activation patterns in prefrontal cortex appear to mediate cognitive control during emotion episodes. Frontal event-related potentials (ERPs) can tap cognitive control hypothetically mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex, and developmentalists have used these to differentiate age, individual, and emotion-valence factors. Extending this approach, the present article outlines a research strategy for studying emotion regulation in children by combining emotion induction with a go/no-go task known to produce frontal ERPs. Preliminary results indicate that medial-frontal ERP amplitudes diminish with age but become more sensitive to anxiety and internalizing children show higher amplitudes than noninternalizing children, especially when anxious. These results may reflect age and individual differences in the effortful regulation of negative emotion.

AB A 4-wave longitudinal design was used to examine protective links from child competence to behavioral problems in first-(M = 10.97 years) and second-(M = 8.27 years) born rural African American children. At 1-year intervals, teachers assessed child behavioral problems, mothers reported their psychological functioning, and both mothers and children reported parenting practices. Structural equation modeling indicated that child competence was linked with residualized positive changes in mothers' psychological functioning from Wave I to Wave 2. Mothers' psychological functioning and child competence at Wave 2 forecast involved-supportive parenting at Wave 3, which was associated negatively with externalizing and internalizing problems at Wave 4. The importance of replicating processes leading to outcomes among children in the same study is discussed.

AB This article reviews the literature on using behavior-rating scales to assess the mental health of children from different ethnic groups in the United States. Particular emphasis is placed on children referred to child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Differences between categorical and dimensional classification, as well as broadband versus narrowband classification approaches are discussed. Sources of potential bias and the best available methods used to assess ethnic group differences in ratings scales are presented. Finally, the extent to which behavior rating scales have been examined for measurement equivalence is critiqued and directions for future research are forward.

AB Using cross-domain latent growth modeling, we examined trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems in disadvantaged boys followed from ages 2 to 6 years (N = 303). On average, externalizing problems gradually decreased and internalizing problems gradually increased. However, we found significant variability in individual-level trajectories. Higher levels of externalizing problems were associated with higher levels of internalizing problems; rates of change were also positively correlated across domains. In addition, high levels of externalizing problems predicted rapid increases in internalizing problems. In follow-up analyses involving child and parenting factors, the combination of high negative emotionality, low fearfulness, and high negative maternal control preceded high, nondecreasing externalizing trajectories. The combination of high negative emotionality, high fearfulness, and high negative maternal control preceded high, increasing internalizing trajectories. Taken together, the results indicate both general and specific processes in the development of early externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB Using a short-term longitudinal design, internalizing and externalizing emotions were examined as risk factors for being victimized by peers in early childhood. Regulation, aggression, and withdrawal were also tested as mediators. We found that anger, mediated by aggression and regulation, positively predicted being victimized, although the way in which anger related to victimization risk varied for boys and girls and across time. These findings were robust, particularly for girls, attesting to the importance of externalizing variables as risk factors for young children's victimization. Support for internalizing variables as risk factors for being victimized was weak. The implications of the findings for developmental models connecting symptomatology and victimization are discussed.
