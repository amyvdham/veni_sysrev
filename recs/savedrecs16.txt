AB Many studies have documented the ways in which shyness can be a barrier to personal well-being and social adjustment throughout childhood and adolescence; however, less is known regarding shyness in emerging adulthood. Shyness as experienced during emerging adulthood may continue to be a risk factor for successful development. The purpose of this study was to compare shy emerging adults with their non-shy peers in (a) internalizing behaviors, (b) externalizing behaviors, and (c) close relationships. Participants included 813 undergraduate students (500 women, 313 men) from a number of locations across the United States. Results showed that relatively shy emerging adults, both men and women, had more internalizing problems (e.g., anxious, depressed, low self-perceptions in multiple domains), engaged in fewer externalizing behaviors (e.g., less frequent drinking), and experienced poorer relationship quality with parents, best friends, and romantic partners than did their non-shy peers.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this work was to analyze prospectively the prevalence of behavioral disorders in children with urinary incontinence because of nonneuropathic bladder-sphincter dysfunction before and after treatment for incontinence.
   METHODS. A total of 202 children with nonneuropathic bladder-sphincter dysfunction were enrolled in the European Bladder Dysfunction Study, in branches for urge syndrome (branch 1) and dysfunctional voiding (branch 2); 188 filled out Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist before treatment and 111 after treatment. Child Behavior Checklist scales for total behavior problems were used along with subscales for externalizing problems and internalizing problems.
   RESULTS. After European Bladder Dysfunction Study treatment, the total behavior problem score dropped from 19% to 11%, the same prevalence as in the normative population; in branch 1 the score dropped from 14% to 13%, and in branch 2 it dropped from 23% to 8%. The prevalence of externalizing problems dropped too, from 12% to 8%: in branch 1 it was unchanged at 10%, and in branch 2 it dropped from 14% to 7%. The decrease in prevalence of internalizing problems after treatment, from 16% to 14%, was not significant.
   CONCLUSION. More behavioral problems were found in dysfunctional voiding than in urge syndrome, but none of the abnormal scores related to the outcome of European Bladder Dysfunction Study treatment for incontinence. With such treatment, both the total behavior problem score and the score for externalizing problems returned to normal, but the score for internalizing problems did not change. The drops in prevalence are statistically significant only in dysfunctional voiding.

AB Laboratory experiments and surveys show that self-objectification increases body shame, disrupts attention, and negatively predicts well-being. Using experience sampling methodology, the authors investigated self-objectification in the daily lives of 49 female college students. Building on the predictions of objectification theory, they examined associations between internalizing an observer's perspective on the self and psychological well-being, and examined the moderating roles of trait self-esteem and appearance-contingent self-worth. Within-person increases in self-objectification predicted decreased well-being, but this association was moderated by trait self-esteem and trait appearance-contingent self-worth; high self-esteem, highly appearance-contingent participants reported increased well-being when they self-objectified. Furthermore, perceived unattractiveness partially mediated the main effect and the three-way interaction: high self-esteem, highly contingent participants experienced smaller drops in well-being when they self-objectified, in part because they felt less unattractive. These results suggest that in daily life, some women receive a boost from self-objectification, although most women experience decreases in well-being when self-objectifying.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the associations between loneliness/social dissatisfaction and teacher-identified behavioural risk during late childhood. A broad range of behaviour problems, as well as academic adjustment, are assessed, in order to specify in which types of behaviour and academic problems loneliness/social dissatisfaction is most likely to occur. Forty-six fifth and sixth graders who were in the borderline or clinical spectrum on the basis of their total Teacher's Report Form score completed the Children's Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Scale, and were compared with 50 students who did not have behaviour problems. Overall, the behaviourally at-risk group experienced more loneliness/social dissatisfaction than the comparison group. Loneliness was a more strong correlate of the variables studied than social dissatisfaction. For the behaviourally at-risk students, the strongest positive associations were found between loneliness and social problems, withdrawn/depressed behaviour and inattention; a trend for a negative association between loneliness and hyperactivity/impulsivity, as well as rule-breaking behaviour was also found. Children having both internalizing and externalizing problems experienced more loneliness than children with either internalizing or externalizing problems. Academic adjustment (i.e. academic performance, how much a student is learning and how happy he/she is) had negative links with loneliness. Several hypothetical explanations are offered and suggestions for research and action are made.

AB Background Research comparing population samples from different time periods to investigate secular changes in adolescents' psychosocial problems have mostly focused on parent and teacher reports. The few studies using self-reports have limitations, such as using only school-based samples or investigating a limited range of problems. Aim We investigated changes from 1993 to 2003 in Dutch 11- to 18-year-old girls' and boys' self-reported emotional and behavioral problems. We also examined whether trends were different for various socio-demographic groups. Method We used the Youth Self-Report (YSR) to assess emotional and behavioral problems, and obtained self-reports of police contact, substance abuse, suicidal ideation and self-harm across two adolescent population samples, assessed in 1993 and 2003. To investigate whether reports were different for the 2 years, we performed analyses of variance on the mean scores, and chi-square analyses on the percentages of deviant-scoring children and children reporting specific problem behaviors for boys and girls separately. Logistic regressions were conducted to investigate interactions of year with various socio-demographic variables. Results For boys, results showed a few small changes, indicating decreases from 1993 to 2003 in self-reported Social Problems, Externalizing, Aggressive Behavior, and Rule-Breaking Behavior. For girls, Thought problems, Somatic Complaints, Internalizing problems, suicidal ideation and self-harm increased. Drunkenness and drug use increased for both boys and girls. There were some differences between socio-demographic groups. Boys from low-SES families and younger adolescent girls experienced most increases. Conclusion We found evidence for some small trends in self-reported problems. For boys, some decreases were seen, regarding mostly behavioral problems, whereas for girls, some increases were seen in emotional and behavioral problems. Changes appeared to have most negatively affected young adolescent girls' functioning.

AB Objective: Numerous studies based on parent questionnaires reveal that obese children are subject to both physical and psychosocial strains. Children are not included as informants in the assessment procedure, and there is a lack of clinical interview studies assessing DSM-IV-based diagnoses in overweight children.
   Methods: Emotional and behavioural problems of treatment seeking obese children (N = 59; aged 8-12-years) attending a mental health service were assessed by means of clinical interviews (Kinder-DIPS) that included child and parent reports. In addition, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) data (N = 55) available for this clinical sample were compared with data of a representative sample of normal-weight children (N = 1,080). Furthermore, CBCL data of the clinical subsample of 10-12 year-old overweight children (N 34) were compared with data of a subsample of 10-12 year-old overweight children (N = 33) and of the subsample of normal-weight (N 386) children from a representative population, both matched by sex.
   Results: 23 children (39%) met full criteria for a psychiatric disorder according to DSM-IV, and 19 (34.5%), nearly one third, suffered from Binge Eating Disorder (BED). The overweight clinical sample and their normal weight peers differed significantly on 6 of the 8 primary syndrome scales, on the internalizing and the externalizing scores, and on the total problem score of the CBCL. The overweight children in the clinical sample scored significantly higher than the overweight children in the representative sample on the subscale measuring social problems and the total score, with BMI accounting for the difference in total score. Within the representative sample, overweight 10-12 year-old children scored significantly higher than their normal weight peers on two scales measuring delinquency and social problems.
   Conclusion: A third of the obese children had mental disorders and behaviour problems. This finding applies to clinically referred obese children and, to a much lesser degree, to nonclinical obese subgroups in the normal population. Clinically obese children constitute a patient group that is in urgent need of multimodal treatment. As a consequence, a major change in treatment and prevention of childhood obesity is warranted, i.e., from the mere treatment of eating and activity behaviours to the inclusion of treatment of co-morbid mental disorder and prevention of chronification.

AB Objective: To determine the differential impact of maternal and paternal internalizing psychopathology on cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) outcome of anxiety-disordered children and adolescents.
   Method: Participants consisted of 127 children and 51 adolescents with a primary anxiety diagnosis. Children were randomly assigned to a standardized group CBT or individual CBT; adolescents received individual CBT. Parents received four training sessions. Participants were evaluated at pre- and post-treatment with a clinical interview and with self- and parent-reported questionnaires. Lifetime anxiety and mood disorders in parents were obtained with a clinical interview.
   Results: For children, no associations were found between maternal and paternal anxiety or mood disorders and treatment outcome. For adolescents, however, maternal lifetime anxiety disorders were positively associated with pre-post-treatment improvement in clinician severity ratings and with treatment success.
   Conclusion: Lifetime maternal anxiety disorders were significantly associated with favourable treatment outcomes in adolescents. Paternal disorders were not associated with treatment response.

AB Objective: To assess the relative contribution of potential risk factors for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children referred for evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including weight, mean sleep duration, and comorbid sleep disorders.
   Design: Medical record review.
   Setting: Academic pediatric medical center.
   Participants: Clinical sample of 235 children aged 3 to 18 years undergoing overnight polysomnography for symptoms of SDB.
   Outcome Measures: History of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems and Child Behavior Check list (CBCL) scores.
   Results: More than half (56%) of the sample was overweight or at risk for overweight, more than one-third (36%) was classified as being short sleepers, and almost half (49%) had at least 1 additional sleep diagnosis. Forty-seven perent had a history of behavioral problems and 23% had a reported diagnosis of a ttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. There were no significant differences in CBCL scores based on any measure of SDB disease severity. Increased weight was associated with increased internalizing, CBCL scores in a dose-dependent fashion (P=.003), while short sleepers were more likely to have elevated externalizing scores (P <.001). Overall, the strongest predictor of adverse behavioral outcomes was the presence of at least 1 additional sleep diagnosis (P <.001).
   Conclusions: The relationship between SDB and parent-reported behavioral outcomes in children is complex. In addition to SDB-related impairments, clinicians should consider the relative contributions of being overweight, insufficient sleep, and comorbid sleep disorders when assessing behavior in these children.

AB Objective: This study was conducted to explore possible causes of rage attacks as well as clinically significant aggressive symptoms in Japanese adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS).
   Methods: The subjects included 29 adolescents (23 males, 6 females; mean age: 13.5 +/- 3.7 years). Eighteen subjects (62.1%) were diagnosed with TS only, 11 (37.9%) with TS and comorbidities, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Clinically significant aggressive symptoms were assessed using two pilot tools, the Rage Screen and Questionnaire and the Clinical Rating of Aggression.
   Results: Thirteen subjects (44.8%) were judged to have clinically significant aggressive symptoms, according to the Clinical Rating of Aggression. Twelve met criteria for recurrent rage attacks, according to the Rage Screen and Questionnaire. Between the 13 aggressive and 16 non-aggressive subjects, no significant differences were found in age, gender, psychiatric comorbidities, or concurrent medication. Child Behavior Checklist ratings to compare 11 aggressive and 12 non-aggressive subjects <= 16 years of age revealed elevated t-test scores on the anxious/depressed, thought problems, aggressive, internalizing, externalizing subscales, and total scale in the aggressive group versus the non-aggressive group.
   Conclusion: Rage attacks and clinically significant aggressive symptoms are common problems in Japanese TS youth. Psychiatric morbidity appears associated with impulsive-aggressive symptoms. Treatment implications from these findings need to be explored further.

AB Background: Mental problems have been hypothesized to impede social adaptation and vice versa, and discrimination is assumed to interact with both. The available empirical documentation is, however, limited. The objective of this study is to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of associations and pathways between discrimination, mental problems and social adaptation in young refugees. Methods: Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used for the analysis of cross-sectional data from interviews with 131 young Middle Eastern refugees residing in Denmark. Results: Participants reported a mean of 1.8 experiences of discrimination, and the prevalence of five indicators of positive social adaptation was 47-92%. Discrimination, mental problems and social adaptation were strongly mutually associated, without gender difference. Discrimination predicted internalizing behaviour. Improved social adaptation correlated negatively with discrimination and with externalizing and internalizing behaviour. Conclusion: Perceived discrimination among young refugees from the Middle East is associated with mental problems and social adaptation. Discrimination seems to provoke internalizing but not externalizing behaviour. The direction of other pathways is ambiguous, suggesting a certain amount of recursive interaction between mental health, discrimination and social adaptation.

AB Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children is strikingly similar in clinical presentation and treatment responsiveness to OCD in adults. While treatment is commonly effective for OCD not all subtypes of OCD are similarly responsive to treatment. Numerous studies describe the differential responsiveness of OCD subtypes to pharmacological treatment in adults, yet few such studies exist in pediatric OCD. This manuscript reviews the extant literature that addresses differential response of OCD subtypes to medication intervention. Specific OCD subtypes can be derived utilizing the following strategies: symptom factor analysis, comorbidity latent class analysis, concurrent internalizing disorders, concurrent externalizing disorders, tic-related subtype and early-onset subtype are reviewed in relation to data on differential pharmacotherapy response. Only externalizing disorders moderate treatment response in pediatric OCD. Specifically, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder are associated with poorer response to medication treatment. Hoarding appears to be associated with a poor response to medication in adults, but data are sparse in children. The presence of tic disorders may also predict poorer response to pharmacotherapy in pediatric OCD. Strategies for treatment of the tic-related subtype of OCD, while strongly supporting the use of antipsychotic-augmentation for enhanced response in adults, are lacking controlled data in pediatric OCD.

AB We tested whether children show greater internalizing symptoms when their parents are actively abusing alcohol. In an integrative data analysis, we combined observations over ages 2 through 17 from two longitudinal studies of children of alcoholic parents and matched controls recruited from the community. Using a mixed modeling approach, we tested whether children showed elevated mother- and child-reported internalizing symptoms (a) at the same time that parents showed alcohol-related consequences (time-varying effects), (b) if parents showed greater alcohol-related consequences during the study period (proximal effects), and (c) if parents had a lifetime diagnosis of alcoholism that predated the study period (distal effects). No support for time-varying effects was found; proximal effects of mothers' alcohol-related consequences on child-reported internalizing symptoms were found and distal effects of mother and father alcoholism predicted greater internalizing symptoms among children of alcoholic parents. Implications for the time-embedded relations between parent alcoholism and children's internalizing symptoms are discussed.

AB The goal of this study was to explore the moderating role of maternal personality and parenting characteristics in the links between shyness and adjustment in kindergarten. Participants were 197 children enrolled in kindergarten programs (and their mothers and teachers). Multisource assessment was employed, including maternal ratings, behavioral observations, teacher ratings, and individual child interviews. Results indicated that shyness was associated with a wide range of socio-emotional and school adjustment difficulties in kindergarten. Moreover, support for the moderating role of parenting was also found. Relations between shyness and certain indices of maladjustment were stronger among children with mothers characterized by higher neuroticism, BIS sensitivity, and an overprotective parenting style, and weaker for mothers characterized by high agreeableness and an authoritative parenting style.

AB The predictive validity of symptom criteria for different subtypes of ADHD among children who were impaired in at least one setting in early childhood was examined. Academic achievement was assessed seven times over 8 years in 125 children who met symptom criteria for ADHD at 4-6 years of age and in 130 demographically-matched non-referred comparison children. When intelligence and other confounds were controlled, children who met modified criteria for the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD in wave 1 had lower reading, spelling, and mathematics scores over time than both comparison children and children who met modified criteria for the other subtypes of ADHD. In some analyses, children who met modified criteria for the combined type had somewhat lower mathematics scores than comparison children. The robust academic deficits relative to intelligence in the inattentive group in this age range suggest either that inattention results in academic underachievement or that some children in the inattentive group have learning disabilities that cause secondary symptoms of inattention. Unexpectedly, wave 1 internalizing (anxiety and depression) symptoms independently predicted deficits in academic achievement controlling ADHD, intelligence, and other predictors.

AB Objective: To evaluate the utility of the Child Behavior Check list (CBCL) for identifying children of parents with panic disorder or major depression at high-risk for future psychopathology.
   Methods: Baseline Internalizing and Externalizing CBCL T-scores were used to predict subsequent depressive, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders at a 5-year follow-up in children of parents with panic disorder, major depression, or neither disorder.
   Results: The Internalizing scale predicted subsequent agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and social phobia. In contrast, the Externalizing scale predicted subsequent disruptive behavior disorders and major depression.
   Conclusions: The convergence of these results with previous findings based on structured diagnostic interviews suggests that the CBCL broad-band scales can inexpensively and efficiently help identify children at high risk for future psychopathology within a population of children already at risk by virtue of parental psychopathology.

AB Co-occurring mental distress and behavior problems are the norm in substance abuse treatment but are often poorly assessed due to resource constraints. This paper describes the development and validation of scales measuring internalizing mental distress and externalizing behavior problems that are shorter versions of comorbidity scales found in the full Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN). GAIN data from two treatment outcome studies, one involving adolescents and the other on adults, were used in the creation and testing of the scales. Subsets of items from the full GAIN scales were selected for the short scales through the application of standard psychometric principles. The short comorbidity scales still have moderate to high reliability and are highly correlated with the full scales. Parallel tests of construct validity show no substantial loss when moving from the longer to shorter versions. The short scales maintain good sensitivity and specificity for predicting diagnostic impressions.

AB We examined factors related to treatment responders (n = 35) and nonresponders (n = 16) in a group of 51 children admitted to the Intensive Mental Health Program (IMHP). Children's response to treatment was coded based on their functioning at intake and discharge using total CAFAS scores. Demographic variables, length of treatment, number of diagnoses and medications, and history of physical/emotional abuse or neglect did not significantly distinguish between responders and nonresponders. Nonresponders were more likely to present with a history of suspected or confirmed sexual abuse, internalizing diagnoses, or comorbid internalizing and externalizing diagnoses. Although the small sample size may limit interpretations, our findings indicate treatment programs need augmentation when children with serious emotional disturbances (SED) may be at risk for not responding to interventions.

AB The Pediatric Symptom Checklist- 17 (PSC- 17) is a brief form of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist that is designed to screen for behavioral health problems in primary care settings. It has been proposed to have three subscales: externalizing, internalizing, and attention problems. in the context of developing a behavioral health screening program in an inner-city primary care practice, we evaluated the construct validity of the PSCA 7. A total of 331 families with children between 4 and 12 years of age who were seen for well-child care during the study were invited to complete the PSC-17 and 320 families (96.5%) did so. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed and the Comparative Fit Index and root mean square error of approximation fit statistics were calculated to determine whether the data fit the proposed three-factor model. We found that although the PSC-17 contained three subscales, several items did not load predominantly on the subscale that they were proposed to measure. Specifically, although the five items on the internalizing subscale loaded only on this subscale, only four of the seven externalizing items loaded exclusively on the externalizing subscale, and only two of the five attention items loaded exclusively on the attention problems subscale. Clinicians using the PSC-17 in urban low-income communities should recognize that the externalizing and attention problems subscales of the PSC-17 may not be valid measures of these dimensions of child behavior in this population.

AB The specificity of the association between 2 parenting behaviors (warmth and supervision) and 2 indicators, aggressive behavior and depressive symptoms, of major child outcomes (externalizing problems and internalizing problems) was examined among 196 inner-city African American mothers and their school age children. Given the growing number of African American families affected by HIV/AIDS and demonstrated compromises in parenting associated with maternal infection, the moderating role of maternal HIV/AIDS was also examined. Findings from longitudinal analyses supported the specificity of maternal warmth but not of maternal supervision. Maternal warmth was a stronger predictor of decreases in child aggressive behavior than of decreases in depressive symptoms. In addition, maternal warmth was a stronger predictor of decreases in aggressive behavior than was maternal supervision. Parenting specificity was not moderated by maternal HIV/AIDS. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB This study tested a hypothesized model of the relationship between maternal depression and child psychological and physical dysfunction mediated by parenting and medication adherence. A sample of 242 children with asthma, aged 7 to 17, participated with their mothers. Maternal depression was assessed by self-report, and parenting was observed during family interaction tasks. Internalizing symptoms were assessed by self- and clinician reports. Asthma disease activity was assessed according to National Heart Lung and Blood Institute guidelines, and medication adherence was evaluated with a 24-hr recall method. Structural equation modeling indicated that negative parenting partially mediated the relationship between maternal depression and child internalizing symptoms. Child internalizing symptoms, in turn, mediated the associations between both maternal depression and negative parenting and asthma disease activity. Medication adherence did not mediate the link from maternal depression to disease activity. Thus, maternal depression was linked to child psychological dysfunction both directly and indirectly via negative parenting but linked to physical dysfunction only indirectly through psychological dysfunction. These findings suggest that diagnosing and treating depression in mothers of children with asthma would enhance child well-being both psychologically and physically.

AB Limited data exist on the unique, additive, and interactive effects of exposure to domestic and community violence on children's functioning, particularly in community samples. This study examined relations between children's violence exposure, at home and in the community, and symptoms of externalizing and internalizing problems. Parents reported on domestic violence in the home, and children reported on community violence. Concurrent child functioning was measured through parent and teacher reports on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and child self-reports on the Children's Depression Inventory. A multiethnic sample of 117 children, aged 8 to 12 years, and their parents and teachers participated. Community violence was related to all measures of children's adjustment, whereas exposure to domestic violence was related only to CBCL extemalizing problems. Teacher reports of child aggression were predicted by child age, community violence, and the interaction of community and domestic violence. Implications for research and clinical intervention are discussed.

AB This study examines child and adolescent psychopathology from a maladaptive trait perspective, incorporating both parental and child ratings of parenting as a moderator of the personality-psychopathology association. Hierarchical moderated regression analyses were conducted on a combined sample of referred and nonreferred children and adolescents (N=862, parental ratings of parenting and N=396, child ratings of parenting). The results indicated positive main effects of maladaptive traits on externalizing and internalizing problems, and positive main effects of parental negative control on externalizing problems. Significant interactions were found for Disagreeableness and Emotional Instability with parental Negative Control and for Disagreeableness x Positive Parenting in explaining externalizing problems. The discussion focuses on the contribution of these findings to a better understanding of the trait-psychopathology relationship at young age.

ID TEACHER RATINGS; SCHOOL READINESS; CHILD; PARENT; PRESCHOOL; AGGRESSION;

AB Children's behavior problems, both internalizing and externalizing, are a function of both genetic and environmental influences. One potentially important environmental influence is the classroom environment. This study of 1941 monozygotic twin pairs examined whether children whose parents rated them as similarly high or low on a number of problem behaviors were rated in the same way by teachers when they were together versus separated in their classrooms at school. Results showed that twins in the same classrooms were rated by their teachers more similarly on each dimension of problem behavior than were twins who were separated into different classrooms, suggesting that the classroom environment is important in predicting differences between twins in terms of problem behaviors at school. In addition, parents' ratings of problem behaviors were lower for twins placed in the same classroom versus twins in different classrooms. Thus, there is reason to consider whether, at least during the early school years, parents should be allowed to make the decision to not separate twins at school.

AB We examined in 100 girls whether girls' depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and perceived similarity were related to their cognitions of hypothetical friends (prosocial, withdrawn/depressed, and aggressive). Depression, loneliness, and social anxiety were each related to various friend-related cognitions, but only social anxiety and loneliness had unique relations when these three internalizing problems were examined simultaneously and with perceived similarity. After accounting for the three internalizing constructs, perceived similarity was related to higher wanting to be friends with and perceived acceptance from all three hypothetical friends, lower not wanting aggressive girls as friends, and lower expected rejection by prosocial girls. Findings highlight the importance of perceived similarity, and the importance of examining depression, loneliness, and social anxiety simultaneously, when assessing girls' friendship-related cognitions.

AB Objective: The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine change in internalizing symptoms from late childhood (age 10) into mid-adolescence (age 15) in a nationally representative sample of Canadian children. The roles of a child's sex, maternal depressive symptoms in late childhood, and their interactions were investigated. Method: The sample was derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Mothers reported on their own depressive symptoms and children reported on their own internalizing symptoms at three time (T) points (T1: 1994/1995; T2: 1996/1997; T3: 1998/1999). Change in children's internalizing symptoms was investigated using multiple regression. Results: Girls increased and boys decreased in their internalizing symptoms from T1 to T3. The effect of maternal depressive symptoms at T1 was moderated by sex and remained significant after controlling for maternal depressive symptoms at T2 and T3, with more adverse effects in girls. Conclusions: The internalizing symptoms of girls increased from childhood to adolescence, whereas those for boys decreased. Female children exposed to maternal depressive symptoms T1 continued to show negative effects 4 years later.

ID CARDIAC-ARRHYTHMIAS; PERCEPTIONS; GENOTYPE; ILLNESS; IMPACT
AB Objective: To compare children with asthma to children with long-QT syndrome (LQTS) in terms of anxiety and medical fears.
   Method: Forty children (25 males/15 females) with asthma and their mothers participated, along with seven children with LQTS (four males/three females) and their mothers.
   Results: Children with asthma had significantly more medical fears, fear of danger/death, and fear of minor injury and small animals compared to children with LQTS. Children with LQTS tended to have more fear of failure and criticism, and tended to keep their feelings to themselves and minimize their real feelings of anxiety. Children with LQTS had significantly more internalizing problems, and their mothers had significantly higher anxiety.
   Conclusion: Fear and uncertainty can be overwhelming in LQTS. Children with LQTS do not seem to be able to share their feelings openly. Examining the psychosocial adjustment of affected children may assist professionals to help families to cope more effectively.

Results of cross sectional regression and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses suggest that there is a positive relationship between limited English proficiency and externalizing symptoms, particularly by third grade. Additionally, sex and place of birth also helped to explain externalizing behaviors at various time points in the models. Place of birth and family poverty were significantly associated with internalizing symptoms. Implications for future research and interventions related to internalizing and externalizing behavior among the Latino/a school aged population are discussed.

AB This study examined the relationship among pubertal timing, parental control, and problem behaviors. There were 267 participants, whose ages ranged from 9 to 16 years. Both maternal and paternal psychological control predicted problem behaviors over and above the effects of behavioral control. For boys, early maturation and high levels of paternal psychological control, whereas for girls, on-time maturation and low levels of paternal psychological control were associated with low levels of internalizing problem behaviors. Early maturation and high levels of maternal psychological control predicted high levels of externalizing problem behaviors. The implications of these findings were discussed in terms of the detrimental effects of psychological control on adolescent wellbeing, the role that pubertal timing may or may not play during this period, and finally the need to separately examine fathers' parenting and mothers' parenting while investigating the impact of parental control on adolescent problem behaviors.

AB In a longitudinal study that followed children from fourth through sixth grades, we tested whether problems in children's peer relations preceded psychological maladjustment and whether adjustment difficulties paved the way for poor social relationships. Both close friendships and peer group acceptance were examined. Our findings indicated that less peer acceptance predicted more internalizing and externalizing symptoms and less global self-worth two years later but that psychological adjustment did not predict future peer acceptance. Conversely, the lack of a supportive close friendship did not predict worse psychological functioning; however, depressive symptoms and low self-worth did predict less close friend support two years later. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing the different kinds of social bonds that children form with peers.

AB OBJECTIVE. The survival of very low birth weight infants has increased markedly in recent years. Unfortunately, the prevalence of significant and lifelong motor, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction has remained a major problem confronting these children. The objective of this study was to perform screening tests for early autistic features in children with a history of very low birth weight and to identify risk factors associated with a positive screening result.
   METHODS. We studied 91 ex-preterm infants <= 1500 g at birth. Infants underwent conventional MRI studies at preterm and/or term-adjusted age. We collected pertinent demographic, prenatal, intrapartum, acute postnatal, and short-term outcome data for all infants. Follow-up assessments were performed at a mean age of 21.9 +/- 4.7 months, using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Child Behavior Checklist.
   RESULTS. Twenty-six percent of ex-preterm infants had a positive result on the autism screening tool. Abnormal scores correlated highly with internalizing behavioral problems on the Child Behavior Checklist and socialization and communication deficits on the Vineland Scales. Lower birth weight, gestational age, male gender, chorioamnionitis, acute intrapartum hemorrhage, illness severity on admission, and abnormal MRI studies were significantly associated with an abnormal autism screening score.
   CONCLUSIONS. Early autistic behaviors seem to be an underrecognized feature of very low birth weight infants. The results from this study suggest that early screening for signs of autism may be warranted in this high-risk population followed by definitive autism testing in those with positive screening results.

AB Increasing numbers of children are presenting with internalizing symptoms, and psychologists need effective and efficient ways of assessing and intervening with these problems, most typically anxiety and depression. The author discusses a positive, strength-based approach to internalizing disorders with an emphasis on the role of positive affect in differential diagnosis and intervention. This framework describes how positive affect, life satisfaction, and strengths may be measured and how such measurement may be integrated into the overall assessment. A positive framework is also applied to intervention, both in terms of current empirically validated interventions for children's internalizing disorders and in consideration of new intervention applications based on recent work with adults and youth.

AB This study investigates the relationships among stress, coping, and mental health in 139 students participating in an International Baccalaureate (IB) high school diploma program. Mental health was assessed using both positive indicators (life satisfaction, academic achievement, academic self-efficacy) and negative indicators (psychopathology) of adolescent social-emotional and school functioning. Findings include that students in an IB program perceive significantly more stress than a sample of 168 of their general education peers, and that specific coping styles are differentially related to mental health outcomes in this subgroup of high-achieving high school students. Furthermore, coping styles (specifically, anger and positive appraisal) moderate the influence of stress on global life satisfaction and internalizing symptoms of psychopathology.

AB Background Child and adolescent mental health service units (CAMHS) play an important role in the supply of services to children and adolescents with mental illness. The purpose of this study was to examine the service unit effect on parent satisfaction with outpatient treatment. Method The study was undertaken in 49 of 72 Norwegian outpatient CAMHS in 2004. A total of 2253 of the parents who were asked to participate (87%) responded. Parent satisfaction was measured using two summated scales: clinician interaction/ information and treatment outcome. Multilevel analyses were used to assess the contribution of the service units to satisfaction and to investigate patient level predictors of parent satisfaction. Results About 96) 98% of the parent satisfaction variance could be attributed to factors within CAMHS, leaving only 2-4% of the variance attributable to the CAMHS level. Parents of patients aged 0-6 years were more satisfied than older patients' parents. Longer treatment episodes were positively associated with satisfaction. Parents whose children had been referred with externalizing symptoms were less satisfied with treatment outcome than those referred for internalizing symptoms. Waiting time was negatively associated with treatment outcome satisfaction. Adjustments for patient characteristics did not substantially change the relative effect of CAMHS on satisfaction ratings. Conclusion The results indicate that information from user satisfaction surveys has clear limitations as an indicator of CAMHS quality. From a quality improvement perspective, the factors affecting the variance within CAMHS are of dominating importance compared to factors affecting between CAMHS variance.

AB Perceived school safety and victimization of adolescents were investigated in conjunction with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in adolescence. Self-efficacy and trust in teachers were studied as resources that promote psychosocial well-being. The sample was consisted of 225 students 8th to 10th grade from schools in Bremen. Findings showed that self-efficacy was significantly related to more prosocial and fewer internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, whereas victimization and low school safety went along with more symptoms. Trust in teacher was not linked to better adjustment, it was however associated with more emotional symptoms and problems with peers. Self-efficacy moderated the association between school safety and behavior problems. Students with low self-efficacy who felt safe at their school had fewer behavior problems.

AB This study used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between childhood exposure to domestic violence and children's internalizing, externalizing, and trauma symptoms. Results from 60 reviewed studies revealed mean weighted effect size d-values of .48 and .47 for the relationship between exposure to domestic violence and childhood internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively, indicating moderate effects. A larger mean weighted effect size d-value of 1.54 was obtained for the relationship between exposure to domestic violence and childhood trauma symptoms, though this figure was based on only six studies. Moderator analyses for gender showed that the relationship between exposure to domestic violence and externalizing symptoms was significantly stronger for boys than for girls. Further analyses examining age, age by gender, and recruitment setting variables revealed no significant effects. Descriptive information obtained from this meta-analytic review suggests that more recent research within this area is beginning to address some of the significant methodological limitations of past research. Recommendations for future research in the area are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Children of alcoholics (COAs) are at elevated risk for alcohol use disorders (AUD), yet not all COAs will develop AUD. The 2 primary aims of this study were to identify neural activation mechanisms that may mark protection or vulnerability to AUD in COAs and to map the same activation patterns in relation to risk behavior (externalizing or internalizing behavior).
   Methods: Twenty-two adolescent COAs were recruited from an ongoing community longitudinal study of alcoholic and matched control families. They were categorized as either vulnerable (n = 11) or resilient (n = 11) based on the level of problem drinking over the course of adolescence. Six other adolescents with no parental history of alcoholism, and no evidence of their own problem drinking were recruited from the same study and labeled as low-risk controls. Valenced words were presented to the participants in a passive viewing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Activation to negative versus neutral words and positive versus neutral words were compared between groups. Behavior problems were assessed with the Youth Self-Report (YSR).
   Results: The resilient COA group had more activation of the orbital frontal gyrus (OFG), bilaterally, and left insula/putamen than the control and vulnerable groups, in response to emotional stimuli. In contrast, the vulnerable group had more activation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and less activation of the ventral striatum and extended amygdala, bilaterally, to emotional stimuli than the control and resilient groups. The vulnerable group had more externalizing behaviors which correlated with increased dorsomedial prefrontal activation and decreased ventral striatal and extended amygdala activation.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with dissociable patterns of neural activation underlying risk and resiliency in COAs. We propose that the pattern observed in the resilient COAs represents an active emotional monitoring function, which may be a protective factor in this group. On the other hand, the vulnerable group displayed a pattern consistent with active suppression of affective responses, perhaps resulting in the inability to engage adaptively with emotional stimuli.

AB The roles of social support and coping as intervening processes between exposure to community violence and internalizing symptoms were examined longitudinally among a community sample of 667 middle school students in the inner city. After controlling for potential confounders (e.g., social desirability, victimization and witnessing of family violence, guardian's psychological symptomatology), internalizing symptoms at Year 2 were predicted by hypothesized changes over 1 year, such that increased community violence exposure, decreased guardian and peer support, and increased use of defensive and confrontational behavioral coping were related to more internalizing symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD, although some of these relations varied by gender. The relations between internalizing symptoms at Year 3 and increased changes in exposure to community violence over 2 years were moderated by social support and/or coping, such that decreased guardian support and increased use of defensive and confrontational coping were generally associated with more symptoms for boys exposed to community violence. Girls who witnessed increased community violence and who increased their use of defensive or confrontational coping experienced more internalizing symptoms. The findings underscore the importance of developmental and contextual considerations in the design and implementation of interventions.

AB This study explores gender differences in lifetime and recent substance use/internalizing behavior, childhood externalizing behavior, and gambling preferences among African-American youth gamblers. Data are from a prospective study of a community sample of 452 urban African-American youths who began at entry into first grade and were followed for ten years. Gambling was associated with high teacher ratings of childhood externalizing behaviors among males and with high parent ratings of childhood impulsivity and hyperactivity among both genders. Internalizing behavior was associated with female gambling. No male-female differences in substance use/lifetime conduct disorder among gamblers were noted. Gambling preferences/frequency differed across genders.

AB Mindfulness training was evaluated as a new treatment for attention and impulsivity problems in adolescents with a variety of different externalizing disorders: attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant and/or conduct disorder, and autism spectrum disorder if characterized by externalizing problem behaviour. It was argued that the large overlap between these three disorders may be partially explained by common underlying attention and behaviour control deficits. Fourteen clinically referred adolescents suffering from externalizing disorders followed mindfulness training in a group format. Parallel, their parents received mindful parenting training. Adolescents and their parents were measured before and after waitlist, after 8-week training, and at 8-week follow-up. No improvement occurred during waitlist on most variables. After mindfulness training, children self-reported substantial improvement on personal goals, internalizing and externalizing complaints, attention problems, happiness, and mindful awareness, and performed better on a sustained attention test. Likewise, parents reported improvement on children's goals, externalizing and attention problems, self-control, attunement to others and withdrawal. In addition, parents improved on their own goals. Improvement was maintained 8 weeks after the training. Consistent with mindfulness theory, increased child awareness after training predicted longer-term improvement in parent-rated child symptoms. Concomitant parent and child mindfulness training appears to be a promising approach for clinic-referred adolescents with attention and impulsivity problems.

AB Associations among internalizing, externalizing, and social competence were examined in a longitudinal cohort (N = 205) of 8- to 12-year-old children reassessed after 7, 10, and 20 years. Theoretically informed nested structural equation models tested interconnections among broad multi-informant constructs across four developmental periods. Follow-up analyses examined gender invariance, measurement and age effects, and putative common causes. Key model comparisons indicated robust negative paths from social competence to internalizing problems from childhood to adolescence and from emerging adulthood to young adulthood. Social competence and externalizing problems showed strong initial associations in childhood but no longitudinal cross-domain paths. Using a developmental psychopathology framework, results are discussed in relation to cascade and transactional effects and the interplay between competence and symptoms over time.

AB In planning interventions it is essential to understand how adverse risk factors in early childhood are associated with child mental health problems, whether some types of problems can be better explained by the specific risk factors, and whether early risk factors are differently related to different types of child behavior problems. A community sample of 692 1.5-3.5-year-old children from Northern Russia was assessed by means of maternal reports. The study compared two models for the development of internalizing (withdrawn, anxious/depressed) and externalizing (aggressive, destructive) behavior problems in relation to the same early risk factors using structural equation modeling. Findings suggested that the development of these problems is related to maternal psychological problems and alcohol use during pregnancy, and mediated by the continuing maternal and family dysfunction and compromised postnatal condition of the child. Results indicated good model fit for both internalizing and externalizing problems, and neither of the models fit significantly better than the other. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding developmental risk and informing intervention and prevention efforts.

AB This study examined parent and child gender effects on parents' attributions and beliefs in regards to child symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants included mothers and fathers of 19 girls and 17 boys with ADHD. Groups of boys and girls, aged 5-13 years, were equated on age and medication status, as well as ADHD symptom severity. These groups also were similar in the severity of comorbid oppositional behaviors and internalizing problems, as well as a variety of demographic characteristics. Parents' attributions for child behavior were assessed in response to written scenarios describing either hyperactive/impulsive or inattentive symptoms of ADHD. Parents also completed a questionnaire assessing beliefs and knowledge about ADHD. There were no child gender effects for parents' attributions or beliefs. All parents attributed inattentive symptoms to more internal, global and stable causes than impulsive symptoms. Mothers attributed both inattentive and impulsive child symptoms to more global and stable causes than did fathers. Fathers, but not mothers, reported more negative reactions to ADHD symptoms that were perceived as having an internal cause. Finally, mothers scored higher on beliefs in behavior management than did fathers, and fathers believed more in psychological causes and treatments for ADHD. Possible explanations for and implications of these results are explored.

AB Objective This study aimed to evaluate the role of parental relational styles on the development of psychopathological disturbances in children with Learning Disability (LD).
   Method Fifty-six children aged 7-12 diagnosed with LD were evaluated on the basis of the Children Behaviour Check List (CBCL) completed by parents. Parents completed an Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and a family relationships internal representations questionnaire (Family Attitudes Questionnaire, FAQ). Multiple regressions were performed, using parental FAQ and ASQ scores as predictors and children's CBCL scores as criterion
   Results Sixty percent of children in the sample obtained a clinical score in at least one of the two syndrome groups. Internalizing behavior in children was predicted by father's Relationships as Secondary and mother's Need for Approval and Preoccupation with Relationships scores. Externalizing behavior was predicted by both father and mother's Need for Approval scores.
   Conclusion Insecure attachment styles in parents appeared associated with maladaptive emotional-behavioral strategies in their children and may be interpreted as a risk factor for the development of the latter. More specifically, internalizing behavior in children appeared associated with dimensions pointing to dismissing attachment in fathers and to preoccupied attachment in mothers, while externalizing behavior appeared associated with dimensions indicating preoccupied attachment in both parents. Possible interpretations of these data within the LD population are put forward.

AB Temperament, effortful control, and problem behaviors at 4.5 years were assessed in 72 children classified as exuberant, inhibited, and low reactive as 2-year-olds. Exuberant toddlers were more positive, socially responsive to novel persons, less shy, and rated as having more problem behaviors, including externalizing and internalizing behaviors, than other children as preschoolers. Two forms of effortful control, the ability to delay a response and the ability to produce a subdominant response, were associated with fewer externalizing behaviors, whereas expressing more negative affect (relative to positive/neutral affect) when disappointed was related to more internalizing behaviors. Interaction effects implicated high levels of unregulated emotion during disappointment as a risk factor for problem behaviors in exuberant children.

AB Effortful control was examined as a moderator of the relations of three domains of contextual risk factors to growth in internalizing and externalizing problems in a community sample (N = 189) of children (8-12 years at Time 1). Socioeconomic, maternal, and environmental risk factors were examined as predictors of initial levels and growth in children's adjustment problems across 3 years. The effects of the risk factors depended on children's level of effortful control. For children lower in effortful control, socioeconomic risk was related to significantly higher initial levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and decreases over time. However, children lower in effortful control had higher levels of problems at all three time points than children higher in effortful control. Maternal risk was associated with increases in internalizing for children lower in effortful control, and environmental risk was related to increases in internalizing and externalizing problems for children lower in effortful control, but not those higher in effortful control. Children who were lower in effortful control appeared to experience more adverse effects of contextual risk than those higher in effortful control, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving children's effortful control might serve to protect children from increased risk of adjustment problems associated with contextual risk factors.

AB There are a number of significant challenges researchers encounter when studying development over an extended period of time, including subject attrition, the changing of measurement structures across groups and developmental periods, and the need to invest substantial time and money. Integrative data analysis is an emerging set of methodologies that allows researchers to overcome many of the challenges of single-sample designs through the pooling of data drawn from multiple existing developmental studies. This approach is characterized by a host of advantages, but this also introduces several new complexities that must be addressed prior to broad adoption by developmental researchers. In this article, the authors focus on methods for fitting measurement models and creating scale scores using data drawn from multiple longitudinal studies. The authors present findings from the analysis of repeated measures of internalizing symptomatology that were pooled from three existing developmental studies. The authors describe and demonstrate each step in the analysis and conclude with a discussion of potential limitations and directions for future research.

AB This study examines the effects of kindergarten retention on children's social-emotional development in the early, middle, and late elementary years. Previous studies have generated mixed results partly due to some major methodological challenges, including selection bias, measurement error, and divergent perceptions of multiple respondents in different domains of child development. The authors address these challenges by using propensity score stratification to contend with selection bias and by embedding measurement models in hierarchical models to account for measurement error and to model dependence among observations. The authors' analyses of a series of multivariate models enable them to compare the retention effects across different respondents over different time points. In general, the results show no evidence suggesting that kindergarten retention does harm to children's social-emotional development. Rather, the findings suggest that, had the retained kindergartners been promoted to the first grade instead, they would possibly have developed a lower level of self-confidence and interest in reading and all school subjects 2 years later and would have displayed a higher level of internalizing problem behaviors at the end of the treatment year and 2 years later.

AB This study assessed the relation between religious involvement and multiple indices of competence in 183 eighth- and ninth-grade Indonesian Muslim adolescents (M = 13.3 years). The authors assessed spirituality and religiosity using both parent and adolescent reports, and social competence and adjustment using multiple measures and data sources. Structural equation modeling analyses revealed that parent and adolescent reports of religiosity and spirituality yielded I single religious involvement latent variable that was related to peer group status, academic achievement, emotional regulation, prosocial behavior, antisocial/problem behavior, internalizing behavior, and self-esteem. The consistency of relations between religious involvement and competence may be in part attributable to the collectivist context of religion in West Java, Indonesia, within which people exhibit strong beliefs in Islam and religion permeates daily life.

AB Although Internalized and Externalized problem behaviors are described as separate phenomena at the psychometric and clinical levels, they frequently co-occur. Only few studies, however, have investigated the causes of such covariation. In a sample of 398 twin pairs aged 8-17 drawn from the general population-based Italian Twin Registry, we applied bivariate genetic analyses to parent-rated CBCL/6-18 Internalization and Externalization scores. Covariation of Internalizing and Externalizing problem behaviors was best explained by genetic and common environmental factors, while the influence of unique environmental factors upon covariance appeared negligible. Odds ratio values showed that a borderline/clinical level of Externalization is a robust predictor of co-existing Internalizing problems in the same child, or within a sibship. Our findings help to approximate individual risks (e.g., in clinical practice, predicting the presence of Internalization in an externalizing child, and vice-versa), and to recognize that several shared environmental and genetic factors can simultaneously affect a child's proneness to suffer from both types of problem behaviors.

ID FRIENDSHIP; RESPONSES; MEMORY
AB Same-sex friendships are an important source of social support and typically contribute to positive adjustment. However, there can be adjustment trade-offs if the friends co-ruminate (i.e., talk excessively about problems) in that co-rumination is related to having close friendships but also to increased internalizing symptoms. The current study utilized an experimental manipulation that elicited co-rumination in young women and thus mirrored an everyday response to stress. Observed co-rumination was associated with a significant increase in the stress hormone, cortisol (after controlling for self-reported co-rumination and for cortisol levels assessed before the discussion of problems). These findings suggest that co-rumination can amplify, rather than mitigate, the hormonal stress response to personal life stressors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article evaluates the relations between peer victimization and child and parent reports of social-psychological variables 1.5 years later. Thirty-six children diagnosed with endocrine disorders and their parents completed questionnaires regarding social-psychological functioning. Peer victimization at time 2 was significantly related to concurrent depression, loneliness, externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Hierarchical linear regression equations indicated that peer victimization at baseline was not a significant predictor of time 2 social-psychological functioning when baseline levels of each variable were controlled. Significant correlations were found between baseline and time 2 levels of social anxiety, loneliness, externalizing and internalizing symptoms, with medium to large effect sizes. Peer victimization, social anxiety, loneliness, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems are relatively stable across time. Peer victimization is related to concurrent adjustment problems but may not contribute to the development of new problems. Early identification and intervention is imperative. Medical visits are an opportunity to assess and refer for treatment.

AB Many factors have been identified to explain differences in mental health problems between migrant and native children: the process of migration, the ethnic minority position of migrants, their specific cultural background and the selection of migrants. In this paper, the international literature regarding mental health of migrant children is reviewed using strict selection criteria. An extensive search was carried out to locate journal articles on the subject of mental health in migrant youth published since the 1990s. Only 20 studies met all inclusion criteria. Besides the conclusion that the studies did not unequivocally find an increased risk of mental health problems in migrant children, it proved to be very difficult to draw any sound conclusions with respect to these children's risk of mental health problems, since the impact of migration on children's mental health varied with the informants used and the characteristics of the migrant group and of the host country. The lack of univocal definitions of key terms further complicated generalised conclusions in this research field. As such, this research field is in urgent need of more research using standardised research designs, methodology and definitions. A proposition for this research design is made.

AB OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of breastfeeding on child behavior and maternal adjustment.
   METHODS. We followed up children who were in the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial, a cluster-randomized trial of a breastfeeding promotion intervention based on the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. A total of 17 046 healthy, breastfeeding mother-infant pairs were enrolled from 31 Belarussian maternity hospitals and affiliated polyclinics; 13 889 (81.5%) were followed up at 6.5 years. Mothers and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and supplemental questions bearing on internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems. Mothers also responded to questions concerning their relationships to their partner and child and their breastfeeding of subsequently born children.
   RESULTS. The experimental intervention led to a large increase in exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months (43.3% vs 6.4%) and a significantly higher prevalence of any breastfeeding at all ages up to and including 12 months. No significant treatment effects were observed on either the mother or the teacher Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ratings of total difficulties, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, or prosocial behavior or on the supplemental behavioral questions. We found no evidence of treatment effects on the parent's marriage or on the mother's satisfaction with her relationships with her partner or child, but the experimental intervention significantly increased the duration of any breastfeeding, and mothers in the experimental group were nearly twice as likely to breastfeed exclusively the next-born child for at least 3 months.
   CONCLUSIONS. On the basis of the largest randomized trial ever conducted in the area of human lactation, we found no evidence of risks or benefits of prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding for child and maternal behavior. Breastfeeding promotion does, however, favorably affect breastfeeding of the subsequent child.

A Achenbach and L. A. Rescorla (2001) reported for the same model (.06). Support for the 2nd-order factor structure of Internalizing and Externalizing Problems also was provided. Comparisons of the mean scores for the syndromes and Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems revealed mostly small differences between the sample of adopted Chinese girls and T.

AB Background. Depression and anxiety are highly co-morbid disorders. Two latent trait models have been proposed to explain the nature of the relationship between these disorders. The first posits that depressive and anxiety disorders are both manifestations of a single internalizing factor. The second model, based on a tripartite model proposed by Clark & Watson [Journal of Abnormal Psychology (1991) 100, 316-336], proposes that depressive and anxiety disorders reflect a combination of shared and disorder-specific factors.
   Method. We directly compared the two models in a sample of 891 individuals from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project who participated in up to four diagnostic assessments over approximately 15 years. Structural equation models were used to examine the relationship between depressive and anxiety disorders across different developmental periods (< 14, 14-18, 19-23, 24-30 years of age).
   Results. The one- and three-factor models were hierarchically related. Thus, a direct comparison between the one- and three-factor models was possible using a chi(2) difference test. The result found that the three-factor model fit the data better than the one-factor model.
   Conclusions. The three-factor model, positing that depressive and anxiety disorders were caused by a combination of shared and disorder-specific factors, provided a significantly better fit to the data than the one-factor model postulating that a single factor influences the development of both depressive and anxiety disorders.

Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive episode (MDE) are known to be highly co-morbid, little prospective research has examined whether these two disorders predict the subsequent first onset or persistence of the other or the extent to which other predictors explain the time-lagged associations between GAD and MDE.
   Method. Data were analyzed from the nationally representative two-wave panel sample of 5001 respondents who participated in the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and the 2001-2003 NCS follow-up survey. Both surveys assessed GAD and MDE. The baseline NCS also assessed three sets of risk factors that are considered here: childhood adversities, parental history of mental-substance disorders, and respondent personality.
   Results. Baseline MDE significantly predicted subsequent GAD onset but not persistence. Baseline GAD significantly predicted subsequent MDE onset and persistence. The associations of each disorder with the subsequent onset of the other attenuated with time since onset of the temporally primary disorder, but remained significant for over a decade after this onset. The risk factors predicted onset more than persistence. Meaningful variation was found in the strength and consistency of associations between risk factors and the two disorders. Controls for risk factors did not substantially reduce the net cross-lagged associations of the disorders with each other.
   Conclusions. The existence of differences in risk factors for GAD and MDE argues against the view that the two disorders are merely different manifestations of a single underlying internalizing syndrome or that GAD is merely a prodrome, residual, or severity marker of MDE.

AB Objective: A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT). Method: Hierarchical linear modeling software was used to synthesize the primary studies to calculate an overall effect size estimate and test for between-study variability. Results: Solution-focused brief therapy demonstrated small but positive treatment effects favoring SFBT group on the outcome measures (d = 0.13 to 0.26). Only the magnitude of the effect for internalizing behavior problems was statistically significant at the p < .05 level, thereby indicating that the treatment effect for SFBT group is different than the control group. Conclusions: This study allows social workers interested in solution-focused brief therapy to examine the empirical evidence quickly and with more definitive information.

AB Children with significant behavior problems are at risk for poor school adaptation and a host of deleterious school outcomes. Given the time children spend in school, there is a need to better understand the normative contexts and processes within schools that may enhance the positive adaptation of children with significant behavior problems. This study evaluated one such context, the teacher-student relationship, specifically, the degree of closeness and conflict in the relationship, between urban, American elementary schoolchildren with significant extemalizing or internalizing behavior problems and their teachers. The results suggest that the qualities of the teacher-student relationship predict children's successful school adjustment. Having a relationship with a teacher characterized by warmth, trust, and low degrees of conflict was associated with positive school outcomes. Some moderation effects were noted, including differential effects for warmth on the reading achievement of children with externalizing distress, and conflict on the school adaptation of children with internalizing problems. Results are discussed in light of theory and school-based intervention and prevention efforts.

AB Characteristics associated with disadvantaged social position, such as low socioeconomic status (SES) and female gender, may play a significant role in the development of internalizing symptoms among adolescents. Indeed, theories of "double jeopardy" suggest that these disadvantaged status characteristics interact to produce particularly harmful mental health outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that lower SES places adolescent females at greater risk for internalizing symptoms than males. We used data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods collected from a 15-year-old adolescent cohort (n = 640) at baseline and at two-year follow-up. Female gender predicted internalizing symptoms cross-sectionally and prospectively, whereas household income and caretaker education generally were not associated with internalizing symptoms. Findings overall did not indicate interactive effects between gender and SES indicators. However, subgroups of females at the lowest levels of caretaker education and household income displayed increased risk for specific outcomes, including higher internalizing symptom levels at follow-up and maintenance of severe symptom levels from baseline to follow-up.

AB The modifying effects of psychiatric and familial risk factors on age at smoking initiation, rate of progression from first cigarette to regular smoking, and transition time from regular smoking to nicotine dependence (ND) were examined in 1269 offspring of male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Mean age of the sample was 20.1 years. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusting for paternal alcohol dependence and ND status and maternal ND were conducted. Both early age at first cigarette and rapid transition from initiation to regular smoking were associated with externalizing disorders, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use. Rapid escalation from regular smoking to ND was also predicted by externalizing disorders, but in contrast to earlier transitions, revealed a strong association with internalizing disorders and no significant relationship with use of other substances. Findings characterize a rarely examined aspect of the course of ND development and highlight critical distinctions in risk profiles across stages of tobacco involvement. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To test whether the experience of being bullied has an environmentally mediated effect on internalizing symptoms in young children.
   Design: A genetically informative, longitudinal 19941995 birth cohort.
   Setting: A nationally representative sample from the United Kingdom.
   Participants: We examined 1116 twin pairs who are participants in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study.
   Main Exposure: The experience of being bullied between the ages of 7 and 9 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Mothers' and teachers' reports of children's internalizing problems at 7 and 10 years of age.
   Results: Monozygotic twins who had been bullied had more internalizing symptoms ( mean, 0.23; SD, 1.00) compared with their co-twin who had not been bullied ( mean, - 0.13; SD, 0.86), indicating that being bullied has an environmentally mediated effect on children's internalizing problems (beta, 0.36 [ 95% confidence interval ( CI), 0.18-0.54]). This effect remained significant after controlling for preexisting internalizing problems (beta, 0.26 [ 95% CI, 0.09-0.44]).
   Conclusions: Being bullied at a young age is an environmentally mediated contributing factor to children's internalizing problems. Intervention programs aimed at reducing bullying behavior in schools and in the community have the potential to influence children's early symptoms of mental health problems.

AB Although reunification is the most common and preferred exit from the U.S. foster care system, little is known about the well-being of children following foster care. Even less is known about reunification following long-term foster care. Geographically limited studies suggest poor behavioral outcomes following reunification. A secondary data analysis was performed using a subsample of 604 children from the National Study of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) who had experienced at least 8 months of foster care. Multiple imputation (MI) was employed to address missing data. Descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and propensity score matching are used to explore the role of risks and reunification in children's well-being from baseline to 36-month follow-up. Results indicate that reunification has no direct effect on behavioral outcomes, but is associated with increased risks in the family context of children who are reunified. Findings highlight the complex nature of the relationship between reunification and behavioral outcomes, as well as the need for reunification interventions that specifically target parental mental health and children's internalizing behaviors. Reunification research using longitudinal data and qualitative methods is recommended to clarify risks and outcomes across time. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This current article introduces the special issue on child and adolescent psychopathy and the search for protective factors. Although there has been considerable research conducted on psychopathy at the adult level and a surge of research attempting to extend the concept to children and adolescents in the past decade, few studies have attempted to examine factors that might moderate or protect against the development of psychopathy. This special issue focuses on topics relevant to examining potential protective factors within a developmental psychopathology framework. Articles in the special issue are longitudinal and thus allow for the examination of protective factors as they are evidenced in real time. They focus on genetics, peer relations, parental factors, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These studies provide a foundation for examining protective factors and provide the groundwork for future research in this area.

AB The current study examined the relation between interpersonal callousness trajectories during adolescence ( ages 14 to 18) and characteristics of antisocial personality and internalizing problems in young adulthood ( age 26), using a community sample of 506 boys. The influence of several parent and peer factors on callousness trajectories during adolescence was also explored. Although the mean interpersonal callousness trajectory for the entire sample was relatively flat, there was substantial individual variability in both the initial status and rate of change of interpersonal callousness over time. Trajectories of interpersonal callousness were associated with higher levels of antisocial personality features in early adulthood but were unrelated to adult internalizing problems. Conduct problems and parent - child communication difficulties were the best predictors of elevated levels of interpersonal callousness throughout adolescence. However, none of the parenting and peer factors examined predicted substantive changes in interpersonal callousness over time.

AB The aim of the present study was to estimate the genetic, shared and nonshared environmental contributions to self-reported and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing problems in a follow-up study of intercountry adopted young adults. Young Adult Self-Report ratings were obtained from 1475 adoptees aged 22 - 32 years and Young Adult Behavior Checklist ratings from 1115 adoptive parents. For the genetic analyses, a subset of 143 adopted biologically related and 295 unrelated siblings was used. The data were subjected to model fitting decomposing three sources of variance: genetic factors (A) shared environment (C) and nonshared environment (E). Genetic factors were of more importance in both self-reported (A(2) = 54%, C-2 = 0, and E-2 = 46%) and parent-reported (A(2) = 76%, C-2 = 15% and E-2 = 9%) internalizing problems. Environmental factors were of more importance in both self-reported (A(2) = 33%, C-2 = 17% and E-2 = 50%) and parent-reported (A(2) = 28%, C-2 = 27% and E-2 = 45%) externalizing problems. This was in contrast with findings from the first and second assessments in the same sample during adolescence when genetic factors were more important in explaining externalizing problems compared with internalizing problems. Our results suggest a developmental reversal in genetic and environmental influences on behavior problems from early adolescence into adulthood, which could be related to different underlying developmental trajectories.

AB Objective.-To conduct a pilot study to evaluate the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms in children and adolescents with cyclic vomiting syndrome and to assess-family history of psychiatric disorder.
   Background.-Little is known about psychiatric comorbidity in youth with cyclic vomiting syndrome, a periodic syndrome.
   Methods.-Eighty-five parents, of children aged 3-18 years with cyclic vomiting syndrome confirmed in a multidisciplinary clinic, completed the age-appropriate Children's Symptom Inventory, a questionnaire that screens for psychiatric symptoms in pediatric patients. Twenty-one adolescents aged 13-18 years completed the Youth's Report, a self-report form of this questionnaire. Sixty-two parents completed a family psychiatric history checklist.
   Results.-These children and their parents evidenced a high prevalence of anxiety and mood symptoms compared to norms of the Children's Symptom Inventory and population norms for internalizing psychiatric disorders. On the age-appropriate Children's Symptom Inventory, 47% of subjects (40/85) met diagnostic cut-off for an anxiety disorder, and 14% (12/85) for an affective disorder. Discrepancies were found in parent and adolescent reports for symptoms of panic disorder (chi-square = 4.83, df = 1, P = .028), posttramnatic stress disorder (chi-square = 6.87, df = 1, P = .009), and somatization disorder (chi-square = 6.41, df = 1, P = .01), with parents reporting significantly more symptoms than the adolescents. Internalizing disorders were also prevalent in the parents with 59% (36162) endorsing either an anxiety and/or an affective disorder. Mothers reported a significantly higher prevalence of anxiety disorders (35%) than did fathers (13%) (chi-square = 8.43, df = LP < .004).
   Conclusion.-Children and adolescents with cyclic vomiting syndrome appear to be at increased risk for internalizing psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Further research using standardized psychiatric interviews and a control group are indicated to further assess psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with cyclic vomiting syndrome.

AB Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) symptoms of common mental disorders derived from structured interviews of a representative sample of 4,049 twin children and adolescents and their adult caretakers. A dimensional model based on the assignment of symptoms to syndromes in DSM-IV fit better than alternative models, but some dimensions were highly correlated. Modest sex and age differences in factor loadings and correlations were found that suggest that the dimensions of psychopathology are stable across sex and age, but slightly more differentiated at older ages and in males. The dimensions of symptoms were found to be hierarchically organized within higher-order "externalizing" and "internalizing" dimensions, which accounted for much of their variance. Major depression and generalized anxiety disorder were substantially correlated with both the "externalizing" dimension and the "internalizing" dimension, however, suggesting the need to reconceptualize the nature of these higher-order dimensions.

AB This study examined the developmental trajectory of anxiety symptoms among 290 boys and evaluated the association of trajectory groups with child and family risk factors and children's internalizing disorders. Anxiety symptoms were measured using maternal reports from the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach, 1991, 1992) for boys between the ages of 2 and 10. A group-based trajectory analysis revealed 4 distinct trajectories in the development of anxiety symptoms: low, low increasing, high declining, and high-increasing trajectories. Child shy temperament tended to differentiate between initial high and low groups, whereas maternal negative control and maternal depression were associated with increasing trajectories and elevated anxiety symptoms in middle childhood. Follow-up analyses to diagnoses of preadolescent depression and/or anxiety disorders revealed different patterns on the basis of trajectory group membership. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms of risk factors and implications for early identification and prevention.

AB Although genetic and environmental influences on behavior problems in middle childhood and adolescence have been well-studied, little is known about the etiology of behavior problems in very early childhood. The present study explores genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior problems and competences in an infant-toddler sample of twins. There were 1,950 twin pairs (mean age = 23.8 months) who were rated by parents on the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment. All four domains (Externalizing, Internalizing, Dysregulation, Competence) and 20 subscales-indices on the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment displayed significant heritability. There were also substantial shared environmental influences operating on most of the domains and subscales. Compared with behavior problems, behavioral competencies were less heritable and more influenced by shared environments.

AB A model of the relation between self-concept and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviours in adolescence, with the self-concept influencing problem behaviours (S --> IE), was assessed using a sample of 277 Swedish adolescents. The model was tested in a path analysis with data from Youth Self Report (YSR) and Structural Analysis of Social Behaviour (SASB) questionnaires. Consistent with the model, a positive self-concept was found to be the most important factor for adjustment and for protection against common problem behaviour. A negative self-concept combined with female gender were risk factors for internalized problems. Self-control had only a direct effect on externalizing behaviour for boys. Adolescents of 15, 16 years of age had a stronger relationship between a negative self-concept and externalizing problem behaviour than younger and older adolescents. Internalizing problem behaviours such as anxiety and depression predicted aggressive and delinquent behaviour. These findings highlight the importance of promoting of a positive self-concept in every adolescent in various psychosocial contexts.

AB This study analyzed family influences on treatment refusal in schoollinked mental health services (SLMHS). Specifically, it assessed whether levels of family cohesion, conflict, and organization were related to whether a family refused to initiate recommended treatment. Children (N = 133) referred for emotional and behavioral problems and their families participated. Results indicated that (1) family environment factors explained a significant amount of variance in treatment refusal after controlling for demographic factors, (2) families of children with predominantly internalizing symptoms were at greater risk for refusing treatment than families of children with predominantly externalizing symptoms, and (3) lower level of family cohesion was an individual risk factor for refusing treatment. Incorporating an evaluation of family environment within SLMHS assessments may aid in the identification of areas wherein intervention may be beneficial in preventing treatment refusal.

AB We used cluster analysis to identify children's coping profiles and to examine self-and parent-reported correlates of coping in a community sample. Participants included 135 children (M age = 11.27, s.d. = .59) recruited from local public elementary and junior high schools and 116 of their parents. Analyses included hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's method), followed by non-hierarchical (k-means) cluster analysis to confirm the cluster solution. Results yielded four clusters reflecting high, active, low, and indiscriminant patterns of coping strategies. Members of the active coping group self-reported the fewest symptoms of distress and the greatest number of prosocial competencies after controlling for social desirability. No differences emerged for parent-reported psychosocial functioning across coping profiles. Our results suggest that a combination of active coping strategies may be associated with better psychosocial functioning than a combination of active and avoidant coping strategies.

AB Background: Research has identified three personality subtypes in adults with eating disorders (EDs): a high-functioning, an undercontrolled, and an overcontrolled group. The current study investigated whether similar personality prototypes exist in adolescents with EDs, and whether these personality prototypes show relationships to external correlates indicative of diagnostic validity. Methods: Experienced clinicians from an adolescent practice-research network provided data on ED symptoms, DSM-IV comorbidity, personality pathology, and family and developmental history for 120 adolescent patients with EDs. Results: Consistent with the findings from the adult literature, three types of personality pathology emerged in adolescents: High-functioning/Perfectionistic, Emotionally Dysregulated, and Avoidant/Depressed. The High-functioning prototype showed negative associations with comorbidity and positive associations with treatment response. The Emotionally Dysregulated prototype was specifically associated with externalizing Axis I and Cluster B Axis II disorders, poor school functioning, and adverse events in childhood. The Avoidant/Depressed prototype showed specific associations with internalizing Axis I and Clusters A Axis II disorders, poor peer relationships, poor maternal relationships, and internalizing disorders in first-degree relatives. Conclusions: These data support the presence of at least three diagnostically meaningful personality prototypes in adolescents with EDs, similar to those found previously in adults. Diagnosis of adolescents with EDs may be usefully supplemented by the assessment of personality style.

AB Introduction: Studies show that, in childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), boys have the combined type with externalizing behaviors more frequently, and girls have the inattentive type with increased internalizing disorders more frequently.
   Method: This study explored gender differences in adults with ADHD in 2 large, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies conducted from 2000 to 2001. Information collected included 2 measures of ADHD, multiple psychological measures, general physical symptoms, and treatment response.
   Results: Thirty-four percent of the subjects were female. Women were rated as more impaired on every measure of ADHD symptoms including total Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Investigator Format (CAARS-INV), total Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS), and most subscales of both measures. More women (75%) had combined type compared with men (62%). Women showed a more complex presentation, with higher scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 17-item version (HAM-D-17), more sleep problems, and more past DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses. Both sexes displayed substantial impairment on 3 Psychological General Well-Being Schedule factors: tension-anxiety, life satisfaction, and vitality-drive. Women experienced significantly (p = .003) greater rates of emotional dysregulation (37%) versus men (29%) as defined by a cluster of symptoms on the WRAADDS. The emotional dysregulation factor is derived by combining 3 symptoms-temper control, mood lability, and emotional overreactivity-from the Utah Criteria for ADHD in adults. These symptoms are considered associated symptoms in the DSM-IV description of ADHD. Women also experienced greater improvement (p = .011) on this symptom factor.
   Conclusion: In contrast to the results from childhood studies, women were more impaired than men on ADHD scales in our study. The higher level of emotional symptoms and more complicated presentation in women may obscure the diagnosis of ADHD. Thus. the assessments of adults with ADHD should include an exploration of the emotional dimensions of the illness.

AB Relations between marital aggression (psychological and physical) and children's health were examined. Children's emotional insecurity was assessed as a mediator of these relations, with distinctions made between marital aggression against mothers and fathers and ethnicity (African American or European American), socioeconomic status, and child gender examined as moderators of effects. Participants were 251 community-recruited families, with multiple reporters of each construct. Aggression against either parent yielded similar effects for children. Children's emotional insecurity mediated the relation between marital aggression and children's internalizing, externalizing, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. No differences were found in these pathways for African American and European American families or as a function of socioeconomic status or child gender.

AB The present study addressed the following questions: (a) To what extent do different methods of measuring the family environment converge onto a single latent construct? (b) How are the constructs of positive and of negative family environment related? (c) Do the associations among various methods of measuring the family environment differ as a function of children's gender or of risk? and (d) How are the latent constructs of family environment related to depression in mothers and their children? Participants were 240 children (mean age = 11.86 years, SD = 0.57) and their mothers, who varied with regard to their history of depression. Family environment was measured with self-report questionnaires completed separately by mothers and by children, observations of mother-child interactions, and a 5-min speech sample of each mother talking about her child. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that different methods for assessment of the family environment converged and that the constructs of positive and of negative family environments were significantly related to each other and to depression in both mothers and their children. These findings may help inform future intervention efforts by highlighting specific parenting dimensions that are strongly associated with maternal and with child depression.

AB The present study examined whether positive parenting and deviant peer associations mediated the relations between a cumulative risk composite comprising financial strain, neighborhood problems, and maternal psychological distress and subsequent youth adjustment problems. Drawn from the Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three City Study, the sample consisted of 449 economically disadvantaged Latino families. Structural equation modeling showed that after controlling for baseline levels of youth adjustment problems, cumulative risk, assessed when adolescents were 10 to 14 years old, was directly and indirectly predictive of youths' deviant peer associations 16 months later, through mother's positive parenting. Deviant peer associations, in turn, were proximally associated with youth externalizing and internalizing problems. Findings underscore the role of mothers and peers in Latino youth adjustment problems.

AB Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is highly comorbid with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and cannabis dependence. However, the temporal sequencing of these disorders has not been extensively studied to determine whether SAD serves as a specific risk factor for problematic substance use. The present study examined these relationships after controlling for theoretically-relevant variables (e.g., gender, other Axis I pathology) in a longitudinal cohort over approximately 14 years. The sample was drawn from participants in the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project. After excluding those with substance use disorders at baseline, SAD at study entry was associated with 6.5 greater odds of cannabis dependence (but not abuse) and 4.5 greater odds of alcohol dependence (but not, abuse) at follow-up after controlling for relevant variables (e.g., gender, depression, conduct disorder). The relationship between SAD and alcohol and cannabis dependence remained even after controlling for other anxiety disorders. Other anxiety disorders and mood disorders were not associated with subsequent cannabis or alcohol use disorder after controlling for relevant variables. Among the internalizing disorders, SAD appears to serve as a unique risk factor for the subsequent onset of cannabis and alcohol dependence. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One hundred seventy-four college students and a subset of their mothers and fathers provided ratings of college students' emotional and behavioral functioning. College students and their mothers and fathers demonstrated variable levels of correspondence in their ratings of college students' internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Similar findings were noted with t-test comparisons, with college students rating themselves as experiencing significantly higher levels of behavior problems than did their mothers and fathers. Further, college students' ratings of their mothers' and fathers' parenting and their perceptions of their parents predicted significantly their ratings of their own behavior problems. Although mothers' communication reciprocity and perceptions of their college students served as significant predictors of mothers' ratings, a different pattern of results occurred with paternal variables. Overall, these findings further the understanding of correspondence and predictors of cross-informant ratings of college students' emotional and behavioral functioning.

AB This study examines whether health risk behaviour in adolescence can be predicted by self- and by parental reports of psychopathology (externalizing and internalizing symptoms) assessed two and four years earlier. A total sample of 366 fourth graders participated in a longitudinal study with measurements taken in grades 4, 6, and 8. In grades 4 and 6 the children completed the Youth Self Report (YSR) while their parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). In grade 8, the children reported their risk behaviour (smoking, sexual activity, dietary behaviour and suicidal tendencies). Results reveal that cross-informant correlations for both symptom-scales are low to medium and tend to increase slightly from grade 4 through 8. Children reported higher symptom-levels and changes over time than their parents. The predictability of risk behaviour in adolescence by reported psychopathology in grade 6 exceeds the predictability in grade 4. Results indicate that the predictability of risk behaviour by self-reports versus parental reports of psychopathology depends on the specific kind of health risk behaviour and the child's gender.

AB The aim of this prospective study was to examine the relations between organized activity involvement and internalizing and externalizing symptoms across four years of high school. Participants were 240 adolescents who varied in their risk for psychopathology. Information about adolescents' activity involvement and internalizing and externalizing symptoms were provided by both self- and mother-reports. Structural equation modeling revealed that the prospective models fit the data well. In addition to showing that activity involvement and psychopathology were quite stable over the high school years, we found reciprocal effects for activity involvement and internalizing symptoms at some, although not all, time points. Specifically, controlling for prior symptoms and risk (i.e., maternal depression history), more activity involvement in tenth grade predicted fewer internalizing symptoms in eleventh grade, which then predicted more activity involvement in twelfth grade. No reciprocal relations were found for externalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of examining internalizing symptoms as both a predictor and outcome of activity involvement during adolescence.

AB Knowledge of the impact of childhood psychosocial problems on success in military service is scarce. The purpose of the study was to assess whether childhood psychosocial problems are associated with suitability for military service. The subjects were 2,622 Finnish boys born in 1981. They were first assessed with the Rutter parent and teacher questionnaires and self-reports (Children's Depression Inventory) at age 8. Their suitability for military service was assessed at age 18. A wide range of childhood problems, especially internalizing disorders, predicted release from military service. All informants had predictive association with later suitability for military service. The majority of children with psychiatric problems were later estimated to be fit for military service. The results show a predictive association between childhood psychiatric problems and early adult psychosocial impairment, as estimated by the ability to serve in the military forces.

AB The aim of the present article was to investigate the outcomes of the universal social competence promotion program Second Step in a typical 'real world' implementation in Norway. We addressed the effects of the program on social competence and externalizing and internalizing problem behaviour among 1,153 fifth and sixth grade students (11 schools, 55 classrooms) after one year of intervention. Although the program is originally American, Second Step has been translated and adapted for the Norwegian setting and renamed Steg for Steg. Applying Linear Mixed Modelling, the results from the age cohort design with comparison groups show that the program had significant positive effects on social competence for boys and girls in grade 5 and for girls in grade 6. Boys in grade 6 reported lower levels of externalizing problem behaviour compared to control students. There were no effects in regard to internalizing problem behaviour. The analysis also revealed that the results varied between classrooms. These results may be considered to add weight to the evidence in support of a wider implementation of the Second Step program.

AB Path analyses were applied to test a model that includes internalizing and externalizing behavior problems as predictors of suicidal behaviors in children. Parents of an inpatient sample of boys (N = 87; M age = 9.81 years) rated the frequency of suicidal ideation and completed standardized measures of behavior problems. Blind raters rated the severity of the children's suicidal behaviors. Results revealed a significant direct effect for suicidal ideation on suicide attempt and for depressive symptoms on suicidal ideation. There was also a significant indirect path from impulsivity to suicidal ideation through aggressive and depressive symptoms. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB Objective.-The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the parent and youth versions of the 17-item Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) for identifying children with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Methods.-Cross-sectional convenience samples of children aged 8 to 10 years treated at a primary care pediatrics practice in New York City were recruited. The PSC-17 and its 5-item internalizing subscale were used in both parent- and youth-completed formats. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were identified with the University of California, Los Angeles posttraumatic stress reaction index (UCLA RI), used as a structured interview with the child.
   Results.-One hundred fifty-six children enrolled in the study. Twenty-two percent of children met the UCLA RI cutoff for likely PTSD. The youth version of the PSC-17 and its 5-item internalizing subscale identified these children with sensitivities of 78% and 75% and specificities of 77% and 77%, respectively, relative to the UCLA RI. The parent version of the PSC-17 and the internalizing subscale had poorer sensitivities of 44% and 25% and similar specificities of 79% and 92%, respectively.
   Conclusions.-Symptoms of PTSD can be identified using the youth self-report version of the PSC-17. A 5-item subscale of the PSC-17 also performed well and can readily be used in primary care settings.

AB Secondary analyses of a randomized clinical trial controlled for treatment condition effects and examined the impact of comorbid psychopathologies on the mental health, physical health, and criminal behavior of 80 substance abusing delinquents approximately 5 years later in emerging adulthood. Overall, emerging adults with a comorbid disorder during adolescence scored higher on psychopathology, criminal behavior, and health problems. Participants with both internalizing and externalizing disorders exhibited more negative outcomes than those with a comorbid externalizing disorder. For the entire sample, more internalizing diagnoses forecasted higher internalizing and aggression scores, more criminality, and poorer physical health. More externalizing disorders predicted higher internalizing, delinquency, and criminality scores, but was unrelated to physical health. More internalizing diagnoses for females but not males predicted greater criminality, and especially more aggressive crimes in emerging adulthood.

AB Gaining a better understanding of the types of child symptomatology that predict age at first admission and risk for readmission to a child psychiatric inpatient facility could help to inform the focus of intervention. Accordingly, the current study examined whether internalizing and extemalizing behavior problems, alone or in combination, were associated with age at first admission and risk for repeat admission. Analyses were based on a sample of 372 children (M = 9.13 years, SD = 1.91) admitted to an acute psychiatric inpatient facility. Internalizing behavior was associated with a later age at admission, but unrelated to repeat admission. Externalizing behavior was associated with an earlier age at admission and increased risk for repeat admission. Co-occurring internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were associated with increased risk for repeat admission, but were unrelated to age at first admission. Implications for findings are discussed.

AB This study examined the relationship between violence exposure in three different contexts (home, school, and community) and internalizing and externalizing outcomes in early adolescents. We modeled both context-specific and cumulative effects of exposure to violence. After controlling for a number of risk factors associated with violence exposure, violent incidents encountered at school and at home were consistently related to multiple outcomes. Violence exposure in the community was related only to aggressive fantasies but not to other extemalizing or internalizing problems. High levels of violence exposure in the community attenuated the relationship between home violence and internalizing symptoms and school violence and extenializing problems. Cumulative exposure to violence was related to all aspects of adjustment, but the number of contexts in which violence occurred did not predict beyond the effects of cumulative exposure. Finally, high levels of cumulative violence exposure were associated with a plateau or decrease in emotional distress.

AB The pattern of dysfunction (i.e. impairment vs. distress) judged to be associated with disorders empirically identified by Krueger, Caspi, Moffitt and Silva (1998) as internalizing (e.g. major depressive episode; agoraphobia) was compared to the pattern characterizing disorders classified as externalizing (e.g. antisocial personality disorder; alcohol dependence). In Study 1, lay raters (N=270) judged the social impairment, occupational impairment, and personal distress associated with symptoms of seven internalizing and four externalizing disorders. As predicted, symptoms composing internalizing disorders were perceived as involving a greater degree of distress, and a lesser degree of impairment, relative to symptoms composing externalizing disorders. In Study 2, conducted with a small sample of clinician judges (N=21), symptoms composing internalizing disorders were again judged as involving a greater degree of distress (but, in this case, not a lesser degree of impairment) relative to symptoms composing externalizing disorders. This research provides a novel means of validating the distinction between internalizing and externalizing groups of disorders.

AB The aim of the present study was to identify factors that are related to the traumatic symptoms and problem behavior among adolescents who experienced the New Years fire in 2001 in Volendam, The Netherlands. Three groups of factors were considered: pre-trauma (personality and coping), trauma-related (physical and emotional proximity to disaster), and post-trauma factors (received social support). Forty-five adolescents completed the questionnaire. Two years after the disaster, these adolescents experienced significant traumatic stress reaction (70% within the clinical range) and showed clinically significant levels of internalizing problems (37%). Pre-trauma, individual factors were identified as the most important predictors of distress, followed by received social support. The indicators of physical and emotional proximity to disaster explained little variance in distress.

AB Objective: Adolescents accessing inpatient psychiatric services typically have severe and complex disturbance. The aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive description of an adolescent inpatient sample by examining their psychiatric diagnosis, symptomatology and functioning and associated parental mental health, family functioning and cultural and socioeconomic factors. Few studies have described all these factors and existing studies have reported varying results.
   Methods: Participants were 88 adolescents (37 male) aged 12-18 years (mean = 15.4 years) consecutively recruited through a small number of case clinicians from a regional metropolitan public inpatient unit over a 5 year period. Adolescents and parents participated in clinical interviews and completed psychometric measures. Case clinicians provided diagnostic information.
   Results: In contrast to previous studies, adolescents were from a cross-section of socioeconomic backgrounds. Results showed a high rate of comorbid Axis I diagnoses with depressive disorders the most common principal diagnosis. Two-thirds of adolescents experienced clinical levels of internalizing problems. Clinical levels of thought disturbance and externalizing problems were reported for most adolescents, although adolescents self-reported fewer of these symptoms. Educational and social difficulties were common. A salient result was the high level of family dysfunction reported by multiple informants. Most parents reported minimal personality or psychological disturbance but results contradicted other studies and may reflect response bias. In a preliminary finding, non-English-speaking background and low socioeconomic status were associated with a psychosis-related principal diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Findings indicate the multiplicity of issues facing adolescent inpatients including psychiatric symptoms, impaired personal and family functioning and family cultural and background factors. Treatment that focuses on only some of these factors may have limited effectiveness.

AB This study explored associations between maternal discipline, maternal trait anxiety and anxiety in preschool-aged children. The sample comprised 47 mothers and their children, aged 2-3 years. Maternal discipline was assessed by maternal self-report; and child anxiety by maternal and play leader report. Positive associations were found between self-reported, ineffective, maternal discipline and symptoms of anxiety in preschool-aged children. Associations were not found between self-reported "verbose" discipline (long reprimands or reliance on talking) and preschoolers' anxiety. There were also no associations between play leaders' reports of preschoolers' anxiety and any of the mothers' self-reported discipline measures. Positive associations were found between maternal trait anxiety and the use of self-reported ineffective disciplinary behaviours. Over-reactive discipline was shown to be a stronger predictor of preschoolers' anxiety symptoms than maternal anxiety or lax discipline. It was concluded that children's internalizing symptoms (according to mother report) may be associated with use of ineffective disciplinary strategies. Increased use of these strategies was also associated with anxiety in mothers, and it is suggested that use of ineffective discipline strategies might partially account for the association between maternal and child anxiety.

AB Parental supportiveness and protective overcontrol and preschoolers' parasympathetic regulation were examined as predictors of temperamental inhibition, social wariness, and internalizing problems. Lower baseline vagal tone and weaker vagal suppression were expected to mark poorer dispositional self-regulatory capacity, leaving children more susceptible to the influence of parental socialization. Less supportive mothers had preschoolers with more internalizing problems. One interaction between baseline vagal tone and maternal protective overcontrol, predicting social wariness, conformed to the moderation hypothesis. Conversely, vagal suppression moderated several links between paternal socialization and children's anxious difficulties in the expected pattern. There were more links between mothers' self-reported parenting and child outcomes than were noted for direct observations of maternal behavior, whereas the opposite tended to be true for fathers.

AB Youths with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be at increased risk for internalizing symptoms, but factors explaining individual variation in these symptoms are not understood. Monitoring, a cognitive-affective information processing style characterized by the tendency to scan for, attend to, and magnify threatening cues when stressed, was hypothesized to be related to more internalizing symptoms. Optimism, in contrast, was hypothesized to serve as a protective factor and to be related to fewer internalizing symptoms. Eighty-seven youths with CF (ages 7-18 years) attending a clinic visit completed measures of monitoring, optimism, state anxiety, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Parents also completed a measure of their child's internalizing symptoms. As hypothesized, monitoring predicted increased trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas optimism predicted decreased trait anxiety, state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and parent-rated internalizing symptoms. Age, gender, respiratory function, and socioeconomic status generally were unrelated to internalizing symptoms, with the exception that younger children had more trait anxiety but fewer parent-rated internalizing symptoms. Results suggest that monitoring and a lack of optimism may explain individual variation in internalizing symptoms among youths with chronic physical problems. Further research is needed to examine whether these factors precede increases in internalizing symptoms over time.

AB This preliminary study examined the association between sleep habits and problematic behaviors in healthy preschool children using an internationally standardized method. Two groups of 4-6-yr-old healthy Japanese children were recruited. Children in Group A (n=68) met one or more of the following three conditions: they went out from their home with adults after 21:00h two or more times a week, they went to bed after 23:00h four or more times a week, and they returned home after 21:00h three or more times a week, while those in Group B (n=67) met none of these conditions. Sleep-wake logs and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/4-18 were completed daily for two weeks. The CBCL consists of questions with 113 items categorized into eight subscale items: (I) Withdrawn, (II) Somatic complaints, (III) Anxious/depressed, (IV) Social problems, (V) Thought problems, (VI) Attention problems, (VII) Delinquent behavior, and (VIII) Aggressive behavior. Internalizing (I+II+III), externalizing (VII+VIII), and total scale scores were also derived. Generally, the higher the score, the greater the likelihood of problematic behaviors in that scale. We compared both the CBCL scores and distribution of the CBCL score-determined clinical classification of behavior (normal, borderline, and abnormal) between the groups. Correlation coefficients between CBCL scores and each of the seven indices of the studied sleep habits (wake-up times, bedtimes, nocturnal sleep duration, nap duration, total sleep duration, and range of variation in wake-up and bedtime) were also assessed. Group A children showed significantly shorter average nocturnal sleep, nap, and total sleep duration, significantly later average bedtimes and wake-up times, and a significantly greater range of variation in bedtimes and wake-up times than Group B children. The CBCL score of the total scale was significantly higher in Group A than Group B children. The distribution of the clinical classifications of behavior between the two groups showed no significant differences. Although nocturnal sleep, nap, and total sleep duration did not correlate with total CBCL score, it showed a high positive correlation with wake-up times, bedtimes, and ranges of variation in both wake-up and bed times. The distribution of the clinical classification for the total scale showed significant differences between early and late risers, and also between regular and irregular sleepers. The number of children classified as normal for the total scale score was higher in early risers and regular sleepers than in late risers and irregular sleepers. Preschool children of Group A, late risers, late sleepers, irregular risers, and irregular sleepers were likely to show problematic behaviors.

AB Internalizing symptoms and disorders are relatively common during adolescence and impact considerably on social and emotional functioning. Using a family systems framework, this paper reviews the current literature examining the impact of internalizing symptoms and disorders on the functioning of the family system, the spouse subsystem and the parent-child subsystem. Moreover, literature examining the relationship between parents' and adolescents' internalizing symptoms and disorders is reviewed. The reviewed research demonstrates that there exists an association between internalizing symptoms and disorders and poorer functioning at various levels of the family system. Longitudinal studies have generally reported that parent internalizing symptoms and disorders predict poorer functioning in the family system as well as internalizing symptoms and disorders in adolescents. However, few longitudinal studies have examined whether adolescent internalizing symptoms and disorders predict poorer family functioning and internalizing symptoms and disorders in parents. Those that have examined such effects report mixed results. On the basis of our review, we make recommendations about future research directions. In particular, it is argued that more research on the reciprocal effects of internalizing symptoms and disorders within families is needed to better understand the antecedents and consequences of these conditions for families of adolescents.

AB Objective: The objective of the study was to identify clinical and sociodemographic characteristics that may differentiate youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who are resistant to treatment vs those who have a favorable response.
   Method: Participants included 60 outpatients, aged 7-17 years, who were determined to have previously received an adequate trial of a first-line treatment (ie, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cognitive behavioral therapy). Patients who were treatment-resistant were compared with responders on a number of factors, including severity and nature of OCD symptoms, levels of internalizing and extemalizing symptoms, family accommodation of OCD symptoms, and functional impairment.
   Results: The treatment-resistant group endorsed significantly more obsessions and compulsions, greater levels of internalizing symptoms, higher parental stress related to accommodation, and greater functional impairment than treatment responders. However, relative to treatment-resistant patients, treatment responders reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, perhaps indicating that they were more distressed by their OCD symptoms, as well as greater insight into their symptoms.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that youth with more severe symptoms of OCD, higher related parental stress, and greater functional impairment tend to be more resistant to first-line treatments, and that perhaps they may require more intensive or family-based interventions. Treatment responders report more depressive symptoms and insight into their OCD, which may suggest a greater readiness for treatment. Further research likely would help to identify which types of treatment would be most beneficial for individual youth. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This study reports the psychological assessment of 12 children referred to a narcolepsy clinic, using quantitative methods to describe intellectual and psychosocial functioning in childhood narcolepsy.
   Methods: The participants were six males and six females aged between 7-16 years (median age 10 years). The protocol included a clinical interview; the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III-UK; and the Parent version of the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: Eleven children obtained an IQ in the average range (mean and median 100). However, a significant difference was found between verbal and performance scales in 42% of children, compared to WISC-III normative prevalence rates of 24%. CBCL results revealed that 10/12 children scored in the clinically significant range on the Total Score Index, with 9/12 obtaining scores in the significant range on the Internalizing Index. The majority of children presented with difficulties in discussing and describing distressing physical and psychological symptoms with parents and others.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the psychosocial impact of narcolepsy extends beyond the effects of excessive sleepiness and that symptoms such as hallucinations can lead to significant psychological morbidity.

AB Aims To determine the prevalence of psychological distress in young adults with Type 1 diabetes and to explore associated factors.
   Methods Ninety-two participants with Type 1 diabetes (46 male, 46 female) attending a young adult clinic completed two psychological self-report assessments; the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Adult Self-Report Scale (ASR). The mean age was 21.6 +/- 2.8 years (SD) and mean duration of diabetes was 9.3 +/- 5.4 years. A questionnaire identified the method of insulin delivery, the frequency of blood glucose monitoring and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance. HbA(1c) was measured.
   Results Of the participants, 35.2% reported depressive symptoms (CES-D >= 16), 23.1% indicating severe depressive symptoms (CES-D >= 24), and 32.2, 40.4 and 35.5% of participants reported significant distress (ASR >= 60) on the ASR total problem scales, ASR internalizing and ASR externalizing scores, respectively. Mean HbA(1c) levels were higher in participants with depressive symptoms compared with those with normal scores (CES-D >= 16, HbA(1c)= 9.4% vs. CES-D < 16, HbA(1c)= 8.4%, P = 0.01). Factors associated with psychological distress included use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (P = 0.02) and increased frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes (P = 0.03). CSII users had higher CES-D (21.3 vs. 11.9, P = 0.001) and ASR-Total (59.7 vs. 53.0, P = 0.02) scores than non-CSII users.
   Conclusions Approximately one-third of young adults with Type 1 diabetes experience psychological distress, which is associated with poorer glycaemic control. Psychological distress was related to frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes and method of insulin administration, with significantly greater distress being observed in those using CSII. These findings support inclusion of a psychologist in the diabetes team.

AB The focus of this study was whether couples-based treatment for substance abuse had comparable secondary benefits on the internalizing and externalizing behaviors of adolescent versus child siblings living in their homes. Couples took part in a couples-based treatment for substance abuse that combines Behavioral Couples Therapy and individual counseling (i.e., Learning Sobriety Together). During a 17-month assessment period, the relationship between parents' functioning (i.e., fathers' drug use as determined by percent days abstinent and parents' dyadic adjustment) as rated by mothers, fathers, and children's teachers and internalizing behavior (as rated by mothers' only) was stronger for children than their adolescent siblings, particularly in terms of children's externalizing behaviors. Interventions that reduce paternal drug use and improve couple functioning may reduce internalizing and externalizing symptoms for children in their homes; however, adolescents may need more intensive interventions to address internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the role of psychosocial risk and resource factors as mediators of differences in internalizing problems between young immigrants with origins in four different countries. The study population included 341 immigrants from Iran, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. A gap in internalizing problems was confirmed between two apparently healthy national groups (Somalis and Tamils) and two apparently vulnerable groups (Iranians and Vietnamese). Findings showed that psychosocial profiles of risk and resources differed in content between the four groups. The profiles explained significant proportion of variation in internalizing symptoms in all national groups. Multiple mediation analyses verified that differences in school-related problems, self-efficacy and intergenerational conflicts fully or partly accounted for the differences in internalizing symptoms between the healthy and vulnerable national groups. The findings are discussed in light of culture-specific patterns of behaviour and family interaction.

AB This study aimed to determine longitudinal associations of early triadic family processes and 3-year-old children's strengths and difficulties and to control those associations for family risk factors. In 80 families expecting their first child, we assessed parents' anticipations of future family relationships ( Triadic Capacity) and parents' psychological distress, marital quality, and education level. When the children were 4 months of age, we observed triadic family interaction in a standardized laboratory play scenario. The children's strengths and difficulties at age three were assessed using multiple methods. As expected, parents' Triadic Capacity assessed before the child was born predicted triadic family interaction 4 months after birth. Early triadic family processes explained variance in children's emotional functioning at age three over and above the effects of family stress factors assessed before the child was born. However, early triadic family processes did not explain children's co-operative behaviour or children's symptoms at age three. Results also highlighted the roles of fathers' education level in children's externalizing behaviour, mothers' psychological distress at children's low co-operative behaviour, and low marital quality in children's internalizing behaviour.

AB I recently proposed a socio-relational framework that suggests that phenotypic variation in the expression of discrete affect behaviors (e.g., expressed anger vs. sadness) may reflect two basic dimensions of behavioral response. The first dimension is the motivation to selectively attract or avoid interactions with different people. The second dimension is the behavioral display of either personal capacity or trustworthiness cues, often through the expression of dominant and submissive behaviors, respectively (Vigil, in press). Sex differences in affect behaviors (e.g., externalizing vs. internalizing displays) may reflect developmental sensitivities to advertise capacity and trustworthiness cues somewhat differently, due to the unique social dynamics and relational constraints under which males and females evolved. In this study, I use a series of self-report questionnaires to examine two basic assumptions of the framework. The first assumption is that sex differences in nonverbal affect behaviors (aggression vs. crying) reflect the desire for, and are effective for causing other people to either avoid or comfort the individual, respectively. I hypothesized that males would report a greater likelihood of responding to various distress moods with aggressive, rather than crying behaviors, and that males would desire, and believe male peers similarly desire distancing responses from others when feeling these moods. Instead, females were hypothesized to report more crying behaviors, and to desire, and believe female peers desire more comforting responses from others. The second assumption is that people are more accurate at inferring the desired social responses (i.e., to be left alone or comforted when experiencing distress) of same-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers. I hypothesized that people's beliefs of same-sex peers are more similar to the self-reported desires of the male and female participants, themselves, than their beliefs of opposite-sex peers. The results are consistent with the first assumption, but show that only men were more accurate at inferring same-sex, rather than opposite-sex desires. In general, the findings are consistent with the socio-relational framework that suggests that humans may have evolved specialized expressive behaviors and interpersonal styles for communicating and interacting with same-sex affiliates.

AB This study aims to make a comparative analysis of families' and teachers' evaluation of behavior problems among children at the age of six, receiving preschool education. The data of the study were collected from the mothers and teachers of 60 male and 61 female children. Data collection instruments are Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 4-18 (CBCU4-18) and Teacher Report Form (TRF/5-18).The correlations between mothers and teachers in the subtests of Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form show that the relationship is of low and intermediate significance (r=0.183 r= 0.355, p < 0.05). The correlation coefficient is higher for externalizing problems (r=0.361), compared to internalizing problems (r=0.238). The relationship is of intermediate significance for the problems as a whole (r=0.298, p < 0.05). The findings were analyzed by the sex and socioeconomic status of children as well as by the educational level of their parents. In this study it was shown that behaviour problem, in children could not be evaluated with the information caring out from only one source. It was found out that some behaviour, that can be perceived by mothers as a problernaticraight be not regarded as a problem by teachers. Sometimes the opposite situation is also possible. So the view and opinion of teachers having interactions with children should be regarded in studying related child behaviours.

AB The two main goals of this longitudinal study were to find different trajectories of substance use throughout adolescence and to analyse consequences of this consumption during early adolescence for emotional and behavioural adjustment at the end of adolescence. The study used a longitudinal descriptive design and was carried out on a sample of 101 adolescents (63 girls and 38 boys). They completed questionnaires three times: when they were 13, 15 and 18 years old. Results showed three different clusters of adolescents according to their trajectory of substance use: low consumption, increasing consumption and early experimentation. Differences among the clusters indicated a better emotional adjustment in late adolescence for those boys and girls included in the early experimentation group. Externalizing problems were higher for the adolescents composing the increasing consumption cluster. Regression analyses also showed that moderate substance use in early adolescence was related to a higher self-esteem and a lower level of internalizing problems in late adolescence. There was no relationship between early substance use and later behavioural problems.

AB Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is comorbid with a range of other disorders, including anxiety disorders. The aim was to examine different explanations for the covariation of these symptom domains in children according to the framework provided by (Lilienfeld, S. O. Comorbidity between and within childhood externalizing and internalizing disorders: Reflections and directions. Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 2003). The covariation of ADHD symptoms and anxiety symptoms were examined over a 12-month period in a community sample of 499 children aged 8-13; 91% were retained at 12-month follow-up. Dimensional assessments were conducted using questionnaires given to children, parents and teachers, with results analyzed via structural equation modeling. Positive associations between ADHD and anxiety symptoms were linked with inattention symptoms, were particularly pronounced for girls, and were linked via temperament and behavioral problems. No support for the hypothesis that ADHD symptoms predicted the development of anxiety symptoms over time or vice versa. ADHD symptoms (particularly inattention) and anxiety symptoms are covarying phenomena that are linked with an irritable temperament and disruptive behavior.

AB The present study examined associations among dimensions of suicidality and psychopathology in a sample of 428 homeless adolescents (56.3% female). Confirmatory factor analysis results provided support for a three-factor model in which suicidality (measured with lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts), internalizing disorders (assessed with lifetime diagnoses of major depressive episode and post-traumatic stress disorder), and externalizing disorders (indicated by lifetime diagnoses of conduct disorder, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse) were positively intercorrelated. The findings illustrate the utility of a dimensional approach that integrates suicidality and psychopathology into one model.

AB This study examined the effects of comorbid separation anxiety disorder (SAD) on the expression of externalizing symptoms in children presenting with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as well as the treatment effects on anxiety and internalizing symptoms. Participants were 64 children with ODD seen in parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), including 15 children with comorbid SAD. Children with ODD + SAD did not differ from children with ODD only in disruptive behavior severity at pretreatment assessment, and children with ODD + SAD showed significant decreases in SAD symptoms at post-treatment. Additionally, children with clinical levels of internalizing behavior demonstrated significant reductions in these symptoms, along with reduction of externalizing symptoms targeted in treatment. We discuss the possibility that treatments focusing on parent-child interactions and certain parenting skills may generalize across specific child symptom constellations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: This study investigated the quality of sibling relationships among children with ADHD relative to those without ADHD. Additional analyses examined whether externalizing and internalizing problems comorbid with ADHD affected sibling relationships. Method: Participants were 77 children with ADHD and 14 nonproblem control children. Sibling relationships were assessed via three informants: mother report, self-report, and sibling report. Results: In analyses utilizing hierarchical linear modeling to combine data from the three informants, children with ADHD showed increased conflict in sibling relationships, relative to nonproblem children. Comorbid externalizing problems were associated with less warmth/closeness and increased conflict in the sibling relationship and largely accounted for the finding that children with ADHD showed greater sibling relationship problems. Comorbid internalizing problems were associated with less warmth/closeness in the sibling relationship. Conclusion: It is recommended that sibling relationships be incorporated into theories of social impairment in ADHD. (J. of Att. Dis. 2008; 11(4) 482-492)

AB The article reviews psychosocial treatments for phobic and anxiety disorders in youth. Using criteria from Nathan and Gorman (2002), 32 studies are evaluated along a continuum of methodological rigor. In addition, the treatments evaluated in each of the 32 studies are classified according to Chambless et al.'s (1996) and Chambless and Hollon's (1998) criteria. Findings from a series of meta-analyses of the studies that used waitlists also are reported. In accordance with Nathan and Gorman, the majority of the studies were either methodologically robust or fairly rigorous. In accordance with Chambless and colleagues, although no treatment was well-established, Individual Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy (GCBT), GCBT with Parents, GCBT for social phobia (SOP), and Social Effectiveness Training for children with SOP each met criteria for probably efficacious. The other treatments were either possibly efficacious or experimental. Meta-analytic results revealed no significant differences between individual and group treatments on diagnostic recovery rates and anxiety symptom reductions, as well as other youth symptoms (i.e., fear, depression, internalizing and externalizing problems). Parental involvement was similarly efficacious as parental non-involvement in individual and group treatment formats. The article also provides a summary of the studies that have investigated mediators, moderators, and predictors of treatment outcome. The article concludes with a discussion of the clinical representativeness and generalizability of treatments, practice guidelines, and future research directions.

AB A ruminative response style has been shown to predict depressive symptoms among youth and adults, but it is unclear whether rumination is associated specifically with depression compared with co-occurring symptoms of anxiety and externalizing behaviors. This prospective, multiwave study investigated whether baseline rumination predicted prospective elevations in depressive symptoms specifically. Rumination was assessed at baseline in a sample of early and middle adolescents (N=350, 6-10th graders). Symptom measures of depression, anxious arousal, general internalizing, and conduct/externalizing problems with good discriminant validity were assessed at four time points over a 5-month period. Results using hierarchical linear modeling show that rumination predicted prospective fluctuations in symptoms of depression and general internalizing problems specifically but not anxious arousal or externalizing problems. Rumination predicted increasing prospective trajectories of general internalizing symptoms. Baseline rumination interacted with prospective co-occurring fluctuations of anxious arousal and externalizing behaviors over time to predict the highest levels of prospective depressive symptoms. Rumination partly mediated the sex difference (girlsboys) in depressive and internalizing symptoms.

AB Family functioning and parenting were hypothesized to mediate the relation between remission of maternal depression and children's psychosocial adjustment. Participants were 114 mother-child dyads participating in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression Child 3-month follow-up. All mothers had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and were treated initially with citalopram; 33% of mothers experienced remission of depressive symptoms. Youth ranged in age from 7 to 17. Remission of maternal depression was associated with changes in children's reports of their mothers' warmth/acceptance, which in turn partially mediated the relation between maternal depression remission and youth internalizing symptoms, accounting for 22.9% of the variance.

AB This study examined maternal sadness and adolescents' responses to stress in the offspring (n=72) of mothers with and without a history of depression. Mothers with a history of depression reported higher levels of current depressive symptoms and exhibited greater sadness during interactions with their adolescent children (ages 11-14) than mothers without a history of depression. Similarly, adolescent children of mothers with a history of depression experienced higher rates of internalizing and externalizing symptoms than adolescents of mothers without a history of depression. Regression analyses indicated that adolescents' use of secondary control coping mediated the relationship between observed maternal sadness and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, in that higher levels of secondary control coping (e.g., cognitive reframing) were related to fewer symptoms.

AB This study used latent profile modeling (LPA) with a community sample that included an enriched sampling of children (aged 6-11) diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (N=271). Six classes of ADHD emerged from our LPA; only 17% of children fell into a class without significant co-occurring symptoms. In addition, nearly half of children were assigned to classes that could not be reliably distinguished using existing DSM-IV subtypes. For the most part, each of the classes was clearly differentiated from a sample of community controls and had clinical diagnoses and child self-reports that were consistent with expectations given by their latent profile of symptoms. Although each of the respective classes of ADHD had elevated levels of hyperactivity and/or attention problems, the current findings suggest that an exclusive reliance on these dimensions is a largely inadequate method of subtype classification. To the contrary, our findings suggest that ADHD subtypes can be more reliably partitioned based on the degree to which they display disruptive behavior, internalizing symptoms, or both.

AB Validity data are presented for a new measure of threat appraisals in response to community violence. Adolescents (N=358; 45% male; 91% African American, M=12.10 years, SD=1.63) and their maternal caregivers participated in two waves of a longitudinal interview study focused on the consequences of exposure to community violence. Structural equation modeling revealed that a six-factor correlated model best fit the data, indicating that the six subscales of the threat appraisal measure represent distinct but related constructs. The factor structure was invariant across age and gender. Exposure to violence was associated prospectively with caregiver- and adolescent-rated adjustment problems. Each of the six threat appraisals mediated links between exposure to violence at Wave 1 and adolescent-rated internalizing adjustment problems 1 year later.

ID COLLEGE-STUDENTS; CULTURAL ORIENTATION; BICULTURALISM; YOUTH
AB Southeast Asian adolescents in the United States face the daily challenge of adjusting to the American culture and their culture of origin. However, little is known about how the patterns of their bicultural adjustment influence psychological symptoms, especially when faced with other challenges such as community violence and negative life events. Additionally, the overrepresentation of Southeast Asian youth in the mental health and juvenile justice systems also necessitates a deeper understanding of the adjustment of this group of adolescents. Data from a sample of 80 Vietnamese and Cambodian adolescents who were between 13 and 18 years old revealed high rates of community violence witnessing and victimization, and a moderate level of negative life events. All of these stressors were related to higher externalizing and trauma-related symptoms, but only violence victimization and negative life events were related to higher internalizing symptoms. There was an additive effect of higher bicultural orientation related to lower externalizing and traumatic-stress symptoms in the face of stress and violence exposure, but no moderation effects were found.

AB The authors tested a theoretical model positing that poverty has an indirect effect on child and adolescent functioning through children's poverty-related stress. Path analyses with a multiethnic sample of 164 children aged 6 to 18 revealed that the stress associated with poverty, such as economic strain, family conflict, violence/trauma, and discrimination, is an important component of the experience of poverty for children. Poverty-related stress was associated with a wide range of correlates, including internalizing and externalizing syndromes, DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms, physical health, and deviant behavior such as pregnancy, legal problems, substance abuse, and school dropout. Most models fit equally well for adolescents and preadolescents, suggesting that poverty is stressful for children as young as 6. African American children's functioning was less strongly associated with poverty-related stress than was the functioning of Hispanic and Caucasian children. Implications of poverty-related stress as a potential mechanism of poverty's pernicious effect on child functioning are discussed.

AB Background: Knowledge of the relative contributions of risk factors in predicting young children's behavior problems may provide insights for the development of preventive interventions.
   Objective: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to identify maternal predictors of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors in a volunteer sample of 205 low-income, single mothers with children between 2 and 6 years of age.
   Method: Data were collected on chronic stressors, self-esteem, negative thinking, depressive symptoms, and child behavior during in-home interviews with the mothers.
   Results: Mothers' reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors did not differ by sex or race of the child. Chronic stressors and depressive symptoms, in addition to control variables, explained 27% of the variability in internalizing behavior while these two variables accounted for 21% of the variability in externalizing behavior. For both internalizing and externalizing behavior, chronic stressors exerted the largest total effects. The effects of self-esteem and negative thinking were indirect, with the latter playing a stronger role. The indirect effect of negative thinking on child behavior was exerted through depressive symptoms, while self-esteem was linked with child behavior through both negative thinking and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: Decreasing mothers' negative thinking, a variable amenable to intervention, may not only decrease a mother's depressive symptoms but also improve her perception of the child's behavior.
   Clinical Relevance: Decreasing mothers' negative thinking may provide a way to reduce their depressive symptoms and result in fewer behavior problems among their young children. Nurses working in primary care and community-based settings are in key positions to address this problem and improve the mental health of low-income mothers and positively affect the behavior of their children.

AB The present longitudinal study examined resting heart rate and heart rate variability and reactivity to a stressful gambling task in adopted adolescents with aggressive, delinquent, or internalizing behavior problems and adopted adolescents without behavior problems (total N=151). Early-onset delinquent adolescents showed heart rate hyporeactivity to the stress-eliciting gambling task compared to late-onset delinquent adolescents and adolescents without behavior problems. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and reactivity to stress were not related to environmental factors such as early-childhood parental sensitivity, parental socioeconomic status, or adoptee's health status at arrival. We conclude that the distinction between delinquency and aggression and between childhood-onset and adolescence-onset delinquency is important for the study of stress reactivity in adolescents.

AB The majority of studies linking individual differences in the quality of social relationships and activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have focused on the early development of attachment between infants and their caregivers. Later in development, during middle childhood and adolescence, the parallel HPA links to age-appropriate social relationships with peers, parents, and siblings remain largely unspecified. This study addressed this knowledge gap. Early morning saliva samples were obtained from 367 children in middle childhood (ages 6-10) and 357 adolescents (M age=11-16 years) on two successive days 1 year apart and assayed for cortisol. Latent state-trait modeling was employed to separate variance in cortisol levels attributable to "stable trait-like" versus "state or situational specific" sources to minimize the high moment-to-moment variation in basal adrenocortical activity. During adolescence but not middle childhood, and for girls but not boys, lower levels of "trait cortisol" were associated with poor quality social relationships. The pattern was robust, extending to the quality of relationships with parents, siblings, and peers. Importantly, the relationship was independent of the rates of internalizing or externalizing problem behavior. We found that isolating the variance in cortisol levels attributable to stable intrinsic sources revealed an interpretable pattern that linked individual differences in basal HPA activity to social relationships during adolescence. Studies are needed to reveal the biosocial mechanisms involved in the establishment of this gender- and age-specific phenomenon and to decipher whether or not individual differences in this hormone-behavior link are adaptive.

AB Research on adolescent emotion has generally focused on expressions of emotion; however, there are reasons to believe that adolescents' experiences of emotion may be related to adolescent development in unique and important ways. This study examined the relation of adolescents' emotional experiences of conflict with their mothers to their internalizing and externalizing symptoms at three time points, each a year apart. After participating in videotaped conflict negotiation tasks with their mothers, adolescents (N=80) watched the videotape of their interactions and used a joystick to make continuous ratings of how negative, positive, or neutral they felt during the discussions. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used to assess relations among their continuous emotion ratings and their internalizing and externalizing symptoms 1 year before the interaction task, at the time of the interaction task, and 1 year later. Adolescents' externalizing symptoms at the time of the conflict task were associated with negative emotion that decreased across the conflict discussion. Relations between emotional experience and internalizing symptoms a year later were moderated by adolescent gender, revealing that a tolerance for increasing negative emotion predicts fewer future internalizing symptoms for girls. The importance of adolescents' ability to tolerate negative emotion during normal developmental conflicts is discussed.

AB Patterns of academic competence, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems were examined in females from the longitudinal Individual Development and Adaptation (IDA) program in order to understand unexpected patterns of educational attainment and problems in adulthood. Person-oriented methods were used to identify patterns of competence and problems at ages 10, 13, and 43. These patterns were linked across time to reveal expected and unexpected educational pathways from childhood to adulthood. Most later patterns were consistent with earlier patterns of competence and problems. This structural-level stability supported our hypothesis that competence and problems tend to be inversely related and function together over time as integrated systems. We focus on one unexpected educational pathway characterized by individuals whose problems remain low over time despite stable levels of low competence. This unexpected educational pathway was examined further in terms of optimal versus general adjustment consequences in adulthood. Some policy implications of studying individual patterns and pathways are discussed.

AB As the field follows recommendations to introduce standardized assessments on substance, mental, and behavioral problems, a consistent picture has emerged that co-occurring disorders are common, that there is heterogeneity in the type of disorder, and that the pattern varies by age. This study examines the prevalence of self-reported substance use and mental health problems, the pattern of comorbidity, and how both vary by age among people presenting to substance abuse treatment. Data are from 4,930 adolescents and 1,956 adults admitted to substance abuse treatment in multisite studies who were assessed with the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs and categorized into five age groups: < 15, 15-17, 18-25, 26-39, and 40+ years. Two thirds of clients had a co-occurring mental health problem in the year prior to treatment admission. Across all ages, clients self-reporting criteria for past-year substance dependence were more likely than those who did not to have other co-occurring mental health problems (odds ratios of 2.9 to 8.8). The prevalence and patterns of co-occurring mental health problems, however, varied by age. Young adults (ages 18-25) were found to be most vulnerable to co-occurring problems. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: This aim of this study was to examine the influence of grandparental (G1) and parental (G2) major depressive disorder (MDD) and other forms of psychopathology on behavior problems in very young offspring (G3). Method: Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) participants who had children over a 3-year period were invited to participate in a study of infant and child development. We attempted to collect diagnostic history from the original OADP (G2) participants, their coparents, the parents of the original OADP participants (G1), and the parents of the coparents. Child (133) outcomes at 24 months of age were based on parent reports of behavior problems. Results: Univariate correlations indicated that G1 and G2 familial loadings for MDD were associated with higher levels of G3 internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant interaction between G1 and G2 MDD on G3 internalizing (but not externalizing) behavior problems. A higher familial loading for MDD in either the parental or grandparental generation was associated with elevated grandchild internalizing problems, but higher loadings for MDD in both generations did not convey additional risk. Conclusions: Parental MDD and grandparental MDD are both associated with elevated levels of internalizing problems in young grandchildren, but MDD in both the G1 and G2 generations does not confer additional risk. One important implication is that MDD in the grandparental generation is associated with increased risk to grandchildren even in the absence of parental MDD. Future studies should examine the mechanisms through which grandparental psychopathology influences behavior problems in grandchildren.

AB Purpose: The aim of this prospective study is to describe the association of comorbid behavioral and somatic factors in children with different forms of nocturnal enuresis and daytime incontinence referred to a tertiary center.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 166 consecutive children 5.1 to 16.4 years old were referred for detailed assessment between January 2004 and July 2006. Evaluation included a detailed history, pediatric examination, 24 to 48-hour voiding protocols, sonography and uroflow. Parents filled out the Child Behavior Checklist, a standardized parental questionnaire consisting of 113 problem items. ICD-10 diagnoses were given based on standardized mental state examination and mutual consensus conferences.
   Results: In the full sample externalizing disorders were more than twice as common as internalizing disorders. Differences were found between children with nocturnal enuresis and daytime incontinence regarding parent reported externalizing behavior scores as well as rates of ''at least I ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis'' and comorbid encopresis. Children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis showed fewer internalizing disorders and lower rates of ''at least I ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis'' and comorbid encopresis compared to those with nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, urge incontinence and voiding postponement. The results of sonography and uroflow measures also differed between groups.
   Conclusions: Different subtypes of enuresis and urinary incontinence demonstrate differences in behavioral problems and psychiatric comorbidity. The highest rates of psychiatric comorbidity were found in the group of children with voiding postponement and the lowest were in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis. We recommend screening for comorbid psychiatric disorders in children with enuresis and urinary incontinence. Further investigations in a larger group of children are necessary.

AB Self-reports and other-reports of behavioral problems in children and adolescents can be assessed with the Achenbach inventory, which provides triadic information (children, parents, teachers) on the basis of content-parallel items. This inventory was administered to 583 girls and 474 boys aged 10-17 years in Germany. To identify the consensus among the three sources of information, correlations were computed at the level of eight syndrome scales as well as at the level of two second-order factors (internalizing and externalizing problems). In general, the associations turned out to be as low or moderate as expected. However, a substantial prediction of the two second-order factors in children was achieved by combining the same factors for parents and teachers within one structural equation model. Here, a better prediction was possible for girls than for boys. It is recommended to combine parent and teacher judgments and to use gender-specific prediction models at the level of syndromes and dimensions.

AB Theoretical background: Recently, the prevalence and the assumed increase of emotional and behavioral problems in pre-school-aged children and the influence of the social environment have been discussed more widely. In German-speaking countries there is a lack of epidemiological research with children 2.5-5 years of age. The purpose of the present study is to examine the prevalence rates of children using different informants and investigate the influence of demographic characteristics. Method: Families were recruited in preschools in Braunschweig. In total, N = 474 children were rated by their mothers, fathers, and preschool teachers using the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 1 1/2-5. Results: The prevalence rates of the syndrome scales ranged from 0.5% to 9.4%. Internalizing problems were most frequently rated. Parental education, income, and nationality were significantly associated with the prevalence of internalizing and total problems. Conclusions: Implications for epidemiology research and prevention of child behavior problems are discussed.

AB The aim of this study was to study and compare externalizing and internalizing difficulties, clinical problems of adolescent girls who attempted a suicide and delinquent girls. A total of 100 adolescent girls aged 11-18 years have participated in this study: 50 of them were suicide attempters, and the other 50 girls had problems of delinquent behavior. In this study, the questionnaire ASEBA YSR 11-18 was used. To compare averages, Student's t and Mann-Whitney's U tests were applied with a 0.05 level of statistical significance.
   For adolescent girls who attempted a suicide, more prominent internal difficulties were identified. They were more depressive/anxious, presented more somatic complains, and were more closed/anxious. Those girls felt more anxiety and presented more affective problems. The difference in the average scores of scales of the both groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Externalizing problems of adolescent suicide attempters did not significantly differ from ones of the girls with delinquent behavior. The average scores of scales on braking of rules and aggression were not significantly different.
   Girls with delinquent behavior had a higher social competency, and the girls who attempted a suicide more often presented significant social difficulties, though there was no statistically significant difference in the scores on the activity competence scale.
   Conclusions. The adolescent girls who attempted a suicide have more evident internal difficulties than delinquent girls do, though externalizing behavior difficulties of the suicide attempters are similar to those of girls with delinquent behavior. The girls who attempted a suicide experience more social difficulties, and their social competency is lower when comparing to delinquent girls of the same age.

   SAMPLE
AB Information about coexisting problems in dyslexia may be vital for diagnostic and remedial procedures. There are few studies in this area, and to our knowledge none for the students in focus in this study. They all have phonological deficits and severely impaired reading abilities, in spite of prolonged educational remediation. The aim was to assess if these students have more behavioural/emotional problems than normal reading students. A clinical sample of 70 students, 59 males and 11 females, were compared to a normal reading control group. The groups were pair-wise matched on age, gender, cognitive level, and whether they lived in rural or urban areas. Mean age for the two groups was 150 months; and mean IQ scores approximately 100. Information on behaviour/emotions was obtained from parents, teachers and participants by means of the Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher's Report Form and Youth Self Report. The dyslexia group showed significantly more problems in all areas than the controls. This was reported from all three groups of informants. Parents reported most problems, internalizing behaviour for more than 50% of the participants and total problem behaviour for nearly 45%. Significantly more attention problems were also reported for the dyslexia group from all informants. Parents reported that nearly half the group demonstrated attention problems. Both groups of participants had more problems reported for those with IQ scores of 100 or lower. Further research is needed in this area, but the results clearly indicate that identifying additional behavioural/emotional problems may be imperative for students with severe reading problems.

AB Psychosocial development in children with chronic disease is a key issue in paediatrics. This study investigated whether psychosocial adjustment could be reliably assessed with the 42-item Adolescent Adjustment Profile (AAP) instrument. The study mainly focused on adjustment-to-obesity measurement, although it compared three patient groups with chronic conditions. All phenylketonuria (PKU) patients in Sweden between ages 9 and 18 and their parents and teachers were invited to participate. Patients with neurobehavioural syndromes and obesity were age- and gender-matched with PKU patients. Healthy children constituted a reference group. Psychosocial adjustment was measured using the AAP, which is a multi-informant questionnaire that contains four domains. Information concerning parents' socio-economic and civil status was requested separately. Respondents to the three questionnaires judged the PKU patients to be normal in all four domains. Patients with neurobehavioural syndromes demonstrated less competence and the most problems compared with the other three groups. According to the self-rating, the parent rating and the teacher rating questionnaires, obese patients had internalizing problems. The parent rating and the teacher rating questionnaire scored obese patients as having a lower work capacity than the reference group. Compared with the reference group, not only families with obese children but also families with children with neurobehavioural syndromes had significantly higher divorce rates. Obese patients were also investigated with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), another instrument that enables comparison between two measures of adjustment. The AAP had good psychometric properties; it was judged a useful instrument in research on adolescents with chronic diseases.

AB Using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, we examined posttraumatic growth in a sample of 50 adolescents and young adults who had experienced parental death in childhood or adolescence. Longitudinal relations were examined between baseline measures of contextual and intraindividual factors and scores on the posttraumatic growth subscales (i.e., New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strengths, Spiritual Changes, and Appreciation of Life) six years later. Controlling for time since death, threat appraisals, active coping, avoidant coping, seeking support from parents or guardians, seeking support from other adults, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems were significant predictors of posttraumatic growth. The implications of these findings for research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB Background: This study examined parent/youth self-report agreement on emotional and behavioral symptoms among adolescents with eating disorders (ED). Sampling and Methods: Eighty-three parent-adolescent pairs participated. All adolescents (age 11-18 years) were females and met diagnostic criteria according to the DSM-IV for anorexia nervosa restricting type (n = 53) or bulimia nervosa (n = 30). Diagnoses were confirmed using the Structured Inventory for Anorectic and Bulimic Syndromes. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist, and the adolescents completed the corresponding Youth Self-Report. Results: Results of the interclass correlation provide very poor coefficients between parents and adolescents, especially for the internalizing subscale. Analyses of variance of repeated measures revealed significant differences in the total problem score and the internalizing subscore between parents and adolescents. Parents reported significantly more internalizing problems than adolescents. Conclusions: Agreement between parents and adolescents regarding the presence and severity of psychiatric symptoms in adolescents with ED is low. In contrast to previous studies in non-ED samples, adolescents with ED reported lower levels of internalizing problems than their parents. Denial and minimization may be underlying reasons for our findings and represent obstacles in the psychological assessment of adolescents with ED. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

We examined time-linked correspondence of sad facial expressions and autonomic reactivity during an empathy-eliciting task among boys with disruptive behavior disorders (n = 31) and controls (n = 23). For controls, sad facial expressions were associated with reduced sympathetic (lower skin conductance level, lengthened cardiac preejection period [PEP]) and increased parasympathetic (higher respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) activity. In contrast, no correspondence between facial expressions and autonomic reactivity was observed among boys with conduct problems. Furthermore, low correspondence between facial expressions and PEP predicted externalizing symptom severity, whereas low correspondence between facial expressions and RSA predicted internalizing symptom severity.

AB Background: Parent-child treatments have been shown to be superior to child-focused treatments of childhood obesity. Yet until now, the comparative effectiveness of parentonly and parent-child approaches has been little studied.
   Method: Fifty-six obese children and their families were randomly assigned to a 16-session cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the parents only or for a combined treatment of parents and children. Children's percent overweight, the body mass index of their mothers, and behavioral and psychological problems of children and mothers were assessed.
   Results: Both treatments reduced children's percent overweight significantly and equally by 6-month follow-up. Also both treatments provided similar results in reducing general behavior problems (externalizing and internalizing behavior problems), global and social anxiety, and depression.
   Conclusions: Our results point to a comparable efficacy of the two treatments. Further, psychological well-being of both mothers and children can be improved in a CBT for obese children and their parents. Future studies should focus on finding ways to improve the adherence of families to longterm treatment of obesity in childhood. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Pediatric Bipolar Disorder,
   comorbidity or overlap? A review. Part one
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE attention and hyperactivity disorder; pediatric bipolar disorder;
   comorbidity
AB Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can present itself with a wide variety of comorbid psychiatric entities and can easily be misdiagnosed with disorders such as the pediatric bipolar disorder (PedBP), making early detection and treatment difficult.
   The main objective of this review is to evaluate the relationship between PedBP and ADHD. Several studies have addressed this association, establishing a high rate of comorbidity, from 57% to 93%. The risk of developing PedBP in ADHD population has also been studied, documenting a ten-fold increase risk in both genders compared with age-matched healthy controls.
   Pediatric bipolar disorder is still a diagnostic entity which is hard to recognize and differentiate from other disorders, even with the current international diagnostic criteria. Individuals with ADHD with a current depressive episode, suicide attempts and/or substance abuse and that carry a family load (mainly parents) for bipolar disorder are at increased risk of actually having this disorder.
   Several researchers have compared clinical symptoms expressed in children with ADHD and PedBP They have found that children with PebBP exhibit higher frequency of elated mood, increased energy, thought disorder, flight of ideas, increased speed in speech and irritability than those with ADHD. Other authors report higher rates of thought disorders, anxiety, depression, aggression and delinquent behavior amongst children with PedBP than those with ADHD. If has also been reported that children with PedBP compared to those with ADHD present higher rates of euphoria, grandiosity, racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep. Yet another study found that euphoria and increased energy distinguished youths with PedBP from those with other psychiatric disorders, and found that with the group of depressed patients exhibit higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behavior than other diagnostic groups.
   Some cues to diagnose and differentiate PedBP and ADHD have been proposed: ADHD symptoms appearing suddenly or later in life, loss of therapeutic response to stimulants in a previous responder, intermittent symptoms, emergence Of elated mood and decreased need for sleep, severe mood shifting, hallucinations or thought disorders, family history of bipolar disorder and lack of response to adequate treatment.
   Three of the seven criteria for bipolar disorder are shared with ADHD (distractibility increased goal directed activity and talkativeness), making the clinical distinction between ADHD and early onset PedBP a difficult task. In fact, most children diagnosed with PedBP present symptoms and behavior compatible with a simultaneous ADHD.
   The role of ADHD as a prodromic, phenocopy, comorbid condition and/or as a misdiagnosis for PedBP can be further clarified by: 1. case follow-up to determine if comorbid diagnosis can predict the course or determine a prognosis factor; and 2. family genetic studies which are convenient for the evaluation of complex comorbid conditions. Some studies have suggested that this comorbid syndrome may possess a specific genotype, as well a particular course, a pattern of treatment response and may represent a distinctive clinical condition.
   High comorbidity BPD, both in adult and child and adolescent populations, runs a similar pattern to that of other important diagnostic categories in child and adolescent psychiatry. From a clinical perspective, these findings support the notion of avoiding hierarchical diagnoses. Furthermore, it questions the vision of categorical entities as it is proposed in the current diagnostic classification (ICD and DSM).
   Currently, when we talk about ADHD, we cannot separate it from other disruptive behavior disorders, such as conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD). Epidemiological studies show that 40% to 70% of children with ADHD have CD or ODD, and some of them also present comorbid internalizing disorders.
   There is a clear possibility of a diagnostic confussion between PedBP and disruptive behavior disorders. Certain behavioral signals can indicate whether a child has a PedBP and/or a ODD or CD.
   The role sequential or concurrent comorbidity plays on neuropsychological profiles or neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder and ADHD remains unclear. Independent reports indicate an overlap of the neural circuits implicated on both disorders. Apparently, there is an overlap of impairments in ADHD children with and without PedBP involving motor inhibitory control, sustained attention, verbal learning, working memory, planning, and visual and motor skills.
   In addittion, to making both the early detection and diagnosis more difficult, comorbidity between ADHD and PedBP in the clinical setting complicates pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment.
   Pharmacologically, some studies have suggested that stimulant use may be safe and effective in children with manic symptoms and ADHD. Other reports argue against their use, hence these findings are not conclusive. An alternative for the pharmacological management of the ADHD/PedBP comorbidity is the use of atomoxetine, although there are no randomized, double blind or clinical controlled trials to support its use.
   It has been reported that BP and ADHD comorbidity may predict a lack of response to lithium pharmocotherapy in adolescents. Few studies have the addressed response to divalproex with this comorbidity. Data also suggest a lack of response in manic phases to usual pharmacotherapy in bipolar patients with a history of ADHD. These data stress the importance of the detection of comorbid ADHD (active or in remission) for prognostic and therapeutic planning. Furthermore, it is necessary to research on novel treatment modalities to specifically address the comorbid condition.
   In our country, efforts have been made to address the ADHD-PedBP comorbidity. One example is the treatment algorithm for ADHD and PedBP proposed by the Second Expert Consensus on the management of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder, an effort made towards adapting the available evidence and treatment options for our population. The algorithm establishes that at STAGE 0 the crucial aspect is early detection. Bipolar disorder should be addressed first and it ought to be done by a specialist.
   Some important points in STAGE 1 are: 1. first treatment option should be a stimulant (in Mexico, immediate and controlled release methylphenidate) plus a mood stabilizer; 2. in the case of a lack of response to two different stimulants, atomoxetine or bupropion should be considered; 3. as a last option, atypical antipsychotics like risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole are proposed. it also mentions the ever frequent need for combined therapy and dynamic modifications in treatment sequences.
   Conclusions
   ADHD and PedBP disorder are highly comorbid. The similarities between the clinical features of these entities often make diagnosis a challenge for clinicians and carries several treatment considerations.
   In accordance to international research and national efforts to establish treatment options, stimulants may be considered a first line option for ADHD/BP comorbidity with the addition of a mood stabilizer. Although in general stimulants may be benefitial to many patients with both ADHD and BP, a group of patients may not tolerate their use, mainly due to side effects or mood destabilization. To offer a better treatment option for these patients it is crucial to continue in the search for other therapeutic modalities in order to improve residual symptoms in attention and cognition, even when the affective symptoms have resided.

AB Variations in parents' emotion socialization have been linked to children's social competence (SC) and behavior problems, but parental influences do not act independently of children's characteristics. A biopsychosocial model was tested, in which children's parasympathetic regulation of cardiac function and paternal and maternal socialization of negative emotions were examined as joint predictors of young children's SC and behavior problems at daycare and preschool. Mothers and fathers responded differently to children's emotions, and cardiac vagal tone moderated the relations between parents' emotion socialization and children's behavior in early childcare settings. Both maternal and paternal emotion socialization strategies were more strongly associated with preschool adjustment for children with relatively less parasympathetic self-regulatory capacities than for more self-regulated children. Paternal reactions to children's anger, and maternal responses to children's sadness and fear, were particularly closely tied to variations in SC and internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Children with behavioral inhibition, a temperamental style characterized by infant distress to novelty and childhood social reticence, exhibit both continuity and discontinuity of this behavioral trait over the course of development. However, few researchers have identified factors that might be responsible for these different patterns. In the current study, childcare history, maternal personality, and maternal behavior were examined as moderators of the relations between infant temperament, preschool social reticence, and childhood social wariness. Seventy-seven children participated in this longitudinal study that began in infancy and continued into middle childhood. Maternal negative personality moderated the relation between infant temperament and childhood social wariness. In addition, maternal behavior moderated the relation between preschool social reticence and childhood social wariness. The findings suggest that a complex interplay of within-child and maternal factors affect the development of internalizing behavior in the early school years.

AB Interactions among multiple dimensions of child temperament and parenting were tested as predictors of change in child adjustment problems using a community sample (N=188) of children (8-12 years). Significant interactions suggested that the effect of parenting on changes in problems were dependent upon temperament and, in some cases, child sex. Effortful control mitigated the potential negative impact of inconsistent discipline and physical punishment on externalizing problems, whereas frustration exacerbated the effects of inconsistent discipline and rejection. Anxiousness moderated parenting only for boys, mitigating the impact of inconsistent discipline on internalizing and externalizing problems but exacerbating the effects of physical punishment on externalizing problems. Implications for identifying children at risk for developing adjustment problems and for parenting interventions are discussed.

AB This study examined the opposing hypotheses that either low or exaggerated but disputed self-esteem is related to aggression in 652 12-year-old schoolchildren. Children provided peer nominations of social acceptance and of physical aggression, self-ratings of global self-worth and of social satisfaction. Teachers rated aggressive behavior and internalizing problems. Exaggerated but disputed self-esteem was conceptualized as discrepancies between self and peer evaluations of social satisfaction and of social acceptance, respectively, in combination with peer rejection. The main results showed that both low levels of global self-worth and exaggerated but disputed self-esteem were related to aggression. The findings indicated that, depending on how self-esteem is conceptualized, aggressive children may appear to have both a low and a high self-esteem. Regarding gender differences, exaggerated self-esteem was more strongly related to aggression in boys than in girls.

AB Shortly after the birth of their infants, teenage working-class mothers were assessed on attitudes toward the need for deference to family authority (respect-based control) and anger. Their children's internalizing and externalizing problems and self-esteem were assessed approximately 12 years later. High respect-based control was linked to higher levels of externalizing problems in boys, regardless of level of maternal anger. Mothers who were low in anger and high in respect-based control had children who exhibited higher levels of self-esteem. Respect-based control predicted inconsistent rule enforcement, but not lack of warmth or harsh parenting. Arguments are made for distinguishing among various forms of control (e.g., authoritarian, psychological, behavioral, and respect-based) as well as the affective context in which they are administered in order to achieve an adequate understanding of the socialization process.

AB The main goal of this study was to investigate the mediational and moderational role of early adolescents' appraisals of interparental conflict on the association between interparental conflict and adolescent adjustment for girls and boys. In the present study total of 285 adolescents (154 girls and 131 boys) and their parents were recruited from Ankara. The mean ages were 12.45 (SD = .11) and 12.52 (SD = .11) with the range of 10 to 14 for girls and boys, respectively. To collect data we used the O'Leary-Porter Scale (OPS; Porter and O'Leary, 1980), Children's Perceptions of the Interparental Conflict questionnaire (CPIC; Grych, Seid & Fincham, 1992), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBLC; Achenbach, 1991). In general, hierarchical regression analyses showed that parents' ratings on the OPS predicted both boys' and girls' internalizing, externalizing and total behavior problems. In addition, the findings revealed that there is a different pattern of mediational and moderational effects of adolescents' appraisals on the relationship between interparental conflict and adjustment for both genders. For girls, there was a mediational effects of conflict properties and threat in internalizing; conflict properties and self-blame in externalizing and conflict properties, threat and self-blame in total behavior problems. For boys, there was a mediational effects of threat and self-blame in internalizing; only self-blame in externalizing and threat and self-blame in total behavior problems. Furthermore, for girls conflict properties and self blame on the internalizing problems; self blame on externalizing and total problems; for boys self blame only on internalizing problems act as moderator variables. The mediational and moderational role of early adolescents' appraisals of interparental conflict on the association between interparental conflict and adolescent adjustment were discussed in the framework of the cognitive-contextual model.

AB Unlike previous investigations of shelter-based samples, our study examined whether profiles of adjustment problems occurred in a community-program-based sample of 175 school-aged children exposed to domestic violence. Cluster analysis revealed three stable profiles/clusters. The largest cluster (69%) consisted of children below clinical thresholds for any internalizing or externalizing problem. Children in the next largest cluster (18%) were characterized as having externalizing problems with or without internalizing problems. The smallest cluster (13%) consisted of children with internalizing problems only. Comparison across demographic and violence characteristics revealed that the profiles differed by child gender, mother's education, child's lifetime exposure to violence, and aspects of the event precipitating contact with the community program. Clinical and future research implications of study findings are discussed.

AB Objective: In recent years, a large and growing body of research on the effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence has been published; however, the large number makes it difficult to get an overview on the current status of research. The aim of this article is to systematically review the existing meta-analyses and reviews on the four most frequent childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders (anxiety disorder, depression, ADHD, conduct disorder) and to present an up-to-date summary on the effects of treatment for those disorders.
   Methods: This article is based on a systematic literature search, which produced 112 meta-analyses and reviews on efficacy of psychological and psychiatric interventions in childhood and adolescence published between 2000 and 2007. The articles resulting from the literature search were evaluated according to clearly defined criteria. Presentation of the results follows a dichotomous classification (internalizing vs. externalizing disorders), with Part I of this article reporting the results on anxiety disorders and depressive disorders.
   Results: The majority of reviews published between 2000 and 2007 focuses on the treatment of depressive disorders and ADHD. Only for ADHD is the use of medication (stimulants) considered to be the most efficacious treatment option available. For the remaining three disorders, psychotherapy is recommended as the most effective treatment of choice. A combination of psychological and pharmacological treatments is an important option in ADHD and depressive disorders. Considering the efficacy, treatments for ADHD and anxiety disorders produce higher effect-sizes than do interventions for depressive and conduct disorders. For all disorders, there are several desiderata (content and methodological aspects) to be incorporated into future research.
   Discussion: Empirically supported treatment recommendations can be derived for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, ADHD and conduct disorders. Finally, important implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB Objective: Research into changes in the prevalence of children's psychiatric diagnoses has indicated an increase in recent decades. However, methodological problems may have influenced results. This study compared children's emotional and behavioral problem levels across three population samples from different time points across 20 years, assessed with identical methodologies.
   Method: We compared Child Behavior Checklists and Teacher's Report Forms across three population samples of 6- to 16-year olds, assessed in 1983, 1993, and 2003.
   Results: We found evidence for small increases in the mean population levels of parent-reported problems, and in the percentages of children with serious problems. These changes concerned mostly internalizing problems. Teacher reports showed less changes. Decreases in scores were found on several areas of competence. Changes were the strongest between 1993 and 2003.
   Conclusion: We found evidence for small increases in Dutch children's problems. Further developments must be monitored, as this trend may continue and have serious societal consequences.

A child effects model, in which fathers respond to levels of well-being among their adolescent offspring by becoming more or less involved parents, could also account for the positive association between active fathering and adolescent adjustment. We use nationally representative data from the 1995 and 1996 waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to estimate the cross-lagged associations between nonresident father involvement and the externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and academic achievement of 3,394 adolescents. Contrary to assumptions from a socialization perspective and findings from past research on nonresident fathers, our results do not support a father effects model. Our data are more consistent with a child effects model in which levels of adolescent well-being cause, rather than result from, levels of nonresident father involvement.

AB Adolescent suicide is considered a worldwide problem and an increasing source of concern in Singapore. This study explores the relationships among four factors of maladjustment (that is, emotional distress, negative self, antisocial behavior, and anger control problems) and suicidal ideation in two hundred and seventy-one adolescents from Singapore. Findings from the study indicated that emotional distress, negative self-concept, and antisocial behavior significantly predicted suicidal ideation for the whole sample. Beta weight is largest for emotional distress, followed by negative self, and then antisocial behavior. For females, only emotional distress significantly predicted suicidal ideation. For males, only negative self-concept significantly predicted suicidal ideation. Implications of these findings with regard to working with adolescents with suicidal ideations are discussed.

AB Ninety-four low- and middle-income preschoolers (48 boys, 46 girls) were recruited from two sites in a large southwestern city. Children's positive attributions of peer intent, social problem-solving decisions, and attributions of peers' feelings about the provocation were evaluated from individual interviews. In addition, children's anger perception accuracy and their global emotion situation knowledge were assessed. Teachers and their assistants reported on the children's social competence, internalizing and externalizing behavior, and the degree to which children were physically and relationally victimized. Social competence was a negative predictor of relational and physical victimization, and externalizing behavior was a positive predictor of both types of victimization. Anger perception accuracy was negatively related to physical victimization, and global emotion situation knowledge and attributions of sorrow to provoking peers were positive predictors. Results support a conceptual framework that emphasizes the importance of social and emotion-related social cognitive variables for understanding young children's peer-related victimization.

AB Using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the rate and type of behavior problems associated with being reared in an institution prior to adoption were examined in 1,948, 4-through 18-year-old internationally adopted children, 899 of whom had experienced prolonged institutional care prior to adoption. The children's adoptions were decreed between 1990 and 1998 in Minnesota. Binomial logistic regression analyses revealed that early institutional rearing was associated with increased rates of attention and social problems, but not problems in either the internalizing or externalizing domains. Independent of institutional history, children who were adopted >= 24 months had higher rates of behavior problems across many CBCL scales, including internalizing and externalizing problems. In general, time in the adoptive home, which also reflected age at testing, was positively associated with rates of problem behavior. Thus, there was little evidence that the likelihood of behavior problems wane with time postadoption. Finally, children adopted from Russia/Eastern Europe appeared at greater risk of developing behavior problems in several domains compared to children adopted from other areas of the world.

AB Trajectories of relational aggression were examined in a large, diverse sample of fourth-grade students. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine relational aggression over I calendar year. The results indicated that relational aggression increased in a linear fashion for girls over the course of the study. In addition, increases in friend intimate exchange were associated with time-dependent increases in relational aggression among girls only. Relational aggression and internalizing "tracked" together across the course of the study. Overall, the findings suggest relational aggression becomes increasingly common among elementary school girls, and girls' close, dyadic relationships may fuel relationally aggressive behavior in some contexts. Finally, the results indicate that relational aggression trajectories are dynamically associated with maladjustment.

AB A history of exposure to harsh physical discipline has been linked to negative outcomes for children, ranging from conduct disorder to depression and low self-esteem. The present study extends this work into adolescence, and examines the relationship of lifetime histories of harsh discipline to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms and to their developing capacities for establishing autonomy and relatedness in family interactions. Adolescent and parent reports of harsh discipline, independently coded observations of conflictual interactions, and adolescent reports of symptoms were obtained for 141 adolescents at age 16. Both parents' use of harsh discipline was related to greater adolescent depression and externalizing behavior, even when these effects were examined over and above the effects of other parenting measures known to account for these symptoms. Adolescents exposed to harsh discipline from mothers were also less likely to appear warm and engaged during an interaction task with their mothers. It is suggested that a history of harsh discipline is associated not only with social and emotional functioning, but also with the developmental task of autonomy and relatedness.

AB Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders in childhood. Its association with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder has been well studied. Recent studies suggest that children with ODD have substantial comorbidity with anxiety and depressive (internalizing) disorders, as well. Identifying the pattern of internalizing comorbidity with ODD in childhood and adolescence and how this varies across age and gender may help to identify mechanisms of such comorbidity. This systematic review presents evidence on the association of internalizing disorders with ODD across childhood and adolescence. Data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in clinic, community and epidemiologic samples are considered separately. Findings suggest that while internalizing comorbidity with ODD is present at all ages, the degree of comorbidity may vary over time in particular groups of children. Girls and boys appear to have different patterns of ODD comorbidity with either anxiety or depression, as well as ages of onset of ODD, however more large studies are required. Children with ODD in early life require further study as they may be a subgroup at increased risk for anxiety and affective disorders. This could have important implications for the treatment of these ODD children and the prevention of sequential comorbidity.

AB The purpose of this paper was to investigate the cooccurrence of problems in activity level, attention, reading, writing and psychosocial adjustment of children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). A parent-report questionnaire, the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire - Chinese version (DCDQ-C), was used to screen first to third graders from 13 mainstream schools in Taipei. Two standardized motor tests were then administered to those who scored below 10% on the DCDQ-C. Tests of activity level, attention, reading, writing and psychosocial adjustment were then administered to this sample. Thirty-eight children identified as DCD, 32 as suspect for DCD and 82 as normal comparison were included in the final sample. Multivariate analysis of variance comparing the three groups (DCD, suspect DCD, and comparison) revealed that both children with DCD and suspect for DCD obtained significantly poorer scores on measures of attention and reading, and were more hyperactive than comparison children. Children with DCD and suspect for DCD were also reported to have more internalizing and social problems than children without motor problems. No significant differences, however, were noted between children with different degree of motor coordination problems (categorized as DCD and suspect for DCD) on any measure. Furthermore, a high percentage of children in both the DCD and suspect groups fell in the clinical range of attention, activity level and psychosocial adjustment problems. The results revealed a high risk for these problems in nonreferred children with motor coordination problems. The high percentage of clinical range behavioral problems warrants attention of clinicians who work with children with motor coordination difficulties to the need to promote early identification and referral.

AB This study examined parental behaviors as mediators in links between depressive symptoms in mothers and fathers and child adjustment problems. Participants were 4,184 parents and 6,048 10- to 15-year-olds enrolled in the 1998 and 2000 cycles of the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Mothers and fathers self-reported symptoms of depression at Times 1 and 2 and their children assessed parental nurturance, rejection, and monitoring and self-reported internalizing and externalizing problems and prosocial behavior at Time 2. Hierarchical linear modeling showed evidence of mediation involving all three domains of parental behavior. Findings supported the hypothesis that the quality of the child's rearing environment is one mechanism that carries risk to children of depressed parents. Interventions for parents whose symptoms of depression interfere with parenting responsibilities could help reduce the risk of some childhood disorders.

AB This longitudinal study examined psychopathology as a predictor and outcome of organized activity involvement during high school among 198 adolescents who varied in risk for psychopathology as a function of their mother's depression history. Higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in eighth grade significantly predicted lower levels of involvement in academic clubs during high school, over and above risk and SES. Tobacco use prior to high school predicted lower levels of involvement overall and in academic clubs and performance arts. Controlling for psychopathology prior to high school, higher levels of activity involvement were associated with lower levels of externalizing symptoms, less tobacco use, and fewer diagnoses of behavior disorders and substance abuse in 12th grade. The positive association between risk and adolescent psychopathology was not buffered by adolescent activity involvement. Overall, these findings suggest that involvement in organized activities may contribute to lower levels of externalizing psychopathology during high school even when controlling for prior psychopathology.

AB The present study examined the relations between self-reported reactive and regulative temperament factors and psychopathological symptoms and personality traits in a group of non-clinical youths aged 9-13 years (N = 208). Results showed that the reactive temperament factor of negative affectivity was positively associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms, whereas the regulative temperament factor of effortful control was negatively related to such symptoms. Further analyses provided some support for the notion that in particular the combination of high negative affectivity and low effortful control was associated with high symptom levels. Results also revealed specific relations between lower-order temperament traits and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. That is, fear and (low) attention control appeared to be more clearly associated with internalizing symptoms, whereas anger/frustration and (low) activation and inhibitory control were more convincingly linked to externalizing symptoms. Finally, relations with the "Big Three" personality traits were as anticipated, with high positive correlations between negative affectivity and extraversion/surgency and their Eysenckian counterparts of neuroticism and extraversion, respectively.

AB Background: Previous research suggests a link between inter-parental conflict and children's psychological development. Most studies, however, have tended to focus on two broad indices of children's psychological adaptation (internalizing symptoms and externalizing problems) in considering the effects of inter-parental conflict on children's development. The present longitudinal study extends this body of research by considering. the impact of inter-parental conflict on children's low academic attainment among a sample of 230 schoolchildren (age 11-13 years) living in the United Kingdom. Method: Controlling for teacher reports of children's initial levels of aggression (Time 1), the proposed theoretical model linked parent and child reports of inter-parental conflict at Time 1 (1999) to children's perceptions of negative parent-child relations, appraisals of self-blame for marital conflict and teacher reports of children's aggressive behavior at Time 2 (2000), which in turn were linked to children's performance on standardized academic tests (English, Math, Science) at Time 3 (2001). Structural equation modeling was used to test all hypothesized relations in the proposed theoretical model. Results: Support was found for the role of children's self-blaming attributions for parents' marital arguments, not negative parenting behavior, as a mechanism through which variation in their academic attainment is explained. Conclusions: Contrary to the focus emphasized in most current family and school-based intervention programs, findings suggest that the attributional processes engendered in children who live in households marked by high levels of inter-parental conflict and hostility have important implications for their long-term academic success.

AB Depressive disorders in children with chronic illnesses have received little attention despite some evidence suggesting that these children experience increased psychological difficulties as a result of their medical condition. Most of the research on depressive disorders among children has been conducted primarily with Caucasian youth, limiting generalizability to ethnically diverse populations. Further, even less research exists on depressive disorders among African American children with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and for African American youth from lower socioeconomic status who are at greater risk for depressive disorders. This paper is an extensive review of the major studies conducted on depression and psychosocial aspects of SCD in African American children. The Transactional Stress and Coping model is provided as a conceptual framework. Following the review, clinical and research implications are provided, as well as an illustration of a psychoeducational family intervention with an African American child who has SCD and internalizing behaviors.

AB This study examined a family process model of early adolescent problem behavior in a community sample of 416 two-parent families. With family systems theory, a model was developed that suggests (a) marital hostility and parental depressive affect are conjoint familial stressors for youths, (b) youth triangulation mediates the association between marital hostility and adolescent problems, and (c) parental warmth buffers the negative effects of parental depressive affect and youth triangulation. With structural equation modeling, youth-perceived triangulation mediated the association between marital hostility and adolescent internalizing problems. Marital hostility was associated with externalizing problems. Mothers' depressive affect was associated with internalizing problems, and fathers' depressive affect was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems. Parental warmth was not a significant moderator.

AB This article presents long-term effects of a randomized trial evaluating 2 standardized, manual-based prevention strategies for families with parental mood disorder: informational lectures and a brief, clinician-based approach including child assessment and a family meeting. A sample of 105 families, in which at least 1 parent suffered from a mood disorder and at least 1 nondepressed child was within the 8- to 15-year age range, was recruited. Parents and children were assessed separately at baseline and every 9 to 12 months thereafter on behavioral functioning, psychopathology, and response to intervention. Both interventions produced sustained effects through the 6th assessment point, approximately 4.5 years after enrollment, with relatively small sample loss of families (<14%). Clinician-based families had significantly more gains in parental child-related behaviors and attitudes and in child-reported understanding of parental disorder. Child and parent family functioning increased for both groups and internalizing symptoms decreased for both groups, with no significant group differences. These findings demonstrate that brief, family-centered preventive interventions for parental depression may contribute to long-term, sustained improvements in family functioning.

AB This study examined the stability of the child and maternal affective expression and maternal responsiveness and the mutual influence of child and maternal expression of emotion. The authors tested whether maternal depression and child problem behavior were associated with the pattern of emotional exchange within the mother-child dyads. The sample consisted of 69 mother-child dyads (children aged 2-5 years), with 32 of the mothers having childhood-onset depression. Mothers were mostly stable in their affective expression (positive and negative) and responsiveness, whereas children were only stable in positive expression. Within the dyads, mothers seemed to play a more important role in regulating children's later emotional expression. Maternal depression was associated with concurrent maternal responsiveness and their reduced positive expression over time. Results are discussed in relation to the differential function of parental general positivity and responsiveness and the interpersonal transmission of emotional problems.

AB This investigation tested whether parenting mediates longitudinal associations between marital conflict and children's adjustment. Data were drawn from a three-wave study of 283 families with children aged 8 - 16 years at Wave 1. Relations among marital conflict, parenting (behavioral control, psychological autonomy, and warmth), and children's adjustment (externalizing and internalizing) were examined. Structural equation models indicated multiple dimensions of parenting mediated relations between marital conflict and children's adjustment. When including controls for earlier adjustment, behavioral control continued to mediate relations between marital conflict and change in children's internalizing symptoms over time. These results advance parenting process models for relations between marital conflict and child adjustment and provide impetus for study of other pathways, including direct and child effects.

AB Using data on 294 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health who live with a biological father and have both a resident stepmother and a nonresident biological mother, this study examines the prevalence, antecedents, and consequences of adolescents' closeness to each of their parents. Findings demonstrate that adolescents vary in their likelihood of having close relationships to resident fathers, resident stepmothers, and nonresident biological mothers, but when they can do so, they appear to benefit. Close relationships with both resident fathers and nonresident mothers are associated with fewer adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Closeness to resident stepmothers, however, is unrelated to these two outcomes. Results suggest that fathers play a particularly important role in these families.

AB Borderline pathology of childhood (BPC) may be a precursor of personality disorders. There is a lack of data concerning outcome in adolescence. A group of 59 adolescents, who had been treated as children in a Child Psychiatry Day Hospital five to seven years earlier, was evaluated. Using the child version of the Retrospective Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, 28 participants had been diagnosed with BPC while the remaining 31 participants who did not have a history of BPC served as the comparison group. The youth and their parents were given a battery of measures assessing current psychopathology and. functional status. The group with a history of BPC was more likely than the comparison group to exhibit a combination of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Adolescents with a history of BPC were more impaired than the comparison group on a global measure of functional status. Compared to children with no history of BPC, children diagnosed with BPC are more likely to display poorer functioning as adolescents and continue to be at risk for psychopathology during adolescence. Future directions for research are discussed.

The associations among peer victimization, tic symptom severity, and psychological symptoms, as well as the potential mediating relationship between peer victimization, tic severity, and child internalizing symptoms, were also explored. Children with tics displayed higher rates of peer victimization than control groups, and peer victimization in children with tics was positively correlated with tic symptom severity, loneliness, anxiety symptoms, and parent report of child internalizing symptoms. Results also supported the hypothesis that peer victimization mediates the relationship between tic symptom severity and loneliness. Findings highlight the importance of the assessment and treatment of psychosocial variables in children with chronic tic disorders, including social functioning and peer relationships.

AB BACKGROUND: Childhood overweight is a condition that is prevalent within our society, affecting more and more children each year. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between child overweight and educational outcomes.
   METHODS: Data are reported for 13,680 children in third grade from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, a set of data designed and carried out by the US Department of Education. Students were individually administered reading and math assessments. Teachers reported how often students exhibited certain social skills and behaviors. A series of 1-way analyses of covariance and multivariate analysis of covariance was used.
   RESULTS: Overweight children had significantly lower math and reading test scores compared with nonoverweight children in third grade. However, these differences became insignificant after including socioeconomic and maternal education variables. Third grade overweight girls had significantly more externalizing and internalizing problems as well as lower self-control scores than nonoverweight girls even after including socioeconomic and maternal education variables.
   CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that how we deal with children's overweight may have implications for the future psychological health of a considerable proportion of US children.

AB Purpose: The current study focuses on the construction and validation of the Short Screening Instrument for Psychological Problems in Enuresis, for emotional problems and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, in a population of children with enuresis.
   Materials and Methods: In phase I factor analyses were performed on 31 items of the Internalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist and on 18 items of the Attention Deficit Disorder scale of the Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale to select the most discriminating items. The question format and cutoff score for referral were determined by maximization of correctly classified patients, with the full Child Behavior Checklist and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale as standards. In phase II 109 children with enuresis (76 males and 33 females, mean age 8.5 years, SD 2.4) admitted to a tertiary care university hospital entered the validation study. The parents completed the Short Screening Instrument for Psychological Problems in Enuresis and the original questionnaires, ie Child Behavior Checklist and Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale.
   Results: Seven items (factor loading greater than 0.65) were selected for "emotional problems," 3 (greater than 0.80) for "attention problems" and 3 (greater than 0.75) for "hyperactivity/impulsivity problems." Full screening was indicated when at least 2 problem behaviors occurred at least "sometimes" for Child Behavior Checklist items or "frequently" for Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale items. Validation of the Short Screening Instrument for Psychological Problems in Enuresis revealed good accuracy for all subscales (approximately 88%), excellent specificity (0.91 to 0.99) and low to fair sensitivity (0.29 to 0.75).
   Conclusions: The Short Screening Instrument for Psychological Problems in Enuresis meets its goal because it leads to time efficient and early detection of problems of emotion, attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. The implementation of this short questionnaire can contribute to better followup of medical treatment.

AB Genetically informative data can be used to address fundamental questions concerning the measurement of behavior in children. The authors illustrate this with longitudinal multiple-rater data on internalizing problems in twins. Valid information on the behavior of a child is obtained for behavior that multiple raters agree upon and for rater-specific perception of the child's behavior. Rater-disagreement variance sigma(2)(rd) accounted for 35% of the individual differences in internalizing behavior. Up to 17% of this sigma(2)(rd) was accounted for by rater-specific additive genetic variance sigma 2(A(u)). Thus, the disagreement should not be considered only to be bias/error but also as representing the unique feature of the relationships between that parent and the child. The longitudinal extension of this model helps to make a distinction between measurement error and the raters' unique perception of the child's behavior. For internalizing behavior, the results show large stability across time, which is accounted for by common additive genetic and common shared environmental factors. Rater-specific shared environmental factors show substantial influence on stability. This could mean that rater bias may be persistent and affect longitudinal studies.

AB Introduction. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18) is the most commonly used parent-completed instrument that assesses child and adolescent psychopathology. It has been used in epidemiology and clinical studies. The last version contains DSM-oriented subscales.
   Objective. Investigate the psychometric properties of the CBCL/6-18 and develops a valid and reliable Mexican version.
   Method. Psychologists and child psychiatrists adapted the Spanish version of CBCL/6-18, and a back translation was done by a native English speaker. Discrepancies in the adaptation were solved by consensus. The checklist was applied to children in the community and to outpatients from a psychiatric children hospital. Reliability was evaluated by estimating internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) on all scales: retest at one week was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). A ROC curve was performed to estimate a cut-off which correctly identified children from the clinically referred patients and children recruited in the community (non-referred). Mean differences for the groups were calculated with the Student's t test.
   Results. The Mexican version of the CBCL/6-18 showed that the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.90 for internalizing problems, 0.94 for externalizing problems and 0.97 for the total problem scale. The ICC was 0.97 for the total problem scale. Significant differences were found between the mean score in broad band, narrow and the new DSM/oriented scales.
   Conclusions. The Mexican version of CBCL/6-1 8 is a reliable and valid screening instrument for clinical and epidemiologic use.

AB The authors draw on developmental psychopathology, life course sociology, and scholarship on educational processes to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the association of children's mental health problems with educational attainment. They use this framework to address two empirical gaps in prior research: lack of attention to mental health trajectories and the failure to consider diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude, disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational trajectories.

AB The relation between level of intellectual functioning and risk for associated symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was investigated. Cognitive ability and associated symptoms were assessed directly and/or via parent report in 74 children with ASD at 6 and 9 years of age. Participants were classified as lower and higher functioning using Nonverbal and Verbal IQ-and Communication scores on the Vineland at age 6. Children with higher functioning at age 6 displayed increased internalizing symptoms by age 9, whereas children with lower functioning displayed higher hyperactivity, attention problems, and irritability by age 9. Results suggest that level of intellectual functioning may be a risk factor for different patterns of associated symptoms by later childhood.

AB The present study investigated the adjustment of Indian adolescents living in Britain as well as the links between parents' and adolescents' acculturation styles and the adolescents' problem behaviours. The sample consisted of 68 young adolescents (31 Indian and 37 English) between the ages of 10 and 13, and their mothers and fathers. Mothers, fathers and adolescents reported about their own acculturation style, and parents also reported on their adolescents' problem behaviour. Overall Indian adolescents exhibited more internalizing problems than did their English peers. Furthermore, within the Indian group, the more Westernized mothers were in their acculturation style, the higher the level of externalizing problem behaviour their adolescents exhibited. In addition, the more traditional adolescents were the more internalizing problems they displayed. Finally, Indian adolescents experienced more internalizing problems when their parents were more Western or less traditional than the adolescents themselves. These findings highlight the importance of examining not only parental acculturation style, but also the parent-child acculturation discrepancy as a risk factor for problem behaviour.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of change in attributions for childhood sexual abuse (CSA) over a 6-year period and whether such patterns were related to abuse severity, age, gender, and subsequent symptoms of depression and PTSD.
   Methodology: One-hundred and sixty children, 8-15 years old, were interviewed within 8 weeks of the time the CSA was reported to child protective services (i.e., the time of abuse discovery). Follow-up interviews were conducted I-year later on 147, and 6 years later on 121 of the original participants. Abuse-specific attributions were obtained using two methods. Participants first responded to an open-ended interview question about why they believed the CSA had happened to them and then completed a rating scale about the extent to which possible attributions for the CSA applied to them (e.g., "Because I was not smart enough").
   Results: Over time, perpetrator-blame attributions were consistently more common than self-blame attributions for CSA (using both interview and rating measures). Youth were more likely to report self-blame attributions on the rating measure than the open-ended interview question. The interview method indicated that youth often felt confused about why the abuse happened up to a year following discovery but this response diminished by the third assessment. On average, ratings of perpetrator-blame attribution remained high over time (p <.05), whereas ratings of self-blame decreased (p <.01). Penetration was related to more self-blame (p <.05) and less perpetrator-blame (p <.05), and the use of force was related to more perpetrator-blame. The initial level of self-blame attribution ratings predicted subsequent symptoms of depression (p <.05) and intrusive experiences (p <.05) after controlling for age at abuse discovery, gender, and self-blame attributions for common events. Perpetrator-blame attributions were not related to symptoms.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that assessing responses to open-ended interview questions about the perceived reasons for the abuse and ratings of attributions are important for understanding how youth make sense of their abuse. Abuse-specific self-blame attributions at abuse discovery have a persistent effect on internalizing symptoms and should be assessed and the target of treatment as soon as possible after CSA has been reported to the authorities.

AB Background The present study aimed to clarify the circumstances under which maternal depression is associated with adverse outcomes in pre-school-aged children, and to explore the additional impact of the marital relationship in a socio-economically low-risk sample.
   Methods Ninety-two mothers recruited into a longitudinal study were assessed for symptoms of depression when their children were 4, 12 and 15 months, and later at 4 years of age. At 4 years of age, mothers were also asked to report on marital adjustment. Mothers, fathers and pre-school teachers were asked to report on children's internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems.
   Results Children exposed to chronic maternal depression were rated by their parents as significantly more problematic on internalizing and externalizing behaviours. This association was not mediated or moderated by low marital satisfaction. No parent-reported effects were evident for children exposed to transient depression. Ten per cent of the children had internalizing scores in the clinical range, and 7% had externalizing scores in the clinical range. Almost all of the children with clinically elevated scores had been exposed to chronic maternal depression. Teacher reports of internalizing behaviours corroborated parent reports; however, teachers tended to report significantly lower levels of behaviour problems. Although there was a tendency for teachers to rate children exposed to any depression as more problematic on internalizing behaviours, the subgroup differences were not significant.
   Conclusions Findings confirm that depression chronicity is important in determining child behavioural outcomes, and that depression effects cannot be accounted for by low marital adjustment. Results are discussed with reference to transmission of risk models, and treatment implications are considered.

AB This study aimed to determine what youth characteristics were associated with emotional and behavioral problems exhibited within the first three months of placement in residential treatment centers (RTCs) in a sample of youth from 20 agencies in 13 states. Two primary research questions were addressed: 1) What characteristics were associated with behavior during the transition to care? 2) Were the characteristics associated with behavior during the transition the same for boys and girls? Data were drawn from the Time I phase of the longitudinal national Odyssey Project dataset developed by the Child Welfare League of America. Measures included an extensive child and family characteristics (CFC) form and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The results revealed significant gender-specific patterns of associations between youth characteristics and behavior exhibited during the transition to RTC placement. Notably, a sexual abuse history was associated with Externalizing for girls and Internalizing for boys and entering on psychotropic medication was associated with Internalizing for girls and boys and Externalizing for boys only. Results suggest many avenues for refining practice.

AB Using 6 longitudinal data sets, the authors estimate links between three key elements of school readiness-school-entry academic, attention, and socioemotional skills-and later school reading and math achievement. In an effort to isolate the effects of these school-entry skills, the authors ensured that most of their regression models control for cognitive, attention, and socioemotional skills measured prior to school entry, as well as a host of family background measure,,;. Across all 6 studies, the strongest predictors of later achievement are school-entry math, reading, and attention skills. A meta-analysis of the results shows that early math skills have the greatest predictive power, followed by reading and then attention skills. By contrast, measures of socioemotional behaviors, including internalizing and externalizing problems and social skills, were generally insignificant predictors of later academic performance, even among children with relatively high levels of problem behavior. Patterns of association were similar for boys and girls and for children from high and low socioeconomic backgrounds.

AB The present study examines reciprocal associations between marital functioning and adolescent maladjustment using cross-lagged autoregressive models. The research involved 45 1 early adolescents and their families and used a prospective, longitudinal research design with multi-informant methods. Results indicate that parental conflicts over child rearing predicted adolescent depressive symptoms and delinquency. In turn, these adolescent problems exacerbated parental conflicts over child rearing. Furthermore, conflict over child rearing served as the nexus through which more generalized marital dissatisfaction and adolescent adjustment problems were reciprocally interrelated. This research replicates earlier observations that marital problems intensify adolescent maladjustment and extends the literature by demonstrating that adolescent problems also predict marital conflict and ultimately marital dissatisfaction. In sum, the present study demonstrates that marital dissatisfaction, conflict over child rearing, and early adolescent adjustment difficulties are interwoven in a dynamic family system marked by reciprocity along these dimensions.

AB To examine the internal consistency and validity of the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) and Brief-ITSEA (BITSEA) parent-report questionnaires in an early intervention sample. A sociodemographically diverse sample of 192 parents of 11- to 36-month-old children referred to early intervention programs completed surveys containing the ITSEA, BITSEA, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Parents were interviewed with the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Evaluators blind to children's status on the ITSEA and BITSEA rated child behavior during developmental assessments. Finally, a subsample of 71 children was administered the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Findings support the internal consistency of the ITSEA and BITSEA, with the majority of Cronbach's alphas above .70. Supporting validity, ITSEA and BITSEA problem scores correlated significantly with CBCL Internalizing and Externalizing scores (rs=.28 to.78), as well as with observational ratings of problem behaviors on constructs paralleling the ITSEA domains (rs=.21 to.45). In contrast, ITSEA Competence and BITSEA Competence demonstrated moderate negative associations with CBCL scores (rs=-.39 to -.43). Finally, ITSEA Competence and BITSEA Competence correlated significantly with developmental level on the Mullen, Vineland Socialization, and observational ratings of competence (rs=.25 to.43). Emphasizing the importance of addressing social-emotional issues in early intervention settings, 58.6% of children had high social-emotional/behavioral problems and/or low competence on the ITSEA; 39.8% had high ITSEA Problems and 38.5% had low ITSEA Competence. Results indicate the need to assess social-emotional adjustment in early intervention settings and support the use of the ITSEA and BITSEA for this purpose.

AB In this longitudinal study, the link between changing relationships between adolescents and their parents and the mediating role of friendships and support from romantic partners on internalizing and externalizing symptoms were analyzed. Based on data on parent-child relationships obtained in 228 adolescents ( ages 14 to 17) and their fathers and mothers, three different developmental trajectories were found which were differently linked with internalizing and externalizing symptomatology at ages 17 and 21. The quality of relationships with friends and romantic partners mediated the links between earlier parent-adolescent relationships and later problem behavior. The impact of close relationships with friends and romantic partners as a mediating process between family development trajectories and adaptation was more prominent for females than for males, highlighting the darker side of females' close relationships.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this article were to examine the literature published from 1982 to 2006 and to evaluate prevalence of dental fear and anxiety (DFA) and dental behaviour management problems (DBMP) in children and adolescents, and their relationships to age, sex, general anxiety, temperament, and general behavioural problems.
   Methods: A broad search of the PubMed database was performed using three combinations of search terms.
   Results: A large proportion of the identified articles could not be used for the review owing to inadequate endpoints, measures or poor study design. Thirty-two papers of acceptable quality were identified and reviewed. The prevalence of both DFA and DBMP were estimated to 9%, with a decrease in prevalence with age. DFA/DBMP were more frequent in girls. DFA/DBMP were related to general fear and both internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems, although these relationships were not clear-cut. Temperament was related to both DFA and DBMP but with different temperamental characteristics, while general behavioural problems mainly correlated with DBMP.
   Conclusions: DFA/DBMP are common, and several psychological factors are associated with the development of these problems. In order to better understand these relationships, a number of issues concerning design of research and measurement of DFA/DBMP have to be dealt with.

ID BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS; ANXIETY; PERSONALITY; PREDICTION; SCALES;

AB Background: Current treatment of children with dental behaviour management problems (DBMP) is based on the presupposition that their difficulties are caused by dental fear, but is this always the case?
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to study temperamental reactivity, negative emotionality, and other personal characteristics in relation to DBMP in 8- to 12-year-old children.
   Methods: Forty-six children referred because of DBMP (study group) and 110 children in ordinary dental care (reference group) participated. The EASI tempramental survey assessed temperamental reactivity and negative emotionality, the Child Behaviour Questionnaire internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems, and the Children's Fear Survey Schedule general and dental fears. Cluster analyses and tree-based modelling were used for data analysis.
   Results: Among the five clusters identified, one could be characterized as 'balanced temperament'. Thirty-five per cent of the reference group compared to only 7% of the study group belonged to this cluster. Negative emotionality was the most important sorting variable.
   Conclusions: Children referred because of DBMP differed from children in ordinary dental care, not only in dental fear level, but also in personal characteristics. Few of the referred children were characterized by a balanced temperament profile. It is important to consider the dual impact of emotion dysregulation and emotional reactivity in the development of DBMP.

AB Study background and aims: Ethnic disparities in mental health in adolescence may play a role in the development of ethnic disparities in educational attainment. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of ethnic disparities in mental health problems in adolescence to ethnic disparities in educational attainment in adulthood.
   Methods: We followed two community samples of respectively 486 Dutch native and 168 Turkish migrant adolescents (11-15 years old) into adulthood (21-25 years old). Mental health was measured in adolescence, and educational attainment was assessed in adulthood. The contribution of mental health disparities to educational disparities was estimated by the degree of attenuation of the odds ratio (OR) for low education after adjustment for mental health problems.
   Results: Adult Turkish men more often had attained lower education than Dutch men (OR 1.81 (1.01-3.25)). Additional adjustment for mental health problems during adolescence did not change the OR. In Turkish women, however, the OR was 1.94 (1.04-3.62), and adjustment for mental health problems lowered it by 96% to 1.04 (0.51-2.14). The contribution was mostly due to ethnic disparities in internalizing problems.
   Conclusion: In women, but not in men, ethnic disparities in mental health, especially internalizing problems, were a strong predictor for the development of ethnic disparities in educational attainment. Prevention or treatment of internalizing problems among Turkish girls will probably contribute to the prevention of educational disparities.

AB The present study examines the relations between adolescent motherhood and children's behavior, substance use, and internalizing problems in a sample of 1,368 children of 712 female twins from Australia. Adolescent motherhood remained significantly associated with all mental health problems, even when using a quasiexperimental design capable of controlling for genetic and environmental confounds. However, the relation between adolescent motherhood and offspring behavior problems and substance use was partially confounded by family background variables that influence both generations. The results are consistent with a causal relation between adolescent motherhood and offspring mental health problems, and they highlight the usefulness of behavior genetic designs when examining putative environmental risks for the development of psychopathology. The generalizability of these results to the United States, which has a higher adolescent birth rate, is discussed.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of preschoolers diagnosed with moderate to severe attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) recruited for the multisite Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS). The diagnosis and evaluation process will also be described.
   Method: A comprehensive multidimensional, multi-informant assessment protocol was implemented including the semistructured PATS Diagnostic Interview. Parent- and teacher-report measures were used to supplement information from interviews. Consensus agreement by a cross-site panel on each participant's diagnoses was required. Analyses were conducted to describe the sample and to test associations between ADHD severity and demographic and clinical variables.
   Results: The assessment protocol identified 303 preschoolers (3-5.5 years) with moderate to severe ADHD Hyperactive/Impulsive or Combined type. The majority of participants (n = 211, 69.6%) experienced co-morbid disorders, with oppositional defiant disorder, communication disorders, and anxiety disorders being the most common. Participants with co-morbid communication disorders were found to be more anxious and depressed. ADHD severity was found to correlate with more internalizing difficulties and lower functioning. Although boys and girls had similar symptom presentations, younger children had significantly higher ADHD severity.
   Conclusions: Preschoolers with moderate to severe ADHD experience high co-morbidity and impairment, which have implications for both assessment and treatment.

AB Background: Language impairment is often associated with behaviour problems. However, detailed relations between different types of language impairment and specific behaviour problems in children have yet to be demonstrated. The present study attempted to do just this with an eye to the implications to identify foci for early intervention. Methods: The language abilities of 71 five-year-old children with language impairment were assessed via the administration of an extensive battery of language tests. The children's behaviour profile was assessed via administration of the Child Behaviour Checklist. Results: Factor analyses confirmed the presence of four language factors: speech, syntax, semantics and phonology. Forty percent of the children displayed serious significant behaviour problems. The most frequently occurring behaviour problems were: withdrawn behaviour, somatic complaints, thought problems and aggressive behaviour. Behaviour problems were associated with three of the four language factors but not strongly associated with speech problems. Conclusions: Differential relations between specific types of language impairment and specific behaviour problems already exist at a young age. Phonological problems showed broad relations to problem behaviour; semantic language problems were especially related to internalizing behaviour problems. This finding suggests the need for specific therapies for both different types of language problems and different types of behaviour problems.

   CONTEXT; PERCEPTIONS
AB Research indicates that peer victimization contributes to poor school functioning in childhood and adolescence, yet the processes by which victimization interferes with school functioning are unclear. This study examined internalizing and externalizing problems as domain-specific mediators of the association between subtypes of peer victimization (relational, physical) and school functioning (engagement, achievement) with a cross-sectional sample of 337 early adolescents. School engagement was examined further as a proximal process that intervenes in the associations between internalizing and extemalizing problems and achievement. Gender differences in these associations were assessed. As expected, internalizing problems showed stronger links with relational than with physical victimization and partially mediated the influence of both on engagement for girls but not boys. Externalizing problems partially mediated the influence of both subtypes of victimization on school functioning for girls and physical victimization for boys. Notably, engagement was a robust mediator of the contributions of internalizing problems and physical victimization to achievement for girls and externalizing problems to achievement for girls and boys. Findings also suggest that physical (but not relational) victimization partially mediates the link between internalizing and externalizing problems and school functioning.

AB This study examined parent-child agreement regarding anxiety and depressive disorders in youth with asthma and evaluated key demographic and health differences associated with parent-child agreement. Of 756 outpatient youth with asthma, 122 (16.0%) were diagnosed with a DSM-IV anxiety or depression disorder using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (C-DISC). Parents reported on internalizing symptoms using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Logistic regression analyses were used to examine factors related to parent- and child-reported symptom agreement. Low rates of agreement (48.9%) between youth and parents regarding diagnosis of a DSM-IV anxiety or depressive disorder were found among youth with asthma. Increased agreement was associated with higher extemalizing behavior score on the CBCL and more anxiety and depressive symptoms on the C-DISC. Children without behavioral problems and with less severe anxiety and depression were recognized significantly less often by their parents.

AB Objective: To critically review literature published from 1996 to 2007 on psychopathology in children with epilepsy (CWE). Method: Using Ovid, we searched Medline and PsychInfo databases for original studies on epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of psychopathology in CWE, ages 0 to 18 years, using the terms "psychopathology," "emotional and behavioral problems," and "mental health problems." We selectively present the findings of studies that are clinically relevant to mental health professionals. Results: Psychopathology occurs in 37% to 77% of CWE, and attention, internalizing, and thought problems may be specific to epilepsy. Cognitive and linguistic deficits, as well as family factors, have moderating effects on psychopathology in CWE. The association of epilepsy-related variables, including antiepileptic drugs, with psychopathology is inconsistent in cognitively normal CWE. Children with symptomatic epilepsy and devastating epilepsy syndromes have high rates of global developmental delay, hyperactivity, and autistic symptoms. The treatment of psychopathology in CWE integrates standard psychiatric practices. Conclusions: Epilepsy is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by seizures, psychopathology, cognitive, and linguistic problems. Improved early identification of CWE at risk for psychopathology, evidence-based psychiatric treatment, and multidisciplinary management strategies would advance clinical practice in this highly complex field of pediatric neuropsychiatry.

AB Objective: We investigated in a prospective longitudinal population-based study whether childhood suicide ideation is associated with negative mental health outcome in adulthood. Method: A total of 1,022 Dutch children who were 11 years or younger in 1983 were prospectively followed over 10 to 14 years into adulthood. Parent reports of suicide ideation in childhood (11 years or younger; n = 20) were examined in relation to mental health in adulthood assessed with a structured psychiatric interview (mood disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, and externalizing disorder) and selfreported suicide ideation and history of suicide attempt. Results: Childhood suicide ideation was highly predictive of suicide ideation in adulthood (odds ratio 10.70, 95% confidence interval 3.26-35.09), and lifetime history of suicide attempt (odds ratio 5.80, 95% confidence interval 1.53-22.02). Childhood suicide ideation was associated with an increased likelihood of mood disorder and anxiety disorder in adulthood and to a lesser extent externalizing disorder, although these effects decreased considerably after adjusting for childhood internalizing and externalizing behavior. Conclusions: Suicide ideation in childhood may be a stable characteristic with worrying consequences in adulthood. Children with parent-reported suicide ideation at a young age may require additional resources, age-appropriate intervention, and careful monitoring into adulthood.

AB OBJECTIVE. The potential association between short sleep duration or sleep problems and childhood overweight has not been well described. The objective of this study was to test the independent associations of sleep duration and problems with overweight risk in children.
   METHODS. Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed. In 3rd and 6th grades, sleep duration and problems were obtained by maternal report, and height and weight were measured, with overweight defined as a BMI of >= 95th percentile for age and gender. Logistic regression evaluated the association of sleep duration and problems with overweight at 6th grade cross-sectionally adjusting for gender, race, and maternal education. Additional covariates tested individually included the level of chaos at home, the quality of the home environment, the lax-parenting subscale score of the Raising Children Checklist, and the Child Behavior Checklist internalizing and externalizing subscale scores. Logistic regression also evaluated the relationship of sleep duration at 3rd grade and overweight at 6th grade, adjusting for gender, race, maternal education, and the child's BMI z score in 3rd grade.
   RESULTS. Of 785 children, 50% were male, 81% were white, and 18% were overweight in 6th grade. Shorter sleep duration in 6th grade was independently associated with a greater likelihood of overweight in 6th grade. Shorter sleep duration in 3rd grade was also independently associated with overweight in 6th grade, independent of the child's weight status in 3rd grade. Sleep problems were not associated with overweight.
   CONCLUSION. One preventive approach to overweight may be to ensure adequate sleep in childhood.

Delay but not probability discounting decreased with age. Delay discounting was also associated with verbal intelligence and Go-NoGo and Iowa Gambling Task performance. Probability discounting was associated only with externalizing behavior. Findings conform to an accumulation of evidence that while delay and probability discounting may have some overlapping components, they also reflect some fundamentally different processes in this age group.

The results indicated a direct moderating effect of emotional regulation in the relation between maternal anxiety and externalizing behaviour and that ability and negative affect moderated the relation between maternal anxiety and attention and social problems and somatic complaints. The links between maternal anxiety and withdrawal and anxiety/depression symptoms were also mediated by lability and negative affect. This mediation was independent of emotional regulation in the first case, and it depended on emotional regulation with regard to anxiety/depression symptoms.

AB There is little research regarding interventions for children with internalizing behaviors in schools, both within classrooms and in nonclassroom environments. In response to this need, a nonclassroom treatment package, consisting of (a) social skills instruction, (b) mediated self-management, and (c) a reinforcement system, was implemented to modify the socially withdrawn behavior of 3 elementary students. The effects of this treatment package were evaluated on the school playground-during recess-by recording both the number of communicative acts and the total time spent engaged in appropriate peer play for each target student. All target students showed marked improvement in their playground, social interaction. Future research should be conducted with similar populations, using variations of the described methods in other school settings. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

DT Article
ID CANCER; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
AB The authors assessed the risk for psychosocial maladjustment in a population-based sample of dependent children of parents with serious physical illness. In the context of The Hamburg Health Survey, a wide range of data on current life situation and health status was collectedfrom a representative sample of families with children and adolescents between 4 and 18 years old (N = 1, 950). For 4- to 18-year-old children and adolescents in Germany, the prevalence of a serious physical illness in a parent was 4.1 %. The adjusted risk of psychosocial maladjustment in this target group, depending on the case definition, is elevated, with internalizing problems being more prevalent than externalizing problems. Although problems for affected boys decline with puberty, they increase for girls. In this age-group, girls and boys appear to be under particular strain when the respective same-sex parent has a serious physical illness. Exposure to serious parental physical illness is an epidemiologically relevant risk factor for psychosocial maladjustment in children and adolescents that needs to be better recognized by medical professionals.

AB Differences between pervasive (home and day-care/school) versus non-pervasive (home only) conduct problems were examined in regard to various child, parent/family, and day-care/school characteristics in an outpatient clinic sample of 120 children aged 4-8 years. All children scored above the 90th percentile on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory for home problems and met the criteria for a possible or a confirmed diagnosis of oppositional defiant behaviours. The proportion of children with pervasive conduct problems was high, 83%. Teachers in day care and school reported children in the pervasive group to have significantly more attention and internalizing problems as well as lower social competence scores than those in the non-pervasive group. Children in the pervasive group also showed consistently more problems in their relationships both with teachers and peers than those in the non-pervasive group. The implications for assessment and treatment of children with conduct problems in these age-groups are discussed.

ID BRAIN-TUMORS; MUTISM
AB Purpose. Posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) occurs in approximately 20% of patients after resection of a tumor from the posterior fossa. Few descriptions of persistent psychosocial consequences exist. We assessed whether the development of PFS is associated with increased risk for emotional, behavioral, and social problems after the cessation of cancer treatment. Procedures. Medical charts and neuropsychological data from 21 children (range= 6-17 years old, median=9.8) were reviewed. All participants were survivors of childhood medulloblastoma and had been treated with surgical resection of the tumor, craniospinal radiation, +/- chemotherapy, and had comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations 1-2 years post-treatment. Six of the 21 were diagnosed with PFS. A series of chi-square tests were conducted to determine whether a relationship existed between PFS and clinically significant levels of emotional, behavioral, and social problems as measured by parent-report on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Conners' Parent Rating Scale-93 (CPRS-93). Results. Children who developed PFS were significantly more likely to exhibit obsessive-compulsive type (i.e., perfectionistic) behaviors, withdrawal behaviors, social problems, and internalizing problems (all P<0.05) than those who did not develop PFS. Additionally, children with PFS were more likely to evidence anxious-shy behaviors, attention problems, and somatic complaints, although these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion. Results from the current preliminary study suggest that PFS may place children at increased risk for emotional, behavioral, and social problems long after completion of their cancer treatment.

AB This study examined maternal and child predictors of White mothers' cultural socialization/pluralism and preparation for bias of Chinese and Korean adopted children in families participating in the Northeast-Northwest Collaborative Adoption Project. Mother's psychological connection to Asian Americans, but not White identity, and children's age predicted cultural socialization/pluralism and preparation for bias. Birth country was related to cultural socialization/pluralism but not preparation for bias. Cultural socialization/pluralism was related to fewer externalizing problems but not to internalizing problems. Preparation for bias was not related to behavioral problems. The implications of these findings are summarized in terms of interventions aimed at increasing mothers' connections to Asian American communities or individuals, providing Korean cultural information to parents of Korean adoptees, and the timing of interventions.

AB Prenatal exposure to alcohol can lead to long-term impairments in cognition and behavior and represents a major public health concern. This paper reviews studies examining the social and behavioral functioning of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. Social and behavioral functioning are important domains for study because deficits in these areas can lead to problems in everyday functioning and to maladjustment in later life. Most research with individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure has used caregiver or self-report questionnaires or semi-structured interviews to sample behavior. The vast majority of studies indicate significant difficulties with interpersonal functioning, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and high rates of psychopathology. Recent intervention studies conducted with individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure have shown promising results in improving the social skills and behavioral functioning in this population. Finally, this paper concludes with recommendations for future studies in this area.

AB Skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR) was examined as a longitudinal mediator and moderator of relations between parental marital conflict and psychopathology among children and young adolescents. Participants were 157 boys and girls (M age at T1 = 9.31 years; SD = 1.97); there was a 2-year lag between T1 and T2 assessments. At T1, participants' SCLR was assessed in response to lab challenges. Parents completed measures of aggressive marital conflict and child adjustment at T1 and T2. Supportive of moderation effects, T1 marital conflict interacted with T1 SCLR and gender in the prediction of changes in maladjustment. The link between marital conflict and increased internalizing and externalizing symptoms was stronger for girls with higher SCLR than girls with lower SCLR. Marital conflict predicted increased externalizing behaviors for boys with lower SCLR but not higher SCLR, although levels of externalizing behaviors were similar among boys with lower and higher SCLR especially at higher levels of marital conflict. Findings build on the literature by illustrating the importance of examinations of both family risk and youth biological vulnerability for the prediction of psychopathology.

Research on racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and disorders in adolescents has been less consistent or generally lacking. The current study examined the prevalence of these symptom groups in a large sample of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders in which the three major racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. (White, Black, and Hispanic/Latino) were well-represented. Hispanic females reported experiencing higher levels of depression, anxiety, and reputational aggression than other groups. Black males reported the highest levels of overtly aggressive behavior and also reported higher levels of physiologic anxiety and disordered eating than males from other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic females also exhibited higher levels of comorbidity than other racial/ethnic groups.

AB The consequences of aggression on problem course and suicide risk were examined in 270 acutely suicidal adolescents (ages 12-17 years; 184 girls). Participants were assessed during psychiatric hospitalization (T1), 6-months post-hospitalization (T2), and 15 or more months post-hospitalization (T3). Study variables included self- and parent-reported aggression; self-reported internalizing symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and adverse events; and clinician-rated suicidal behavior. Aggression was not directly related to suicide attempt concurrently or prospectively. However, among more aggressive youth, internalizing symptoms were more predictive of T3 suicide attempt than among less aggressive youth. T1 aggression predicted aggressive incidents and the likelihood of incarceration prior to T3. Two-level hierarchical linear modeling indicated that self-reported aggression and internalizing problems were linked in terms of severity and rates of decline over time. Overall, parent-reported aggression was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Findings highlight (a) the continuity and consequences of aggression, (b) a possible role of aggression in worsening suicide risk factors and potentiating suicide attempt, and (c) the importance of ongoing research on subtypes of suicidal adolescents.

AB The present study examined the role of parenting styles in the experience and expression of homesickness, and the way of coping with the feelings involved. Using a sample of 670 first year college and university students, aged 16 to 25, we tested three hypotheses: (1) authoritarian, permissive as well as uninvolved parenting are associated with the experience of homesickness, contrary to students with authoritative parents who are less likely to have feelings of homesickness; (2) students with authoritarian, permissive or uninvolved parents show their homesickness by internalizing and externalizing problems; and (3) students raised by authoritative or permissive parents use more effective coping strategies to deal with homesickness. Results indicated that students raised by authoritative and permissive parents experienced more homesickness with stronger feelings of homesickness than students raised by authoritarian or uninvolved parents. However, they hardly express homesickness by internalizing or externalizing problems when they use effective ways of coping, namely support-seeking and/or problem-solving. Students with parents endorsing an authoritarian or uninvolved parenting style, on the other hand, showed more internalizing and externalizing problems in reaction to feelings of homesickness. They also use less effective coping strategies. The results revealed the importance of a loving and accepting home environment for the development and expression of homesickness, as well as the importance of the way in which students learn to cope with their problems.

AB Background: Children's early problem behavior that manifests in multiple contexts is often more serious and stable. The concurrent and predictive validity of ratings of externalizing and internalizing by four informants was examined at preschool and early school age in an at-risk sample. Methods: Two hundred forty children were assessed by mothers and fathers (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)), and teachers and laboratory examiners (Teacher Report Form (TRF)) at ages 3 and 5 years. Results: All informants' ratings of externalizing converged on a common factor at ages 3 and 5 that showed strong stability over time (beta = .80). All informants' age 3 externalizing ratings significantly predicted the problem factor at age 5; mothers', fathers', and teachers' ratings were independently predictive. Ratings of internalizing (except by examiners at age 3) also converged at both ages; the problem factor showed medium stability (beta = .39) over time. Only fathers' ratings of age 3 internalizing predicted the age 5 problem factor. Conclusions: Findings support the value of multi-informant assessment, uphold calls to include fathers in childhood research, and suggest that examiners provide valid, though non-unique assessment data. Examiner contributions may prove useful in many research contexts.

AB Background: Much of the evidence suggesting that loneliness is a risk factor for socio-emotional adjustment difficulties comes from studies with older children and adolescents. Comparatively less is known about the mental health implications of loneliness in early childhood. The goals of the present study were to provide additional convergent validity of the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire for Young Children (Cassidy & Asher, 1992) and explore potential gender differences in relations between loneliness and behavior problems in early childhood. Methods: A multiple source assessment of 139 kindergarten-aged children (M-age = 64.76 mos., SD = 4.48) was undertaken, including parental ratings, behavioral observations, child interviews, and teacher ratings. Results: Overall, loneliness was positively associated with anxiety, aggression, and peer exclusion. However, several gender differences were also observed. Conclusions: Loneliness may be a marker variable for both early internalizing and externalizing problems. However, gender differences in the behavioral associates of loneliness are also evident.

AB Background: Relatively little is known about the genetic architecture of childhood behavioral disorders in very young children. Method: In this study, parents completed the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment, a questionnaire that assesses symptoms of childhood disorders, as well as socio-emotional competencies, for 822 twin pairs (49.3% female; age 17-48 months) participating in the Wisconsin Twin Project. Psychometric, rater bias, and sex-limitation models explored the role of genetic and environmental influences on (1) externalizing and internalizing behavior; (2) less commonly assessed behaviors pertaining to physical and emotional dysregulation, general competencies, social relatedness; and (3) infrequent behaviors such as those associated with pervasive developmental delays. Results: Heritable influences accounted for the majority (56% or more) of variation in behavior that was commonly observed by both parents. The remaining variance was associated with non-shared environmental factors, with the exception of competency and atypical behavior, which were also influenced by shared environmental factors. In contrast, for most behaviors, the variation unique to mother and father ratings was split between variation due to shared environment or rater biases and to measurement error. Little evidence emerged for sex differences in the underlying causes of variation. Keywords: Behavioral genetics, twins, behavior problems, toddlerhood.

AB The relation between adolescent-reported parenting behaviors and mother-reported youth externalizing and internalizing behaviors was examined among 91 Mexican American mother-adolescent (ages 13-17) dyads recruited from an immigrant enclave in a large midwestern metropolitan area. Two major dimensions of mothers' parenting emerged: supportive parenting and harsh parental control. Gender moderation analyses revealed that lower levels of externalizing behaviors were linked with mothers' higher levels of supportive parenting among girls but not among boys. Higher levels of youth-reported depression were linked with mothers' higher levels of harsh parental control among boys but not among girls. The findings highlight the importance of supportive parenting and of gender in the study of Mexican American families and youth mental health.

AB This article documents the development, factor structure, and psychometric properties of the parent- and youth-report forms of the Child Obsessive Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R), a measure of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-specific functional impairment. Using a sample of 250 youth (M age = 11.7, 54% male, 80% Caucasian) diagnosed with OCD in a university hospital-based child anxiety clinic, exploratory factor analysis was employed to develop a 4-factor structure for the parent-report measure (Daily Living Skills, School, Social, Family/Activities) and a 3-factor structure for the youth-report form (School, Social, Activities). Both measures demonstrated good internal consistency, concurrent validity, and test-retest reliability. Moreover, partial correlations demonstrated significant associations between COIS-R scales and clinician global assessment of functioning scores controlling for both symptom severity and comorbid internalizing and externalizing symptomatology. These findings suggest that the COIS-R may hold utility for assessing the specific impact of OCD symptoms on youth functioning.

AB Objective: To examine in a sex-sensitive manner the frequencies, clinical correlates, and patterns of co-occurrence of impulse-control disorders in adolescent psychiatric inpatients.
   Method: 102 consecutive adolescents (54.9% females; mean age = 15.8 +/- 1.4 years) admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service for a variety of disorders were screened for impulse-control disorders from January through June 2006 using the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview. Subjects screening positive were blindly evaluated with structured clinical interviews.
   Results: Forty-one patients (40.2%) met criteria for a current impulse-control disorder. The most common impulse-control disorder was intermittent explosive disorder (12.7%). Compared to patients without impulse-control disorders, those with impulse-control disorders were more likely to report previous psychiatric hospitalization (75.6% vs. 4 1.0%; p = .001) and internalizing disorders (78.0% vs. 55.7% p = .04). Although not statistically significantly different, a numerically larger proportion of girls as compared with boys had an impulse-control disorder (48.2% vs. 30.4%;. p = .07). In particular, a statistically greater percentage of females had pyromania (12.5 % vs. 0%; p = .02).
   Conclusions: Impulse-control disorders are common among adolescent psychiatric inpatients, with a trend toward impulse-control disorders being more common in girls. Impulse-control disorders appear associated with more severe psychiatric illness. Sex-specific patterns of impulse-control disorder occurrence in adults do not appear uniformly applicable to adolescent psychiatric inpatients. Better identification of impulse-control disorders in adolescents is needed, as are empirically validated treatments for adolescents with co-occurring impulse-control disorders.

AB Objective: Chronic illness is highly prevalent among adults with children. it is therefore important to understand how parental illness may or may not have an impact on affected families. Findings thus far have suggested that differences between children with and without a sick parent are minimal, but there are individual and familial moderators of outcome. it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to single-parent families. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether maternal chronic illness affects multiple aspects of child functioning in a large, ethnically diverse sample of single-parent families compared to those not affected by illness. Potential moderators of differences, including maternal distress, parenting variables (aggravation and warmth), functional impairment related to illness, and demographic characteristics were also tested. Methods: Using data from the Child Development Study (CDS), 812 mother-child pairs were studied. Mothers completed measures of child internalizing, externalizing, and positive behaviors, while children completed a measure of depression. Results: The results indicated that overall there were no differences between children with or without a sick mother on the measures of well-being. Higher symptom levels among both cohorts were associated with maternal distress and aggravation in parenting only. However, children with a sick mother were more likely to have a consultation due to emotional difficulties. Conclusion: Several areas for future work on how illness affects single-parent families were identified such as prospectively studying illnesses with a variable course and determining which protective factors promote resiliency for children in this difficult situation.

AB Psychosocial outcomes have come to the front as a main concern for individuals with Cerebral Palsy (CP), promoting the need to understand the quality of life experienced by children and adolescents diagnosed with CP. As a result, the current study examined the relationships among quality of life in children with CP, the psychological symptoms and parenting characteristics of the parents of these children, and the emotional and behavioral functioning of these children. Results of this study suggested that these variables are related in interesting ways. Further, parenting stress, parents' depressive symptoms, and children's internalizing behavior problems were significant predictors of the quality of life experienced by the children in this sample. Thus, the direct benefits from optimizing parents' mental health as well as that of their children may prove to be an important intervention in helping to improve the quality of life of children who have been diagnosed with CP.

AB Analyses were conducted to examine the extent of overlap and predictive strength of multiple forms of child maltreatment and stressors internal and external to the family. Findings suggest a strong association between child maltreatment (physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic violence) and stressors (family conflict, personal problems of parents, and external constraints on the family). After controlling for stressors, family socioeconomic status, and child gender, a general construct of child maltreatment was predictive of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescents. Specific effects of child physical and sexual abuse were revealed in these longitudinal structural equation model tests.

AB Background When assessing people with intellectual disabilities (ID), using the DSM-IV-TR can be challenging. Frequently, significant clinical data must be obtained from interviews with key informants. A new semi-structured interview tool was developed including behavioural descriptions of each DSM-IV-TR symptom criterion for a number of mood and anxiety disorders. A goal was to provide mental health clinicians with an instrument easy to use in clinical practice that would increase reliable identification of diagnostically important mood and anxiety symptoms. This is especially important given the fact that many experts believe these 'internalizing' clinical syndromes may often be missed in this population, because of characteristic limitations in expressive language skills.
   Method To establish validity, the Mood and Anxiety Semi-structured (MASS) Interview-derived diagnoses were compared with clinical DSM-IV diagnoses derived from an extensive inpatient evaluation and classifications based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for 93 psychiatric inpatients served on a specialized unit for people with ID and major mental health disorders.
   Results Agreement with the MASS Interview was high yielding significant kappa coefficients ranging from 0.42 to 0.78.
   Conclusions The MASS Interview, a semi-structured interview containing behavioural descriptions of DSM-IV symptom criteria, shows promise as a potentially helpful tool in the psychiatric diagnostic evaluation of persons with ID and limited expressive language skills, in the detection of mood and anxiety disorders. The tool also yields a wide breadth of clinical information and is easy for mental health clinicians to use.

AB Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of behavioral parent training (BPT) as adjunct to routine clinical care (RCC).
   Method: After a first phase of RCC, 94 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ages 4-12, all referred to a Dutch outpatient mental health clinic, were randomly assigned to 5 months of BPT plus concurrent RCC (n = 47) or to 5 months of RCC (n = 47) alone. BPT consisted of 12 sessions in group format; RCC included family support and pharmacotherapy when appropriate. Exclusionary criteria were minimized, and children with and without medication could participate. Parent-reported behavioral problems, ADHD symptoms, internalizing problems, and parenting stress were assessed before and after treatment. Follow-up assessment of the BPT + RCC group was completed 25 weeks post-BPT intervention. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: Both groups showed improvements over time on all measures. BPT + RCC was superior to RCC alone in reducing behavioral (p =.017) and internalizing (p =.042) problems. No outcome differences were found in ADHD symptoms (p =.161) and parenting stress (p =.643). These results were equal for children with and without medication. Children allocated to RCC alone received more polypharmaceutical treatment. Conclusions: Adjunctive BPT enhances the effectiveness of routine treatment of children with ADHD, particularly in decreasing behavioral and internalizing problems, but not in reducing ADHD symptoms or parenting stress. Furthermore, adjunctive BPT may limit the prescription of polypharmaceutical treatment.

LA English
DT Article
DE comorbidity; gender identity disorder
ID DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW SCHEDULE; BEHAVIOR; ANXIETY; BOYS
AB Objective: To investigate the prevalence and type of comorbiclity in children with gender identity disorder (GID). Method: The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent version was used to assess psychopathology according to the DSM in two groups of children. The first group consisted of 120 Dutch children (age range 4-11 years) who were referred to a gender identity clinic between 1998 and 2004 (GID group) and the second group consisted of 47 Dutch children who were referred to an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) clinic between 1998 and 2004 (ADHD group; 100% response rate for both groups). Results: Fifty-two percent of the children diagnosed with GID had one or more diagnoses other than GID. As expected, more internalizing (37%) than externalizing (23%) psychopathology was present in both boys and girls. Furthermore, the odds ratios of having internalizing or externalizing comorbidity were 1.28 and 1.39 times higher, respectively, in the clinical comparison group (ADHD group) than in the GID group. Finally, 31% of the children with GID suffered from an anxiety disorder. Conclusions: The results of this categorical diagnostic study show that children with GID are at risk for developing co-occurring problems. Because 69% of the children do not have an anxiety disorder, a full-blown anxiety disorder does not seem to be a necessary condition for the development of GID. Clinicians working with children with GID should be aware of the risk for co-occurring psychiatric problems and must realize that externalizing comorbidity, if present, can make a child with GID more vulnerable to social ostracism.

AB Objective: To test the validity of the MacArthur Health and Behavior Questionnaire (HBQ) using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine optimal thresholds for the HBQ in predicting Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version-IV (DISC-IV) diagnoses. The roles of child sex, level of impairment, and physical health in understanding of psychopathology were also considered. Method: A sample of 814 8-year-old twin children was recruited from birth records. Mothers were interviewed over the telephone using the HBQ and were also interviewed in person using the DISC-IV. Fathers also completed the HBQ; children completed the parallel module of the Berkeley Puppet Interview.
   Results: The HBQ identified more cases overall than the DISC-IV. Sex did not contribute to prediction of diagnosis. Impairment, DISC-IV symptom counts, father HBQ, child Berkeley Puppet Interview, and physical health significantly distinguished the HBQ low and high symptom groups. Conclusions: The HBQ is a valid new screening measure of psychopathology for use with children under 9 years of age. It is sensitive to internalizing disorders, which may aid the understanding of depression and anxiety disorders that are often underappreciated in young children.

AB Objective: The societal changes experienced by Western societies in recent decades have raised concerns about increases in the level of children's mental health problems. Although studies of secular changes in the prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses have indeed shown increases, their results may have been influenced by methodological problems, such as changing diagnostic criteria. Although repeated population studies using identical measures have not indicated such a clear increase in mental health problems, these studies have been limited to school-age children. We therefore investigated changes in Dutch parents'reports of very young children's emotional and behavioral problems over a 14-year period. Method: We compared Child Behavior Checklist scores across two Dutch general population samples of 2- and 3-year-olds, one sample assessed in 1989 and one in 2003. Results: Results revealed only a few changes over time, indicating small decreases in parent-reported problems. Between 1989 and 2003, there were decreases in the mean scores and in the proportions of children with deviant scores on the Anxious/Depressed, Total Problems, Internalizing, and DSM-oriented aftention-deficit/hyperactivity problems scales. Conclusions: Despite indications of increasing problems among school-age children and adolescents, parent-reported problem levels of very young Dutch children have not increased. Our findings even showed some small improvements in parents' reports of very young children's functioning between 1989 and 2003.

AB Correlations between adolescent and parent reports of adolescent problems are low in magnitude. In community samples adolescents tend to report more problems than parents and in clinical samples adolescents tend to report fewer problems than parents. Indices of agreement may be biased if some adolescents in a given sample report more problems and others report fewer problems than parents. In the current study, order and mean agreement between adolescent and maternal reports of adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems, taking into account the direction of disagreement, was examined in a community sample of 133 young adolescents and their mothers. Two-thirds to three-quarters of adolescents reported more problems than mothers. Accounting for the direction of discrepancies resulted in improved agreement between adolescents and mothers and differing patterns of predictors of discrepancies. Additionally, the results demonstrate the need to control for relations between adolescent-reported problems and discrepancies when exploring predictors of discrepancies.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate behavior and quality of life in children after corrective cardiac surgery in infancy. Twenty cyanotic (tetralogy of Fallot) and 20 acyanotic children (ventricular septal defect), operated at a mean age of 0.7 years with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), were assessed at a mean age of 7.4 years by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the German KINDL. Test results were related to perioperative and neurodevelopmental outcome. Compared to healthy children and not significantly different between the groups, internalizing and externalizing problems were elevated, school performance and total competence were reduced, and self- and parent-reported quality of life was not reduced. Parent-reported problems and reduced physical status were correlated with longer durations of DHCA and CPB. Internalizing and externalizing problems, reduced school competence, and reduced self-esteem were associated with reduced endurance capacity. Externalizing problems were related to reduced gross motor function. Poor school competence was related to reduced intelligence and academic achievement. Children with preoperative hypoxemia in infancy due to cyanotic cardiac defects are not at significantly higher risk for behavioral problems and reduced quality of life than those with acyanotic heart defects. The risk of long-term psychosocial maladjustment after corrective surgery in infancy is increased compared to that for normal children and related to the presence of neurodevelopmental dysfunction.

AB OBJECTIVES. Recent changes in family structure are associated with an increase in psychosocial maladjustment in adolescents. We examined, from a public health intervention perspective, the association between family breakup and psychosocial maladjustment in adolescents and assessed the mediating role of family-functioning variables.
   METHODS. We analyzed data from the Social and Health Survey of Children and Adolescents in Quebec, Montreal, Canada, which was conducted in 1999. Sample-weighted logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the risk of internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, substance abuse, and alcohol consumption in relation to family breakups and family-functioning variables, after adjusting for socioeconomic factors.
   RESULTS. All 4 of the indicators of psychosocial maladjustment were significantly associated with family breakup. The association between family breakups and internalizing disorders was mediated by parental psychological distress and low paternal emotional support. Independently, the witnessing of interparental violence was also strongly associated with internalizing disorders. For the other 3 outcomes, that is, externalizing disorders, substance abuse, and alcohol consumption, family breakup and family-functioning variables had independent effects.
   CONCLUSIONS. Family-based interventions and social approaches are complementary support modalities for adolescents experiencing family disruptions.

AB The Youth Self-Report Form's (YSR's) factor model was derived from traditional exploratory factor analytical procedures. Assuming appropriate model specification, psychometrically invariant items, and that its items provide useful psychometric information across nations omitted from its normative samples, the YSR is widely used in cross-national studies of nonreferred children. Item response theory analytical procedures reveal (a) 2 dimensions partly overlapping with the YSR's Internalizing and Externalizing second-order factors; (b) variance (i.e., differential item functioning) in how well a few items discriminate for nonreferred children across two nations; and (c) variance in estimating severity levels in children with identical psychopathological severity cross-nationally. Addressing psychometric variance, limiting redundancy, and matching children's psychopathological severity levels with items measuring this severity might promote more accurate and economical assessment.

AB Objective: Referred obese adolescents often display psychological problems. The present study aimed at investigating whether Young's schema theory constitutes a comprehensive framework to understand psychopathology in youth in general and in referred obese adolescents in particular. Methods: 91 youngsters referred for obesity treatment and 91 normal weight controls (all between 12 and 18 years of age) filled out the Young Schema Questionnaire and the Youth Self-Report. Parents were asked to complete the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: The obese youngsters displayed an overall greater severity of dysfunctional schemas than normal weight controls. The obese group scored significantly higher for the schemas Emotional Deprivation, Social Isolation/Alienation, Defectiveness/Shame, Failure to Achieve, Dependence/Incompetence and Subjugation. Social Isolation/Alienation and Vulnerability to Harm/Illness were highly predictive for internalizing symptoms in youth. The schemas Entitlement and Dependence/Incompetence were predictive for externalizing symptoms in youth. Conclusion: Referred obese individuals display high levels of maladaptive schemas and these are generally related to internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

   POLYMORPHISM; FRONTAL ACTIVATION
AB Recent work on the molecular genetics of complex traits in typical and atypical human development has focused primarilyon associations of single genes with behavior. Disparate literature suggests that the presence of one or two copies of the short allele of the serotonin transporter (5-HT7) gene and the long allele (7-repeat allele) version of the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) gene predicts internalizing- and externalizing-related behaviors, respectively. Apparently for the first time in the extant literature, we report a gene-gene statistical interaction on behavior problems in a group of typically developing children at age 7. DNA was extracted from buccal cells collected from 108 children and genotyped for short and long alleles of the 5-HTT gene and the short (2-5 repeats) versus long (6-8 repeats) allele of the DRD4 gene. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. As predicted, children with one or two copies of the short allele of the 5-117-T gene and the long allele version of the DRD4 gene exhibited significantly more internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 7 than children with other combinations of the 5-HTT and DRD4 short and long genotypes. As well, children with the 5-HTT long and DRD4 long genotypes had the lowest reported scores on internalizing and externalizing behaviors at age 7, suggesting that the presence of the 5-HTT long genotype may serve as a protective factor against these behaviors in children with the long DRD4 genotype. Implications of these findings for understanding cumulative biological risk and protective factors in childhood behavior problems and psychopathology are discussed.

AB Recent research has found that the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene and maternal insensitivity may interact to predict externalizing behavior in preschoolers. The current study attempted to replicate and extend thisfinding in a sample of 18-30-month-old children. The current study examined two distinct dimensions of parenting (warm- responsive and negative- intrusive) as predictors of childhood externalizing and internalizing behavior Further race was investigated as a moderator of gene -environment relationships. Results revealed that high warm-responsive parenting was associated with decreased externalizing behavior only for African American children possessing the short polymorphism of DRD4. The data indicate that children may be differentially susceptible to different aspects of parenting depending on their genotype, and it is important to consider differences in racial composition when studying these relationships.

AB To determine the optimal time for testing the association between personality traits and cortisol levels, and the number of sampling days needed for reliable results to be obtained for preschool-aged children, ambulatory salivary sampling for cortisol was performed on 39 preschoolers at four different times for 10 consecutive school days. A repeated-measure ANOVA revealed a significant day effect, time effect, and day by time interaction. Further tests of day effect revealed that within-subject cortisol levels differed significantly in the early morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon cortisol data, but not in the late morning; group average levels of cortisol assessed in the early mornings are significantly different among the days, so are the ones measured in early and late afternoon. Midafternoon cortisol levels showed the most significant day effect and the highest correlation with internalizing disposition. In addition, the probability of finding significant correlations between cortisol levels and internalizing disposition increased with a greater number of aggregated cortisol measures. The tentative conclusion is that to avoid under- representation of the correlations between cortisol levels and personality variables, both sampling time selection and data aggregation are important.

AB The authors examined the relations of maternal supportive parenting to effortful control and internalizing problems (i.e., separation distress, inhibition to novelty), externalizing problems, and social competence when toddlers were 18 months old (n = 256) and a year later (n = 230). Mothers completed the Coping With Toddlers' Negative Emotions Scale, and their sensitivity and warmth were observed. Toddlers' effortful control was measured with a delay task and adults' reports (Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire). Toddlers' social functioning was assessed with the Infant/Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment. Within each age, children's regulation significantly mediated the relation between supportive parenting and low levels of externalizing problems and separation distress, and high social competence. When using stronger tests of mediation, controlling for stability over time, the authors found only partial evidence for mediation. The findings suggest these relations may be set at an early age.

AB OBJECTIVE - Ancedotally, parents report behavioral changes in their diabetic children who have fluctuating blood glucose levels. This study aimed to test associations between intercurrent glycemia and child behavior in an ambulant setting.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Prepubertal children attending the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with type I diabetes received glycemic assessment and simultaneous behavioral assessment on two occasions 6 months apart. Subjects wore a continuous glucose monitor over a 72-h period, and parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children at the two study time points.
   RESULTS - There was a high correlation between intra-individual externalizing and internalizing behavior scores (r = 0.88, P < 0. 001 and r = 0.81, P < 0.001, respectively) at the two time points. Mean blood glucose (MBG) was significantly associated with the mean externalizing behavior score (beta = 1.7 [95% CI 0.6-2.8], adjusted r(2) = 0.088). Percentage of time in the normal (r = - 0.2 [-0.3 to -0.5], adjusted r(2) = 0.068) and high (r = 0.2 [0.07-0.3], adjusted r(2) = 0.089) glycemic ranges were significantly associated with the mean externalizing behavior score. For every 5% increase in time in the normal glycemic range, there was a decrease in the externalizing behavior score of 1.0, and for every 5% increase in time in the high glycemic range there was an increase in the externalizing behavior score of 1.0. There was no significant, association between MBG and the mean internalizing behavior score.
   CONCLUSIONS - Externalizing behaviors were associated with intercurrent glycemic status. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the mechanisms of this association and how it might impact ultimate diabetes outcomes.

AB Objective: To investigate the specificity of the association between internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression) and atopic disorders (asthma, allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and atopic dermatitis) in a child and adolescent psychiatric clinical sample. Method: A sample of 184 youths was evaluated for current DSM-IV psychiatric disorders (clinical interview) and lifetime history of atopic disorders (parent report and chart review) in a. child and adolescent psychiatry clinic from September 1, 200 1, through December 31, 2002. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the differential likelihood of having a lifetime history of atopic disorders among psychiatrically ill youths with and without internalizing disorders. Results: Youths with internalizing disorders were significantly more likely than those with non internalizing disorders to have a lifetime history of atopic disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% Cl = 1.02 to 3.73, p =.04). Moreover, analyses distinguishing youths with "pure" internalizing disorders from those with comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders, "pure" externalizing disorders, and other psychiatric disorders showed that the association with atopic disorders was specific for "pure" internalizing disorders only (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.09 to 5.30, p =.03). Conclusions: Atopic disorders may be associated specifically with "pure" internalizing disorders in psychiatrically ill youths. Additional studies are needed to identify the underlying mechanisms of this specificity for the subsequent development of effective treatment and prevention interventions that target both disorders.

AB This study compared parents' ratings of behavioral and emotional problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 199 1; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) for general population samples of children ages 6 to 16 from 31 societies (N = 55,508). Effect sizes for society ranged from.03 to.14. Effect sizes for gender were <=.0 1, with girls generally scoring higher on Internalizing problems and boys generally scoring higher on Externalizing problems. Effect sizes for age were <=.0 1 and varied across types of problems. Total Problems scores for 19 of 31 societies were within I SD of the overall mean of 22.5. Bisociety correlations for mean item scores averaged.74. The findings indicate that parents' reports of children's problems were similar in many ways across highly diverse societies. Nonetheless, effect sizes for society were larger than those for gender and age, indicating the need to take account of multicultural variations in parents' reports of children's problems.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether Learning Sobriety Together, a treatment for substance abuse that combines behavioral couples therapy and individual counseling, had comparable secondary benefits on the internalizing and externalizing behaviors of adolescent versus preadolescent siblings living in homes with their alcoholic fathers (N = 13 1) and their non-substance-abusing mothers. During a 17-month assessment period, the association between parents' functioning (i.e., fathers' drinking as determined by percentage of days abstinent and parents' dyadic adjustment) and children's adjustment (as rated by mothers, fathers, and children's teachers) was stronger for preadolescents than for their adolescent siblings, particularly in terms of children's externalizing behaviors. Interventions that reduce paternal drinking and improve couple functioning may serve as an important preventative intervention for preadolescents in these homes, whereas adolescents may need more intensive interventions to address internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

ID MARITAL CONFLICT; PRESCHOOL; INFANTS; RISKS
AB Associations between interparental conflict and the development of temperament characteristics have seldom been addressed; moreover, studies on the impact of interparental conflict on developing behavior problems in infancy and early childhood are relatively rare. The authors therefore aimed to contribute to the study of these issues. A sample of 64 families was investigated longitudinally. At the infant age of 4 months, negative emotionality was measured with a laboratory routine. When infants were 4, 8, and 12 months old, maternal sensitivity was assessed during home observations, and interparental conflict was measured by means of questionnaires. When infants were 30 months old, behavioral inhibition was measured in 2 laboratory fear episodes, and behavior problems were assessed with a structured clinical interview of the primary caregiver. Interparental conflict and infant negative emotionality were significantly and independently associated with subsequent behavioral inhibition. The association of interparental conflict with behavior problems was moderated by infant negative emotionality. Infants high in negative emotionality developed more serious behavior problems when exposed to high interparental conflict, whereas the association was not significant in infants low in negative emotionality.

   QUESTIONNAIRE; VALIDATION
AB This study examined coping predictors of laboratory-induced pain tolerance, intensity, and unpleasantness among 244 healthy children and adolescents (50.8% female; mean age, 12.73 +/- 2.98 years; range, 8-18 years). Participants were exposed to separate 4-trial blocks of pressure and thermal (heat) pain stimuli, as well as 1 trial of cold pain stimuli. Strategies for coping with pain were measured using the Pain Coping Questionnaire (PCQ). Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between the 8 PCQ subscales and pain responses (pain tolerance, intensity, and unpleasantness) to all 3 pain tasks, controlling for age and sex. We found that internalizing/catastrophizing predicted higher pain intensity across the 3 pain tasks and higher cold pain unpleasantness; seeking emotional support predicted lower pressure pain tolerance; positive self-statements predicted lower pressure pain intensity and lower cold pain intensity and unpleasantness; and behavioral distraction predicted higher pressure pain tolerance and lower heat pain unpleasantness. These results suggest that in healthy children, internalizing/catastrophizing, and seeking emotional support may be conceptualized as pain-prone coping strategies, and positive self-statements and behavioral distraction as pain-resistant coping strategies within the context of laboratory pain.
   Perspective: These results support investigation of interventions with children that aim to reduce acute pain responses by modifying coping to reduce seeking of emotional support and catastrophizing and enhance the use of positive self statements and behavioral distraction.

AB Examined the concurrent validity of the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) module of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, Child and Parent versions (ADIS-C/P). One hundred eighty-four clinic-referred children were categorized into three ADIS-generated groups: No diagnosis of ADHD (No ADHD; n = 63), parent-only diagnosis of ADHD (Parent Only; n = 81), and parent plus child diagnosis of ADHD (Parent + Child; n = 40). The groups were compared on demographics, comorbid diagnoses, parent and child-report measures, and a computerized test of attention. Results support the concurrent validity of the ADIS ADHD module and highlight the positive relationship between internalizing symptomatology and parent-child agreement on ADHD diagnoses. The clinical implication of this study is that parent-child agreement on ADHD may serve as a marker of internalizing symptomatology. Future research on child self-perceptions is suggested in developing treatments for this internalizing ADHD group.

AB The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; A. T. Beck, R. A. Steer, & G. K. Brown, 1996) was administered to 164 biological mothers of sexually abused children to determine the psychometric characteristics of the BDI-II and to estimate the prevalence of self-reported depression in this population. The study also sought to ascertain whether the mothers' BDI-II total scores were correlated with various psychosocial characteristics of the mothers and their children. It was found that there was only one dimension underlying the 21 BDI-II responses, and the internal consistency of the BDI-II total scores was high. Twenty-six percent of these mothers had scores indicative of clinical depression. The mothers' BDI-II total scores were significantly correlated with their husbands' or paramours' having sexually abused their children and their ratings of the children's internalizing behaviors. These results were discussed as supporting the use of the BDI-II with mothers of sexually abused children to measure self-reported depression.

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that targeted both anxious and aggressive behaviors in children with anxiety disorders and comorbid aggression by parent report. Method: The effects of a cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention targeting comorbid anxiety and aggression problems were compared with a standard cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention targeting anxiety only. The study was conducted over a period of 2 years, and 69 families were included, with participating children ranging in age from 8 to 14 years. Intervention effects were evaluated at posttreatment and 3 months following treatment. Results: An intent-to-treat analysis identified few significant differences between conditions in level of improvement following treatment and at follow-up, with the exception of parent-reported stress, anxiety, and depression, which improved in the anxiety treatment condition. Both treatment programs led to significant reductions in parent-reported child externalizing and internalizing problems and child-reported internalizing problems and to improved parenting practices. Conclusions: Comorbidity did not appear to significantly affect treatment outcome for anxiety disorders, and combining existing treatments to address comorbid problems did not enhance treatment effectiveness. Further trials are required to assess the effectiveness of an expanded combined treatment program that allows adequate time to address both internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Objective: To study associations between comorbid psychopathology and long-term outcomes in a large birth cohort sample from age 8 to early adulthood. Method: The sample included long-term outcome data on 2,556 Finnish boys born in 1981. The aim was to study the impact of early childhood psychopathology types (externalizing versus internalizing versus both) and informant sources (self-report versus parent/teacher reports) on young adult outcomes, based on data from a military registry of psychiatric diagnosis, a police registry on criminal and drug offenses, and self-reported problems in late adolescence and early adulthood. Results: Children with combined conduct and internalizing problems at age 8 had the worst outcomes and highest risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders, criminal offenses, and self-reported problems at follow-up, with 62% of these boys manifesting psychiatric disorders, committing criminal offenses, or both at follow-up. Although these children included only 4% of the sample, they were responsible for 26% of all criminal offenses at follow-up. In contrast, children with conduct problems without internalizing problems and those with attention problems had much less severe but nonetheless elevated levels of risk of antisocial personality disorder and criminal offenses. Long-term outcomes for these two groups were substantially better than for children with combined conduct and internalizing problems. Children with "pure" emotional problems had an elevated risk only of similar emotional problems at follow-up. Conclusions: The subjective suffering and long-term burden to society is especially high among children with comorbid conduct and internalizing problems in childhood. A major challenge for child and adolescent psychiatric, education, and social services is to develop effective intervention strategies focusing on these children. Additional longitudinal epidemiological studies of this comorbidity group are needed, and, if replicated, such findings will have important implications for future diagnostic classification systems (DSM-V).

AB Diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults requires retrospective assessment of ADHD symptoms in childhood. The Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS) and its German validated version (WURS-k) may offer a helpful tool to a certain relevant childhood problems associated with ADHD. Up to now validating data of the WURS-k were limited to male population. In a population of 69 female adult ADHD patients and 97 controls, ROC analysis indicated a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 92% at a cut-off of 30 points in the WURS-k. This cut-off value is equivalent to those of males.
   Symptom report varies significantly by gender and females describe more internalizing problems while males report more externalizing behaviour. Regarding different sub-types according to DSM-IV males and females did not differ in the items of the WURS-k.

AB OBJECTIVE. Although cerebellar hemorrhagic injury is increasingly diagnosed in infants who survive premature birth, its long-term neurodevelopmental impact is poorly defined. We sought to delineate the potential role of cerebellar hemorrhagic injury in the long-term disabilities of survivors of prematurity.
   DESIGN. We compared neurodevelopmental outcome in 3 groups of premature infants ( N = 86; 35 isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury, 35 age-matched controls, 16 cerebellar hemorrhagic injury plus supratentorial parenchymal injury). Subjects underwent formal neurologic examinations and a battery of standardized developmental, functional, and behavioral evaluations ( mean age: 32.1 +/- 11.1 months). Autism-screening questionnaires were completed.
   RESULTS. Neurologic abnormalities were present in 66% of the isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury cases compared with 5% of the infants in the control group. Infants with isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury versus controls had significantly lower mean scores on all tested measures, including severe motor disabilities ( 48% vs 0%), expressive language ( 42% vs 0%), delayed receptive language ( 37% vs 0%), and cognitive deficits ( 40% vs 0%). Isolated cerebellar hemorrhagic injury was significantly associated with severe functional limitations in day-to-day activities. Significant differences were noted between cases of cerebellar hemorrhagic injury versus controls on autism screeners ( 37% vs 0%) and internalizing behavioral problems ( 34% vs 9%). Global developmental, functional, and social-behavioral deficits were more common and profound in preterm infants with injury to the vermis. Preterm infants with cerebellar hemorrhagic injury and supratentorial parenchymal injury were not at overall greater risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities, although neuromotor impairment was more severe.
   CONCLUSIONS. Cerebellar hemorrhagic injury in preterm infants is associated with a high prevalence of long-term pervasive neurodevelopment disabilities and may play an important and underrecognized role in the cognitive, learning, and behavioral dysfunction known to affect survivors.

AB Factor analyses of Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC) parents' and teachers' questionnaires have supported the multidimensional theory of human behavior. The goal of this study was to analyze the dimensional structure of the BASC parents and teachers Spanish version questionnaires. In order to do this, a randomized sample of 1.176 children aged 6 to 11 years old, from the schools of Manizales City (Colombia), was selected. BASC parents and teachers questionnaires were administered to the participants. The results show that BASC parents had two dimensions: clinical and adaptive, KMO = 0,87, which explained 64% of the variance. BASC teachers had two clinical dimensions: externalizing (factor 1) and internalizing (factor 3), and he adaptive dimension was the factor 2 (75,2% of the variance). KMO was 0,90.

TI Assessment of the adolescent behavior with Achenbach's Scales; Is there
   a concordance 33 between different informants?
SO SALUD MENTAL

DT Article

AB Introduction
   Behavioural problems in adolescents are thought to be relevant as strong predictors for the detection of other psychological disorders. For this reason and due to the importance they present by themselves, carrying out an adequate assessment of them is fundamental. Mental health professionals have diverse opinions about the value and importance of the different informants. The majority choose of their sources according to the disorder and necessities of each evaluator. On the other hand, the need to obtain data about adolescents' functioning from multiple resources has been emphasised and numerous reasons have been exposed. Concretely, the fact of carrying out the most objective and complete evaluations as possible has been considered essential in those studies aimed at evaluating behavioural alteration in adolescents. For this reason, Achenbach developed three versions of his scale: one for the parents, another for the teachers and a third one for the adolescents themselves. Numerous investigations have studied the concordance between groups of informants about different behavioural alterations in adolescents, but none have carried out a complete analysis of all informants in all subscales (not only the total ones). For this reason, the current study has been developed with the aim of contributing to obtain an enriching vision for the professional in the field.
   Objectives
   a) To systematically explore agreement patterns between adolescents, teachers and parents who inform of behavioural problems in adolescents in the general population and b) in those cases in which no agreement is found, to analyse the level of disagreement between each pair of informants for each subscale.
   Methodology
   Cross-sectional and descriptive study.
   Participants. The study was formed by 160 triads of parents, teachers and 13-16 year old adolescents selected from several schools in Barcelona.
   Instruments. The three forms of the Achenbach scale behavioural alterations were applied, The scale was translated into Spanish by the Unit of Epidemiology and Diagnostic in Psychopathology of the Development of the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona: Youth Self-Report, self-evaluated, Child Behaviour Checklist/4-18 and Teacher's Report Form, both heteroevaluated and completed by parents and teachers, respectively. These three forms contain a 89-item set that evaluates the same behaviour, where eight items are organised in scales of syndromes derived empirically and which are invariant throughout informants. The eight subscales are: withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. Some of them are grouped in second order factors: the first three in internalising, the last two in externalising, and the rest of them provide a total problems punctuation.
   Statistical procedure. Agreement values were analysed for each pair of informants and each subscale through the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). A value below 0.40 indicates low concordance. In these cases, the statistical analysis proceeds with the discordance analysis by pairs of informants and for each subscale through the Bland Altman Method.
   Results A low concordance (below 0.40) between informants was found especially in internalizing scales (0.230). A slightly higher value was found in attention (0.334), aggressive behaviour (0.371), externalizing (0.357), and total subscales (0.327). Secondly, it was observed that, when informing about somatic complains, thought and attention problems, internalising items and the total scale, parents reported more alterations, followed by adolescents and teachers. Also, parents indicated more withdrawal problems in adolescents, although in this case they were followed by teachers and adolescents themselves. Finally, in the evaluation of the anxiety/depression scales, social problems, delinquent behaviour, aggressiveness and externalising conducts, adolescents informed of more alterations followed by their parents, and then by the teachers. Regarding the agreement/disagreement variability throughout the scales scores, the discordance between different informants was higher when the punctuation was further away from normality, generally when the scales were scored higher.
   Discussion
   The normative criteria of comparison and the reference frames for each group of informants are different. For instance, the fact that teachers report less behavioural alterations could be explained because of their familiarity in dealing with adolescents and a higher tolerance towards some behaviors. In general terms, this result fits in with most conclusions from investigations carried out in this field. On the other hand, the fact that parents inform of more internalising problems could be attributed to adolescent behaviour which would in turn alter the family context. Another explanation might be that parents are on the whole more implicated and more sensitive in detecting certain conducts or behavioural alterations in their offspring. In any case, it is disputable whether the lack of concordance between the different informants does really exist or, on the contrary, adolescent behaviour changes depending on the context. Finally, a result contradicting those found in the studies reviewed is that adolescents are the ones who report more externalising problems. Other authors have found that adolescents inform more about internalising problems, something which should be expected taking into account that they are the ones who know themselves better. This could be possibly explained by the presence of more social desirability/undesirability among the adolescents of our sample in front of their pair group when answering to the evaluation scales; this may be due to the group context in which the case was applied. The main limitation of the present study that it was carried out with a general population sample, although from another point of view this may be considered as a gain of the study. We recommend carrying out explicative studies about discordance, which could clarify the predictive validity of each informant group and make variations in the type of sample under study.
   Conclusions
   Data from different sources contribute with specific information of relative validity. This is why a multidimensional, multisituational and mulitiinformant approach is fundamental. This is necessary not only to evaluate behavioural alterations in adolescents within a research context, but also when taking diagnostic decisions in a clinical context, because, depending on the chosen informant,the diagnostic criteria for one disorder or another might change. Also, our results imply that there may be an underdetection of behavioural problems in adolescents by the adults, which would result in a lower psychological demand than the necessary.

AB Objective Prevalence of behavioural and emotional problems in primary school children was examined 4 years after a baseline survey at preschool age. The scope of symptoms was investigated. Due to anonymity of data only group differences between the two measurements were reported. Method A representative sample of 1,481 children in fourth year primary school was assessed with the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). In addition to the CBCL broadband groups of internalizing (INT) and externalizing symptoms (EXT) a third group of combined internalizing and externalizing symptoms (COM) was defined. Results The 6 month prevalence of child mental health problems at second wave was 18% - a significant increase on the previous baseline rate of 12.4%. Of those 18% of children with child mental health problems 27.3% had exclusively internalizing, 6.0% externalizing symptoms and 52.4% had combined symptoms of INT and EXT. Conclusion The increasing prevalence was associated with an increase of symptoms of the broadband groups INT and COM but not EXT. The results also highlight an age and gender specific vulnerability of boys, both at preschool and primary school.

AB The current study examined the initial psychometrics of the Early Childhood Behavior Problem Screening Scale (ECBPSS; Epstein & Nelson, 2006), namely the factor structure and associated internal consistency of factor items of parent and teacher versions as well as interrater reliability. Data came from samples of preschool- and kindergarten-age children from 2 medium-size cities in the U.S. midwest. Separate analyses of the parent and teacher data revealed internalizing and externalizing factors, with Cronbach's alphas ranging from.83 to.95. Parent and teacher interrater reliability coefficients ranged from.32 to.37. Overall, the results suggest that the 12-item ECBPSS Parent and Teacher forms may be useful for screening young children who may be at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders.

AB This study applies the family-systems concept of differentiation (the balance of autonomy-granting and connectedness) to another primary system of adolescent development-school. This study assessed the relationships among levels of family and school differentiation to the externalizing and internalizing behaviors, peer group membership, and academic achievement of 693 middle and high school students. High levels of family and school differentiation were correlated with all measures of well-being. Individuals in the low-low matched differentiation group had the lowest academic achievement, whereas individuals in the high-high matched differentiation group had the highest academic achievement. Students in the mismatched group, who had high differentiation with parents, but low differentiation with school, had lower grade point averages, higher school absences, and higher disciplinary actions than those in the mismatched group with high school differentiation and low parent differentiation.

AB Smoking is a highly addictive behaviour, often initiated during adolescence. It is suggested that smoking is associated with behavioural and emotional problems. This study aims to assess the impact of psychosocial problems on smoking initiation and vice versa.
   Method: We obtained data on self-reported psychosocial problems and smoking of adolescents at the age of 13 years and 2 years later. The baseline questionnaire was completed by 1789 students. 68% of the baseline questionnaire could be linked to a questionnaire of the second measurement.
   Results: 15% smoked at baseline and 29% two years later. Respectively 8% and 9% had a clinical Externalizing problem score or a clinical Internalizing problem score at baseline, 14% had these problems two years later. Externalizing problems at baseline predicted the onset of smoking two years later. Internalizing problems only predicted smoking among girls. This association between psychosocial problems and smoking is most obvious for the onset of regularly smoking and less for the onset of experimenting. Reversibly smoking at baseline is only associated with the onset of externalizing problems two years later.
   Conclusion: Clinical Externalizing and Internalizing problems make the initiation of regular smoking more likely. The effects on experimental smoking are less obvious. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has been recognized as a disabling condition with a significant impact on the neurobehavioral functioning of affected individuals, including cognition, behavior, and academic functioning, but little research has been performed on targeted interventions for these children.
   Methods: A socio-cognitive habilitative program focused on improving behavior and math functioning in children 3 to 10 years of age (n=61) was developed and evaluated. The intervention provided parental instruction on FAS, advocacy, and behavioral regulation via workshops and interactive math tutoring with children. All families received parental instruction and were then randomly assigned to either the math instruction or standard psychoeducational care groups.
   Results: Satisfaction with workshops was very high, with over 90% agreeing that trainers were knowledgeable and materials easy to understand and helpful. Significant gains in knowledge were found for information provided in the instructional groups. At posttesting, caregivers reported fewer problem behaviors on the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Internalizing Problem Behavior, Externalizing Problem Behavior, and Total Problem Behavior summary scales. After 5 months, both groups of children demonstrated gains in math knowledge but significantly higher gains were found in the group receiving direct math instruction. The math treatment group was also more likely to demonstrate a gain of over 1 standard deviation on any of the 4 math outcome measures used.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that parents of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FAS(D)) benefit from instruction in understanding their child's alcohol-related neurological damage and strategies to provide positive behavioral supports and that targeted psychoeducational programs may be able to remediate some of the math deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

AB This study examined the role of family environment for young adult burn survivors making the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Ninety-three young adults who sustained large burns as children were asked to describe their families using the Family Environment Scale (FES). When examining the difference between burn survivors and the normative sample of the FES, burn survivors did not perceive their current family environment different than the normative group. However, burn survivors endorsed more items in the areas of achievement orientation and moral-religious emphasis, and less involvement in intellectual-cultural activities. We also examined the relationship between family characteristics on the FES and psychological adjustment of burn survivors as measured by the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR). Increased conflict on the FES was positively associated with YASR total problem score, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors. In addition, participation in recreational and social activities and organization both inversely correlated with YASR total problem score. In conclusion, increased family conflict was associated with decreased psychological adjustment of burn survivors as measured by the YASR total problem score. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB Although childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has been linked to risk for delinquency, research is limited on the potential pathways from CSA to subsequent delinquent outcomes. A total of 160 youth with confirmed CSA histories were interviewed at the time of abuse discovery, when they were 8 to 15 years of age, and again I and 6 years later The findings supported the proposed relations from stigmatization following the abuse (abuse-specific shame and self-blame attributions) and internalizing symptoms to subsequent delinquency through anger and affiliation with deviant peers. This longitudinal research suggests that clinical interventions for victims of CSA must be sensitive to these affective and cognitive processes and how they affect delinquent activity.

AB Background Internalizing psychopathology, anxiety in particular, is assumed to contribute to the development of gender Identity disorder (GID). Until now, anxiety has only been reported in studies using parent-report questionnaires; physiological correlates of anxiety have not been studied. In this study we assessed anxiety and stress in children with GID by measuring their cortisol, heart rate (HR) and skin conductance levels (SCL) and asking them to repeat their moods and experience of control. Methods By using an established psychological challenge, involving provocation and frustration, we investigated whether children with GID as compared to healthy controls react in a more anxious way under these experimental circumstances. We assessed anxiety levels in 25 children with GID and 25 matched controls by measuring cortisol, HR and skin conductance and examined whether a pattern of increased physiological activity corresponded with the feeling of being less in control and having more intense negative emotions. Results The results showed that children with GID had more negative emotions and a tonically elevated SCL. There were no differences between the groups in cortisol and HR. Conclusion This is the first study that shows that children with GID have a more anxious nature as compared to their normal counterparts.

AB This study examined patterns of behavioral and emotional responses to conflict and cooperation in adolescents with anxiety/mood disorders and healthy peers. We compared performance on and emotional responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game, an economic exchange task involving conflict and cooperation, between adolescents with anxiety/depressive disorders (A/D) (N=21) and healthy comparisons (n = 29). Participants were deceived to believe their co-player (a pre-programmed computer algorithm) was another study participant. A/D adolescents differed significantly from comparisons in patterns of play and emotional response to the game. Specifically, A/D participants responded more cooperatively to cooperative overtures from their co-players; A/D girls also reported more anger toward co-players than did comparison girls. Our findings indicate that A/D adolescents, particularly females, respond distinctively to stressful social interchanges. These findings offer a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying social impairment in youth with internalizing disorders.

AB This study aimed to assess the prevalence of war experiences and the use of specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies in response to these experiences among 294 formerly abducted adolescents at three rehabilitation centres in Uganda. Cognitive strategies were measured by Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Symptoms of psychopathology were measured by the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IES-R) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Relationships were studied by means of descriptive statistics, correlations and Multiple Regression Analyses. Strong relationships were found between specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies and posttraumatic stress (PTS), Internalizing and Externalizing symptoms. The results may have implications for intervention strategies. (c) 2006 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, the authors investigated whether there was evidence of intraindividual stability in behavior problems over time as well as whether children with higher levels of behavior problems at 24 months and more rapid increases in behavior problems prior to school entry performed more poorly on 1st-grade tests of cognitive ability and achievement than their peers. Three findings were noteworthy. First, there was evidence of both intraindividual and interindividual variability in behavior problems between 24 months and 1st grade. Second, children with higher initial levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors at 24 months had lower cognitive ability and achievement scores in 1st grade. Finally, children with more rapid increases in internalizing behaviors over time had lower cognitive ability scores in 1st grade; this association did not exist for externalizing behaviors. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB Objective This study assessed psychometric properties of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/1.5-5) and explored clinical insights from its use in a sample of adopted Chinese girls. Methods Parental ratings were obtained on 707 adopted Chinese girls, ages 1.50-5.92 years (M = 3.24, SD = 1.26). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), employing robust weighted least squares estimation, was used to evaluate the instrument's seven-factor correlated structure. Profiles of scores were analyzed descriptively for clinical insights. Results The CFAs indicated that the fit of Achenbach and Rescorla's (2000 Manual for the ASEBA preschool forms & profiles. Burlington, VT: University of Vermont, Research Centre for Children, Youth, & Families) model to the data obtained from the adopted Chinese girls was acceptable using either a 2-point response scale or the original 3-point response scale for the 67 items from which the seven syndromes or correlated factors are derived. Values for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) for the 2-point and 3-point response scales were .049 and .053, respectively. The RMSEA of .049 for the model using the dichotomously scored items was slightly better than what Achenbach and Rescorla (2000) reported for the same model (.06). Conclusions The study provides additional evidence of the factorial validity of the CBCI/1.5-5 and supports its use with Chinese girls adopted into North American families. While the Chinese girls showed similar or better behavioral adjustment, compared to a reference group from the CBCL's normative sample, they tended to manifest higher levels of sleep problems.

AB Purpose: The association between language delay and behavior problems in toddlers was examined in 2 studies, 1 conducted in a developmental clinic in New Jersey. (Study 1; N = 83) and the other conducted in a developmental clinic in New York (Study 2; N = 103).
   Method: in both clinics, parents of 18- to 35-month-olds completed the Language Development Survey (LDS) and the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 (CBCL). In Study 2, the Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition (PLS-A) was also administered. Neurodevelopmental delay (ND) and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) symptoms were also assessed in both studies but were done so using different measures.
   Results: In Study 1, LIDS Vocabulary score and CBCL Total Problems, Internalizing, and Withdrawn scores were significantly correlated. However, when children with ND and/or suspected PDD were excluded, only the correlation between LIDS Vocabulary and Withdrawn remained significant. In Study 2, only the correlation between LDS Vocabulary and Withdrawn approached significance. Children delayed in language on the PLS-4 had higher CBCL scores than typically developing toddlers only on the CBCL Withdrawn syndrome.
   Conclusion: Significant associations between language delays and behavior problems were not found in 2 samples of 18- to 35-month-olds when children with ND and PDD were excluded, except that toddlers with language delays appeared to show elevated social withdrawal relative to typically developing toddlers.

AB This study evaluated effects of the Iowa Strengthening Families Program, a family-focused universal preventive intervention, on growth patterns of adolescent internalizing (anxiety and depressive symptoms) and monthly polysubstance use (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, and other illicit drugs), as well as the association between internalizing and polysubstance growth factors. The sample consisted of rural Midwestern adolescents (N = 383), followed from sixth through twelfth grade. Compared to the control group, the intervention group adolescents showed a slower rate of increase in internalizing symptoms and polysubstance use. Intervention effects on internalizing symptoms were similar for boys and girls; however, girls demonstrated a higher overall level and a greater rate of increase across time. The intervention slowed the rate of increase in polysubstance use significantly more for girls than for boys, although overall levels of use were lower in the intervention group for both genders. Associations between internalizing and polysubstance use growth factors were found for girls, but not for boys, suggesting gender differences in psychosocial development.

AB Females have recently become an important population in research related to serious and violent juvenile offending. Although a small body of research exists on girls in the deep end of the system, very few studies have examined the degree of heterogeneity within high-risk female samples. This study applied latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of female juvenile offenders based on their self-report of offending profiles (N = 133). Results supported a three-class solution with subgroups characterized by patterns of 'violent and delinquent', 'delinquency only', and 'low' offending patterns. The LCA solution was replicated in an independent sample of high-risk females. The 'violent and delinquent' class was characterized by significantly higher rates of DSM-IV diagnoses for internalizing disorders, affect dysregulation, exposure to violence (within the home, school and neighborhood), and familial histories of criminality. Implications for future research, policy and clinical practice are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 33:339-352, 2007. (C)2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Objective: To examine the effect of maternal depressive symptoms on child problem behavior trajectories and how the father's positive involvement may modify this association.
   Design: Secondary data analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
   Setting: A nationally representative household sample of men and women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
   Participants: The study sample includes 6552 mother-child dyads interviewed biennially between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2002; children were 0 to 10 years old at baseline.
   Intervention: Past-week maternal depressive symptoms in 1992.
   Main Outcome Measures: Maternal self-reports of child internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed repeatedly using a modified Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Linear growth curve models indicate that the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms on child problem behavior trajectories become negligible after controlling for the father's involvement and other covariates, including the child's age, sex, and race/ethnicity; the mother's educational level; maternal age at child birth; number of children; poverty status; urban residence; and father's residential status. Positive involvement by the father was inversely associated with child problem behavior trajectories. The effects of maternal depressive symptoms on child problem behaviors varied by the level of the father's positive involvement.
   Conclusion: When the father actively compensates for limitations in the depressed mother's functioning, the child's risk of problem behaviors may be reduced.

AB Background This study examined the relationship between children's and adolescents' external (aggression or delinquent behaviour) and internal (depression and anxiety, somatic complaints or regressive behaviour) symptoms and their perceptions of parenting behaviour.
   Method Participants were 159 children (83 boys and 76 girls) aged 10-17 years and were categorized into five groups. The two experimental groups included clearly defined externalizing (n = 35) and internalizing (n = 46) children. Two sibling groups and one non-sibling group served as controls. The five groups were compared for subjective perceptions of maternal and paternal rejection, favouritism and overprotection.
   Results No effects of age or gender were found. The results revealed that compared with non-symptomatic children from different families and with non-symptomatic siblings, both internalizing and externalizing children obtained higher scores on the variables examined. Externalizing children obtained the highest scores, while internalizing children obtained intermediate scores. The sibling comparison data revealed a gap between the perceptions of symptomatic children and their siblings: symptomatic children reported negative parenting practices towards both themselves and their siblings, whereas the opposite was true of sibling reports. The reports suggest that while both internalizing and externalizing symptoms are associated with negative perceptions of the parent-child interaction, this may be particularly the case among externalizing children.
   Conclusions The importance of perceptions of reality, as opposed to objective circumstances, is discussed in the context of treatment.

AB This study used a sample of 551 children surveyed yearly from ages 6 to 13 to examine the longitudinal associations among early behavior, middle-childhood peer rejection and friendedness, and early-adolescent depressive symptoms, loneliness, and delinquency. The study tested a sequential mediation hypothesis in which (a) behavior problems in the early school years are associated with middle-childhood peer rejection and (b) rejection, in turn, leads to lower friendedness and subsequently higher adolescent internalizing-but not externalizing-problems. Results supported this sequential mediation model for internalizing outcomes and revealed an additional path from early disruptiveness to loneliness via peer rejection alone. No evidence of sequential mediation was observed for delinquency.

AB Grounded-theory analyses were used to formulate propositions regarding the processes of adolescent emotional development. Progress in understanding this difficult topic requires close examination of emotional experience in context, and to do this the authors drew on qualitative data collected over the course of a high school theater production. Participants' (ages 14-17) accounts of experiences in this setting demonstrated their capacity to actively extract emotional knowledge and to develop strategies for managing emotions. These accounts suggested that youth's repeated "hot" experience of unfolding emotional episodes in the setting provided material for this active process of learning. Youth also learned by drawing on and internalizing the emotion culture of the setting, which provided concepts, strategies, and tools for managing emotional episodes.

AB This longitudinal study investigated prospective links between social isolation and adjustment problems among 166 (77 girls, 89 boys) Finnish children ages 7 to 9. Peer nominations for social engagement and self-reports of internalizing and externalizing problems were collected in the spring of the 1st and 2nd grade. Friendship moderated prospective associations between peer and adjustment variables. Among friended children, there were no prospective associations between social isolation and either internalizing or externalizing problems. Among unfriended children, initial social isolation was positively linked to subsequent increases in internalizing and externalizing problems, and initial internalizing and externalizing problems predicted subsequent increases in social isolation. The findings suggest that friendship buffers against the adverse consequences associated with being isolated and presenting adjustment difficulties.

AB Representational strategies of emotion regulation during play are believed to protect children against behaviour problems. Yet, before the age of 4, it appears that children rely more on their attachment figure than on representational strategies to assuage distress. The study was aimed at testing whether 3-year-olds' narrative features during the Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT) could predict concurrent internalizing problems assessed by the mothers' and fathers' ratings of the child, using the Child Behaviour Checklist. Regression analyses including gender, IQ, socio-economic status and ASCT dimensions revealed that representations of supportive care-giving predicted mother-reported internalizing problems (negative association), whereas positive resolution and attachment strategies (security, deactivation, hyperactivation, disorganization) did not. Results were interpreted with reference to Bowlby's hypotheses regarding the aetiology of depression and anxiety disorders. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: This study was conducted to examine whether pediatric patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding symptoms differed in terms of clinical characteristics from pediatric OCD patients without hoarding symptoms.
   Method: Eighty children and adolescents with OCD (range, 7-17 years) completed clinician-administered and parent- and child-report measures of OCD symptom severity, impairment, and emotional and behavioral symptoms.
   Results: Twenty-one youth endorsed significant hoarding symptoms. Relative to nonhoarders, youth with hoarding symptoms had worse insight, more magical thinking obsessions, and ordering/arranging compulsions than nonhoarders, higher levels of anxiety, aggression, somatic complaints, and overall externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Higher rates of panic disorder were found in youth with hoarding symptoms although other comorbidity rates did not differ.
   Conclusions: These findings in children are partially consistent with studies in adults, and suggest that pediatric patients with hoarding symptoms may exhibit a unique clinical presentation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the interplay between interparental conflict and child cortisol reactivity to interparental conflict in predicting child maladjustment in a sample of 178 families and their kindergarten children. Consistent with the allostatic load hypothesis (McEwen & Stellar, 1993), results indicated that interparental conflict was indirectly related to child maladjustment through its association with individual differences in child cortisol reactivity. Analyses indicated that the multimethod assessment of interparental conflict was associated with lower levels of child cortisol reactivity to a simulated phone conflict between parents. Diminished cortisol reactivity, in turn, predicted increases in parental reports of child externalizing symptoms over a 2-year period. Associations between interparental conflict, child cortisol reactivity, and child externalizing symptoms remained robust even after demographic factors and other family processes were taken into account.

AB Co-ruminating, or excessively discussing problems, with friends is proposed to have adjustment trade-offs. Co-rumination is hypothesized to contribute both to positive friendship adjustment and to problematic emotional adjustment. Previous single-assessment research was consistent with this hypothesis, but whether co-rumination is an antecedent of adjustment changes was unknown. A 6-montb longitudinal study with middle childhood to midadolescent youths examined whether co-rumination is simultaneously a risk factor (for depression and anxiety) and a protective factor (for friendship problems). For girls, a reciprocal relationship was found in which co-rumination predicted increased depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased positive friendship quality over time, which, in turn, contributed to greater co-rumination. For boys, having depressive and anxiety symptoms and high-quality friendships also predicted increased co-rumination. However, for boys, co-rumination predicted only increasing positive friendship quality and not increasing depression and anxiety. An implication of this research is that some girls at risk for developing internalizing problems may go undetected because they have seemingly supportive friendships.

AB Objective. - Research on adolescent adjustment disorder (AD) is scarce. We characterized adolescent outpatients with AD in psychosocial background and treatment received compared with patients with other non-psychotic disorders (OND). Furthermore, we explored precipitant stressors, distress symptoms and behavioral problems among males and females with AD.
   Method. - Data were collected prospectively on 290 consecutive psychiatric outpatients, aged 12-22 yrs, at a secondary care clinic in Finland. DSM-III-R diagnoses were assigned, based on all available information, at the end of treatment.
   Results. - AD was the second most common diagnosis among non-psychotic patients (31 % of 290). Compared to OND-patients, those with AD were predominantly female and had less severe psychosocial impairment. In multivariate comparisons school-related stressors, problems with law and restlessness characterized males, and parental illness and internalizing symptoms females with AD. Intensity and duration of treatment of AD-patients varied widely.
   Conclusions. - Adjustment disorder comprised a common clinical entity among adolescent outpatients. Psychiatric assessment and treatment should be individually targeted by taking into account gender-specific stressors and distress symptoms among young people with AD. (C) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Background: Although parental divorce is associated with increased substance use and internalizing problems, experiencing the separation of one's parents may not cause these outcomes. The relations may be due to genetic or environmental selection factors, characteristics that lead to both marital separation and offspring functioning. Method: We used the Children of Twins (CoT) Design to explore whether unmeasured genetic or environmental factors related to the twin parent, and measured characteristics of both parents, account for the association between parental divorce and offspring substance use and internalizing problems. Results: The association between parental divorce and offspring substance use problems remained robust when controlling for genetic and environmental risk from the twin parent associated with parental divorce, and measured characteristics of both parents. The results do not prove, but are consistent with, a causal connection. In contrast, the analyses suggest that shared genetic liability in parents and their offspring accounts for the increased risk of internalizing problems in adult offspring from divorced families. Conclusions: The study illustrates that unmeasured genetic and environmental selection factors must be considered when studying parental divorce. In explaining associations between parental divorce and young-adult adjustment, our evidence suggests that selection versus causal mechanisms may operate differently for substance abuse (a causal relation) and internalizing problems (an artifact of selection). The CoT design only controls for the genetic and environmental characteristics of one parent; thus, additional genetically informed analyses are needed.

AB study explored the factor structure and developmental trajectory of effortful control (EC), its relations with child adjustment, and the moderating role of age and gender in 75 4- to 6-year-old children at risk for psychopathology. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed two subcomponents of effortful control: Suppress/Initiate (the ability to inhibit a dominant response while initiating a new response) and Motor Control (inhibiting fine and gross motor activity). EC performance improved with age, and both subcomponents were associated with greater social competence at all ages. Associations with internalizing problems were moderated by child age such that greater EC was linked to fewer problems at age 4 but did not relate to problems at ages 5 or 6.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify aspects of family relationships that may protect young children from the pathogenic effects of family violence. Using a sample of 30 preschool-age children whose mothers were physically abused by a partner, we investigated the associations between children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and: (1) the quality of the mother-child relationship, and (2) mothers' attunement to their child's sad and angry emotions. Results indicated that clinician ratings of the mother-child relationship, and mothers' attunement to their child's experience of emotion each made a unique contribution to the prediction of children's externalizing behavior. These relationships remained robust, even after taking the severity of domestic violence reported by mothers into consideration. Maternal attunement, however, did not mediate the relationship between marital conflict and children's behavior problems. No significant link was found between children's internalizing behavior and maternal attunement to their children's sadness and anger. Additional findings suggested that mothers with a PTSD diagnosis tended to be less attuned to their child's experience of sadness.

AB Objectives: To determine whether preadolescent physical abuse raises the risk of adolescent suicidal behavior, to examine potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between preadolescent abuse and adolescent suicidality, and to examine whether distal (preadolescent) risk factors add to proximal (adolescent) factors in predicting suicidality. Method: Seventy-five physically abused preadolescents on the New York City Maltreatment Register and 78 controls were studied at ages 10.5 and 16.5 years. Adolescent suicidal ideation and attempts and hypothesized risk and protective factors were assessed by self-report, parent interview, and teacher ratings. Data were analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Preadolescent physical abuse was a robust, largely unmediated, independent predictor of adolescent suicidality. Only adolescent internalizing problems mediated the relationship. No risk factors moderated the relationship. Adolescent attachment to parents and internalizing problems contributed independently to the prediction of suicidality risk in abused and control subjects. No preadolescent risk or protective factors added to the predictions beyond risk deriving from preadolescent abuse. Conclusions: The association between preadolescent physical abuse and adolescent suicidality is largely unmediated and unmoderated by well-documented risk factors for suicidality. Therefore, comprehensive interventions to reduce abusive parenting must begin when families enter the child protection system, along with therapeutic interventions with the children and adolescents themselves.

AB This panel study investigated the directionality of relations between adolescents' perceptions of their parents' psychological control and adolescents' self-reported internalizing and aggressive (physical and relational) behaviors. Data were collected from a random, community sample of 530 adolescents ages 12-19 years old at time 1, and again 2 years later. Hierarchical regression analyses found that adolescents' perceptions of parents' psychological control at baseline did not predict changes in adolescents' internalizing and aggressive behaviors over 2 years but higher internalizing behavior and physical aggression at time 1 predicted increases in adolescents' estimates of their mothers' and fathers' psychologically controlling behaviors. Higher relational aggression reported by adolescents at time 1 predicted increases in their perceptions of mothers as psychologically controlling. This study provides more evidence for child effects on adolescents' ratings of their parents' psychological control than for parent effects of perceived psychological control on adolescents' behavior.

AB This study explores the relationship of parenting to internalizing and externalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant youth in the Netherlands. Interviews were conducted with 713 Moroccan immigrant parents, using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Nijmegen Rearing Questionnaire. Child rearing varied with socioeconomic status and psychological acculturation level of the parent, and gender and age of the child. In accordance with studies in Western populations, high levels of affection and monitoring were associated with low levels of problem behavior and high levels of discipline were associated with high levels of problem behavior. However, in contrast to studies in Western populations, a positive relationship was revealed between affection and discipline, and the univariate associations between discipline and problem behavior were modest. Discipline and internalizing problems were unrelated in low SES families, whereas a positive relationship was found in high SES families. The relationship between monitoring and externalizing problems was age-specific: We found a negative association for adolescents and no association for children.

Third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children (N = 670; 3 15 girls, 355 boys) completed self-report measures of friendship quality, relational and overt physical victimization, anxiety and depression. Results indicated that several aspects of positive friendship quality, including help and security, serve as effective buffers against both relational and overt victimization. These results were found for girls only and for both anxiety and depression. Results highlight the importance of positive friendship features as protective factors in the link between victimization and internalizing distress.

AB OBJECTIVES. We sought to examine the impact of a randomized, controlled trial of home visiting among infants with failure to thrive on growth, academic/cognitive performance, and home/classroom behavior at age 8.
   METHODS. Infants with failure to thrive (N = 130) or adequate growth (N = 119) were recruited from pediatric primary care clinics serving low- income, urban communities. Eligibility criteria included age < 25 months, gestational age > 36 weeks, birth weight > 2500 g, and no significant medical conditions. Evaluation included anthropometries, Bayley scales, maternal anthropometries, demographics, negative affect, IQ, and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scale. Infants with failure to thrive were treated in an interdisciplinary growth and nutrition clinic and randomized into clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention or clinical-care-only groups. The home-visiting curriculum promoted maternal sensitivity, parent-infant relationships, and child development. Follow-up visits were conducted by evaluators who were unaware of the children's growth or intervention history. At age 8, the evaluation included anthropometries, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, and the Wide Range Achievement Test, Revised. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist and teachers completed the Teacher Report Form.
   ANALYSIS. Multivariate analyses of variance were used to examine differences in growth, cognitive/academic performance, and home/school behavior, adjusted by maternal education, public assistance, and, when appropriate, infant Bayley score, maternal BMI, height, negative affect, IQ, and Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment scores.
   RESULTS. Retention was 74% to 78%. Children in the adequate-growth group were significantly taller, heavier, and had better arithmetic scores than the clinical-intervention-only group, with the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group intermediate. There were no group differences in IQ, reading, or mother-reported behavior problems. Children in the clinical-intervention-plus-home-intervention group had fewer teacher-reported internalizing problems and better work habits than the clinical-intervention-only group.
   CONCLUSIONS. Early failure to thrive increased children's vulnerability to short stature, poor arithmetic performance, and poor work habits. Home visiting attenuated some of the negative effects of early failure to thrive, possibly by promoting maternal sensitivity and helping children build strong work habits that enabled them to benefit from school. Findings provide evidence for early intervention programs for vulnerable infants.

AB OBJECTIVE. We investigated a national cohort of extremely immature children with respect to behavioral and emotional problems and social competencies, from the perspectives of parents, teachers, and children themselves.
   METHODS. We examined 11-year-old children who were born before 26 completed weeks of gestation in Sweden between 1990 and 1992. All had been evaluated at a corrected age of 36 months. At 11 years of age, 86 of 89 survivors were studied and compared with an equal number of control subjects, matched with respect to age and gender. Behavioral and emotional problems, social competencies, and adaptive functioning at school were evaluated with standardized, well-validated instruments, including parent and teacher report questionnaires and a child self-report, administered by mail.
   RESULTS. Compared with control subjects, parents of extremely immature children reported significantly more problems with internalizing behaviors (anxiety/depression, withdrawn, and somatic problems) and attention, thought, and social problems. Teachers reported a similar pattern. Reports from children showed a trend toward increased depression symptoms compared with control subjects. Multivariate analysis of covariance of parent-reported behavioral problems revealed no interactions, but significant main effects emerged for group status ( extremely immature versus control), family function, social risk, and presence of a chronic medical condition, with all effect sizes being medium and accounting for 8% to 12% of the variance. Multivariate analysis of covariance of teacher-reported behavioral problems showed significant effects for group status and gender but not for the covariates mentioned above. According to the teachers' ratings, extremely immature children were less well adjusted to the school environment than were control subjects. However, a majority of extremely immature children (85%) were functioning in mainstream schools without major adjustment problems.
   CONCLUSIONS. Despite favorable outcomes for many children born at the limit of viability, these children are at risk for mental health problems, with poorer school results.

AB External correlates of a teacher-rated typology of child adjustment developed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children were examined. Participants included 377 elementary school children recruited from 26 classrooms in the southeastern United States. Multivariate analyses of variance and planned comparisons were used to determine whether the teacher-rated behavior subtypes could be differentiated and, if so, to create more complete descriptions of each cluster. Self-perceptions of academic, social, and emotional adjustment as well as peer perceptions of behavioral attributes and social status were found to provide convergent evidence for the typology. Divergent evidence emerged related to internalizing difficulties. Parallels between the teacher-rated typology and peer-relations research were drawn. Most notably, peers rated Mildly Disruptive (MD) children as bullying and disruptive, consistent with teacher report. However, peers also rated MD children as "cool" and with high levels of social dominance and social control, consistent with recent reports of popular bullies. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Does schizotype explain the discordance among informants of adolescent

ID AGREEMENT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PARENT; POPULATION; TEACHER; RATINGS; SAMPLE
AB Introduction Behavioural alterations are a quite potent predictor for schizophrenia. Very often, apparently healthy adolescents (who will later develop schizophrenia) present altered conducts similar to those manifested by schizophrenic subjects and as predictors for the disorder.
   There are studies that describe the relationship between these behavioural alterations and the features found in schizotypical personality disorder or schizophrenic symptoms. In this way, it has been established that those subjects who obtain high scores in schizotypy present more behavioural alterations.
   Concretely, the different behavioural alterations have been differentially related to the positive and negative subtypes of the schizotypical personality, suggesting continuity between the nature of premorbid conducts and the adult symptoms patterns in which the illness develops. On the other hand, comparing adolescents that will later develop schizophrenia with those who will not, it has been found that the best schizophrenia predictor is a poor behavioural adjustment.
   Moreover, if the teachers' reports are examined, there can be certain aspects such as the early behavioural patterns which will identify children who, for instance, will develop schizophrenia thirty years later, or even differential patterns according to the gender of the subjects.
   Therefore, if we want to carry out a schizophrenia prediction according to these behavioural criteria, knowing which informants are more useful and how their opinions match among them is of a great interest. Until this moment, the majority of studies have pointed out at the ability of teachers to identify conducts that can be used to select people at risk for schizophrenia. However, having into account that numerous studies conclude that there is a lack of agreement between these and other different informants for behavioural alterations in adolescents, the importance of studying the variables that can be influencing this matter must be raised.
   Following with the line of our research group a question is raised. We wonder if the presence of schizotypical personality traits makes the adolescents behaviour more ambiguous, with the consequent difficulty to define it in a coincident way from different evaluators and from themselves.
   Objectives To analyse the influence of the schizotypical personality (assessed with the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences), the demographic variable gender and the interaction between them, in the discordance of different informants (parents, teachers and adolescents) when they inform about behavioural problems in adolescents (assessed with the Achenbach's scales).
   Methodology This is an analytic transversal stud), that can be framed into a longitudinal study of 2 cohorts from the general population, which started on 2000 and has been then followed-up ("Psychoeducation program and early detection of schizophrenic disorders of adolescent onset"). Participants. 160 triads of parents, teachers and adolescents from 13 to 16 years old selected from 7 schools of Barcelona took part in the study.
   Instruments. The three forms of the Achenbach scale for the measure of behavioural alterations were applied: Youth Self-Report, Child Behaviour Checklist/4-18 and Teacher's Report Form. These forms contain 8 scales which are invariant throughout informants: Withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. Some of them are grouped in second order factors: Internalizing, externalizing and total.
   To evaluate the psychometrical schizotypical personality of adolescents we used the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory for Feelings and Experiences. It consists of an autoadministered inventory with 159 items that includes four schizotypical scales. The Unusual Experiences scale reflects the positive dimension of schizotypy and includes items of unusual perception aberrations and magical thinking. The Introvert Anhedonia Scale reflects the negative dimension of schizotypy and consists of items assessing restricted affect, social isolation and anhedonia. The Cognitive Disorganization Scale refers to disorganized aspects of the psychosis and it is composed of items assessing difficulties in concentration and decision-making. Finally, the Impulsive Nonconformity Scale reflects the characteristics of impulsive-type personality social anxiety and maladjusted behaviours.
   Statistical proceed Multiple regression analyses were carried out in order to revise the influence of the schizotypical personality, the demographic variable gender and the interaction between them as possible explicative variables, in the discordance between different informants about behavioural problems of adolescents. The dependent variable was a measure of the level of discordance between the three groups of informants.
   Results A major discordance between informants of behavioural problems was found as schizotypy was higher. Concretely, a larger number of unusual experiences in adolescents increase the discordance for thought and internalizing problems. Discordance is also higher in aggressiveness and anxiety/depression as cognitive disorganization increases. Also, the higher the introverted anhedonia, the higher the discordance is for social problems, anxiety/depression, attention, externalizing problems, and for the total.
   To finish, a high score in non-conformity impulsivity increases the discordance for attention, delinquency and aggressive problems. About the influence of gender, discordance between informants for anxiety/depression is higher for females than for males.
   However, this varies when the interaction effects found are considered. In this way, a differential effect for the increase of non-conformity impulsivity and introvert anhedonia can be observed in males and females. Therefore, discordance between informants is higher when evaluating anxiety/depression in males when non-conformity impulsivity is high. just the opposite happens for girls. In addition, the discordance for the internalizing subscale increases just as the introverted anhedonia raises for females, but it decreases when evaluating males.
   Discussion It seems clear that no source of data can be substituted for any other when evaluating behavioural problems in adolescents and much less when attention is centred in those adolescents who score high in schizotypy.
   Specifically, when evaluating the behaviour of those subjects who score high in the positive dimension of schizotypy, the agreement between informants decreases for thought and internalizing problems; and, when the behaviour of those who are defined for a more negative schizotypy is evaluated, the agreement decreases for social problems, anxiety/depression, externalizing and total.
   Having all this into account and adding information that other authors have found related to each schizotypy subtype (which, besides, are the ones which more concordance show), some conclusions could be raised. It can be assumed as evident that schizotypical personality (and each trait type) and the subjacent conduct in these subjects can generate a difficulty in perceiving certain conducts which are not predominant in the subject, with the consequent discordance between informants. For future studies, it would be very interesting to carry out studies examined which group of informants augurs the behavioural predisposition for schizophrenia and its dimensions in the most accurately way possible.
   Conclusions A most exact and objective method to assess behavioural problems as well-demonstrated predictor to schizophrenia, is necessary in order to select vulnerable teenagers to the illness and to develop programs of early intervention.

AB Obesity is a health condition, but its consequences extend far beyond the realm of health. To illuminate an important route by which the experience of obesity can filter into the status attainment process, this study drew on nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test a social psychological model of the gendered link between obesity and education. Obese girls were less likely to enter college after high school than were their nonobese peers, especially when they attended schools in which obesity was relatively uncommon. Additional analyses revealed that increasing rates of internalizing symptoms, self-medication, and academic disengagement explained about one-third of the obese girls lower odds of college enrollment. Obese boys, on the other hand, did not differ from their peers-no matter what their school context-in college enrollment.

AB Comprehensive intervention for homeless, street living youth that addresses substance use, social stability, physical and mental health issues has received very little attention. In this study, street living youth aged 14-22 were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) or treatment as usual (TAU) through a drop-in center. Findings showed that youth assigned to CRA, compared to TAU, reported significantly reduced substance use (37% vs. 17% reduction), depression (40% vs. 23%) and increased social stability (58% vs. 13%). Youth in both conditions improved in many other behavioral domains including substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion and task oriented coping. This study indicates that homeless youth can be engaged into treatment and respond favorably to intervention efforts. However, more treatment development research is needed to address the barriers associated with serving these youth. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study explored three aspects of peer group membership in adolescence: peer group affiliation, the importance of group membership, and a sense of peer group belonging. Each is considered in relationship to adolescents' behavior problems as measured by the Achenbach Youth Self-Report. Participants included an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 733 adolescents ranging in age from 11 to 18 years. Girls reported more internalizing problems and boys reported more externalizing problems. Girls also reported a higher sense of peer group belonging than boys. When controlling for adolescent age, gender, ethnicity, parent's educational level, and family structure, a sense of peer group belonging was negatively related to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Adolescents who viewed peer group membership as very important to them and had a positive sense of peer group belonging had significantly fewer behavior problems than those who viewed peer group membership as very important but did not have a positive sense of peer group belonging.

ID KLINEFELTER-SYNDROME
AB Sex chromosomal aneuploidy is the most common disorder of sex chromosomes in humans, with an incidence of I in 400 newborns. The addition of more than one extra X and/or Y chromosome to a normal male karyotype is less frequent and has its own distinctive physical and behavioral profile. This study examines the behavioral similarities and differences in individuals with 48,XXYY compared to 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY. The participants include 11 males with 48,XXYY and 13 males with 48,XXXY and 49,XXXY. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior, the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, and the Reiss Personality Profiles, parents are asked to characterize the behavior and personality of their boys with sex chromosome tetrasomy and pentasomy. Males with 48,XXYY have higher overall adaptive scales in daily living skills, socialization, and communication compared to males with 48,XXXY and 49,XXXXY. Both groups are at risk for maladaptive behavior, although 48,XXYY males are at a higher risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. 48,XXCKY and 49,XXXXY function at a lower cognitive level and their behavior is often immature for their chronological age. Both groups display interests in helping others, but have a low tolerance for being rejected or teased. Specific recommendations and interventional strategies are provided for individuals with 48,XXYY, 48,XXXY, and 49,XXXXY. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   CONDUCT PROBLEMS; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; MISSING DATA
AB Context: Affective and anxiety disorders in early adulthood are associated with internalizing and externalizIng disorders in childhood. Previous studies have not examined whether the risk associated with childhood psychological ill health persists for midlife psychological health.
   Objectives: To examine whether childhood and adulthood psychological health are associated with midlife affective and anxiety disorders and to examine sex differences in these associations.
   Design: Data were gathered during a biomedical survey of the 1958 British Birth Cohort, a 45-year longitudinal study of 98% of births in I week in 1958.
   Setting: General population sample in England, Scotland, and Wales.
   Participants: Analyses were based on 9297 participants, 54% of the surviving sample.
   Main Outcome Measure: Diagnoses according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 1 Oth, Revision (ICD-1 0) at age 45 years for depressive episode and generalized anxiety disorder.
   Results: Internalizing and externalizing disorders at ages 7, 11, and 16 years were associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in risk for midlife anxiety and affective disorder (P <.05), whereas psychological ill health at ages 23, 33, and 42 years was associated with a 2- to 7-fold increase in risk for midlife disorder (P <.05). Early-adulthood associations were significantly stronger for men (P <.05). Type and age at onset of childhood problems did not contribute to variations in the associations with midlife disorder. Risk for midlife disorder increased significantly with the cumulative number of adulthood reports of psychological ill health (P <.001).
   Conclusions: Childhood psychological health is an important independent distal factor in adulthood psychological health. Adulthood psychological health shows stronger associations with midlife disorders, indicating a poorer prognosis for adulthood than childhood psychological ill health. Men may be more susceptible than women to the effects of psychological ill health in early adulthood on midlife disorders. Targeting prevention, recognition, and treatment efforts in early adulthood, as well as in childhood and adolescence, may significantly reduce the burden of disease.

Of the 280 children and adolescents evaluated in this clinic, 35 were diagnosed with panic disorder using a semi-structured clinical interview (K-SADS) and other objective measures. Approximately half of the youngsters with panic disorder also met criteria for the diagnosis of agoraphobia. There was extensive comorbidity between panic disorder and other internalizing and externalizing disorders. Parents reported clinically significant levels of child symptomatology on the CBCL. Teacher-and child-reported symptomatology on the CBCL was within the normal range. At the same time, it was notable that no child had been referred specifically for evaluation or treatment of panic disorder or agoraphobia. Implications for clinical assessment/identification and treatment are discussed.

AB The investigation was performed on 113 adolescents in the age between 15 and 18 years (63 boys, 50 girls). Corah Dental Anxiety Scale (CDAS) and Children's Fear Survey Schedule - Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS) were used for evaluation of dental fear and Child Medical Fear Questionnaire (CMFQ) for evaluation of the fear of medical treatment. Achenbach Youth Self Report questionnaire (YSR) was used for evaluation of emotional and behavioral problems. The tests were filled in by children. The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of dental anxiety in adolescents and to assess a cause - consequence relationship between dental anxiety and emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. The results of CDAS, CFSS-DS and CMFQ tests showed that dental anxiety scores and the total internalizing problems were higher in girls. Girls displayed more physical problems (p < 0.001) and were more prone to anxiety/depression disorders (p < 0.05). Both boys and girls were more agressive, more prone to delinquent behaviour and had more externalizing problems in comparison with the average values obtained for the Croatian population. Significant correlation coefficients for boys were calculated for age and anxiety/depression, and delinquent behaviour and aggression (p < 0.05). Significant correlations were observed between physical problems and dental anxiety measured by the CFSS-DS test (p < 0.01), and between physical problems and the total internalizing problems (p < 0.05). In girls, the CMFQ scores showed significant correlations between dental anxiety and physical problems (p < 0.05), and anxiety/depression (p < 0.01) and the total internalizing and externalizing problems (p < 0. 05). Significant correlations were calculated for age and the total internalizing and externalizing problems for boys (p < 0. 05). According to the results of both CDAS and CMFQ tests, anxiety in girls showed significant correlations with delinquent behaviour (p < 0.01). CDAS scores for girls showed significant correlations with aggression (p < 0.05) and the total externalizing problems (p < 0.01).

AB Objectives: In the assessment and treatment of persons with dental fear, there may be other psychological/behavioural factors than fear itself and traditional measures of psychopathology that should be considered. Longitudinal natural history studies are needed to find such variables. The present study investigated whether the same behavioural problem dimensions (internalizing, externalizing, attention) found among children and adolescents with behaviour management problems and/or dental fear could also be found among severely fearful adult patients. Methods: The participants were 230 consecutive adult patients applying for treatment for severe dental anxiety at a specialized clinic. Patients completed a version of the Rutter behaviour questionnaire that was adapted for adults. Comparison data were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale and self-rated anger evoked by dental fear. Background data, including dental fear, were also collected. Descriptive statistics, principal components analyses, group comparisons and correlations were calculated. Results: Of the three behaviour problems scales we adapted for adults, two (Internalizing and Attention) had acceptable psychometric properties and meaningful relations with the comparison variables. In contrast, the third problem scale (Externalizing) proved to have less satisfactory properties and relations, especially for men. Patients with severe phobia had higher levels of problem behaviours than patients with less severe phobia. Conslusion: Internalizing and Attention scales for adults seem promising for use in future prospective studies of the natural history of dental fear. The Externalizing scale, however, needs to be studied with a wider range of comparison variables and measures of social desirability.

AB Longitudinal growth patterns of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were examined in a community sample of 441 children across the ages of 2 to 5 using hierarchical linear modeling. Contextual risk was measured using five indicators (socioeconomic status. marital status, number of siblings, parent stress, parent psychopathology), and three levels of child resilience (biological, behavioral, and relational) were also assessed. Results indicate that a general pattern of decline in both types of behavior problems was observed for the entire sample across time, although considerable individual variability in this pattern was observed. Children's externalizing and internalizing behavior at age 5 was predicted by the level of risk at age 2. All three child resilience factors were also predictive of externalizing and internalizing behaviors at age 5. In the prediction of the slope of problem behavior over time, risk status interacted with both temperamental fearlessness and a mutually responsive orientation with the mother to predict the decline in externalizing and internalizing problem behavior. Results underscore the complex interactions of risk and multiple levels of resilience that are implicated in the maintenance of problem behavior over time. They highlight the importance of considering whether expected resilience factors operate similarly across different levels of risk.

AB In this study. we evaluated predictors of resilience among 8- to 12-year-old children recruited from primarily low socioeconomic status neighborhoods, 117 of whom suffered from clinical levels of conduct problems and/or depression. and 63 of whom suffered from no significant symptoms. Tests of interactions were conducted between (a) paternal antisocial behavior and maternal depression and (b) several physiological indices of child temperament and emotionality in predicting (c) children's conduct problems and depression. Both internalizing and externalizing outcomes among children were associated specifically with maternal melancholic depression, and not with nonmelancholic depression. In addition. low levels of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) among children conferred significant risk for depression, regardless of maternal melancholia, whereas high RSA offered partial protection. Furthermore, high levels of maternal melancholia conferred significant risk for child depression, regardless of paternal antisocial behavior, whereas low levels of maternal melancholia offered partial protection. Finally, low levels of electrodermal responding (EDR) conferred significant risk for conduct problems, regardless of paternal antisocial behavior, whereas high EDR offered partial protection. None of the identified protective factors offered complete immunity front psychopathology. These findings underscore the complexity of resilience and resilience-related processes, and suggest several potential avenues for future longitudinal research.

AB Background In Tourette syndrome (TS) as a neurodevelopmental disorder not only the tics but also the comorbid conditions change with increasing age. ADHD is highly comorbid with TS and usually impairs psychosocial functioning more than the tics. Its impact on further comorbidity during development is important for clinical practice and still a matter of debate. Method Aspects of developmental psychopathology considering the impact of ADHD were examined by logistic regression (year wisely) in a cross-sectional sample of children and adolescents (n = 5060) from the TIC database. Results In TS+ADHD (compared to TS-ADHD) higher rates of comorbid conditions like OCD, anxiety disorders, CD/ODD and mood disorders were found in children (510 years). In adolescents (1117 years) higher comorbidity rates in TS+ADHD remained only for CD/ODD and mood disorders. Accordingly, for OCD and anxiety disorders there was a steeper year wise increase of these comorbidities in TS-ADHD while it was a similar for CD/ODD and mood disorders in TS-ADHD as well as TS+ADHD. Conclusion Children with TS+ADHD have more comorbidities than the TS-ADHD group, whereas in both adolescent groups this did no longer hold for OCD and anxiety disorders. These findings indicate that in TS comorbid ADHD is associated with high rates of externalizing and internalizing problems, whereas TS without ADHD is associated only with internalizing problems in adolescence.

AB This study is unique in addressing developmental correlates of direct social support for young children in a high risk sample, in contrast to previous studies addressing social support for caregivers. Participants were drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study of at-risk children. Social support was rated from maternal interviews throughout early childhood. Support from the mother was assessed from mother-child observations. Outcomes included internalizing and externalizing behavior problems measured from first through tenth grades. The most common support providers were biological fathers, followed by grandparents and other providers. Using multilevel modeling, higher quantity, higher quality, and lower disruption of support predicted lower starting levels of behavior problems, controlling for support from the mother. Disruption was associated with change in slope. Gender differences were found for externalizing behavior intercepts. Social support provides a promotive factor for young high risk children. Implications include involving children's social support providers in prevention and intervention programs.

AB Families with an adolescent between the ages of 11 and 18 years participated in a study examining the relationship between parental depressive and anxiety symptomatology and parental ratings of adolescents' functioning. This study indicated that mothers, fathers, and adolescents exhibited significant cross-informant correspondence (i.e. correlations) and very few significant differences in ratings of adolescents' functioning. After controlling for demographic variables and the ratings of other informants, mothers' depressive symptomatology was a significant predictor of mothers' ratings of adolescents' internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and competence. With regard to fathers' ratings, fathers' depressive symptomatology was a significant predictor of adolescents' internalizing behavior problems and competence, whereas fathers' depressive and anxious symptomatology was a significant predictor of adolescents' externalizing behavior problems. The findings of this study suggested the importance of considering maternal and paternal depressive symptomatology when parents are asked to provide ratings of their adolescents' functioning.

AB Objective: We investigate the relations of early atypical characteristics (perinatal problems, developmental delay, and difficult temperament) and onset-age (as well as severity of) first major depressive disorder (MDD) and first internalizing disorder in a clinical sample of depressed children in Hungary.
   Method: Participants were 371 children (ages 7-14) with MDD, and their biological mothers, recruited through multiple clinical sites. Diagnoses (via DSM-IV criteria) and onset dates of disorders were finalized "best estimate" psychiatrists, and based on multiple information sources. Mothers provided developmental data in a structured interview.
   Results: Difficult temperament predicted earlier onset of MDD and first internalizing disorder, but its effect was ameliorated if the family was intact during early childhood. Further, the importance of difficult temperament decreased as a function of time. Perinatal problems and developmental delay did not impact onset ages of disorders, and none of the early childhood characteristics associated with MDD episode severity.
   Conclusions: Children with MDD may have added disadvantage of earlier onset if they had a difficult temperament in infancy. Because early temperament mirrors physiological reactivity and regulatory capacity, it can affect various areas of functioning related to psychopathology. Early caregiver stability may attenuate some adverse effects of difficult infant temperament. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the role of coping strategies, specifically negative thinking, in mediating the association of pain with symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents with sickle cell disease. Fifty-two 12-18-year-old adolescents with sickle cell disease completed a daily pain diary and paper-and-pencil measures of pain, pain coping, depression and anxiety. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were within the non-clinical range. Preliminary analyses indicated that lower family income was associated with higher reports of pain and negative thinking. Mediation regression analyses supported negative thinking as mediating the association of: (1) pain intensity with depression, and (2) pain interference with daily activities with anxiety. Findings highlight negative thinking as a factor compromising adolescents' adaptation to sickle cell pain; however, further investigation is required to determine the mediating influence of pain coping. Associations for lower income emphasize the multiple risk factors experienced by many of these adolescents.

AB Adolescent eveningness is associated with age, parental monitoring, daytime sleepiness, sleep problems, moodiness, and the use of coffee. This study investigated the association between adolescent morningness-eveningness and psychopathology, substance use, and suicidality in 1332 students ages 12 to 13. Each student-participant completed the Chinese version of the Child Morningness/Eveningness Scale (CMES), the Pubertal Development Scale, and a questionnaire about their sleep schedule, trouble sleeping, habitual substance use, and suicidality. Their mothers completed the Child Behavioral Checklist and Chinese Health Questionnaire. The morning (n = 412), intermediate (n = 740), and evening (n = 180) groups were operationally defined by the CMES t scores. The mixed model was used for data analysis. The evening group had shorter weekday sleep time, longer weekend sleep time, more daytime napping, and greater sleep compensation on weekends and was more likely than the other 2 groups to have behavioral/emotional problems, suicidality, and habitual substance use. Internalizing and externalizing problems partially explained the association between eveningness, substance use, and suicidality. The findings suggest that eveningness may be an indicator for adolescents with behavioral/emotional problems and risky behaviors and suggest an investigation for possible intervention.

AB Background: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an adrenal androgen which is stress responsive and a trigger for pubertal maturation. Studies on basal DHEA suggest protective benefits against anxiety and depression, yet it is unknown whether DHEA responsivity is protective. Methods: Structural equation modeling examined salivary DHEA responses to a public speaking task (PST) and parent-child conflict discussion paradigm (CDP) in adolescents. Results and conclusions: DHEA levels were higher in girls than boys, and in older and more physically developed adolescents, indicative of DHEA's function during pubertal maturation. DHEA levels increased during the PST, indicating responsiveness of DHEA to acute stressors. Across both tasks, girls with internalizing problems showed sharper rises in DHEA by 40 minutes post-task, ending with the highest DHEA. In internalizing adolescent girls, DHEA may serve as a marker of responsivity in stressful or conflictual contexts. A failure of these girls with internalizing problems to show a normal diurnal decline in the afternoon extended this conclusion to naturalistic environments. DHEA may be one possible mechanism linking stress responsivity and physical maturation that helps to explain adolescents' risk for psychopathology within a biobehavioral framework.

AB Few researchers have considered the influence of school context, an important construct at earlier ages, on late adolescents' college adjustment. In a sample of second-semester freshmen (N = 266), the authors explored associations between a sense of school belonging and academic and psychological adjustment. Students' reports of belonging at the university as well as in high school were both significant in predicting current academic (e.g., grades, academic competence) and psychological adjustment (i.e., self-worth, internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors), even after controlling for other important demographic and relationship factors. Last, the authors found that parental education (i.e., whether the participant was a first-generation college student) interacted with high school belonging in predicting externalizing problem behaviors.

AB Many U.S. employees with children work nonstandard hours, yet we know little about the linkages among maternal shift schedules, mothers' and fathers' parenting behaviors, and children's socioemotional outcomes. In a sample of 55 dual-earner families with children age 8 to 14 years and mothers working day versus evening shifts, the authors found that mothers' work schedules are unrelated to their parenting behaviors. However, fathers whose wives work evenings (vs. days) spend more time with children, know more about children's activities, receive more disclosures from children, and have better parenting skills, variables that are inversely associated with children's internalizing, externalizing, and risk-taking behaviors.

AB The cognitive contextual framework proposes that the emotional climate in the family plays a role in shaping how children perceive and evaluate interparental conflict. This hypothesis was tested in a sample of 144 8- to 12-year-old children and their parents. Children in families that expressed high levels of negative affect and low levels of positive affect reported greater self-blame for conflict, but parents' expressiveness did not predict children's threat appraisals. Positive and negative expressiveness moderated the association between exposure to parental conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. These data suggest that the broader family context can shape the meaning of conflict to children and increase understanding of the conditions under which parental discord leads to child maladjustment.

AB Background While parenting behaviours have direct effects on children's behavioural outcomes, other, more distal factors also may be shaping the way a mother handles parenting responsibilities. Dispositional factors are likely to be a major influence in determining how one parents. Although researchers have studied the relationships among maternal dispositional factors, parenting, and child behaviours, few studies have examined these relationships when the child is at developmental risk. Children with developmental delays evidence elevated clinical level behaviour problems, so this group is of primary interest in the search for precursors to psychopathology. The present study examined how the maternal dispositional trait of self- mastery, as well as supportive and non-supportive parenting, relate to behaviour problems in young children with and without developmental delay. Method Participants were 225 families, drawn from Central Pennsylvania and Southern California. The children, all aged 4 years, were classified as delayed ( n = 97) or non-delayed ( n = 128). The Self- Mastery Scale measured perceived level of control over life events. The Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale measured different ways parents perceive themselves as reacting to their children's distress and negative affect. The Child Behavior Checklist assessed children's behaviour problems. Results Delayed condition mothers reported significantly more child behaviour problems than non-delayed condition mothers; the two conditions did not differ in self-mastery, supportive parenting, or non-supportive parenting. Self-mastery, nonsupportive parenting reactions, and child behaviour problems all related significantly to one another. For the sample as a whole and within the delayed condition, the association between self-mastery and child behaviour problems was partially mediated by nonsupportive parenting reactions, although self-mastery was still significantly associated with problem behaviour. In the non-delayed condition, although significant relationships also were found among the variables of interest, non-supportive parenting did not have a significant main or mediation effect. Delay status moderated the relationship between negative parenting reactions and child behaviour problems, assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist Total and Internalizing scores. When mothers displayed low levels of non-supportive reactions, children in the delayed and non-delayed groups had similar levels of total problem behaviour. However, when mothers were medium or high in non-supportive reactions, children in the delayed group had much higher levels of problem behaviours than those in the non-delayed group. Conclusions The present study extended research on parental dispositional factors and parenting by measuring self-mastery as a global personality trait rather than measuring self-efficacy related specifically to childrearing. Moreover, relationships were examined for both developmentally delayed and non-delayed samples, allowing for a clearer understanding of the influences on problem behaviours in children with developmental delays. The findings support the view that parenting behaviours have a greater impact on children at developmental risk.

AB Objective To examine the factorial invariance of the Somatic Complaints subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist as a measure of Internalizing Behavior Problems across a sample of children with and without Spina bifida. Methods Multisample confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare mother and father report on the Somatic Complaints subscale across a sample of children with Spina bifida and a matched comparison sample of able-bodied children ages 8 through 11 years (N = 68 for mother report in each group; N = 54 for father report in the Spina bifida group and 53 for the able-bodied group). Results Although there were no significant between-group differences in the magnitude of factor loadings, significantly more variance in scores on the Somatic Complaints scale was unrelated to Internalizing Behavior Problems for the spina bifida group, compared to the able-bodied group. There were no between-group differences when father data were analyzed, but the latent variable of Internalizing Behavior Problems explained little variance in the Somatic Complaints scale for either group. Conclusions Maternal report of Somatic Complaints on the CBCL does not appear to measure Internalizing Behavior Problems in the same manner across groups of children with and without Spina bifida. This suggests that the Somatic Complaints subscale should be interpreted with caution when measuring Internalizing Behavior Problems within this population.

AB Objective Findings in the literature are inconsistent on the impact of congenital heart disease (CHD) on the psychological and cognitive functioning of children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to systematically review this empirical body of literature. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis to review studies on behavior problems and cognitive functioning in CHD. Results Only older children and adolescents with CHD displayed an increased risk of overall, internalizing, and to a lesser extent externalizing behavior problems. In addition, patients with severe CHD exhibited lower cognitive functioning than patients with less severe CHD, specifically with respect to performance intelligence. Moreover, decreased cognitive functioning remained relatively stable across different age groups. Conclusions Children with severe heart disease may benefit from interventions specifically targeting perceptual organizational abilities, such as visual-spatial abilities. Moreover, older children and adolescents with CHD may benefit from psychological interventions reducing anxiety symptoms and depression.

AB Objectives (a) To assess emotional triggering of pediatric asthma and ascertain its contribution to disease morbidity and functional status; (b) to test whether negative family emotional climate (NFEQ) is associated with depressive and/or anxious symptoms and emotional triggering of asthma attacks in the child. Method Children with asthma (N=272, 56% male, age 7-17) and their primary caregivers answered together an Asthma Trigger Inventory (Ritz, Steptoe, Bobb, Harris, & Edwards, 2006). Children reported on anxious (STAIC) and depressive (CDI) symptoms and on asthma-related quality of life (PAQLQ). Parent(s) reported on their child's internalizing (CBCL-I) and depressive symptoms (CDI-P). A clinician also rated the child's depression using the structured CDRS-R. Asthma diagnosis was confirmed and disease severity rated according to NHLBI guidelines by an asthma clinician. Results Path analyses indicated that NFEQ was associated with depressive symptoms, which in turn were associated both directly and indirectly (by way of emotional triggering) with disease severity. Comparison of nested models indicated the possibility of differential roles and pathways for anxious versus depressive symptoms. Conclusion Findings elucidate possible pathways of effect by which family emotional climate and child depressive symptoms may influence pediatric asthma disease severity by way of potentiating emotional triggering of asthma.

AB Concurrent, predictive, and incremental validity of global and domain-based adolescent life satisfaction reports are examined with respect to internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The Students' Life Satisfaction Scale (SLSS), Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale (MSLSS), and measures of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems from the Youth Self-Report of the Child Behavior Checklist are administered to secondary school students on three occasions, each separated by 1 year. As expected, concurrent and predictive validity correlations between the SLSS and MSLSS total scores and internalizing and externalizing behaviors are modest to moderate in magnitude, with correlations declining but remaining statistically significant across time. Results also reveal that the domain-based scores on the MSLSS (e.g., family, school) demonstrated incremental validity in relation to adolescents' global life satisfaction reports; that is, various domain-based scores contribute statistically significant variance above and beyond the variance associated with the global scores, depending on the criterion. Implications for assessments of life satisfaction among adolescents are discussed.

AB The present study examined child adjustment, experience of parenthood, and child-rearing between two types of planned lesbian families (i.e., two-mother families in which the child had been born to the lesbian relationship), vii. those with a known donor (n=42) and those with an as-yet unknown donor (n=58) (both with children between 4-8 years old). Data were collected by means of parental reports and standardized instruments were used in the questionnaires (e.g., Child Behaviour Checklist; CBCL). No differences were found on internalizing, externalizing and total problem behaviour scales of the CBCL between children with a known and a currently unknown donor, nor were differences found on parental stress and child rearing. However, social problems were more frequently reported for the children with known donors, and boys with a known donor showed more attention problems. Furthermore, annoying questions from people in their social environment as well as gossip and feelings of being excluded, were more frequently reported by mothers with a (currently) unknown donor.

AB No previous study about comorbidity of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Japan have carried out both a comprehensive investigation using a structured interview and a comparison between ADHD subtypes. The aim of the present study was to clarify the relationship between hyperactivity and disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) in ADHD by comparing a hyperactivity group (HG) with a non-hyperactivity group (non-HG). After diagnosis was carried out by strict exclusion, the 41 ADHD subjects (6-14 years old; IQ, 70-121) diagnosed according to DSM-IV were divided into HG (n = 24) and non-HG (n = 17), and compared for comorbidities and psychopathologies. This was done via semistructured interview with children and parents and questionnaires to parents and teachers. The results demonstrate that (i) most ADHD children had comorbidity (e.g. DBD or anxiety disorder); (ii) the HG had a significantly higher rate of DBD than the non-HG, but the total number of anxiety disorders was not different between subgroups, and (iii) the HG generally had more serious psychopathologies both at home and at school than the non-HG. Both groups had more serious externalizing and internalizing problems at home than at school. The present study provides evidence of a strong relationship between hyperactivity and DBD.

AB Depression and anxiety are typically measured in college samples using adult scales. However, some child and adolescent versions of internalizing symptoms may be appropriate for use with college samples. Child versions may be appropriate to use with college samples when multi-sample designs are utilized, e.g., both children and adults are assessed. To explore this possibility, 149 college students (M age=21.9 yr., SD=6.3; 43 men, 106 women) were assessed on child and adolescent versions and adult scales of anxiety, i.e., the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale and the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and depression, i.e., the Children's Depression Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory. Both sets of depression scores were highly correlated (r=.81), which suggests that the children's measure can be used in college samples. Although scores on the two anxiety scales were also significantly correlated, these scales shared less common variance. An exploratory factor analysis provided evidence that a single factor composed of all items for depression was an optimal solution. It was concluded that the Children's Depression Inventory can be used with college samples; however, the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale should not.

AB The authors tested a theoretical model of how self-control constructs are related to psychological symptomatology and variables that predispose to involvement versus noninvolvement in substance use: willingness to use, affiliation with peers who use, and efficacy for resisting use. Data were obtained from a sample of 332 children (mean age = 9.3 years) who were interviewed in households. Structural equation modeling showed that good self-control was related to more positive well-being and less externalizing symptomatology, whereas poor self-control was related to more externalizing and to more internalizing symptomatology. Externalizing had paths to willingness and peer use, well-being had inverse paths to these variables, and poor self-control had a direct effect to lower resistance efficacy. Multiple-group analyses indicated gender differences in paths from symptomatology to predisposing factors. Implications for understanding vulnerability to substance use are discussed.

AB This study modeled direct and mediated pathways linking childhood hyperactivity and substance use disorder (SUD). Boys (n = 112) were administered the revised Drug Use Screening Inventory at age 12-14 years and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV at age 22 years. Six newly derived scales having established heritability were conceptually organized into internalizing and externalizing pathways to SUD emanating from childhood hyperactivity. Hyperactivity directly predicts SUD. Neuroticism, conduct problems, and their respective manifestations of social withdrawal and school problems mediated the association between hyperactivity and SUD. Hyperactivity also predicted neuroticism that, in turn, predicted low self-esteem leading to social withdrawal and SUD. These results indicate that hyperactivity is a diathesis for both internalizing and externalizing disturbances that, in turn, portend differential expression of psychosocial maladjustment presaging SUD.

The participants were 45 children (17 girls and 28 boys) with SLI and 53 children (27 girls and 26 boys) with TL. Maternal ratings of participants' social and behavioral characteristics were obtained using the Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliott, 1990) and the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1995). Analyses of variance revealed differences between the two groups of children in all areas of social skills as well as in specific indices of internalizing behaviors, although no differences were observed for externalizing behavior. The prevalence of clinically significant difficulties was significantly high in the area of social skills but not for behavioral problems. Implications of the results are discussed.

AB The current study examined whether child-reported maternal warmth and support moderated the association between knowledge of maternal illness and child psychosocial adjustment among 86 low-income, African American mothers with HIV/AIDS and their non-infected children. Mother-child relationship quality moderated the association between children's knowledge of maternal HIV/AIDS and children's externalizing, but not internalizing, difficulties. Consistent with the stress-buffering hypothesis, a warm and supportive mother-child relationship afforded a more robust buffer against externalizing difficulties for children who knew of their mother's illness than for children who did not. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Early adolescents' (11-14 years) responses to marital hostility were examined in a sample of 416 families. The cognitive-contextual perspective and emotional security hypothesis guided the study and 9 adolescent responses were identified. Prospective associations were examined in several structural equation models that included adolescent problems as outcomes. Self-blame and perceived threat uniquely mediated the association between Year 1 marital hostility and Year 3 adolescent externalizing problems (p < .05). Self-blame, lower constructive representations, internalization of feelings, avoidance, and emotional dysregulation uniquely mediated the association between Year 1 marital hostility and Year 3 internalizing problems. Specific cognitive and emotionally based responses are important to understanding how martial hostility affects youth and need to be considered within an integrated model.

AB The aims of this study were to determine the motor outcome of extremely-low-birthweight (ELBW; <1000g) or very preterm (<28wks) children compared with normal birthweight (NBW) children, to establish the perinatal associations of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and its cognitive and behavioural consequences. Participants were consecutive surviving ELBW or very preterm children and randomly selected NBW (>2499g) children born in the state of Victoria, Australia, in 1991 or 1992. Main outcomes were: (1) results of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) at 8 years of age; (2) cognitive function; (3) academic progress; and (4) behaviour. Of 298 consecutive ELBW/very preterm survivors, 255 (85.6%;117 males, 138 females) had the MABC at a mean age of 8 years 8 months. More ELBW/very preterm children (9.5%) had DCD than the NBW group (2%, p=0.001). Only male sex increased the likelihood of DCD in ELBW/very preterm children (p=0.017). ELBW/very preterm children with DCD had worse cognitive function and academic test scores (up to 1SD below those without DCD); they also had more adaptive behaviour and externalizing problems, but not internalizing problems. DCD is more common in ELBW/very preterm children, has few perinatal correlates, and is associated with poor cognitive and academic performance as well as increased behaviour problems.

AB Research regarding the development of early academic skills among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) students has been very limited to date. Using a nationally representative sample of AIAN, Hispanic, African American, and White children at school entry, the authors used latent growth models to estimate the associations among poverty, low parental education, living in a rural location, as well as child attitudes toward learning and internalizing/externalizing behaviors, with mathematical and reading cognitive skill development across the 1st 4 years of school. Results indicate that AIAN children entered kindergarten with scores on both mathematical and reading cognitive tests that were comparable to their peers from other ethnic groups of color. Importantly, all children who entered kindergarten with lower cognitive skill scores also acquired skills more slowly over the next 4 years. Having a positive approach to learning at the start of kindergarten was associated with cognitive skill levels at school entry nearly 1 standard deviation above the population average. Results are discussed with reference to the shared early educational profiles observed between AIAN and other children of color. These findings provide a much-needed update regarding early academic development among AIAN children.

AB Objectives Based on the investigation of 144 families (144 patients affected by Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 109 partners, and 192 children) examined in three different European child and adolescent psychiatric University centres by means of questionnaires, we evaluated the prevalence of psychological symptoms in the offspring and associated risk factors such as duration and severity of the disease as well as depression of the ill and the healthy parent. Results Indicate that the severe disease of MS is associated with depression of the ill and healthy parent. Ill parents, especially ill mothers, as well as depressed ill, or depressed healthy parents evaluate their children's mental health problems with a higher prevalence within the internalizing spectrum. Healthy parents report normal psychological adjustment of their children. If two parents present a depressive state, the prevalence of relevant psychological internalizing symptoms is twice or three times as high as the age norms. Conclusion Children in families with a parent affected by MS and associated depression of the parental couple are at high risk of mental health problems, especially internalizing disorders. In focusing on the mental health of children one must also be aware of the potential opportunities to address the parents' own psychological needs.

Conversely, studies of drug abusing participants and delinquents revealed a high prevalence of ADHD comorbidity. In this study 129 young male prison inmates were systematically examined for ADHD and substance use disorders. 64,3 % showed harmful alcohol consumption. 67,4% fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for any drug abuse or dependence. 28,8% of these participants were diagnosed with ADHD, combined type, other 52,1 % showed ADHD residual type. Opioid dependence was more common in delinquents without ADHD. Addicted delinquents with ADHD showed worse social environment and a higher degree of psychopathology, including externalizing and internalizing behavior, compared to addicted delinquents without ADHD. Neuroticism and conscientiousness ratings of the addicted ADHD group, but not of those without ADHD, differed from non-addicted delinquents. The results underline the need of adequate therapeutic programs for addicted young prison inmates considering ADHD comorbidity, which is associated with additional psychopathology and social problems.

AB To examine the behavioral and emotional difficulties of 73 children and adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), mental retardation-only, and dual diagnosis (i.e., mental retardation and psychiatrically disordered) on the Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders (DSMD: Naglieri, LeBuffe, & Pfeiffer, Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders (DSMD) San Antonio, TX: PsychCorp 1994). Multivariate analyses and d-ratios were computed to assess the statistical and clinically meaningful differences between pairs of samples. The PWS sample exhibited statistically significant higher levels of psychopathology than the mentally-retarded-only sample on the Total, Externalizing, Internalizing, Attention/Delinquency, Conduct, Anxiety, and Acute Problems Scales. When compared to the dually-diagnosed sample, children with PWS Syndrome had comparable levels of psychopathology, but lower levels of depression. Results revealed that PWS represents a highly unique and complex psychological disorder with multiple areas of disturbances.

AB Background: Children's physiological reactivity was examined as a moderator of relations between parental dysphoria and child adjustment problems, addressing gaps in the study of child characteristics as risk processes. Method: One hundred fifty-seven children (86 boys, 71 girls) were assessed twice over a two-year interval. Skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR) to inter-adult argument and problem-solving tasks was observed. Results: SCLR moderated longitudinal predictions of children's internalizing, externalizing and social adjustment problems, especially for paternal rather than maternal dysphoria. Higher SCLR predicted greater vulnerability to parental depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Findings highlight that individual differences in children's physiological reactivity may relate to risk for adjustment problems in the context of parental depressive symptoms.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to determine (1) the prevalence of behavioral problems among two-year-old Pacific children living in New Zealand, (2) ethnic differences in behavioral problems, and (3) relationships between maternal and socio-demographic variables and problem child behavior. Methods: Data were gathered from the Pacific Islands Families (PIF) Study. Mothers of a cohort of 1398 Pacific infants born in Auckland, New Zealand during 2000 were interviewed when the children were two years of age. Maternal reports (1028) of child behavior were obtained using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: In the PIF cohort, 15.6% of children were in the clinical range with one or more deviant scores from the seven syndrome scales, and 14% were in the borderline range. The prevalence rate of internalizing problems was 17.1% in the clinical range and 8.9% in the borderline range. The prevalence rate of externalizing problems was 6.6% in the clinical range and 13.7% in the borderline range. The prevalence rate of total problems was 14.2% in the clinical range and 9.6% in the borderline range. Discipline and maternal education were significantly associated with elevated externalizing scores. Household size, maternal education, cultural orientation, and number of years living in New Zealand were significantly associated with internalizing scores. Child ethnicity was significantly associated with internalizing, externalizing and total problem behavior scores. In the clinical range, child ethnicity and gender were significantly associated with the prevalence of problem behavior. Conclusions: Cross-ethnicity differences in CBCL scores were found, which illustrates the diversity in the Pacific population in New Zealand. Such findings highlight the way in which preschool behavior problems may vary within specific cultural settings and underscore the need for in-depth research to explore these unique contexts.

AB The gender specificity of the relation between acculturation and problem behavior in Moroccan immigrant adolescents in the Netherlands was examined. Three previously identified classes of adolescents with similar patterns of acculturation were used: an integrated, separated, and ambivalent class. Girls with an ambivalent acculturation pattern showed more problems than the other girls on parent- and adolescent-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior. For boys, no effects of acculturation on problem behavior were found. The high number of conflicts between parents and their ambivalently acculturated daughters partly explained the relation between acculturation and problem behavior. The findings emphasized that gender and parent-child conflict should be considered when attempting to understand the complex relation between acculturation and problem behavior.

AB This study examined longitudinal predictive relationships between young children's classroom behaviors and their growth in mathematics skills during the primary grades. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort, the authors tested a longitudinal model featuring positive (interpersonal skills and approaches to learning) and negative (internalizing and externalizing) behaviors at kindergarten entry as predictors of growth in mathematics achievement through 3rd grade. Results indicated that negative behaviors demonstrate negligible relationships with early development of mathematics skills. Interpersonal skills demonstrated a small negative relationship with mathematics growth when other positive behaviors were included as predictors in the model. In contrast, approaches to learning (goal-directed behavior, persistence, organization) demonstrated small positive relationships with growth in mathematical skills and may represent a skill domain for educators to consider in designing their instructional practices.

AB Objective To test a theoretical model examining processes through which a parent-focused educational-behavioral intervention [Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment (COPEA relates to children's post-hospital adjustment problems. Methods Mothers (n = 143) and their 2-7-year-old children, unexpectedly hospitalized in two pediatric intensive care units, were randomized to COPE or control conditions. Maternal measures included parental beliefs, anxiety, negative mood, and child adjustment 3 months post discharge. Observers rated maternal support of their children during hospitalization. Results Structural equation modeling suggested that the model tested provided a reasonable fit to the data [chi(2) (97 df)= 129.43; p =.016; root mean square error of approximation n =.048; comparative fit index =.95]. COPE effects on children's post-hospital externalizing behaviors were indirect, via associations with parental beliefs and maternal negative mood state. Furthermore, COPE participation was associated with more maternal support of their children, which was also associated with less internalizing and externalizing behaviors 3 months post discharge. Conclusion Implementing COPE may help avert future mental health problems in this high risk population. Understanding the processes by which an already empirically validated program relates to child outcomes is likely to aid clinicians and administrators in the widespread uptake of the COPE program.

AB Objective: To validate the 17-item version of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) as a screen for common pediatric mental disorders in primary care. Method: Patients were 269 children and adolescents (8-15 years old) whose parents completed the PSC-17 in primary care waiting rooms. Children were later assessed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). The PSC-17's subscales were compared with K-SADS-PL diagnoses and measures of anxiety, depression, general psychopathology, functioning, and impairment. Results: In receiver operating characteristics analyses, the PSC-17 subscales performed as well as competing screens (Child Depression Inventory, the parent and child Screens for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders) and Child Behavior Checklist subscales (Aggressive, Anxious-Depressed, Attention, Externalizing, Internalizing, and Total) in predicting diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, externalizing disorders, and depression (area under the curve >= 0.80). The instrument was less successful with anxiety (area under the curve = 0.68). None of the screens were highly sensitive, many were insensitive, and all would have low positive predictive value in low-risk primary care populations. Conclusions: The PSC-17 and its subscales are briefer than alternative questionnaires, but performed as well as those instruments in detecting common mental disorders in primary care. Continued research is needed to develop brief yet sensitive assessment instruments appropriate for primary care.

AB Objective: To explore the contributions of genetic and environmental influences to individual variation and covariation of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) DSM-oriented scales (DOS) originally proposed by Achenbach and associates in 2001. Method: A classic twin study of 398 twin pairs ages 8 to 17 years belonging to the population-based Italian Twin Registry, assessed by parents using the CBCL for Ages 6 to 18 (CBCU6-18). Results: Univariate analyses showed that compared with the classic CBCL/6-18 empirical subscales, the DOS have higher heritability (lowest 0.54 for Anxiety Problems, highest 0.71 for Conduct Problems) and simpler causal structure in that the phenotypic variance was satisfactorily explained by additive genetic and unique environmental factors only. Multivariate analyses showed that the causes of phenotypic correlation among the different DOS can be attributed to one common genetic factor and to two idiosyncratic environmental factors, each loading differently on the Internalizing (Anxiety and Affective Problems) and the Externalizing (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity, Oppositional Defiant, and Conduct Problems) CBCU6-18 DOS. Conclusions: Several common risk factors of both genetic and environmental nature can simultaneously affect a child's proneness to develop the psychopathological signs and symptoms captured by the CBCU6-18 DOS.

AB Latin American youth in the United States tend to report more internalizing symptoms than white non-Latino youth, yet little is known about the factors that may contribute to such differences. The present study examined the role that anxiety sensitivity, gender, and ethnic minority status may play in the expression of internalizing symptoms across Latin American adolescents (n = 116) and white non-Latino adolescents (n = 72) in the United States and Colombian adolescents in Colombia (n = 163). Results provide evidence that because fear of anxiety related phenomena and physiological symptoms of anxiety in particular may be normative in Latino culture anxiety sensitivity does not amplify somatic complaints for Latin American and Colombian youth as it does for white non-Latino youth. Results further suggest that anxiety sensitivity and being female predicted anxiety and depressive symptoms independent of cultural background. Implications of the findings to our understanding of cultural variability in internalizing symptoms are discussed.

AB The direct and mediated effects of socioenvironmental risk on internalizing and externalizing problems among Latino youth aged 10-14 were examined using prospective analyses. Participants in this study were 464 Latino mother and child dyads surveyed as part of the Welfare, Children & Families: A Three City Study. It was hypothesized that socioenvironmental risk (i.e., maternal psychological distress, maternal parenting stress, neighborhood disadvantage, and perceived financial strain) would influence later adolescent adjustment by interrupting important family processes and interfering with opportunities for adolescents to develop appropriate social competence. Using path analyses, the mediational model was compared across high and low acculturation groups. With two exceptions, the models for the high and low acculturation groups were equivalent. Results supported a mediated effect between early socioenvironmental risk and later adjustment problems for the low acculturation group through family routines and adolescent social competence. Among families high in acculturation, socioenvironmental risk effects were partially mediated through family routines and adolescent social competence. Finally, a path from gender to maternal monitoring was present in the low acculturation group model but not the high acculturation group model.

AB This longitudinal study examined whether the risk and positive factors contributing to the delinquent behaviors and internalizing problems of 454 Latino adolescents varied across maternal linguistic acculturation and adolescent gender. Although the level of cumulative risk to which the 10-to-14-year old adolescents were exposed did not vary by maternal linguistic acculturation, the factors contributing to their subsequent adjustment 16 months later varied substantially. Multiple regression analyses showed that for boys, maternal monitoring offset cumulative risk effects in the high acculturation group, but was unrelated to adjustment in the low acculturation group. Social competence served a protective function for boys in the high acculturation group, but was detrimental for boys in the low acculturation group and mother-son relationship quality directly predicted more subsequent delinquent behaviors among boys in the low acculturation group. Maternal monitoring was the only positive factor contributing to girls' adjustment, directly predicting fewer delinquent behaviors for all girls.

AB This study examined relationships among the ethnic identity, behavior problems, self-esteem, and social support of 166 ethnically diverse pregnant and parenting adolescents, the majority of whom were African American and Hispanic American, and their infants. Results indicated that pregnant and parenting adolescent females were experiencing nonclinical levels of behavior problems on average and did not differ in their ratings of the variables examined in this study. In addition, social support moderated the relationship between behavior problems and self-esteem for these adolescents. Further, social support mediated the relationship between ethnic identity and internalizing behavior problems as well as between ethnic identity and self-esteem. Finally, parenting adolescents rated their infants as experiencing "at risk" levels of difficulties. Although parenting adolescents' experience of behavior problems and self-esteem was related significantly to their infants' difficulties, none of the variables examined in this study predicted significantly parenting stress. These results suggested that interventions targeting social support may be helpful for improving the functioning of pregnant and parenting adolescents and their infants.

AB Background: Offspring of depressive parents have two times more risk of developing a depression, other psychiatric diseases or a poor social functioning. Aim. To assess psychopathology and social functioning among offspring of currently depressed mothers. Material and methods: We enrolled 290 depressed mother-child pairs in five primary-care clinics in Santiago. A two-stage screening process to identify female primary-care patients with current major depressive illness with children aged 6-16 years, was used. All eligible and consenting patients were asked to complete the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). Those scoring 5 or more were invited to participate in a baseline assessment. The final sample consisted of 290 mother-child pairs. Patients with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression were eligible unless they had current psychotic symptoms, imminent suicide risk history of mania, or current alcohol abuse. Child psychopathology was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a highly reliable and widely used parent-rated checklist to assess competencies and behavioural and emotional problems in children 4 to 18 years of age. Results: Fifty percent (95% confidence interval (CI): 43.9-55.7) of children had overall CBCL psychopathology scores in clinical range. Internalizing symptoms were more prevalent than externalizing symptoms (62.2% [95%CI: 56.3-67.8] and 35.7% [95%CI: 30.2-41.5]. Conclusions: A large proportion of children of depressed poor mothers attending primary care clinics in Chile, had psychopathological symptom, scores in the clinical range, with a predominance of internalizing symptoms. These results are similar to those previously reported in the United States of America (Rev Med Chile 2007, 135: 602-12).

AB The current study examined the link between parents' experience of violence victimization and child outcomes, in 197 mother-child dyads recruited from low-income urban neighborhoods. At recruitment (when children were between 6 and 18 months old), demographic factors, child behavioral outcomes, mother-child interactions, mothers' psychosocial functioning, and mothers' history of violence victimization were assessed. Child behavioral outcomes, mother-child interactions, and mothers' psychosocial functioning were assessed again at age 4. Mothers' history of victimization as children (but not as adults) uniquely predicted child behavior problems at age 4. Three classes of possible mediators were examined: demographics, maternal psychosocial functioning, and mother-child interactions. Of these, only mother psychological aggression toward child met preliminary criteria for mediation; it partially mediated the link between mother childhood victimization and child behavioral outcomes. Maternal depressive symptoms and young age at child's birth independently predicted child behavior problems, but did not act as mediators. Mothers' early experiences with violence victimization appear to exert an important influence on child behavioral outcomes; this influence appears to be mediated, in part, by mothers' psychological aggression toward their children.

AB Objective: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common known genetic risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. The authors conducted a longitudinal evaluation of adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome to identify early risk factors for the development of psychotic disorders.
   Method: Sixty children, 31 with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 29 comparison subjects with idiopathic developmental disability matched for age and IQ, underwent a baseline evaluation between 1998 and 2000; of these, 51 children (28 and 23 in the two groups, respectively) underwent follow-up evaluation between 2003 and 2005. A standardized comprehensive psychiatric, psychological, and adaptive functioning evaluation was conducted in both waves. Participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome were also genotyped for the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) Met/Val polymorphism and underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans.
   Results: The two groups had similar baseline neuropsychiatric profiles. At follow-up, 32.1% of subjects with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome had developed psychotic disorders as compared with 4.3% of comparison subjects. In the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome group, baseline subthreshold psychotic symptoms interacted both with the COMT genotype and with baseline symptoms of anxiety or depression to predict 61% of the variance in severity of psychosis at follow-up evaluation. Lower baseline verbal IQ was also associated with more severe psychotic symptoms at follow-up evaluation.
   Conclusions: Genetic, cognitive, and psychiatric risk factors for the evolution of psychotic disorders in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome during adolescence were identified. Early intervention in the subgroup of children with subthreshold signs of psychosis and internalizing symptoms (especially anxiety symptoms) may reduce the risk of developing psychotic disorders during adolescence.

AB Using data from the first three waves of data (Grades 5, 6, and 7) from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development (PYD), the authors assessed among 1,184 youth (58.5% female) the patterns of change associated with indicators of PYD and of risks/problem behaviors. Results indicated that five PYD trajectories represent change across grades, four trajectories were associated with indicators of internalizing problems, and three trajectories were associated with indicators of externalizing problems. Although theoretical expectations associated with the study of both child and adolescent resilience and PYD led to the expectation that most youth across the early adolescent period would show change marked by the coupling of increases in PYD and decreases in risk/problem behaviors, only about one-sixth of all youth in the sample manifested this particular pattern of change. Other youth remained stable over time, showed increases in PYD and risk, and declined in PYD. The multiplicity of patterns of conjoint trajectories for PYD and risks/problem behaviors constitutes a challenge for both developmental theory and applications aimed at enhancing resilience and positive development among adolescents.

In the total sample and for females only, victims and bully-victims were more likely to report symptomology. Middle and high school victims, but only middle school bully-victims, were more likely to experience internalizing symptoms. Internalizing symptomology was not significantly increased for bullies in any analysis. These study findings expand the association between bully/victim status and internalizing symptoms to a less-studied population that may be limited in their ability to use and obtain mental health assistance.

AB Despite the importance of the family in the treatment of pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), relatively little empirical attention has been directed to family accommodation of symptoms. This study examined the relations among family accommodation, OCD symptom severity, functional impairment, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in a sample of 57 clinic-referred youth 7 to 17 years old (M = 12.99 +/- 2.54) with OCD. Family accommodation was a frequent event across families. Family accommodation was positively related to symptom severity, parent-rated functional impairment (but not child-rated impairment), and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Family accommodation mediated the relation between symptom severity and parent-rated functional impairment.

AB A community-based intervention program was tested with 181 children ages 6-12 and their mothers exposed to intimate partner violence during the past year. A sequential assignment procedure allocated participants to 3 conditions: child-only intervention, child-plus-mother intervention (CM), and a wait-list comparison. A 2-level hierarchical linear model consisting of repeated observations within individuals and individuals assigned to conditions was used to evaluate the effects of time from baseline to postintervention comparing the 3 conditions and from postintervention to 8-month follow-up for both intervention conditions. Outcomes were individual children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems and attitudes about violence. Of the 3 conditions, CM children showed the greatest improvement over time in externalizing problems and attitudes about violence. There were 79% fewer children with clinical range externalizing scores and 77% fewer children with clinical range internalizing scores from baseline to follow-up for CM children.

AB In this study, the authors compared ratings of behavioral and emotional problems and positive qualities on the Youth Self-Report (T. M. Achenbach & L. A. Rescorla, 2001) by adolescents in general population samples from 24 countries (N = 27,206). For problem scales, country effect sizes (ESs) ranged from 3% to 9%, whereas those for gender and age ranged from less than 1% to 2%. Scores were significantly higher for girls than for boys on Internalizing Problems and significantly higher for boys than for girls on Externalizing Problems. Bicountry correlations for mean problem item scores averaged .69. For Total Problems, 17 of 24 countries scored within one standard deviation of the overall mean of 35.3. In the 19 countries for which parent ratings were also available, the mean of 20.5 for parent ratings was far lower than the self-report mean of 34.0 in the same 19 countries (d = 2.5). Results indicate considerable consistency across 24 countries in adolescents' self-reported problems but less consistency for positive qualities.

AB The objective of this study is to make comparisons of the severity of the psychological distress, behavioral problems and traumatic stress reactions, and experiences of unaccompanied refugee minors (URMs) with immigrant/refugee (I/R) and Dutch (native) adolescents with parental caregivers (N = 3273). Self-report questionnaires were administered. Most assessments took place at school. URMs consistently reported significantly higher scores for internalizing problems, traumatic stress reactions, and stressful life events than all other groups. Gender appears to play an important role in the native and I/R samples in reporting psychological distress, behavioral problems, and traumatic stress reactions. Older age was significantly related to higher scores only in the URM group. Natives scored higher on externalizing problems than the other groups. URMs reported to have experienced twice as many stressful life events than I/Rs and natives. URMs appear to be at significantly higher risk for the development of psychopathology than refugee adolescents living with a family member, immigrants, or Dutch adolescents.

AB Internalizing and externalizing problems differ by musical tastes. A high school-based sample of 4159 adolescents, representative of Dutch youth aged 12 to 16, reported on their personal and social characteristics, music preferences and social-psychological functioning, measured with the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Cluster analysis on their music preferences revealed six taste groups: Middle-of-the-road (MOR) listeners, Urban fans, Exclusive Rock fans, Rock-Pop fans, Elitists, and Omnivores. A seventh group of musically Low-Involved youth was added. Multivariate analyses revealed that when gender, age, parenting, school, and peer variables were controlled, Omnivores and fans within the Exclusive Rock groups showed relatively high scores on internalizing YSR measures, and social, thought and attention problems. Omnivores, Exclusive Rock, Rock-Pop and Urban fans reported more externalizing problem behavior. Belonging to the MOR group that highly appreciates the most popular, chart-based pop music appears to buffer problem behavior. Music taste group membership uniquely explains variance in both internalizing and externalizing problem behavior.

AB The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder associated with palatal abnormalities, cardiac defects, a characteristic facial appearance, learning difficulties, and delays in speech and language development. Various behavioral disorders and psychiatric illnesses have also been reported. There is Much debate as to whether the behavioral problems are caused by factors Such as medical discomfort, facial abnormalities or a lower intelligence, or whether they are independently related to the genetic abnormality ("behavioral phenotype"). We examined the relationship between intelligence level and behavioral problems. A group of 69 children with 22q11DS was compared with 69 children with craniofacial anomalies (CFA) using the child behavior checklist (CBCL). The matches between individual children were based on their total IQ scores. Use of the CBCL norm scores covered the corrections for age and sex. The group of 22q11DS children showed significantly more behavioral problems than the CFA group: this was especially apparent on the CBCL, subscales "withdrawn," "anxious/depressed," "delinquent behavior," "aggressive behavior," "somatic complaints," and "social problems." We found no correlation between IQ score and behavioral problems in the 22q11DS group, which was remarkable because, comparable with the general population, intellectual disabilities were a predictor of behavioral problems in the CFA group. 22q11DS children with relatively higher IQs showed more problems of an internalizing than an externalizing nature, whereas the 22q11DS children with lower IQs showed various behavioral problems. The absence of a statistically siganificant correlation between intelligence and behavior problems in the group of 22q11DS children is tentative evidence for a 22q11DS behavioral phenotype.

AB Aim: Explore associations between smoking in pregnancy and psychiatric symptoms in the adolescent offspring.
   Design/subjects: A prospective population based follow-up of 84 adolescents at 14 years of age, of whom 32 of the mothers reported smoking during pregnancy.
   Main outcome measures: The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA), ADHD-Rating Scale IV, Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), estimated IQ based on four subscales of WISC-III.
   Results: Adolescents who were born by smokers had significantly more rule-breaking and aggressive behaviour, externalizing and total problems on the ASEBA than adolescents of non-smokers (p < 0.01), when reported by mothers, fathers and teachers. ADHD symptoms were reported more frequently (p < 0.05), and mothers also reported more internalizing symptoms (p < 0.05) and social problems (p < 0.001). The ASSQ sum score was higher (p < 0.001), and overall function as measured by the CGAS was lower (p < 0.01) for the smoking-exposed group. Associations were still present after controlling for possible confounding factors.
   Conclusion: Adolescents exposed to prenatal smoking had higher scores for both externalizing and internalizing psychiatric symptoms, which could not be explained by a broad range of possible psychosocial confounders. Thus, smoking in pregnancy may be a marker for increased risk of psychiatric symptoms in the offspring.

AB The aim of the study was to identify the specific factors that affect the risk of attempted suicide in Norwegian gay, lesbian and bisexual (GLB) youths beyond the effect of general risk factors presumed to be of importance irrespective of sexual orientation. The national non-probability sample included 407 GLB youths aged between 16 and 25 years of age, among whom 26 per cent of both genders reported a previous suicide attempt. General risk factors for attempted suicide among GLB youths were: lack of parental contact, internalizing problems (depression/anxiety), low self-esteem, regular smoking and victimization. The following risk factors specific for GLB youths increased the risk of attempted suicide even when controlling for general risk factors: currently being in a steady heterosexual relationship, early heterosexual debut (<16), young age of coming out (<15), infrequent contact with heterosexual friends and openness to all heterosexual friends. For practitioners engaged in social work among young people in general or GLB youths in particular, these results show that while coming out is a vital aspect of sexual identity formation that enhances psychological well-being and should be celebrated, in another sense it is a serious stressor with potentially negative consequences unless a strong social support network is there to be relied upon.

AB The objective of this study is to provide preliminary psychometric properties of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-37 (HSCL-37A) for refugee adolescents. The HSCL-37A is a modification of the well-known HSCL-25 and assesses symptoms of internalizing and externalizing problems that have been associated with reactions to trauma. Four independent heterogeneous samples (N = 3,890) of unaccompanied refugee minors, immigrants, and native Dutch and Belgian adolescents were assessed at school. The confirmative factor analyses, per language version, support the two-factor structure of internalizing and externalizing behavior. The total and subscales show good internal consistency and acceptable test-retest reliability in spite of the heterogeneous sample populations. The construct, content, and criterion validity of the HSCL-37A were also examined and found to be good. The findings of this study suggest that the HSCL-37A is a reliable and valid instrument to be used among culturally diverse refugee adolescents to assess emotional distress and maladaptive behaviors.

AB The present study investigated risk and resilience processes in a sample of urban African-American youth. Risk and protective factors were assessed across ecological levels including individual, family and community. Both externalizing and internalizing symptomatology were included as measures of child adjustment. Youth and parental reports as well as various methods, such as the Experience Sampling Method, were used to capture the daily experiences of the adolescents from different perspectives. Poverty, hassles, and exposure to violence predicted higher rates of externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Individual and family protective variables emerged as powerful sources of resilience. An inner sense of confidence and helpful family support were associated with reductions in the deleterious effects of community poverty. Two main patterns, protective-stabilizing and overwhelming-risk, seemed to characterize most of the risk by protective factor interactions. The present findings are important for understanding the complex experiences of urban youth and furthering the literature on sources of risk and protection for African-Americans.

AB Headache and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are common disorders in children and adolescents, frequently referred to paediatricians. Both disorders show similarities in trigger and comorbid factors, their burden on family and individual life, and a paroxysmal trend with risks of chronicization over time. However, very few studies have compared directly headache and RAP. The main aim of this study was to compare the psychological profile of headache and RAP patients vs. healthy controls. A total of 210 children and adolescents [99 boys, 111 girls; age range 4-18 years; mean age (m.a.) = 11.04, SD 4.05] were assessed: 70 headache patients (m.a. 12.4 years; SD 2.9; F = 35, M = 35), 70 RAP patients (m.a. 9 years; SD 3.6; F = 30, M = 40) and 70 controls (m.a. 11.7 years; SD 4.6; F = 46, M = 24). The diagnoses had been made according to international systems of classification both for headache (ICHD-II criteria) and RAP (Rome II criteria). The psychological profile had been made according to the Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18 (CBCL). ANOVA one-way analysis was used to compare CBCL scales and subscales between groups. Headache and RAP showed a very similar trend vs. control for the main scales of the CBCL, with a statistically significant tendency to show problems in the Internalizing scale (anxiety, mood and somatic complaints) and no problems in the Externalizing (behavioural) scale. Only for the Attention Problems subscale migraineurs showed a significant difference compared with RAP. In conclusion, headache and RAP show a very similar psychological profile that should be considered not only for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, but also from the aetiological aspect.

AB This longitudinal study of 105 economically disadvantaged children examined the relation between reading problems and internalizing behavior in 3rd- and 5th-grade assessments (8- to 12-year olds). The variable-centered results showed that reading problems predicted change in internalizing behavior in the context of child and family predictors. The person-centered results showed that children with reading problems in both grades had higher internalizing scores in 5th grade but not in 3rd grade than children with reading problems in 3rd grade or no problems. Child-reported negative emotion experiences varied similarly across grade. The results tie reading problems to emotional distress in school and support conclusions about the direction of effects and the internalization of academic difficulty for disadvantaged children.

Children (7-10 years) and mothers in three groups (RAP-GI, RAP-Peds, and Controls) completed mother and child reports of child's functional disability, internalizing symptoms, and somatic complaints, and mother report of her anxiety and somatization. Child report did not differentiate groups. RAP mothers were more likely than Control mothers to focus on somatic complaints in themselves and their children. Mother report of child disability was strongly related to tertiary care for child's recurrent abdominal pain.

   PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; MAJOR DEPRESSION; FOLLOW-UP; ADOLESCENCE; DISORDERS;

AB Developmental psychopathology theory speaks to the existence of early-manifesting internalizing problems with a heterogeneous longitudinal course. However, the course of internalizing problems has been investigated largely from late childhood onward, with methods that assume children's problem trajectories vary more so in rate than in qualitative functional form. This can obscure heterogeneity in symptom process and course, obscure onset of early gender differences in internalizing problems, and obscure the relevance of early sociocontextual risks for long-term internalizing outcomes. The present study addressed these issues by using person-oriented (latent growth mixture) methods to model heterogeneity in maternal-reported internalizing symptoms from age 2 to 11 years (N = 1,364). Three latent trajectory classes were supported for each gender: two-thirds of children followed a low-stable trajectory; smaller proportions followed decreasing/increasing or elevated-stable trajectories. Although the number, shape, and predictive validity of internalizing trajectory classes were similar across gender, trajectory classes' initial values and rates of change varied significantly across gender, as did the impact of maternal postpartum depression and anxiety on latent growth factors. Extracted latent trajectories were differentially predicted by postpartum maternal psychopathology, and themselves, in several respects, differentially predicted self-reported depressive symptoms in preadolescence. However, discussion focuses on the need for further external validation of extracted latent classes.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the zero-order and unique relations of effortful attentional and behavioral regulation, reactive impulsivity, and anger/frustration to Chinese first and second graders' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as well as the prediction of adjustment from the interaction of anger/frustration and effortful control or impulsivity. A parent and teacher reported on children's anger/frustration, effortful control, and impulsivity. Parents reported on children's internalizing symptoms, and teachers and peers reported on children's externalizing symptoms. Children were classified as relatively high on externalizing (or comorbid), internalizing, or nondisordered. High impulsivity and teacher-reported anger/frustration, and low effortful control, were associated with externalizing problems, whereas low effortful control and high parent-reported anger were predictive of internalizing problems. Unique prediction from effortful and reactive control was obtained and these predictors (especially when reported by teachers) often interacted with anger/frustration when predicting problem behavior classification.

AB Children referred for externalizing behavior problems may not represent a homogeneous population. Our objective was to assess neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might distinguish subtypes of externalizing children from each other and from their normal age mates. Children with pure externalizing (EXT) problems were compared with children comorbid for externalizing and internalizing (MIXED) problems and with age-matched controls. Only boys were included in the analysis because so few girls were referred for treatment. We used a go/no-go task with a negative emotion induction, and we examined dense-array EEG data together with behavioral measures of performance. We investigated two event-related potential (ERP) components tapping inhibitory control or self-monitoring-the inhibitory N2 and error-related negativity (ERN)-and we constructed source models estimating their cortical generators. The MIXED children's N2s increased in response to the emotion induction, resulting in greater amplitudes than EXT children in the following trial block. ERN amplitudes were greatest for control children and smallest for EXT children with MIXED children in between, but only prior to the emotion induction. These results were paralleled by behavioral differences in respons 6 time and performance monitoring. ERP activity was localized to cortical sources suggestive of the dorsal anterior cingulate for control children, posterior cingulate areas for the EXT children, and both posterior cingulate and ventral cingulate/prefrontal regions for the MIXED children. These findings highlight different mechanisms of self-regulation underlying externalizing subtypes and point toward distinct developmental pathways and treatment strategies.

AB This study examined the extent to which effortful control moderated the risk of internalizing or externalizing problems associated with high negative emotionality in a Dutch population sample of pre- and early adolescents (N = 1,922). Internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, Youth Self-Report, and Teacher Checklist of Psychopathology. Temperament (effortful control, fearfulness, frustration) was assessed with the parent version of the Revised Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire. The effects of fearfulness and frustration appeared to be attenuated by high levels of effortful control. The associations differed between the two domains of mental health investigated: effortful control reduced the effect of fearfulness on internalizing problems and the effect of frustration on externalizing problems. The effects were stronger for externalizing problems and similar for preadolescent (age 11) and adolescent (age 13/14) outcomes.

AB This study first examined the respective relations of resiliency and reactive control with executive functioning. It then examined the relationship of these different domains to the development of academic and social outcomes, and to the emergence of internalizing and externalizing problem behavior in adolescence. Resiliency and reactive control were assessed from preschool to adolescence in a high-risk sample of boys and girls (n = 498) and then linked to component operations of neuropsychological executive functioning (i.e., response inhibition, interference control, fluency, working memory/set-shifting, planning, and alertness), assessed in early and late adolescence. Consistent, linear relations were found between resiliency and executive functions (average r = .17). A curvilinear relationship was observed between reactive control and resiliency, such that resiliency was weaker when reactive control was either very high or very low. In multivariate, multilevel models, executive functions contributed to academic competence, whereas resiliency and interference control jointly predicted social competence. Low resiliency, low reactive control, and poor response inhibition uniquely and additively predicted internalizing problem behavior, whereas low reactive control and poor response inhibition uniquely predicted externalizing problem behavior. Results are discussed in relation to recent trait models of regulation and the scaffolded development of competence and problems in childhood and adolescence.

AB Children with epilepsy, even those with new-onset seizures, exhibit relatively high rates of behavior problems. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among early temperament, family adaptive resources, and behavior problems in children with new-onset seizures. Our major goal was to test whether family adaptive resources moderated the relationship between early temperament dimensions and current behavior problems in 287 children with new-onset seizures. Two of the three temperament dimensions (difficultness and resistance to control) were positively correlated with total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems (all P < 0.0001). The third temperament dimension, unadaptability, was positively correlated with total and internalizing problems (P < 0.01). Family adaptive resources moderated the relationships between temperament and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at school. Children with a difficult early temperament who live in a family environment with low family mastery are at the greatest risk for behavior problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Logistic regression analyses were used to establish the most robust set of risk factors that would best predict borderline/clinical levels of problem behavior (i.e., a t score at or above 60 on the Child Behavior Checklist Total Problem scale) of kindergarten and first-grade children at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders. Results showed that among the I I risk factor domains considered, 5 were most predictive of borderline/clinical levels of problem behavior: externalizing behavior pattern, internalizing behavior pattern, early childhood child maladjustment, family functioning, and maternal depression. Within these 5 domains, the most robust set of individual risk factors were difficult child (i.e., temperament, parent management skills, interaction between temperament and parent management skills), destroys own toys, and maternal depression. Results, limitations, future research, and implications are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore correlates of childhood social-withdrawal in India. Participants were n = 929 elementary school-aged children in New Delhi. Children completed peer nominations of social-withdrawal, aggression, and sociometric status, as well as self-report measures of loneliness and depressive symptoms. Teachers rated child social and academic adjustment at school. Consistent with North American findings, the results indicated that, compared with their average counterparts, socially withdrawn children reported greater loneliness and depressive symptoms, were rated by teachers as more anxious, and were more likely to be rejected by peers. Although girls were rated as being more socially withdrawn than boys, contrary to expectations, few interactions with gender were found. The results are discussed in terms of the meaning of social-withdrawal within the context of the Indian culture.

AB The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of FRIENDS, a well-validated emotional resiliency program, to reduce internalizing problems among primary school children aged 8-10. 47 children who reached at least the cutoff point for internalizing score, as measured using a standardized test on child behaviour, were allocated to either the intervention or the wait-list control condition. All children completed measures on internalizing symptoms and self-esteem both before and after an 8-week FRIENDS intervention or wait period. Results showed that children from the FRIENDS program showed significantly higher self-esteem and fewer internalizing symptoms when compared to those in the waitlist group. Modifications done on adapting FRIENDS to culturally and contextually appropriate content for Hong Kong children with internalizing problems were discussed. Limitations of this study were also addressed.

AB The psychometric properties of the Dutch Teacher's Report Form (TRF) for teachers of Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) were evaluated in this study. The teachers (n = 486) that participated received a Dutch TRF to report on the mental health of the unaccompanied minor. Hierarchical confirmative factor analysis and individual confirmatory factor analyses support the a priori structure of the Dutch TRE However, the Thought Problems subscale could not be verified in this study, suggesting that some of the problem behavior reported by teachers of URM differs from that of parent reports or that the item constellation of the Dutch TRF is different for teachers of URM. The total Internalizing and Externalizing scales show good internal consistency. The construct and concurrent validity of the Dutch TRF were found to be acceptable. The results suggest that the Dutch TRF is a reliable and valid instrument to assess emotional and behavior problems of URM.

AB Sixty-three adolescents with social phobia and 43 with no psychiatric disorders were compared across a number of clinical variables. In addition to clinically impairing social fear, adolescents with social phobia had significantly higher levels of loneliness, dysphoria, general emotional over-responsiveness and more internalizing behaviors than normal controls and 57.1% of socially phobic adolescents had a second, concurrent diagnosis, 75% of which were other anxiety disorders. In addition, adolescents with social phobia were significantly less socially skilled. Though similar in some respects to childhood social phobia, adolescent social phobia has a unique clinical presentation. The importance of developmental differences on the development of age-appropriate interventions is discussed.

AB Objective: To investigate whether externalizing and internalizing problems are related to lower and higher heart rate (HR), respectively, and to explore the relationship of these problems with respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Moreover, to study whether problems present at both preschool and preadolescent age show stronger associations with autonomic function than those that were not. Method: In a population cohort of 10- to 13-year-old children (N = 931; 11.6 +/- 0.5 years; 47% boys), autonomic measurements in supine and standing position were performed at school. RSA and BRS were determined by spectral analysis. Current externalizing and internalizing problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist and problems at age 4 to 5 retrospectively by the Preschool Behavior Questionnaire. Results: At supine rest, current externalizing problems were associated with lower HR and higher RSA, but not with BRS and current internalizing problems with higher HR and lower RSA, but not with BRS. These results were specifically found in children with problems that were retrospectively reported to have been also present at preschool age. Standing-induced changes in autonomic parameters were unrelated to the behavioral dimensions. Conclusions: Externalizing and internalizing problems are associated with divergent autonomic patterns, suggesting autonomic underarousal and overarousal, respectively. Problems starting early in life may specifically account for this. This should be confirmed in prospective studies.

AB This research examined how conscientiousness contributes to adolescents' positive peer relationships and vulnerability to poorer ones. Given its temperamental origins in effortful control, conscientiousness was expected to be particularly important. A total of 256 fifth to eighth graders completed personality, peer-relationship, and victimization measures. Peers, parents, and teachers also completed assessments. Adolescents higher on conscientiousness experienced less victimization, better quality friendships, and higher peer acceptance even after controlling for the other Big Five dimensions. Externalizing and/or attention problems mediated the link between conscientiousness and peer relations. Conscientiousness moderated the relation between internalizing problems and poor interpersonal functioning. Results suggest that self-control processes associated with conscientiousness are important in developing and maintaining relationships in adolescence.

   DEPRESSION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; YOUNG-ADULTS; LONGITUDINAL EVIDENCE;
   PROSPECTIVE COMMUNITY; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; MALAISE INVENTORY
AB Background. The close association between generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) prompts questions about how to characterize them in future diagnostic systems. We tested whether risk factors for MDD and GAD are similar or different.
   Method. The representative 1972-73 Dunedin birth cohort of 1037 males and females was followed to age 32 with 96 % retention. Adult GAD and MDD were diagnosed at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32 years, and juvenile anxiety/depression were also taken into account. Thirteen prospective risk measures indexed domains of family history, adverse family environment, childhood behavior, and adolescent self-esteem and personality traits.
   Results. Co-morbid MDD +GAD was antedated by highly elevated risk factors broadly across all domains. MDD+ GAD was further characterized by the earliest onset, most recurrence, and greatest use of mental health services and medication. Pure GAD had levels of risk factors similar to the elevated levels for co-morbid MDD+GAD; generally, pure MDD did not. Pure GAD had risks during childhood not shared by pure MDD, in domains of adverse family environment (low SES, somewhat more maltreatment) and childhood behavior (internalizing problems, conduct problems, somewhat more inhibited temperament). Pure MDD had risks not shared by pure GAD, in domains of family history (of depression) and personality (low positive emotionality).
   Conclusions. Specific antecedent risk factors for pure adult MDD versus GAD may suggest partly different etiological pathways. That GAD and co-morbid MDD +GAD share many risk markers suggests that the presence of GAD may signal a pathway toward relatively more severe internalizing disorder.

AB The present study examined the role of adolescent substance use and its antecedent behavioral and familial risk factors in the prediction of young adult internalizing symptoms 10 years later, using a community sample of children of alcoholics (n = 194) and demographically matched controls (n = 209). Using growth curve modeling, the authors found that initial levels of adolescent alcohol and drug use (Rag, = 13) and growth in drug use during adolescence predicted higher levels of internalizing symptoms in young adulthood, even after including in the models shared risk factors for both internalizing symptoms and adolescent substance use. These effects remained significant after including concurrent substance use in adulthood, suggesting that adolescent substance use exerts a long-term impact on young adult internalizing symptoms over and above the effects of persistent substance use over time. The present investigation further revealed that initial levels of alcohol and drug use in adolescence mediate the relation between parental alcoholism and young adult internalizing symptoms. Findings provide evidence for the long-term effects of adolescent substance use on young adult functioning and can help inform both etiological and prevention research.

AB An emerging literature suggests that maternal distress during the prenatal and perinatal period may adversely affect offspring development. The association between maternal stress and emotional status in the perinatal period (defined as I month after birth) and adjustment of first-grade children was examined in 948 mother-child dyads from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care using hierarchical multiple regression. Maternal demographic characteristics, including maternal education and income, accounted for 4% of the variance in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) externalizing scores when children were in first grade. Maternal stress and emotional status at 1 month accounted for an additional 4% of the variance in CBCL externalizing t scores; statistically significant contributions were made by maternal depression and perceived social support. Maternal depression and parenting stress at 1 month made statistically significant contributions to CBCL internalizing scores at first grade. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature indicating that perinatal maternal adjustment is associated with children's emotional and behavioral functioning years later. Implications for school psychologists' involvement in prevention, assessment, and intervention practices are discussed.

AB Background: We tested the dual pathway hypothesis to substance use which posits that substance use can develop via internalizing symptoms or deviant behaviors.
   Method: Using data from the Add Health study, we used latent class analysis to define subgroups based on patterns of substance use, and logistic regression procedures to evaluate the prospective association between symptoms of depression, deviance, and the individual substance use patterns.
   Results: Groups representing similar patterns of substance use were identified in both adolescence and young adulthood. Some support for the dual pathway hypothesis was demonstrated. Deviance was prospectively associated with substance group assignment in both adolescence and young adulthood, while depression uniquely predicted assignment to the smoking group in young adulthood among females.
   Conclusions: Further testing of the dual pathway hypothesis should be built on diverse pattern-centered approaches able to explore the presence of population subgroups. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A sample of 335 five-year-old children participating in an ongoing longitudinal study was the focus of a study on the effects of emotional and behavioral challenge on cardiac activity in children with different patterns of early childhood behavior problems. The children were placed in one of three behavior problem groups (low behavior problems, risk for externalizing problems, risk for mixed externalizing/internalizing problems) based on their scores on the Child Behavior Checklist for 4-18-year-olds [Achenbach, T.M., 1991. Integrative guide for the 1991 CBCL/4-18, YSR & TRF profiles. University of Vermont Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT], completed by their mothers. To assess cardiac vagal regulation, resting measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and RSA change (vagal withdrawal) to five emotionally and behaviorally challenging tasks were derived. In addition, heart period (HP) and heart period change (HR acceleration) was examined. Results indicated that the behavior problem groups did not differ in terms of resting measures of either RSA or HP. Analyses of the challenge tasks indicated that the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater cardiac vagal withdrawal across the five tasks than did the other two groups of children. There was a trend for the children at risk for externalizing problems to display less vagal withdrawal than the control group. In addition, the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater heart rate acceleration to the tasks than did the other two groups of children. Follow-up analyses indicated that the greater cardiac acceleration observed in the mixed group was largely a function of greater vagal withdrawal. These findings are discussed in terms of the emotion regulatory function of cardiac vagal regulation, and its implications for patterns of risk for behavior problems in young children.

AB This investigation examined acculturation risk factors and cultural assets, internalizing behavioral problems, and self-esteem in 323 Latino adolescents living in North Carolina. Multiple regression analyses revealed two risk factors-perceived discrimination and parent-adolescent conflict-as highly significant predictors of adolescent internalizing problems and low self-esteem. Adolescents who were highly involved in Latino culture and who experienced high parent-adolescent conflict were found particularly at risk for internalizing problems. Biculturalism and familism were cultural assets found associated with fewer internalizing problems and higher self-esteem. For internalizing problems, familism's protective effect was mediated by parent-adolescent conflict. Implications were discussed.

AB Referral patterns for on-site psychological services were tracked in a pediatric epilepsy clinic at a university medical center. Results revealed that 84 children treated for seizures were referred to an on-site pediatric psychologist. Behavior problems were the overall most common reason for referral; however, boys were more likely to be referred for disruptive behaviors, and girls were more likely to be referred for internalizing symptoms. Following psychological assessment, brief cognitive-behavioral intervention services were provided on-site in the epilepsy clinic to 39% of children and families. Finally, referral rates for psychological assessment/intervention were likely far below the estimated prevalence rates for psychosocial maladjustment in children with epilepsy. Results, therefore, highlight the necessity of facilitating increased referrals to mental health providers and provide support for the feasibility of on-site mental health services.

AB The nature of the co-occurrence of chronic tic disorders (CTD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is unclear. Especially in the field of psychopathology, the relationship of CTD and ADHD remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of the present chart review study was to specify the contribution of CTD and/or ADHD to the psychopathological profile of the comorbid group (CTD+ADHD). The psychopathological profiles of four large groups (CTD-only (n=112), CTD+ADHD (n=82), ADHD-only (n=129), controls (n=144)) were measured by the eight subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and analyzed by a 2x2 factorial design followed by contrasts. There were main effects of ADHD diagnosis on all but one subscale of the CBCL (Somatic Complaints). For CTD diagnosis, main effects were found for Attention Problems, Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, Social Problems and Somatic Complaints. The only interaction effect was seen for Somatic Complaints. While CTD and ADHD were both related to internalizing psychopathology of children in the CTD+ADHD group, ADHD had the largest effect on externalizing psychopathology in the comorbid group. At the level of psychopathology, an additive model for the co-occurrence of CTD and ADHD is strongly supported. In the comorbid group (CTD+ADHD), the ADHD diagnosis shows the strongest relation to externalizing psychopathology.

AB The authors tested the hypothesis that children who are maltreated earlier in life are at greater risk for poor psychological functioning in adulthood than those maltreated later in life. Age of onset of maltreatment was assessed with 3 classifications: (a) continuous (ages 0-11 years); (b) dichotomous (early [ages 0-5 years] vs. later [ages 6-11 years]); and (c) developmental (infancy [ages 0-2 years], preschool [ages 3-5 years], early school age [ages 6-8 years], and school age [ages 9-11 years]). Individuals with documented cases of physical and sexual abuse and neglect prior to age 12 (N = 496) were followed up and assessed in adulthood. Results indicated that an earlier onset of maltreatment, measured dichotomously and developmentally, predicted more symptoms of anxiety and depression in adulthood, while controlling for gender, race, current age, and other abuse reports. Later onset of maltreatment, measured continuously or developmentally, was predictive of more behavioral problems in adulthood. Implications for the assessment of maltreated children, the prevention of adult psychopathology, and the classification of age of maltreatment onset are discussed.

AB Background: Although the protective effects of familial and parental support have been studied extensively in the child psychopathology literature, few studies have explored the protective quality of positive sibling relationships. Methods: A two-wave longitudinal design was used to examine the protective effect of positive sibling relationships on child adjustment for children experiencing stressful life events. Mothers reported on stressful life events and child adjustment. Older siblings assessed the quality of relationship between themselves and target children. Results: Sibling affection moderated the relationship between stressful life events and internalizing symptomatology but not the relationship between stressful life events and externalizing symptomatology. Notably, the protective effect of sibling affection was evident regardless of mother-child relationship quality. Conclusions: Positive sibling relationships are an important source of support for children experiencing stressful life events. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB Background: Little is known about changes in ethnic disparities in mental health during the development of adolescents into young adults. The aim of this study was to study the development of disparities in internalizing and externalizing problems between Dutch natives and Turkish migrant children from adolescence into adulthood. Methods: Turkish migrants (n = 217) and Dutch natives (n = 723) completed two comparable questionnaires about internalizing and externalizing problems: the Youth Self-Report at age 11-18 and the (Young) Adult Self-Report ten years later, at age 21-28. We used mixed linear regression models to model development of mental health problems and to test changes in disparities in mental health between Turkish migrants and Dutch natives. Results: Both in adolescence and in adulthood migrants reported more internalizing and externalizing problems than natives, most pronounced for internalizing problems. Disparities decreased from adolescence into adulthood for both internalizing problems (52%, p <.0001) and externalizing problems (67%, p = .01), independently of gender, age, country of birth of Turkish adolescents, and parental socio-economic position. The favorable changes in the disparities over time were due to more favorable development among Turkish migrants than among natives. Conclusions: In this prospective study, ethnic disparities in internalizing and externalizing problems decreased as adolescents entered adulthood. Different explanations are discussed.

AB Background: The present study explores the relationships between several information processing capacities and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in a general population sample of 10- to 12-year olds (N = 2,037 51% girls). Methods: Parent-reported behavior problems as assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist were used to form four groups of children with 1) neither internalizing nor externalizing problems (n = 1,470), 2) only internalizing problems ( n 237), 3) only externalizing problems ( n 182), and 4) both internalizing and externalizing problems ( n 148). These groups were compared on measures of speed and accuracy from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program reflecting the efficiency of several input-, central cognitive-, and output-related information processing capacities. Results: Children with both internalizing and externalizing problems demonstrated the least efficient performance, followed by children with only externalizing problems, whereas children with only internalizing problems did not differ from children without problems. More specifically, response variability and the ability to maintain and quickly compare information in working memory were found to be related to the severity of problem behavior. The ability to inhibit prepotent responses was related to the type of problem behavior, discriminating between the children with only internalizing problems and only externalizing problems. However, this latter capacity no longer differentiated when controlling for IQ. No differences were found between boys and girls. Conclusions: The results suggest that, in general, cognitive processing deficits are more strongly related to the degree than to the type of maladaptive behavior. Furthermore, response variability and working memory may serve as potential markers for identifying high-risk children and response inhibition as an indicator of the type of maladaptive behavior.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine sex and age differences in coping strategies among pediatric patients with chronic Pain. Sex differences are reported in the adult pain and coping literatures, but little attention has been given to possible distinctions in coping styles in the pediatric chronic pain population. Investigating pain coping skills at an early age may provide clinicians with a better understanding of the evolution of characteristic coping styles and identify areas for intervention. Pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale), pain coping strategies (Pain Coping Questionnaire), and coping efficacy were assessed in children (ages 8-12 years) and adolescents (ages 13-18 years), presenting to a pediatric chronic pain clinic (n = 272). Significant sex differences in coping strategies were found. After controlling for pain intensity,,girls used social support seeking more than boys, while boys used more behavioral distraction techniques. Adolescents engaged in more positive self-stalements (a cognitive strategy) than children. Both boys and girls showed a trend toward pain coping efficacy being negatively correlated with average pain intensity. For girls, pain coping efficacy was also significantly negatively correlated with internalizing/catastrophizing. However, no sex or age differences in coping efficacy were found. This study demonstrates the early emergence of sex- and aged-based Preferences in coping strategies among children and adolescents with chronic pain. The findings establish a basis for further research on early social influences in the development of pain coping styles in males and females. Implications for further clinical research in this area are discussed.

ID VIOLENCE
AB The present study examined the relationship between intimate partner psychological aggression and children behavior problems in a community sample of families (N = 470 children). The results showed that psychological aggression experienced by the mother has adverse effects on children externalizing and internalizing behavior problems over and above the effects of physical aggression. The association between psychological aggression and child behavior problems was partially mediated by maternal distress. Exposure to psychological aggression appears to have unique direct and indirect adverse effects on children.

AB This study drew on four cycles of longitudinal data from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth to examine the academic and behavioural trajectories of youth between 10 and 15 years of age as a function of maternal age at childbearing. The analyses controlled for several family characteristics and examined the mediating effects of three family functioning variables (maternal depression, and nurturing and rejecting parenting behaviours). Maternal age was related to academic competency in math (standardized Math scores), externalizing disorders (Property Offences, Hyperactivity-Inattention), and internalizing disorders (Anxiety-Emotional Disorder). After accounting for family characteristics, the children of the young and older teen mothers retained their disadvantage in Math scores and Property Offences, respectively, whereas the children of older mothers lost the advantages that they had exhibited at age 10 (for Property Offences, the benefits were mediated through family functioning). These results have implications for future research and for the development of policy and programming targeting the healthy development of youth.

AB OBJECTIVE. We examined the trajectory of childhood behavior problems after prenatal cocaine exposure.
   METHODS. The Maternal Lifestyle Study, a longitudinal cohort study, enrolled children between 1993 and 1995 at 4 centers. Prenatal cocaine exposure was determined from mothers who admitted use and/or meconium results. Exposed children were matched with a group of nonexposed children within site and by gestational age, gender, race, and ethnicity. The study began at the 1-month corrected age with a total of 1388 children enrolled. A total of 1056 were assessed for internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems at ages 3, 5, and 7 years using the Child Behavior Checklist. Longitudinal hierarchical linear models were used to determine the effect of prenatal cocaine exposure on behavior problem trajectories while controlling for other prenatal exposures; time-varying covariates, including ongoing caregiver use of legal and illegal substances; demographic factors; family violence; and caregiver psychological distress.
   RESULTS. High prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with the trajectory of internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems; these effects were independent of and less than the significant combined effect of prenatal and postnatal tobacco and alcohol exposures. Caregiver depression and family violence had independent negative influence on all behavior outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Prenatal cocaine exposure has a negative impact on the trajectories of childhood behavior outcomes. When they co-occur with prenatal cocaine exposure, prenatal and postnatal tobacco and alcohol exposures have added negative effects on behavior outcomes.

AB Objective. Emerging evidence about optimal youth development highlights the importance of both reducing negative behavior and promoting positive behavior. In our study we tested a contextual model derived from positive youth-development theory by examining the association of family, school, and community risk and promotive factors, with several outcome indices of both positive and negative adolescent development.
   Methods. A sample of 42 305 adolescents aged 11 to 17 (51% girls) was drawn from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health. Survey item composites were formed representing promotive and risk factors in the family (eg, closeness, aggression) and school and community (eg, community connectedness, school violence). Outcome composites reflected positive (social competence, health- promoting behavior, self-esteem) and negative (externalizing, internalizing, academic problems) developmental outcomes. Ordinary least squares regression was used to test the overall model.
   Results. Between 0.10 and 0.50 of the variance in each outcome was explained by the contextual model. Multiple positive family characteristics were related to adolescent social competence and self-esteem, as well as lowered levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior and academic problems. Family communication, rules about television, and parents' own healthy behavior were related to adolescent health-promoting behavior. School and community safety were associated with increased social competence and decreased externalizing behavior. School violence was related to adolescent internalizing and externalizing behavior, as well as academic problems and lower self-esteem.
   Conclusions. Our results support the proposition that healthy adolescent development has roots in multiple contexts. Youth who were involved in contexts that provided positive resources from important others (ie, parents, schools, and communities) not only were less likely to exhibit negative outcomes, but also were more likely to show evidence of positive development. These findings provide important implications for intervention and prevention efforts and, more generally, for the promotion of positive, competent, and healthy youth development.

ID EXTERNALIZING PROBLEM BEHAVIOR; RATINGS; AGE
AB The Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) was established around 1987 at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The current article summarizes the longitudinal genetic analyses of maternal and paternal ratings of twins' behavior as a function of the sex of the children for the traits of aggression (AGG), attention problems (AP), anxious/depression (ANX), internalizing behavior (INT) and externalizing behavior (EXT). We found that genetic influences are the most important factor in explaining individual differences in these traits. For most phenotypes, influences of genetic factors fluctuate throughout development, with the exception of AP, for which genetic influences remain of similar magnitude. Changes in genetic influences parallel those in shared environmental influences, while non-shared environmental influences remain relatively constant. Around 10% to 20% of the variance is accounted for by parent-specific shared environment, which includes rater bias. For all phenotypes, stability throughout childhood is accounted for by genetic and shared environmental factors, while nonshared environmental influences are mainly age/measurement specific. About 15% of the phenotypic stability is accounted for by rater-specific shared environmental influences, which include rater bias. In conclusion, between ages 3 and 12 genetic factors are the most important cause of individual differences in emotional and behavioral problems.

TI Early childhood temperament and the covariation between internalizing
   and externalizing behavior in school-aged children
SO TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PERSONALITY; DISORDERS; STABILITY
AB There is significant covariation between internalizing and externalizing behavior, although there is also evidence that internalizing behavior is, a protective factor against externalizing behavior. Several researchers have posited that the examination of the relationship between temperament or personality and behavior problems may help explain these seemingly contradictory results. Specifically, negative emotionality or neuroticism has been cited as a temperament characteristic that internalizing and externalizing behavior share in common, whereas behavioral inhibition may be related only to internalizing behavior. We examined the degree to which the covariation between internalizing and externalizing behavior assessed from age 4 to 12 years can be explained by temperament characteristics assessed from age 14 to 36 months. Additionally, we assessed the extent to which this relationship is due to genetic or environmental factors, analyzing data from 225 monozygotic and 185 dizygotic twin pairs assessed by the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study. In males, a portion of the covariation between internalizing and externalizing behavior was explained by shared environmental influences in common with emotionality and shared environmental influences in common with shyness. In females, most of the covariation between internalizing and externalizing behavior was explained by shared environmental influences in common with emotionality. A possible limitation of this study is that the covariation between temperament and behavior problems may be due to shared measurement variance, as parent ratings were used to assess both temperament and behavior problems.

AB To obtain a better understanding of how genetic and environmental processes are involved in the stability and change in problem behavior from early adolescence into adulthood, studies with genetically informative samples are important. The present study used parent-reported data on internalizing and externalizing problem behavior of adoptees at mean ages 12.4, 15.5 and 26.3. In this adoption study adopted biologically related sibling pairs shared on average 50% of their genes and were brought up in the same family environment, whereas adopted biologically unrelated sibling pairs only shared their family environment. The resemblance between these adopted biologically related (N = 106) and unrelated sibling pairs (N = 230) was compared and examined over time. We aimed to investigate (1) to what extent are internalizing and externalizing problem behavior stable from early adolescence into adulthood, and (2) whether the same or different genetic and environmental factors affect these problem behaviors at the 3 assessments. Our results show that both internalizing (rs ranging from .34 to .58) and externalizing behavior Vs ranging from .47 to .69) were rather stable over time. For internalizing and externalizing problem behavior it was found that both genetic and shared environmental influences could be modeled by an underlying common factor, which explained variance in problem behavior from early adolescence into adulthood and accounted for stability over time. The nonshared environmental influences were best modeled by a Cholesky decomposition for internalizing behavior, whereas a time-specific influence of the nonshared environment was included in the final model of externalizing behavior.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to define the long-term psychiatric outcomes of adolescent internalizing disorder in the general population, using data collected over 40 years from a national birth cohort.
   Method: A total of 3,279 members of the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development ( the 1946 British birth cohort) underwent assessments of psychiatric symptoms, primarily anxiety and depression, at ages 13 and 15. Adolescents who had internalizing disorder at both ages 13 and 15 and those who had internalizing disorder at one of the two ages were compared with mentally healthy adolescents on various psychiatric outcomes in adulthood ( ages 26 53), including the prevalence of mental disorders, self-reported trouble with "nerves," suicidal ideation, and treatment for psychiatric disorders.
   Results: About 70% of adolescents who had internalizing disorder at both ages 13 and 15 had mental disorder at age 36, 43, or 53, compared with about 25% of the mentally healthy adolescents. They were also more likely than healthy adolescents to have self-reported " nervous trouble" and to have been treated for psychiatric disorder during adulthood. None of these effects was apparent among subjects who had internalizing disorder at only one of the two adolescent assessments.
   Conclusions: The long-term psychiatric outcome for adolescents with persistent or recurrent internalizing disorder was poor, whereas the outcome for those who had a single episode was better than expected. The association between adolescent internalizing disorder and poor psychiatric outcomes in adulthood may be mediated by persistence or severity of symptoms in adolescence.

AB The first aim of the present study was to examine internalizing problems and their psychosocial correlates among young Muslim immigrants in Norway as compared to other immigrant youth and host peers. The second aim was to examine adaptation differences among Muslim youth based on national origin and gender. Questionnaire data were collected during school classes from 6306 10th grade students in junior high schools in Oslo. Of the 1666 immigrants in the sample, 1060 (63.3%) originated in countries with. majority Muslim population. Internalizing problems were measured in terms of depression and anxiety symptoms. Psychosocial adaptation included measures of general and acculturation-specific risks and resources. In general, Muslims youth appeared well-adapted. However, there were between group differences based on national origin and gender. Also, self-efficacy was identified as an important moderator between acculturation-specific risks and resources and mental health among boys.

AB Objective: The present study investigated associations between the timing and persistence of maternal psychological disorder and child behaviour problems in a cohort of Pacific 2-year-old children in New Zealand.
   Method: Mothers of a cohort of 1398 Pacific infants born in South Auckland, New Zealand were interviewed when their children were 6 weeks, 12 and 24 months of age. Within the context of a wider interview, data regarding maternal mental health were obtained at these times and maternal reports of child behaviour were gathered when the children were 2 years old.
   Results: Prevalence rates for internalizing problems were significantly higher in children of mothers who had self-reported symptoms of psychological disorder (11.9% in no symptoms, 27.8% in early symptoms of postnatal depression, 21.1% in late symptoms of psychological disorder and 42.9% in persistent or recurrent symptoms). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of a child having internalizing problems was 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-2.43) in those of mothers reporting early symptoms of postnatal depression, 1.45 (95% CI: 0.85-2.49) in late symptoms of psychological disorder, and 2.93 (95% CI: 1.54-5.57) in persistent or recurrent symptoms relative to the no symptoms group. For externalizing problems, the effects of maternal psychological disorder were not significant.
   Conclusions: Maternal persistent or recurrent symptoms of psychological disorder may contribute to the behaviour problems of children as young as 2 years old. However, the timing of disorder, whether it is infant or toddler exposure, does not appear to be as crucial. Improved understanding of the associations between maternal psychological disorder and early child behaviour problems may help maternal and child health professionals design appropriate and effective screening and intervention programs to help Pacific mothers and children.

AB Relations between child self-reports of specific aspects of emotion regulation and specific aspects of social functioning in school were studied in two samples (N = 129/ 135) of 8- to 9-year-old children. The newly developed child self-report measure had significant relations to parent (Sample 1) and teacher (Sample 2) ratings of emotion regulation. In line with expectations (Rydell, Berlin, & Bohlin, 2003), poor regulation of anger and exuberance was associated with externalizing problems in both samples, poor regulation of fear had associations with social anxiety or internalizing problems in the two samples and poor regulation of sadness had marginal relations to internalizing problems in one sample. In both samples, good regulation of all emotions except fear was associated with prosocial behaviour. In Sample 1, several independent effects of child self- reports of emotion regulation on outcomes were demonstrated after controlling for parent reports of emotion regulation.

AB This study analyzed the association between domestic partner abuse and children's health. The sample consisted of 420 abused women with at least one child, for a total of 406 female children and 504 male children in 420 households. The women reported that one or more of their children had psychological problems in 27.4% of the cases, 13.6% reported physical health problems, and 7.6% reported both psychological and physical health problems. Externalizing problems were reported most frequently (in 11.7% of the children), while internalizing problems were reported in 5.6% of the children. A greater percentage of children with psychological and physical health problems was found in families in which the abusive partner was also abusive toward the children. We found better mental health in children whose mothers did not abuse them. Women whose children did not exhibit physical or mental health problems were younger, had suffered fewer years of abuse, and had fewer children than the women whose children exhibited health problems.

AB The negative consequences of children's exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) have been well documented; however, less is known about the effects of contextual factors such as parenting stress, parenting behaviors, and mothers' psychological functioning on exposed children. A total of 172 African-American mothers and their children (4 to 12 years of age) were recruited from battered women's shelters for the present study. Mothers filled out questionnaires assessing family violence, family contextual variables, and children's outcomes, and children reported on their own depressive symptoms. Results from a cluster analysis indicated substantial variability in women's experiences of parenting stress with regard to both type and quantity. Across each of the six clusters, women significantly differed in parenting behaviors and general psychological distress, and their children varied concomitantly in severity of internalizing and externalizing problems. These patterns suggest the need for individualized interventions, with a particular focus on parenting stress, to better serve the needs of women and children experiencing IPV.

AB Behavioral responses to stress and challenge are based in emotional and physiological arousal reactions. Adolescents with maladaptive or problematic behavior patterns, such as internalizing or externalizing problems, are likely to show atypical emotional and physiological reactions to stress. Relations between problems and reactions to stress were examined in a sample of 55 young adolescents with normal to clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. Youth had their self-reported emotional states, heart rate, and blood pressure levels measured before and after engaging in two socially challenging, evaluative manipulations. Internalizing problems were associated with less positive affect but greater anxiety and cardiovascular arousal, whereas externalizing problems predicted greater hostility and positive affect but less cardiovascular arousal. The necessity of recognizing and incorporating comorbid characteristics and multiple response systems into studies of the links between problems and reactivity is emphasized in the discussion.

AB We evaluated the utility of Anxiety scales for the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF). The scales (CBCL-A; TRF-A) were examined using mothers and teachers of anxiety-disordered (AD; 157 mothers, 70 teachers) and non-anxiety-disordered (NAD; 100 mothers, 17 teachers) children. Separate samples of parents and teachers of AD (mothers = 145, fathers = 120, teachers = 137) and NAD (mothers = 35, fathers = 29, teachers = 27) children cross-validated the original findings. CBCL-A and TRF-A scores significantly discriminated AD children from NAD children and correlated significantly with other measures of child anxiety. The CBCL-A and TRF-A were sensitive to treatment changes. Relative to the CBCL/TRF Anxious/Depressed syndromes and Internalizing dimensions, the CBCL-A and TRF-A improved prediction of anxiety status.

Participants were 31 domestic violence exposed and 31 non-exposed children ages 3 to 5 years and their single-parent household mothers. Child-mother pairs were matched for child's age, gender, and ethnicity, mother's age and education, and annual family income. Child cognitive and behavioral functioning was assessed via psychological assessment and parent report. The presence of mental health difficulties in mothers was assessed using self-report and clinician-administered instruments. Exposed children showed lower verbal functioning and higher internalizing behaviors than did their non-exposed peers. Exposed mothers displayed greater psychological difficulties than did their counterparts.

AB The Multiple-Family Group Intervention (MFGI) was developed to address the need for an effective and yet affordable treatment for reducing recidivism for incarcerated adolescents and altering the families' coercive interactional patterns from an affect regulation and attachment perspective. The 8-week MFGI program was conducted in two Indiana juvenile correctional institutions. The research study utilized pre- and postintervention assessments and a 6-month follow-up assessment. Data from both male (n = 43) and female (n = 30) adolescents were combined, yielding a total sample of 140 respondents (73 adolescents, 67 caretakers). The 6-month follow-up assessment indicated a recidivism rate of only 44% compared to the national norm of 65-85%. Linear growth models were fit to determine the nature of the changes in adolescent behavior over the three assessments. Adolescents and caregivers reported that adolescents' externalizing behaviors significantly declined over time. Adolescent-reported internalizing symptoms as well as their alcohol and drug use significantly declined over the follow-up period, while caregiver reports of these behaviors showed no change over time. Adolescent-reported attachment to their parents, particularly mothers, increased significantly as did both adolescent and caregiver-reported functional affect regulation.

AB Objective This study examined the relationship between body image discrepancy (BID) scores for actual versus ideal body image for children and indicators of child mental health. Methods Data were collected from 650 5th graders and their parents who participated in the Healthy Passages Phase I study. Participants were recruited through schools in Alabama, California, and Texas. Measures included the Collins Body Image to produce child- and parent-reported child BID scores, respectively, body mass index (BMI) for child and parent, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C). Results After controlling for potential confounders, children's internalizing problems as rated by parents and negative affect as rated by children were significantly associated with discrepancies based on child- and parent-reported child BID scores, respectively. Conclusions Overall, higher child- and parent-reported child BID scores were significantly associated with more internalizing problems and negative affect among children. There were some inconsistencies in the associations between other mental health behaviors and child BID scores contingent on parent or child ratings. Early intervention may be indicated to prevent possible adverse consequences, especially for internalizing problems, from the effects of child- and parent-reported child BID scores on adolescent and adult mental health and well-being.

AB Objective To examine the relationship between peer victimization and child and parent reports of psychosocial adjustment and physical activity in a clinical sample of at-risk-for-overweight and overweight children and adolescents. Methods The Schwartz Peer Victimization Scale, Children's Depression Inventory-Short Form, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Social Physique Anxiety Scale, PACE+ Adolescent Physical Activity Measure, and Asher Loneliness Scale were administered to 92 children and adolescents (54 females) aged 8-18 years. The youth's parent/guardian completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Results Peer victimization was positively related to child-reported depression, anxiety, social physique anxiety, and loneliness, and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Peer victimization was negatively related to physical activity. Depressive symptoms and loneliness mediated the relations between peer victimization and physical activity. Conclusion Recognition of the magnitude of the problem and the means of evaluating for peer victimization is important for clinicians who work with overweight youth. Assessing peer experiences may assist in understanding rates of physical activity and/or past nonadherence to clinician recommendations.

AB Existing research leaves a gap in explaining why African American adolescents do not exhibit more anxiety and depression than other youth, at the same time that they experience more contextual risk factors. The current study examined the roles of social support as well as possible mediators self-esteem and ethnic identity (sense of belonging to one's ethnic group) in reducing internalizing symptoms in 227 African American adolescents (mean age = 12.55). Structural equation models indicated that self-esteem and ethnic identity partially mediated the relation between social support and depression. For depression, ethnic identity accounted for more of the social support effect for males, whereas self-esteem had more impact for females. The mediation model for anxiety was supported in females, with self-esteem more important than ethnic identity. The results suggest that ethnic identity and self-esteem function as important links in how social support reduces internalizing symptoms in African American youth.

AB Using a large longitudinal representative community sample, this study identified three groups of subjects who were depressed either in pre-adolescence, late adolescence or early adulthood, and matched by age and gender to controls without depression. The 90th percentile on one or two self-reported symptom scales [i. e. the Center for Epidemilogical Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) or the subscale Anxious / Depressed subscale on either the Youth Self Report (YSR) or the Young Adult Self Report (YASR)] served as the cut-off for the depression groups. Psychosocial variables under study included life events and life events impact, coping, self-related cognitions, perceived parental rearing style, family relations, perceived school environment, and the internalizing (except anxious/depressed) and externalizing problem scale of the YSR/YASR. The study found a large number of time-related correlations between psychosocial factors and depression. Evidence for causal effect (either antecedent or consequent) was obtained only for self-esteem, perceived maternal rejection, and internalizing problems.

AB The quality of a child's attachment to his/her caregivers has proved its worth as a major predictor of social-emotional adaptation. During the time span from preschool to early school years attachment can be assessed both on a behavioral and a representational level. New studies substantiate the expectation that children with secure attachment will demonstrate less problem behavior compared to those with insecure attachment. Findings of the Duesseldorf longitudinal study support this assumption. In a sample of 66 5-year-old children, attachment behavior was observed in the Strange Situation with the mother; 1,5 years later attachment representations were assessed by means of a story completion task. Mothers rated the child's behavior using the Social Behavior Questionnaire, CBCL, and the TRE The two attachment measures were linked significantly. As expected, mothers and teachers rated the attachment groups differently with respect to problem behavior; their ratings concerning externalizing and internalizing problems varied. The largest differences in problem behavior were observed between disorganized and secure attachment. Overall, membership to one of the attachment groups accounted for 15% and 10% of the total variance of the problem behavior as rated by mothers and by teachers, respectively. Results emphasize the necessity for early preventive parenting training.

AB Differential relationships between seven parenting styles (inconsistent discipline, positive parenting, involvement, poor monitoring/supervision, power and coercion, responsibility oriented parenting, and corporal punishment) and four types of children's psychosocial behaviors (social-emotional competencies, oppositional-aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, emotional instability-internalizing) are studied cross-sectionally. In a study with 373 parents of elementary school children attending first and second grades, parents rated their own parenting behavior with an extended German version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ). In addition, parents assessed the psychosocial behavior of their child on a child social behavior checklist (VBV short version). Data were analyzed separately for fathers and mothers. As expected, positive parenting was closely related to psychosocially competent behavior of children. Specifically, mothers' monitoring and fathers' refusal of corporal punishment and of inconsistent discipline added significantly to the prediction of children's social competence. Less positive parenting styles were positively related to children's behavioral problems, and negatively related to children's social competencies. Specifically, oppositional-aggressive behaviors of children were positively related to inconsistent discipline and corporal punishment by both parents, as well as to responsibility oriented parenting style of mothers and to reports of power and coercion by fathers. Hyperactive behaviors in children were related to inconsistent parenting by both parents, and additionally related to corporal punishment by mothers and the refusal of positive parenting behaviors in fathers. Internalizing behaviors of children were associated with inconsistent parenting by both parents, and with reports of power and. coercion in fathers. There were no significant interactions between parenting styles.

AB Background: This study aimed to compare broad range of behavioral problems and their relations to working status of adolescents in samples of Turkish apprenticeship, technical and high schools.
   Method: The research was carried out on a total of 899 adolescents aged 15 to 20. The study sample was recruited from three different type of schools (High School, Technical School, Apprenticeship School), located in the city of Zonguldak, Turkey. Two questionnaires were administered to the students. First questionnaire evaluated the adolescents' sociodemographic variables, working status and working durations. Second questionnaire evaluated the behavioral problems namely Youth Self Report (YSR).
   Results: The majority of adolescents (75.2%) in apprentice programs were working regularly. Compared to adolescents in high school and technical school, adolescent students in apprenticeship programs were found to have higher scores of withdrawn, somatic complaints, depression and anxiety, social problems, delinquent behaviors, internalization and externalization on the YSR. The Total Problems, Internalizing Problems, Somatic Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, Social Problems and Delinquent Behaviors scores of working adolescents were higher than nonworking adolescents.
   Conclusion: Compared to other schools, adolescents in apprenticeship programs were found to have higher behavioral problems. Longer working hours seems to be associated with withdrawn, somatic complaints, being anxious and depressed, social problems, delinquent behaviors, internalizing and externalization problems. We suggest that it is important to control working conditions of adolescents in order to prevent development of behavioral problems that may lead to several other health problems.

AB The evaluation of a preventive training with first graders is reported ("I keep cool"). The training focuses on the prevention of aggressive behaviour and of destructive problem solving by means of teaching prosocial behaviour and constructive problem solving. From a sample of 143 children, 92 participated in the training, 51 served as controls. Children's social competencies and behaviour problems were assessed before, after, and four months after the training via interviews with children, teachers' ratings, and separate ratings of mothers and fathers. After the training, children reported more constructive problem solving, more prosocial behavior, and a higher level of impulse control. Girls showed a lowered level of destructive problem solving behavior immediately after the training, and a lowered level of stress when confronted with intermarital conflicts of their parents at the follow-up assessment. Teachers reported less internalizing and shyness in both sexes at the follow-up assessment. Mothers reported a marginally significant lower level of oppositional-aggressive behaviour in boys immediately after the training, fathers reported a significant lower level of oppositional-aggressive behaviour and of internalizing and shyness in children of both sexes. The effect sizes of .23 < d < .94 are satisfying and comparable with those of similar programmes.

AB Externalizing and internalizing problems as measured on the Youth Self Report (YSR; Achenbach, 1991a) among early adolescent boys and girls were related to the conceptual level (CL; Blatt, Chevron, Quinlan, Schaffer, & Wein, 1988) with which children described their mothers and fathers. Scoring of these descriptions using the Children's version (CORI; Waniel, Besser, & Priel, 2006) of the Object Relations Inventory (ORI; Blatt et al., 1988) indicated that higher CL in descriptions of mother than of father was significantly related to the intensity of externalizing problem behaviors in boys. Conversely, higher CL in descriptions of father than of mother was significantly related to the intensity of internalizing problems in girls. These results are discussed in terms of the process of identity consolidation and its relationship to the emergence of problem behaviors in early adolescence.

AB Background: Symptoms as in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) are frequent among individuals with pervasive developmental disorders ( PDD). The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity on the clinical phenotype of children and adolescents with PDD. Sampling and Methods: A total of 182 subjects ( 41 females) diagnosed as having PDD were split into a high ( PDD +) and a lower ( PDD) attention problem group using the median of the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL) syndrome scale 'attention problems' ( median T score = 75). The groups were compared with regard to the degree of coexisting psychopathology, as measured by the remaining 7 CBCL subscales, and autistic core features assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised ( ADI- R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule using a multivariate analysis of covariance adjusted for age, IQ and socioeconomic status. Results: The PDD+ subjects exhibited a significantly higher degree of general psychopathology than the subjects in the PDD subgroup, regarding both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. In addition, the PDD+ subgroup tended to exhibit more impairments on the social interaction scale of the ADI- R. Conclusions: Clinicians should adjust treatment plans to ensure comprehensive and effective treatment for both PDD and associated ADHD. A dual diagnosis may be essential to the implementation of effective treatments. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Psychotropic medications are increasingly being used by children and adolescents. In an earlier report, we noted that boys were receiving atypical antipsychotics more frequently than were girls, (70% of the claims). Since diagnosis was not available in the data, we were unable to ascertain the reasons for this. In the present analysis, we examined a large clinical mental health database to ascertain the reason for antipsychotic use. We evaluated the extent to which race, gender, age and type of diagnosis accounted for atypical antipsychotic use in children. Methods: The authors used an anonymous clinical database created at Duke University Medical Center. The database is based on the clinical document of care in the Department of Psychiatry. The data are de-identified per HIPAA guidelines and has an IRB exemption for use in clinical research. Patients analyzed were seen from 1999 to 2005 and were below the age of 18 at the time of clinical care. A total 3,268 patients, with a total of 7,701 visits comprise the analysis sample. Age, gender, race, and diagnosis were extracted as predictors of use of atypical antipsychotics. Results: Males and older children were also more likely to use an atypical. African Americans were slightly more likely to use an atypical than whites. Patients whose diagnoses were classified as either psychotic or internalizing were also more likely to use an antipsychotic. Conclusion: The underlying reasons for the high level of use of atypicals in boys and in African Americans need to be investigated further. Psychopharmacology Bulletin. 2007;40(3):116-124.

   prevalance in Mexico City. Second part
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
ID PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; CARE
AB Introduction Studies on developmental psychopathology have shown that several problems and disorders that started during childhood persist into adulthood. Recent epidemiological studies have emphasized the need for the early identification of problems and disorders in childhood and adolescence that may eventually lead to other psychopathologies in adulthood.
   A previous paper presented the rationale and development of a brief instrument which could be used to early identify clinical risk conditions in children by health professionals: the Brief Screening and Diagnostic Questionnaire, CBTD. The CBTD is a 27-item questionnaire which is answered by the parents of the child exploring symptoms frequently reported as motives for seeking attention at the out-patient mental health services. The instrument showed good reliability, K-R-20= 0.81, and construct validity for identifying groups of symptoms that suggest the presence of the most frequent psychiatric syndromes in children and adolescents.
   As our goal was to identify probable psychiatric disorders, and diagnostic criteria are not equal to clusters of symptoms identified by factor analyses, the next task was to explore the data using a different statistical technique and to develop observational units, syndromes, for further clinical evaluation. The objectives of this paper are: 1. to present the resulting algorithms and 2. their prevalence in children and adolescent population in Mexico City.
   Method The CBTD was included as part of the instruments used in an epidemiological study on psychiatric morbidity in Mexico City. The study was designed as a household survey on a representative sample of the adult population aged 18-65 years in Mexico City. In addition, information was obtained about all the respondents' children aged 4-16 years living at the same household. The total sample included 1685 children and adolescents with the following distribution by age-groups: 16.3% were 4-5 years old; 25.5%, 6-8 years old; 30.9%, 9-12 years old, and 27.4%, 13-16 years old.
   Once the independence of the observations was assured, logistic regression analyses were performed between cardinal symptoms for different diagnoses and the rest of the items from die questionnaire. Statistically significant associations were evaluated clinically and compared to psychiatric syndromes as defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 classifications. Based on these results, algorithms for probable psychiatric syndromes were created.
   Results Using the results from logistic regression analyses, algorithms were created considering different levels of severity for probable disorders: attention-deficit and hyperactivity distinguishing three subtypes, depressive with two definitions and two severity degrees, anxiety with two subtypes, oppositional behavior, conduct disorder, specific language disorder, epilepsy, and other clinical conditions such as problems related with eating attitudes, enuresis and impulsivity,
   Depressive and hyperactive attention-deficit syndromes were the most frequent in the population. Among these groups of syndromes, depression, as defined in terms of the presence of irritability or sadness and three or more associated symptoms, and the combined subtype of hyperactive attention-deficit, were the most prevalent. Oppositional behavior and anxiety syndromes were also frequent, and all of the afore mentioned syndromes appeared predominantly associated at least with another one. Mixed externalizing and internalizing syndromes were found in 5% of the population, while only internalizing syndromes were reported in 4.5% and only externalizing syndromes in 2.4%.
   Although as a whole no significant differences by sex were found on the number of syndromes presented, in males the frequency increased with age, while in girls more syndromes were reported on the youngest and elder age-groups.
   Discussion This paper has presented operational definitions for screening syndromes based on the associations among symptoms explored by the CBTD in children and adolescents of the general population in Mexico City.
   It is important to highlight that the CBTD is based on symptoms which are frequently reported as motives for consultation. So, the instrument does not merely translate diagnostic criteria into questions but rather use the way in which the population perceive and express concern about their children's behavior, in order, first, to define caseness and, second, to identify probable disorders.
   ]Recently, Goodman designed an interesting brief instrument, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), that generates scores for conduct problems, inattention-hyperactivity emotional symptoms, peer problems, and prosocial behavior. One difference between the CBTD and the SDQ is that the former includes items exploring language problems, enuresis, and seizures, which are clinically relevant and frequently associated with conduct and emotional problems. Furthermore, 4% of our study population presented these kind of problems associated with externalizing or internalizing syndromes.
   Results indicating that attention-deficit and depressive syndromes are the most common in the population are consistent with the most frequent disorders attended at the Pediatric Psychiatric Hospital in Mexico City. Also interesting is the fact that in a National Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey, 2% of the adult population with depressive disorders reported having their first depressive episode during childhood or adolescence with a mean duration of 31 months. Likewise, results from the present study found that 2.6% of the children and adolescents have the most severe depressive syndrome, IDEP-2S, which also has the highest diagnostic specificity in clinical settings.
   These results suggest that the CBTD accomplishes the goal of being a useful tool for epidemiological studies and for the surveillance of mental health in childhood and adolescence. The presence of a syndrome does not lead automatically to a psychiatric diagnosis. The intention is that, in those cases, corroboration should be sought by evaluating interference caused by the reported symptoms in familial, school, social and personal functioning.

AB This study explored the possibility that bullies, victims of bullying, and bully-victims (i.e., youth who both perpetrate and are victims of bullying) are at increased risk for victimization in four other domains: conventional crime, child maltreatment, sexual victimization, and witnessing or indirect victimization. It also evaluated the extent to which victimization in these other domains enhances the prediction of internalizing problems. Participants were 689 fifth-grade students from an urban, ethnically diverse school district in the Northeast. Youth completed self-report measures about bullying involvement, victimization in the home and community, and internalizing problems. Bullies, victims, and bully-victims endorsed more victimization in other domains than students not involved in bullying in one of these capacities; bully-victims had the highest victimization rates overall. Further, although regression models showed that bullying involvement was related to greater internalizing problems, explanatory power was increased through the inclusion of other victimization forms. Findings highlight the need for comprehensive victimization assessment among students involved in bullying in any capacity.

AB Although it is important to study the negative outcomes experienced by victims of bullying, it is equally important to study the factors that may buffer victims from distress. Thus, the relationship among social support, victimization, and internalizing-externalizing distress from bullying was investigated. Participants were 355 middle school students who completed the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (Malecki, Demaray, & Elliott, 2000) and scales from the Reynolds Bully-Victimization Scales for Schools (Reynolds, 2003). Teacher, classmate, and school support for males and parent support for females moderated the relationship between victimization and internalizing distress from bullying. Close friend support for females moderated the relationship between victimization and externalizing distress from bullying, however, in a direction opposite to that predicted. Results indicate that social support may play a buffering role between victimization and internalizing distress from bullying.

AB This study examined associations between parents' emotion coaching and emotional expressiveness, and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The sample included 131 16-year-olds and their mothers and fathers. Adolescents completed an open-ended interview about their parents' emotion coaching. Adolescents rated parents' negative emotional expressiveness, and parents and adolescents reported on adolescents' adjustment. Results indicated that mothers were more accepting and supportive of their children's expression of negative emotions than were fathers. Parents' coaching of emotions was associated with fewer adolescents' internalizing symptoms and was unrelated to their externalizing symptoms. Parents' negative emotional expressiveness was positively linked to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Parents' emotion coaching and negative emotional expressiveness explained unique variance in adolescents' internalizing symptoms. Results highlight the importance of the family's emotional climate for adolescents' well-being.

AB Children's victimization experiences within relationships characterized by mutual animosity were examined among 210 6th- and 7th-grade boys and girls. Participants reported that a greater proportion of mutual antipathies, relative to other peers, victimized them. Moreover the receipt of victimization within antipathetic relationships was greater when the partner in the relationship was aggressive, physically strong, non-victimized and had low levels of internalizing problems. Perceptions of victimization and levels of maladjustment were also found to be more strongly associated with victimization from mutual antipathies than with victimization from other peers. Together, these findings highlight the importance of studying victimization in the context of antipathetic relationships and contribute to an emerging literature on the developmental significance of these relationships.

AB This article examined emotion competence in children exposed to domestic violence (DV). It also examined the hypothesis that children's emotional competence mediates relations between DV and children's later difficulties with peers and behavioral adjustment. DV was assessed when children were at the age of five, emotional competence was assessed at the age of 9.5, and peer quality and behavioral adjustment were obtained at the age of 11. Children from homes with greater DV were less aware of their own emotions and more emotionally dysregulated at the age of 9.5. Emotional awareness mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's friendship closeness and internalizing problems at the age of 11. Emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between DV at the age of five and children's negative peer group interactions, social problems, and internalizing and externalizing problems at the age of 11. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of DV on children's emotional development and the role that different aspects of emotional competence play in children's socio-emotional adjustment.

AB The study of social dominance has a long tradition within the peer relationships literature, but rarely has the topic been investigated observationally and longitudinally within other salient close relationships. The present study investigated the role of experiences in social relationships and adjustment indices in childhood in predicting later observed non-verbal social dominance behaviors in the context of romantic relationships in emerging adults. Analyses from a subsample (N = 70) from a 29-year prospective longitudinal study revealed links between early peer behavior and subsequent romantic relationship interactions for men and women. Non-verbal social dominance behaviors were concurrently associated with poor romantic relationship quality, conflict, and physical and verbal aggression within the dyad. Both childhood externalizing and internalizing behaviors significantly predicted non-verbal social dominance behaviors in the romantic partner interactions.

AB In adolescence, peer group becomes an increasingly important context of development. Therefore, knowledge about predictors and correlates of quality of relationships with peers and status in the peer group is of significant theoretical and practical importance. Previous research has mostly been focused on relationships between externalizing behaviors and peer status, while links between internalizing behaviors and peer status have been underresearched. The aim of this study was to determine relationships between young adolescents'-peer status and their anxiety and depression. The sample consisted of 1-77 sixth grade students (89 girls), whose mean age was 12,75 years. Children's self-reports on depression and anxiety were collected by means of Depression Scale for Children and Adolescents (Vulic-Prtoric, 2003.) and Fears and Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents (Vulic-Prtoric, 2004a.). Peer status was measured by sociometric nomination technique. Neither general depression and anxiety, nor their specific aspects, were related to acceptance and rejection by classmates. In the whole sample and the subsample of girls none of the correlations were significant, In the subsample of boys significant, although low, negative correlation between separation anxiety and peer rejection was found, with boys higher on separation anxiety being less rejected by peers. Results were discussed from the developmental perspective. Methodological limitations of the study were pointed out and suggestions for future studies provided.

TI Caregivers' perception of HIV-infected Dominican children's behaviour
SO WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT; HIV/AIDS; PARENTS; DISEASE; STRESS; HEALTH
AB Caregivers (mothers and non-mothers) of HIV+ children face many challenges related to both physical demands and emotional well-being. The perception of caregivers in the Dominican Republic, a country greatly impacted by HIV/AIDS, in regard to their children behaviour, has not been investigated to date. To extend understanding of the potential behavioural issues involved in providing care to children without access to antiretroviral therapy, the Child Behaviour Checklist was administered to 52 caregivers of HIV+ Dominican children (2-8 years old). Both mothers and non-mothers perceived significant pathological internalizing behavioural symptoms in immunosuppressed children, compared to children with less disease progression. Analyses of gender comparisons revealed that older female children were perceived as withdrawn/depressed by their caregivers. These findings suggest that children disease status may be an important contributor to caregiver perception in-mothers, as well as non-mothers and indicate that gender-specific relationships warrant further study.

TI Behavioural symptoms of children with HIV infection living in the
   Dominican republic
SO WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN; HEMOPHILIA
AB Objective The purpose of this report is to describe behavioural problems encountered in a group of Dominican children living with Human Immunodeficency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in the Dominican Republic. They were not receiving antiretroviral treatment.
   Method The participants were 43 children with HIV infection (2 to 8 years of age) who were attending an immunology clinic in the largest paediatric hospital in the Dominican Republic. All of the participants were vertically infected with the HIV virus (mother-to-child transmission) and had a very low socio-economic status. The children caregivers were administered the Child Behavioural Checklist (CBCL) by trained psychologists to determine the caregivers' perception of the children behavioural problems. Behavioural findings were examined according to the CBCL age format: younger children (under 5 years of age) and older children (over 6 years of age).
   Results: Descriptive statistics revealed a high proportion of the children, both younger (approximately 40%) and older (465yo) scored in the borderlinelclinical ranges for internalizing problems, including anxiety, withdrawn-depressed and somatic complaints. In addition, 46% of the older children were perceived as having externalizing problems (rule breaking and aggressive behaviour).
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that a high incidence of behavioural and mood problems may be prevalent among Dominican children with HIV. The findings are discussed in terms of future research to examine other risk factors that might contribute to the high rate of maladaptive behaviours observed in the present report, including the contribution of socio-economic status, caregiver illness, caregiver education and parental loss.

AB This article deals with the long-term consequences of inter-individual differences in the timing of pubertal maturation on psychosocial adaptation in late adolescence. A sample of 49 girls between the ages of 9 and 15 (M= 11.85, SD = 1.10) was investigated and followed up six years later. Objective pubertal timing was measured in early adolescence. Moreover, the stability of subjective pubertal timing during adolescence was measured retrospectively in late adolescence. Outcome variables were depressive symptoms and anxiety as well as individuation from parents and social support in late adolescence. Results indicated that pubertal maturation has no effect on internalizing problems such as depressive mood and symptoms of anxiety. Besides this, girls with consistently early pubertal development during adolescence showed the highest striving for autonomy from parents. Girls with objectively early pubertal development in early adolescence received less social support than on-time and late-maturers in late adolescence.

AB Aims We tested the effects of adolescent substance use on college attendance and completion by young adulthood in the context of the behavioral and familial risk factors that influence substance use. Design, setting and participants Longitudinal data were collected from a community sample of children of alcoholics (248) and matched controls (206) at three adolescent assessments (mu(age) = 13-15) and a long-term follow-up in young adulthood (mu(age) = 25). Measurements College attendance and degree completion by age 25 were self-reported in young adulthood. During adolescence, self-reports of alcohol and drug use were assessed with log-transformed quantity/frequency measures; substance use risk factors [e.g. parental monitoring, externalizing and internalizing symptoms and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version III (DSM-III) diagnosis of parental alcoholism] were assessed by both self- and parent-report, and adolescent reading achievement was assessed using a standardized assessment of reading achievement (Wide Range Achievement Test). Findings Using growth curve modeling, we found that mean levels and growth in adolescent substance use mark, or identify, those adolescents who are at risk for reduced odds of attending and completing college. Moreover, adolescent substance use was not merely a marker of risk, in that growth in drug use (but not alcohol use) significantly mediated the effects of parental alcoholism and early externalizing behavior on later college completion, partially explaining the effects of these risk factors on college completion. Conclusions The current study provides evidence for both the marker and the mediator hypotheses, and identifies multiple pathways to higher educational attainment. The findings point to the importance of studying the effects of adolescent substance use in a broader developmental context of its correlated risk factors to specify more effectively the key pathways to later developmental outcomes.

AB Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders. Accordingly, treatment research has flourished; however, prevention efforts have lagged behind. The extant literature is reviewed on the relationship between anxiety and depression and the potential for childhood anxiety interventions to reduce the risks of secondary depression. Additionally, methodologic issues and recommendations in the design of depression prevention programs are presented. Research appears to support the view that anxiety plays a role in the development of depression; yet, the nature of that role remains unclear.

AB Background: The death of a parent is a major family disruption that can place children at risk for later depression and other mental health problems.
   Design: Theoretically based randomized controlled trial for parentally bereaved children.
   Setting/Participants: Two-hundred and forty-four children and adolescents and their caregivers from 156 families were randomly assigned to the Family Bereavement Program (FBP) intervention condition (90 families; 135 children) or to a control condition (66 families; 109 children). Data collection occurred from 1996 to 1998.
   Intervention: Children and caregivers in the intervention condition met separately for 12 two-hour weekly sessions. Skills targeted by the program for children included positive coping, stress appraisals, control beliefs, and self-esteem. The caregiver program targeted caregiver mental health, life stressors, and improved discipline in the home. Both child and caregiver programs focused on improved quality of the caregiver-child relationship.
   Main Outcome Measures: Child and caregiver reports of internalizing and externalizing symptoms.
   Results: Longitudinal growth curve modeling was performed to model symptoms over time from the point of parental death. The rate of recovery for girls in the program condition was significantly different from that of girls in the control condition across all outcomes. Boys in both conditions showed reduced symptoms over time.
   Conclusions: The methodology offers a conceptually unique way of assessing recovery in terms of reduced mental health problems over time after an event and has contributed to further understanding of FBP intervention effects. The intervention program facilitated recovery among girls, who did not show reduction in behavior problems without the program, while boys demonstrated decreased symptoms even without intervention.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cross-gender behavior during childhood, to estimate the influence of genotype and environment on variation in cross-gender behavior, and to explore the association of cross-gender behavior with maternal ratings of behavior problems as indexed by the Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Cross-gender behavior was assessed by two items from the CBCL: "behaves like opposite sex" and "wishes to be of opposite sex." As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Netherlands Twin Registry, mothers were asked to complete the CBCL for their twins when they were 7 (n similar to 14,000 twins) and 10 years old (n similar to 8,500 twins). The prevalence of cross-gender behavior (as measured by maternal report of behaving like or wishing to be the opposite sex) was 3.2% and 5.2% for 7-year-old boys and girls, respectively, and decreased to 2.4% and 3.3% for 10-year-old boys and girls. Surprisingly, the prevalence rate of cross-gender behavior of girls with a male co-twin was lower than of girls with a female co-twin. At both ages, the similarity for cross-gender behavior was greater in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins pairs. Genetic structural equation modeling showed that 70% of the variance in the liability of cross-gender behavior could be explained by genetic factors, at both ages and for both sexes. Cross-gender behavior was associated with higher scores on Internalizing and Externalizing problems, both in boys and in girls.

AB A modified skills training component of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was implemented in a group therapy format for non-suicidal outpatient young adolescents who met criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Thirty-two youths completed the 16-week program, as well as pre- and post-treatment measures. The treatment was effective not only in decreasing negative behaviors, but also in increasing positive behaviors, per caregiver report. The youths reported a significant reduction in externalizing and internalizing symptoms and in depression. Reliable change indices indicated that far more participants were in the improved category than in the deteriorated category on the measures of interest. Despite the absence of control groups but consistent with the treatment outcome research literature for DBT-based treatments for other disorders, this study demonstrated. that DBT skills training is feasible and shows promise in improving the behavior of ODD young adolescents.

AB Using a multisite community sample of 585 children, this Study examined how protective and vulnerability factors alter trajectories of teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behavior from kindergarten through Grade 9 for children who were and were not physically abused during the first 5 years of life. Early lifetime history of physical abuse (11.8% of sample) was determined through interviews with mothers during the prekindergarten period: mothers and children provided data on vulnerability and protective factors. Regardless of whether the child was abused, being African American; being male; having low early social competence, low early socioeconomic status (SES), and low adolescent SES; and experiencing adolescent harsh discipline, low monitoring, and low parental knowledge were related to higher levels of externalizing problems over time. Having low early social competence, low early SES, low adolescent SES, and low proactive parenting were related to higher levels of internalizing problems over time. Furthermore, resilience effects, defined as significant interaction effects, were found for unilateral parental decision making (lower levels are protective of externalizing outcomes for abused children), early stress (lower levels are protective of internalizing outcomes for abused children). adolescent stress (lower levels are protective of internalizing Outcome,,, for abused children), and hostile attributions (higher levels are protective of internalizing outcomes for abused children). The findings provide a great deal of support for an additive or main effect perspective oil vulnerability and protective factors and some support for all interactive perspective. It appears that some protective and Vulnerability factor,, do not have stronger effects for physically abused children, but instead are equally beneficial or harmful to children regardless of their abuse status.

AB Foster care is a protective intervention designed to provide out of home placement to children living in at-risk home environments. This study employs prospective longitudinal data (N = 189) to investigate the effects of foster care on the development of child behavior and psychological functioning taking into account baseline adaptation prior to placement and socioeconomic Status at the time of placement. Comparisons were made among three groups: children who experienced foster care, those who were maltreated but remained in the home, and children who had not experienced foster care or maltreatment despite their similarly at-risk demographic characteristics. In the current sample, children placed in Out of home Care exhibited significant behavior problems in comparison to children who received adequate care, and using the same pre- and postplacement Measure of adaptation, foster care children showed elevated levels of behavior problems following release from care. Similarly, children placed into unfamiliar foster care showed higher levels of internalizing problems compared with children reared by maltreating caregivers, children in familiar care, and children who received adequate caregiving. Findings suggest that outcomes related to foster care may vary with type of care and beyond the effects associated with maltreatment history, baseline adaptation, and socioeconomic status.

AB Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine to what extent parental psychological characteristics and parental behavior are related to psychological problems in obese youngsters.
   Research methods: Data were collected from 196 families having an overweight youngster (range 10-16 years old) (mean body mass index (BMI) = 31.2; s.d. 5.3) seeking weight-loss treatment and compared with data from normal weight samples. Behavior problems were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist; the Child version of the Eating Disorder Examination was used to assess eating disorder psychopathology. Parental psychopathology was measured using the Symptom Checklist-90; parenting behavior was assessed with the Ghent Parental Behavior Scale.
   Results: Parental psychopathology was prevalent in 59.6% of mothers and 35.7% of fathers. Youngsters exceeding the cutoff for problem behavior ranged between 41.4 and 53.1%. Children's problem behavior was most associated with psychopathology in the mother (r = 0.40 for Internalizing and r = 0.37 for Externalizing; both P < 0.01). The research findings further revealed that the effects of maternal psychopathology were partly mediated by a specific form of parenting behavior, namely Inconsistent discipline, although the effect was stronger for Externalizing behavior (explained variance: 10%) than for Internalizing behavior (explained variance: 4%). No evidence was found for a mediator effect from parenting behavior on the eating disorder symptoms of the obese youngsters. However, several direct relations emerged, suggesting a negative association between a child's eating disorder symptoms and Positive parenting behavior by the mother (r= -0.20 for Eating concern; r= -0.18 for Restraint eating; r= -0.16 for Shape concern; all P < 0.05) as well as by the father (r = -0.25 for Eating concern; r= -0.25 for Weight concern; both P < 0.01; r= -0.21 for Shape concern; P < 0.05).
   Discussion: Parental characteristics were associated with psychological problems in obese youngsters, not only in a direct way but also indirectly. The effects were partly mediated by a particular ineffective parenting style, namely inconsistent discipline on the part of the mother. Pediatric obesity treatments should focus more on parenting behaviors and parental characteristics.

AB Examined a risk-resilience model of peer rejection and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a 5-year longitudinal study of 209 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse girls aged 6-13 at baseline and 11-18 at follow-up. Risk factors were childhood ADHD diagnosis and peer rejection; hypothesized protective factors were childhood measures of self-perceived scholastic competence, engagement in goal-directed play when alone, and popularity with adults. Adolescent criterion measures were multi-informant composites of externalizing and internalizing behavior plus indicators of academic achievement, eating pathology, and substance use. ADHD and peer rejection predicted risk for all criterion measures except for substance use, which was predicted by ADHD only. ADHD and peer rejection predicted lower adolescent academic achievement controlling for childhood achievement, but they did not predict adolescent externalizing and internalizing behavior after controlling for baseline levels of these constructs. Regarding buffers, self-perceived scholastic competence in childhood (with control of academic achievement) predicted resilient adolescent functioning. Contrary to hypothesis, goal-directed play in childhood was associated with poor adolescent outcomes. Buffers were not found to have differential effectiveness among girls with ADHD relative to comparison girls.

AB The purpose of the current study was to determine whether parents make unrealistic evaluations of children and what factors predict these evaluations. Parents of 5- and 6-year-olds rated their child's risk for various positive and negative outcomes, temperament, and health and behavior problems. Parents also completed an adult attachment measure. Parents appeared to give relatively little consideration to realistic constraints when predicting their child's future. Parents scoring higher on attachment avoidance were less optimistic that their child would attain positive outcomes and avoid negative outcomes, consistent with the view that optimism is a motivated phenomenon. Greater child internalizing behaviors also were associated with less parental optimism for positive outcomes. Findings have implications for the delivery of health messages to parents.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess sleep, daytime sleepiness, and behavior problems in children suffering from headaches and in controls, with a special focus on the role of gender. A clinical group of 28 children with persistent headache complaints and a control group of 108 healthy children were included. Sleep was assessed by actigraphy and diaries. Behavior problems were assessed by parental reports. In comparison with the control group, the sleep quality of the clinical group was poorer and they complained more about excessive daytime sleepiness. Children suffering from headache showed higher levels of internalizing behavior problems. Gender was found to be a moderating factor for the relationships between headache and sleep. Compared with control girls, girls suffering from headaches had poorer sleep quality, whereas the opposite was true for the boys. The results highlight the importance of assessing sleep, daytime sleepiness, and psychologic adjustment in children complaining about headaches as an integral part of their routine assessment.

AB Family stability, defined as the consistency of family activities and routines, was examined in a sample of urban families (n = 70) with children (ages 7 to 16) receiving psychological services. Parent-reported family stability was associated with lower parent-reported children's internalizing behavior problems. Child-reported family stability significantly attenuated the influence of parental depressive symptoms on parent-reported children's internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems, while controlling for the effect of children's age. Parental depressive symptoms were associated with problems in child adjustment only at the low level of family stability.

AB The link between treatment techniques and long-term treatment outcome was examined in an empirically supported family-based treatment for adolescent drug abuse. Observational ratings of therapist interventions were used to predict outcomes at 6 and 12 months posttreatment for 63 families receiving multidimensional family therapy. Greater use of in-session family-focused techniques predicted reduction in internalizing symptoms and improvement in family cohesion. Greater use of family-focused techniques also predicted reduced externalizing symptoms and family conflict, but only when adolescent focus was also high. In addition, greater use of adolescent-focused techniques predicted improvement in family cohesion and family conflict. Results suggest that both individual and multiperson interventions can exert an influential role in family-based therapy for clinically referred adolescents.

ID COMPETENCE; RELIGION; VALUES; STYLE
AB The purpose of the study was to determine whether well-established associations between authoritarian parenting and adolescent adjustment pertain to conservative Protestant (CP) families. Structural equation modeling was used to test paths from biological fathers' authoritarian parenting to adolescent adjustment in 65 CP versus 170 comparison families in the Nonshared Environment and Adolescent Development Study (NEAD; D. Reiss et al., 1994). The hypothesis that adolescents in CP families would be less harmed by authoritarian parenting than would adolescents in control families was partially supported: Authoritarian parenting directly predicted greater externalizing and internalizing for adolescents in control families but not for adolescents in CP families. In contrast, parents' religious affiliation failed to moderate the negative associations between authoritarian parenting and positive adjustment. Understanding family processes specific to the CP subculture is important for helping these families raise competent children.

AB The authors' goal in conducting this study was to explore the association between temperament and future-oriented decision making. Forty-three preschoolers (mean age = 51 months) were given a child variant of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and asked to choose between a deck with higher immediate rewards and a deck with higher future rewards. Children who were higher on the Extraversion/Surgency factor of the Child Behavior Questionnaire chose more frequently from the higher immediate rewards deck early in the game. The externalizing dimension of Negative Affectivity (anger/frustration, soothability and discomfort) made the greatest contribution to prediction of performance in the last block of the game. Children who were more easily frustrated and had difficulty regulating negative emotions chose more from the deck with higher immediate rewards. There was a significant interaction between the externalizing dimension of Negative Affectivity, the internalizing dimension of Negative Affectivity (sadness and fear) and Extraversion/Surgency on the last block. These results suggest a complex association between IGT performance and temperament in preschoolers.

DT Article
DE adjustment; Down syndrome; siblings
ID DISABILITIES; FAMILIES; BEHAVIOR; PEERS
AB Background A number of methodological weaknesses have contributed to our relatively poor understanding of the impact on children of having a brother or sister with a disability. These include a focus on poor adjustment, using multidiagnostic groups, inadequate matching, and a failure to consider the perspectives of children and parents together.
   Method This study compared the adjustment of 53 siblings of a child with Down syndrome with a comparison group of siblings of children who were developing typically. Children were matched on a case-by-case basis for gender, age and position in family. Families were matched for family size and father's occupation. The age range of the target siblings was 7-14 years. Data were gathered from mothers, fathers and siblings.
   Results There were no significant differences between the groups on adjustment measures. These included parent perceptions of externalizing and internalizing behaviours, parent perceptions of sibling competence, and sibling perceptions of their own competence and self-worth. Associations between measures of adjustment and child reports of their contribution to household functioning depended on sex rather than group membership. There was an association between parental reports of externalizing behaviour and sibling relationships with the brother/sister closest in age.
   Conclusions Having a brother or sister with Down syndrome does not inevitably lead to poor adjustment. Examination of within-family processes would appear to be more useful in identifying children at risk than merely group membership.

AB The present study reports on the replication of the core syndrome factor structure of the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents (ASCA) for a sample of 229 Native American Indian (Yavapai Apache) children and adolescents from rural north-central Arizona. The six ASCA core syndromes produced the identical two-factor solution as the standardization sample, an independent sample, and a sample of Native American Indians (Ojibwe) from north-central Minnesota. Principal-axis analysis using multiple criteria for the number of factors to extract and retain was used with varimax, direct oblimin, and promax rotations producing identical results and nearly identical factor structure coefficients. As with earlier studies, it was concluded that the ASCA measures two independent global dimensions of youth psychopathology (Overactivity and Underactivity) that are similar to the conduct problems/externalizing and withdrawal/internalizing dimensions commonly found in the child psychopathology assessment literature.

AB Objective: This pilot study evaluated outcomes for a modified 12-session protocol of cognitive-behavioral therapy for childhood traumatic grief (CBT-CTG) conducted between March 2004 and October 2005. CTG is an emerging condition characterized by a combination of posttraumatic stress and unresolved grief symptoms. This two-module treatment model consisting of sequential trauma- and grief-focused components was shortened from a previously presented 16-session protocol.
   Method: Thirty-nine children ages 6 to 17 years old with CTG and their parents received the modified 12-session protocol of CBT-CTG. CTG and posttraurnatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were assessed at pretreatment, after the trauma-focused module, and after the grief-focused module (at posttreatment). Child depression, anxiety, and behavioral symptoms, as well as parental depression and PTSD symptoms, were assessed at pre- and posttreatment.
   Results: Children reported significant improvement in CTG, PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and parents reported significant improvement in children's PTSD, internalizing and total behavior problems, and their personal PTSD symptoms. Although PTSD significantly improved only during the trauma-focused module of treatment, CTG improved significantly during both trauma- and grief-focused modules of treatment. Child satisfaction and parent satisfaction for this treatment protocol were also high.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the shortened CBT-CTG protocol, which is similar in the number of sessions to what many community child bereavement programs offer, may be acceptable and efficacious for this population. The CBT-CTG model requires further evaluation in randomized, controlled treatment trials.

AB This investigation addressed the question of how two forms of social cognitive reasoning - epistemic reasoning and adolescent egocentrism - interface with externalizing and internalizing forms of psychopathology during adolescence. Adolescents' epistemic reasoning (i.e., types of belief entitlement, or degree of doubt, held by an individual when confronted with contradictory sides of an issue), and imaginary audience and personal fable ideation, were assessed in a sample of 29 adolescent boys with behavioral problems and 30 of their peers without behavioral problems. To assess internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, teachers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-TRF). Results revealed that, compared to those without behavior problems, boys with behavioral problems were lower in epistemic reasoning. Further analyses revealed consistent relations between dimensions of social cognitive reasoning to specific forms of psychopathology. These findings suggest that social cognitive reasoning, particularly epistemic doubt, is important in understanding problem behaviors among typical and atypical adolescents.

AB The accuracy of screening methods for predicting children's internalizing, externalizing, or total behavior problems by 1-year follow-up were compared. Parents and teachers completed two screening measures each: a measure of exposure to multiple family risk factors (the Family Risk Factor Checklist: FRFC) and a simple nomination question of child risk status, which involved informants answering one question concerning whether they believed a child was at higher risk than average of developing a mental health problem in the future. Both parents and teachers were more accurate at identifying children at risk of externalizing than internalizing disorders. For parents, the FRFC showed similar sensitivity to simple nomination as a screen for predicting later total behavior problems, lower sensitivity for internalizing problems, and there was a nonsignificant trend for the FRFC to have higher sensitivity for externalizing problems than simple nomination. The specificity of simple nomination was somewhat higher than that of the FRFC for all three mental health outcomes. For teachers, simple nomination showed higher sensitivity than the FRFC for predicting internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems, but the difference was nonsignificant for internalizing problems. The specificity for both teacher screens was similar across mental health outcomes. For a population base rate of externalizing problems of 13%, teacher nominations for children at risk of externalizing problems had a sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 78%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 32%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94%. Teacher nominations of at-risk children had greater predictive accuracy than parent nominations. The simple nomination method shows promise as a cost-efficient screen. When screening children who did not yet have behavioral symptoms, both parent and teacher measures resulted in substantial misclassification errors. However, the use of these screening measures at a population level could benefit large numbers of children who subsequently receive selective preventive interventions.

AB The concurrent and predictive validity of the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV) were examined across gender and ethnicity using multiple outcome measures on a community-based sample of 130 adjudicated youths. The PCL:YV demonstrated concurrent validity with externalizing behavior problems but, it is important to note, was also associated with internalizing measures of negative affect. With a mean follow-up period of 3 years, the PCL:YV was found to predict general and violent recidivism in male, Native Canadian, and Caucasian youths. However, the PCL:YV demonstrated weaker concurrent and predictive validity with girls and failed to predict nonviolent recidivism in all subgroups. Implications of the findings for clinical practice are discussed.

AB Toddlers and Preschool children have been identified as being at risk for post-hospital behavioral sequelae, especially when confronted with an unanticipated intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization. The Purpose of this predictive secondary analysis was to determine demographic and clinical variables that could be assessed early during hospitalization to predict internalizing and externalizing behaviors and negative behavioral change of 2- to 7-year-old children at 3 and 6 months following an unanticipated critical care hospitalization (n = 163 mother-child dyads). The children's behavioral Predilections Prior to hospitalization (i.e., internalizing or externalizing behaviors) and sex, as well as elevated maternal state anxiety, marital status, and level of emotional care giving by mothers, significantly predicted child internalizing and externalizing behavior and Post-hospitalization behavior changes. Results suggest several risk factors that predispose children to poor outcomes following an unanticipated hospitalization that could be targeted for intervention to improve children's emotional and behavioral health.

AB The primary aim of the Michigan State University Twin Registry (MSUTR) is to examine developmental differences in genetic, environmental, and neurobiological influences on internalizing and externalizing symptoms, with disordered eating and antisocial behavior representing particular areas of interest. Twin participants span several developmental stages (i.e., childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood). Assessments include comprehensive, multiinformant measures of psychiatric and behavioral phenotypes, buccal swab and salivary DNA samples, assays of adolescent and adult steroid hormone levels (e.g., estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol), and videotaped parent-child interactions of child and adolescent twin families. To date, we have collected data on over 1000 twins, with additional data collections underway. This article provides an overview of the newly developed MSUTR and describes current and future research directions.

AB Aim: To examine the predictive capacity of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) on psychological problems at the age of 6 y. Methods: Eighty full-term infants of optimal health were evaluated at 3 d and 4 wk of age with the NBAS and at 6 y with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Inattention-Overactivity with Aggression Conners Teacher's Rating Scale (IOWA). Results: The NBAS clusters' predictive value was different at 3 d and at 4 wk. Orientation at 3 d and habituation at 4 wk were the best predictors of psychological problems. At 3 d, lower orientation scores and higher motor and habituation scores predicted higher scores in externalizing problems. Externalizing problems were least influenced by background variables. Only in girls were internalizing problems associated with lower orientation scores. At 4 wk, lower habituation cluster scores predicted higher scores in internalizing problems.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that the NBAS could be useful for identifying neonates at risk of later psychological problems.

AB The present study examined psychosocial risk factors that differentiated direct and indirect bully-victims from bullies, victims and uninvolved adolescents. A total of 7,290 (3,756 girls) students (ages 13-18 yr) from a region of Southern Ontario, Canada, completed a number of self-report measures to determine the relation between direct and indirect bullying and victimization and several psychosocial risk factors, including normative beliefs about antisocial acts, angry-externalizing coping, social anxiety, depression, self-esteem, temperament, attachment, parental monitoring and peer relational problems. ANCOVA and logistic regression analyses indicated that indirect bully-victims and victims were similar in demonstrating greater internalizing problems and peer relational problems than indirect bullies and uninvolved participants. Furthermore, adolescents involved in indirect bullying (bullies, bully-victims) reported a higher level of normative beliefs legitimizing antisocial behaviour and less parental monitoring (males only) than indirect victims and uninvolved participants. Only normative beliefs legitimizing antisocial behaviour distinguished direct bully-victims and bullies from victims and uninvolved adolescents. Results illuminate the distinct characteristics of direct and indirect bully-victims; theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

AB The purpose of this longitudinal, prospective study was to evaluate trajectories of smoking in a cohort of African-American and Puerto Rican young adults and describe personality and behavioral factors associated with specific smoking trajectory group membership. Participants consisted of African-American and Puerto Rican male and female young adults (N = 451, mean age 26) from an inner-city community. Data were collected at four time points over a period of 13 years using structured interviews. Interviews took place within the schools and the participants' homes. Scales with adequate psychometric properties were adapted from previously validated measures. Variables that were examined for this study came from the domains of internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, drug use, and demographic information. Data were analyzed using latent growth mixture modeling to explore discrete smoking trajectories. Logistic regression analyses were then used to examine the risk factors associated with the various smoking trajectory groups. Four trajectory groups were determined to best fit the data: nonsmokers, maturing-out smokers, late-starting smokers, and early-starting continuous smokers. Subjects who were unconventional, experienced intrapersonal distress, and used alcohol and illegal drugs were more likely to belong to one of the smoking trajectory groups than to the nonsmoking group. The early-starting continuous group scored highest on these personal risk attributes. The long-term impact of unconventional behavior, intrapersonal distress, and drug use on developmental trajectories of smoking support the importance of early intervention and prevention.

AB Context: Exploratory studies that generate testable models of how risk factors for childhood mental health problems work together over time are critical for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.
   Objective: To build models addressing the following 2 questions: (1) How early can we identify children at risk for mental health problems in third grade? (2) How do the risk factors work together over time?
   Design and Participants: We assessed a Wisconsin community sample 8 times, beginning during pregnancy. Three hundred seventy-nine families completed multi-informant reports (mothers, teachers, and children) of children's mental health symptoms in third grade.
   Main Outcome Measures: Symptom severity and directionality (externalizing vs internalizing).
   Results: The hypothesis was generated that family socioeconomic status (SES) defined different pathways to symptom severity. In low/middle SES families, children were at risk if their mothers were distressed during the infancy period, which was then associated with more generalized maternal and child distress and dysregulation during the preschool period. In high SES families, the picture was more complex, beginning with parental histories of depression and family psychopathology, which then led to greater family stress in the infancy period and maternal and child distress and dysregulation during the preschool period. For all children, social and academic impairment during the school transition was an important mediator. Two pathways to later symptom directionality consisted of one beginning with child sex and the other with child temperament.
   Conclusions: Most risk factors predicted symptom severity and not directionality. The risk factors for internalizing and externalizing problems may be much the same, and the same preventive interventions might be effective for both classes of problems. Furthermore, at risk children from high SES families might be identifiable as early as infancy, whereas those from lower SES families may be identifiable only as preschoolers.

AB Objective: The objectives of this study were to examine whether girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of having histories of abuse and to assess whether the presence of an abuse history may constitute a distinct subgroup of youth with ADHD.
   Method: We examined rates and correlates of child abuse in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 140) and a matched comparison sample of girls without ADHD (n = 88), all aged 6-12 years. A thorough chart review reliably established documented rates of physical and sexual abuse in both samples.
   Results: There were significantly higher rates of abuse for girls with ADHD (14.3%) than for the comparison sample (4.5%), with most of the abuse found in girls with the Combined as opposed to the Inattentive type. Higher rates of externalizing behaviors (including objective observations in a research summer camp) and peer rejection (indexed through peer sociometric nominations) characterized the subgroup of girls with ADHD with abuse histories compared to the subgroup without such histories, with moderate to large effect sizes. Subgroup differences regarding internalizing problems and cognitive deficits did not emerge. Findings regarding peer rejection were explained, in part, by higher rates of observed aggressive behavior in the abused subgroup.
   Conclusions: The findings raise important questions about the possible etiologic and/or exacerbating role of abusive trauma in a subgroup of children with ADHD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This multimethod, prospective study examined the nature of pathways between interparental hostility and withdrawal, parental emotional unavailability, and subsequent changes in children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and school adjustment difficulties over a 3-year period in a sample of 210 mothers, fathers, and 6-year-old children. The results of autoregressive structural equation models indicated that interparental withdrawal had a detrimental impact on all areas of children's adjustment, whereas interparental hostility had an indirect effect on subsequent changes in child adjustment. An intermediary role of parental emotional unavailability in links between interparental withdrawal and hostility and child outcomes was indicated, with specific, differential effects observed for fathers and mothers.

AB Children who report sexual abuse (SA) have been found to display a range of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. In the present study, a tree-based analysis was used to derive models predicting the variability of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems as well as dissociation symptoms in SA girls. Participants were 150 girls aged 4 to 12 years referred to a specialized pediatric clinic after disclosure of SA. The potential predictors taken into account included sociodemographic and abuse-related variables as well as maternal and family characteristics. The models obtained point to prior abuse as a salient variable in predicting outcomes of SA girls. Implications for the treatment for children disclosing SA are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB The developing HPA axis is under strong social regulation in infancy and early childhood and is vulnerable to perturbation in the absence of sensitive, responsive caregiving. Child maltreatment has complex, long-term influences both on basal cortisol levels and on HPA responsivity to pharmacological and psychological stressors, depending on current psychiatric status, current life adversity, age, and most likely, genetic factors. Among the more consistent findings, maltreated children with internalizing problems have elevated basal cortisol most often detected in early AM concentrations, whereas adults maltreated as children often exhibit low basal cortisol levels and elevated ACTH response to psychological stressors. To disentangle these complicated interactions, future research must take the above qualifiers into account, study the transition to puberty, explore the moderating role of candidate genes, and utilize animal models and pharmacological challenges, when ethical, to localize changes in the HPA axis. Post-institutionalized children may provide a model to separate early adverse care histories from current adversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study describes the construction of a taxonomy of trait-related symptoms in childhood, the Dimensional Personality Symptom Item Pool (DIPSI), and examines the replicability of the taxonomy's higher order structure across maternal ratings of referred (N = 205) and nonreferred (N = 242) children and self-ratings of adolescents (N = 453). The DIPSI's 4 higher order factors-that is, Emotional Instability, Disagreeableness, Introversion, and Compulsivity-showed clear correspondence with the dimensions of personality pathology found in adulthood (Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire; W. J. Livesley, 1990; Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality; L. A. Clark, 1993). These 4 factors can be further organized into 2 superfactors, representing Internalizing and Externalizing Traits, demonstrating empirical and conceptual relationships with psychopathology models in childhood and adulthood. The implications for the assessment and conceptualization of early trait patholygy are discussed in the context of an integrative developmental perspective on the construction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition.

AB Children's internalizing problems are a concerning mental health issue, due to significant prevalence and continuity over time. This study tested a multivariate model predicting young children's internalizing behaviors from parenting practices, parents' anxiety-depression and family stressors. A community sample of 2 year old children (N = 112) was followed longitudinally to 4 years. Parents completed questionnaires and playroom observations provided independent measures of parenting and child variables. Predictors of early childhood internalizing difficulties were over-involved/protective parenting, low warm-engaged parenting, and parental anxiety-depression. Family life-stress and parental anxiety-depression also predicted problematic parenting practices. These findings were discussed within the context of the design of early childhood parenting programs to prevent anxiety and depression in children. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative examination was made of the association of parental mood and anxiety disorders with severity of disability within a large sample of young children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Maternal recurrent mood disorders were associated with elevated cognitive and adaptive functioning in their affected children, parent reports of increased behavior problems and teacher reports of an internalizing behavioral style. Maternal histories of anxiety disorders and paternal depression or anxiety disorders were not associated with levels of adaptive/cognitive functioning or levels of maladaptive behaviors in the children. Various genetic models are discussed. It is hypothesized that genes associated with recurrent depression in women may exert a "protective" effect on cognition and adaptive functioning in children with PDD.

ID BEHAVIORAL-PROBLEMS; SAMPLE
AB The aim of the study was to provide a standardization of self-reported competences and emotional/behavioural problems in Spanish adolescents, using the Achenbach's Youth Self-Report (YSR), and to compare our results to those from other countries. The YSR was completed by 2822 adolescents aged 11-18 years, recruited from secondary schools in two regions of Spain. There were significant differences in Total behaviour problems and in most problem scales in boys and girls, scoring boys higher on externalizing syndromes, whereas girls score higher on internalizing syndromes. Males' mean scores were higher than females' scores for social competence. Age effects also showed significant differences with respect to internalizing problems, thought problems, social problems and depression. Cutoff points based on the 90(th) and 98(th) percentile developed from this sample are presented for the competences and the problem scales. To test the overall range of variations across cultures, comparisons were made between broad band and narrow band measures of the YSR in Spanish adolescents and those from other countries. Gender differences in the YSR were similar to those found across different cultures; there is a consistent trend to increase behavioural problems with age; and social competence seem to be a relevant protective factor against behavioural problems.

AB Given high rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosed in children, knowledge of effective treatment is crucial. To this end, a meta-analysis of parent-involved psychosocial treatment was undertaken to determine its effect on a number of outcomes salient to children with ADHD. Sixteen studies met the criteria for the meta-analysis. Findings indicated that the impact of treatment on ADHD was low compared to comparison and/or control conditions, whereas child-internalizing symptoms and academic problems were better affected by family involvement. Teachers reported the highest effect sizes followed by parents themselves. Although parent involvement might be important for affecting the internalizing symptoms and academic problems that plague children with ADHA ADHD and externalizing symptoms might be better targeted by other interventions.

AB Background: Previous studies have shown that when assessing child psychopathology, parents tend to report more symptoms than children for externalizing disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), whereas children tend to report more symptoms for internalizing disorders such as major depression. Whether for clinical or research purposes, parents are also frequently asked to report on their children's experiences with alcohol and drugs. The purpose of this study was to analyze correspondence between adolescent and parent reports of adolescent substance use and abuse or dependence.
   Methods: In the current study, 591 subjects 12 to 17 years old were interviewed using the child version of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (C-SSAGA) as part of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). One parent was also interviewed about each adolescent using the parent version of the C-SSAGA. Sensitivities, specificities, and kappa coefficients were calculated to assess parental agreement with adolescent reports of lifetime substance use and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Third Revision substance abuse or dependence.
   Results: The results indicate that parents are somewhat knowledgeable about their children's use of substances, particularly those that are used most commonly. For example, 55% of adolescents who had smoked cigarettes, 50% who had used alcohol, and 47% who had used marijuana had a parent who knew that they used. However, parents were less aware of substance-related problems experienced by their offspring, agreeing with adolescent reports only 27% of the time for diagnoses of alcohol abuse or dependence and 26% of the time for diagnoses of marijuana abuse or dependence. Parent reports added few cases of substance use for 12- to 13 year-olds and essentially no cases for 16- to 17-year-olds. Parent reports added a nominal number of diagnoses of substance abuse or dependence for older adolescents.
   Conclusions: Whether for clinical or research purposes, the results emphasize the importance of directly assessing adolescents regarding alcohol and other substance use disorders. Furthermore, investigators should consider the specific disorder(s) being investigated and the ages of the children being studied when determining whether to include parent reports as part of study design.

AB This study examined the role of parenting, family routines, family conflict, and maternal depression in predicting the social skills and behavior problems of low-income African American preschoolers. A sample of 184 African American mothers of Head Start children completed participant and child measures in a structured interview. Results of regression analyses revealed that mothers who utilized more positive parenting practices and engaged in more family routines had children who displayed higher levels of total prosocial skills. Positive parenting and lower levels of maternal depressive symptoms were predictive of fewer externalizing and internalizing child behavior problems. Lower family conflict was linked with fewer externalizing problems. Implications of the study for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB The study examined practices by pediatric residents (n = 61) concerning psychosocial care during well child visits. A random sample (n = 719) of well child visits was selected, and a medical record review was conducted. Results suggested that a behavioral health issue was discussed in 38% of the cases. The most frequent type of problem discussed involved a medical component, while problems with mood were rarely discussed (<1%). Residents treated 67% of the cases and referred 20% of the cases with behavioral health concerns. Logistic regression suggested that residents were significantly more likely to treat medically focused problems (P = 0.05), but more likely to refer children with social/environmental or learning problems (P = 0.05). Results suggested the need for further training in recognition of internalizing disorders.

AB Purpose. To examine the relevance of physical disabilities for self-worth and perceived competence in children with cerebral palsy ( CP), and to examine associations between behaviour problems and self-worth and perceived competence.
   Methods. The Harter scales for self-worth and perceived competence and a new scale for perceived motor competence were used in a sample of 80 children with CP. Their motor functioning was assessed with the Gross Motor Functioning Measure ( GMFM) and behaviour problems with the Child Behaviour Check List administered to parents.
   Results. Self-worth and perceived competence for children with CP were comparable to the Dutch norm sample, except for perceived athletic competence. Within the CP sample, the GMFM showed a domain-specific effect on perceived motor competence. In the multivariate analysis, internalizing problems were associated negatively with all perceived competence scales and self-worth, whereas aggression was positively associated with perceived motor competence, physical appearance, and self-worth.
   Conclusions. Children with CP appear resilient against challenges posed to their self-worth caused by their disabilities. The relevance of the physical disability appears to be domain specific. For internalizing problems and aggression, different theoretical models are needed to account for their associations with self-worth and perceived competence.

AB Objective To study the continuity of psychopathology from the age of 3-12 years. Methods In a population-based birth cohort, children's emotional and behavioral problems were assessed at age 3 using the Child Behavior Checklist 2-3 (CBCL 2-3), and at age 12 by parents using the CBCL 11-18, and the Youth Self Report (YSR) completed by the children. Behavioral ratings were obtained from 800 subjects at both time points. Results externalizing problems at age 3 predicted both externalizing and internalizing problems among both genders in preadolescence. In girls, internalizing behavior at age 3 predicted parent-reported internalizing behavior, and associated negatively with externalizing behavior in self-reports at age 12. Aggressive behavior was found to be remarkably stable, and both aggressive and destructive behavior independently predicted a wide range of later externalizing and internalizing problems. Parent ratings of withdrawal showed stability from early childhood to preadolescence in both genders. Somatic complaints of 3-year-old girls independently predicted both externalizing and internalizing problems. Conclusions The results show the complexity of pathways in psychopathology from early childhood to preadolescence. In particular, aggressive and destructive behaviors in very early childhood predict later problems and necessitate early recognition and possible intervention at an early age. An instrument like the CBCL 2-3 is valuable in the early detection of children at risk of long-term problems.

AB This study extended previous research on mental health utilization to a sample of 214 preadolescent children and their caregivers. Predictors of two distinct phases of service utilization were tentatively examined in multivariate analyses: caregivers' perceptions that children needed services and receipt of those services by children. Of these children, 24.8% were perceived by their caregivers as needing mental health services; 11.7% received mental health services and 13.1% did not. Internalizing behavioral problems increased children's likelihood of being seen as needing services, but failed to increase likelihood of receiving services. Four factors predicted receipt of mental health services: relative lack of poverty, non-African American ethnicity, externalizing behavior problems, and child history of maltreatment. Implications for services targeted at preadolescent children are discussed.

AB This study examined child characteristics and family factors as predictors of stress in the biological or adoptive parents of 6- to 12-year-old children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Impaired executive functioning, poorer adaptive functioning, externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, and adoptive parent status all made significant and independent contributions to the prediction of higher levels of child domain stress, as reported by parents on the Parenting Stress Index. Biological parent status and fewer family resources were associated with higher levels of parent domain stress. Teacher ratings of the child's executive functioning impairments and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems also were associated with parent reports of child domain stress. Findings highlight the need to provide support not only to children with FASDs, but to their caregivers as well.

AB Aims Adolescent mental health problems require treatment and care that are adapted to their needs. To evaluate this issue, it was decided to implement a multidimensional instrument focused on a global approach to adolescent social and behavioural functioning, combined with the ICD-10 classification. Methods The combination of an assessment interview and a classification tool enabled the method to integrate the measurement of several domains of patient-based outcome rather than focus on the measurement of symptoms. A group of 68 adolescents from an inpatient unit were compared with 67 adolescents from the general population. Results Results suggest that adolescents from the care unit adopt significantly riskier behaviour compared with adolescents from the control group. As expected, the main problems identified refer to the psychological and familial areas. A cluster analysis was performed and provided three different profiles: a group with externalizing disorders and two groups with internalizing disorders. On the basis of a structured interview it was possible to obtain information in a systematic way about the adolescents' trajectory (delinquency, physical and sexual abuse, psychoactive substance use). Conclusion It was shown that treatment and care should not focus exclusively on mental health symptoms, but also upon physical, psychological and social aspects of the adolescent. A global approach helps in the consideration of the multitude of factors which must be taken into account when working with people with serious mental health problems and may help to turn the care unit's activity more specifically towards the needs of these adolescents.

AB Objective To examine the associations between coping style, social support, self-efficacy, locus of control, maternal adjustment, and depressive symptoms in children with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) of childhood. Methods Fifty children with RAP (8-18 years) and their mothers were recruited from a gastroenterology clinic (GI) and community medical practices. Participants completed questionnaires that assessed coping style, social support, self-efficacy, locus of control, maternal adjustment, and psychological adjustment. Results Passive coping strategies such as isolating oneself from others, catastrophizing, and behavioral disengagement were associated with more child-reported depressive symptoms. Higher levels of self-efficacy and greater social support from teachers and classmates were associated with fewer child-reported depressive symptoms. Higher levels of maternal adjustment problems, higher social support from parents, and lower social support from classmates were associated with maternal reports of more child internalizing symptoms. Conclusions These findings suggest that coping style, self-efficacy, social support, and maternal adjustment are correlates of depressive symptoms in children with RAP.

AB Decisions about whether to include depressive, passive-aggressive, sadistic, and self-defeating disorders in Axis II have been made difficult by a relative dearth of data. We report the results of a study identifying potential defining features of these diagnoses and assessing their distinctiveness from other Axis II personality disorders (PDs). A national sample of experienced psychiatrists and psychologists used the SWAP-200 to describe a patient with a current axis II disorder or an appendix or deleted PD from DSM-II-R. We examined clinicians' descriptions of patients to identify their most characteristic features, and then applied an empirical clustering procedure, Q-factor analysis, to see whether versions of these disorders would emerge empirically. As currently conceptualized, only passive-aggressive PD was distinct from other PDs. When the data were subjected to Q-factor analyis, the first and largest grouping was a dysphoric (depressive) PD. A hostile-negativistic subcategory emerged that resembled passive-aggressive PD, along with a revised dependent diagnosis that included many self-defeating/masochistic features. The results suggest that a depressive or dysphoric personality may represent an internalizing spectrum of personality pathology, and that a hostile-negativistic PD may be distinct from the disorders in the text of DSM-IV. Sadistic and self-defeating PD do not appear to represent distinct disorders, although they include personality traits (sadism and revictimization) associated with distinct developmental histories.

AB The authors investigated the consistency with which stressful life events are reported by unaccompanied refugee minors during a 12-month follow-up period and analyzed to what extent demographic and psychopathology variables affected memory consistency. From a population-based sample of 920 unaccompanied refugee minors aged 12 to 18 years old, 63% completed the follow-up measurements. Younger participants and those with lower levels of internalizing behavior and posttraumatic stress at follow-up were more prone to memory inconsistencies. Moreover, younger participants and those with fewer inconsistencies were more likely to have obtained a temporary residence permit. Given the difference between accuracy and consistency, it is not warranted to interpret memory inconsistencies as an indication of lack of credibility when assessing traumatic life events in minors applying for asylum.

AB The current study compared levels of family processes, internalizing behaviors, and externalizing behaviors as well as developmental processes, namely the associations among family processes and measures of internalizing or externalizing behaviors, in native Swiss, 2nd and 1st generation immigrant adolescents (N=3,540). Findings provided evidence that both 2nd and 1st generation immigrant youth experienced higher rates of internalizing symptoms (depression and anxiety) than native Swiss youth. Comparisons of how individual family processes were associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors provided evidence of few differences across groups. Thus, developmental processes were largely invariant by immigrant status. Although the immigration process may increase the risk for internalizing and some externalizing behaviors, it does not seem to affect how key family processes are associated with measures of adolescent adjustment.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the test-retest stability of the Spanish version of Youth Self Report after 18 mo. for a sample of 357 Catalonian high school students (158 boys and 199 girls). At Time 2 the girls' scores increased on Delinquent and Aggressive Behavior scales and, therefore on Externalizing scores. At Time 2 the boys' scores increased on Attention Problems and Delinquent Behavior and decreased on Anxious/Depressed, Social Problems, and Internalizing scales. Significant differences in the remaining scales were not observed. The test-retest intraclass correlations for the broad-band scales ranged between .62 (Internalizing) and .68 (Externalizing) and for the narrow-band scales between .37 and .67. The correlations for girls and boys were similar but slightly higher for girls on Anxious/Depressed and Thought Problems.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent behavioral problem, yet many fundamental aspects of NSSI remain unknown. This case series study reports on the diagnostic correlates of adolescents with a recent history of NSSI and examines the relation between NSSI and suicide attempts. Data are from clinical interviews with 89 adolescents admitted to an adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit who engaged in NSSI in the previous 12 months. Results revealed that 87.6% of adolescents engaging in NSSI met criteria for a DSM-IVAxis I diagnosis (M=3.0, S.D.=2.2, range=0 to 8 diagnoses), including externalizing (62.9%), internalizing (51.7%). and substance use (59.6%) disorders. Most adolescents assessed also met criteria for an Axis II personality disorder (67.3%). Overall, 70% of adolescents engaging in NSSI reported a lifetime suicide attempt and 55% reported multiple attempts. Characteristics of NSSI associated with making suicide attempts included a longer history of NSSI, use of a greater number of methods, and absence of physical pain during NSSI. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic heterogeneity of adolescents engaging in NSSI, highlight the significant overlap between NSSI and suicide attempts, and provide a point of departure for future research aimed at elucidating the relations between non-suicidal and suicidal self-injury.

AB This paper focuses on whether a consistent difference by ethnicity existed in the clinical diagnosis of children and adolescents in two behavioral health service environments and reviews plausible explanations for such a difference. Key measures were clinical diagnosis and ethnicity, abstracted from the administrative dataset of a New Jersey behavioral health care organization during 2000-2002, and a data collection conducted for the State of Indiana during 1991-1992. Sample sizes were 5,394 and 10,437, respectively. Only primary diagnoses were used in this study, classified into externalizing versus internalizing disorders. Logistic regression was performed for the dependent variable of presence/absence of an externalizing disorder or internalizing disorder. A main effect for ethnicity was found; African American youth received more externalizing diagnoses than did European American youth (odds ratio 2.01 (CI: 1.73-2.33) in one sample and 1.67 (CI: 1.44-1.94) in the other); African American youth also received fewer internalizing diagnoses than European American youth (odds ratio 0.55 (CI:.48-.63) in one sample and 0.75 (CI: 1.64-.88) in the other. Potential explanations for these findings include: 1. Biopsychosocial origin; 2. Clinician bias; 3. Discordant normative behavioral expectations between parents and service providers; and 4. Interaction between differential expression of underlying pathology and tolerance for such expressions.

AB Background. This study investigates the posited relationship between learning to read, and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviours, during the transition from preschool to primary school.
   Methods. A total of 196 (104 boys, 92 girls) children participating in the Jyvaskyla Entrance into Primary School (JEPS) study were followed up six times during their transition from preschool to primary school. At each measurement, the children's reading performance was tested. Moreover, their internalizing and externalizing problem behaviour was examined by means of structured interviews.
   Results. The results showed that problems in reading acquisition predicted an increase in internalizing problem behaviour during the preschool year and first grade, whereas during the second grade they were associated with an increase in subsequent externalizing problem behaviour. Moreover, from preschool to the beginning of the primary school internalizing problem behaviour predicted subsequent externalizing problem behaviour. Later on during the first and the second primary school years, it was externalizing problem behaviour that predicted an increase in internalizing problem behaviour.
   Conclusions. The results of this study suggested that difficulties in learning to read, and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviours are developmentally linked in a cumulative manner.

AB Objective: Few studies of temperament have tested goodness-of-fit theories of child behavior problems. In this study, we test the hypothesis that interactions between child and parent temperament dimensions predict levels of child psychopathology after controlling for the effects of these dimensions individually.
   Methods: Temperament and psychopathology were assessed in a total of 175 children (97 boys, 78 girls; mean age, 10.99 years; SD, 3.66 years) using composite scores from multiple informants of the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory and the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. Parent temperament was assessed using the adult version of the Temperament and Character Inventory. Statistical analyses included multiple regression procedures to assess the contribution of child-parent temperament interactions after controlling for demographic variables, other types of child psychopathology, and the individual Temperament and Character Inventory and Junior Temperament and Character Inventory dimensions.
   Results: Interactions between child and parent temperament dimensions predicted higher levels of extemalizing, internalizing, and attention problems over and above the effects of these dimensions alone. Among others, the combination of high child novelty seeking with high maternal novelty was associated with child attention problems, whereas the combination of high child harm avoidance and high father harm avoidance was associated with increased child internalizing problems. Many child temperament dimensions also exerted significant effects independently.
   Conclusions: The association between a child temperament trait and psychopathology can be dependent upon the temperament of parents. These data lend support to previous theories of the importance of goodness-of-fit. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The author examined relations among demographic risk (income, maternal education, single-parent status), growth in temperament (fear, irritability, effortful control), and parenting (rejection, inconsistent discipline) across 3 years and the prediction of children's adjustment problems in a community sample (N = 190; ages 8-12 years at Time 1). Family income was related to higher initial levels of fear, irritability, rejection, and inconsistency and lower effortful control but was not related to changes in these variables. Higher initial rejection predicted increases in child fear and irritability. Higher initial fear predicted decreases in rejection and inconsistency. Higher initial irritability predicted increases in inconsistency, and higher initial effortful control predicted decreases in rejection. When growth of parenting and temperament were considered simultaneously, increases in effortful control and decreases in fear and irritability predicted lower Time 3 internalizing and externalizing problems. Increases in rejection and inconsistent discipline predicted higher Time 3 externalizing, although sometimes the effect appeared to be indirect through temperament. The findings suggest that temperament and parenting predict changes in each other and predict adjustment during the transition to adolescence.

AB Emotional and behavioural problems were investigated in children who have a parent with multiple sclerosis (MS), in relation to factors such as family dysfunction, parental depression and illness-related characteristics. The participants were 56 MS patients, their spouses and one randomly selected child aged 4-17 years, and a comparison group of 64 children and both their parents, none of whom reported somatic illness. Emotional and behavioural problems in the children were identified by reporting of both parents and self-report using the Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist and Youth Self Report respectively. Parental depression and family dysfunction were explored using the Beck Depression Inventory and Family Assessment Device, respectively. The data were analysed using independent samples t-tests for between-group comparisons, Pearson r correlations between children's problems and family dysfunction or parental depression, and multiple regression analyses for identifying predictors for children's problems. Children whose parents, especially mothers, had MS presented greater emotional and behavioural problems than comparison children. Children's problems were positively associated with maternal depression and family dysfunction. Family dysfunction predicted children's overall and externalizing problems, while the severity of impairment of the ill mother predicted children's internalizing problems. Implications of these findings for clinical practice are discussed.

AB In a recent review, the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders in non-treated adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders (SUD) in the general population was summarized. This review looks into the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in adolescents and young adults treated for SUD.
   A computerized literature search was conducted resulting in ten eligible studies.
   The prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders varied from 61% to 88%. Externalizing disorders, especially Conduct Disorder (CD), were most consistently linked to SUD in treatment seeking adolescents. Girls are distinguished by their high rate of comorbid internalizing disorders.
   Comparison with data from community and juvenile justice studies shows an ascending trend of comorbidity rates of externalizing disorders from community to clinical and finally to juvenile justice samples. It seems that young addicts with comorbid disorders are at high risk of ending up in the juvenile justice system.

AB Objective: To determine the prevalence of teacher-rated ADHD symptoms in Italian first-graders.
   Method: 1891 first-graders aged 6.6-7.4 years were evaluated using a 34-item DSM-IV-referenced ADHD teacher rating questionnaire which included all the 18 DSM-IV ADHD diagnostic criteria, some Oppositional-Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD), depression and anxiety symptoms, and questions about the child's social and scholastic impairment.
   Results Criteria for ADHD were met in 7.1% (n = 135) of the subjects (10.4% males and 3.8% females), 3.5% with the Inattentive subtype, 2.3% with the Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype and 1.3% with a Combined subtype. Internalizing (depression and/or anxiety) symptoms were reported in 25.9% of the subjects with ADHD symptoms, 17% showed externalizing symptoms (ODD or CD), and 12.6% showed both. Comorbid symptoms were 10 times more frequent than in subjects without ADHD symptoms. Inattentive subtype and scholastic impairment were more frequent in females, Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype and social impairment were more frequent in males.
   Conclusions: Even though the real prevalence of ADHD in first graders is presumably lower than that found in the present study, this screening procedure might allow detecting those children who could benefit from referral for more comprehensive assessments.

AB In the present study (1) intervention effects on children's preschool behavior problems were evaluated in a high risk sample with an overrepresentation of insecure adult attachment representations in 77 first-time mothers, and (2) predictors and correlates of child problem behavior were examined. Early short-term video-feedback intervention to promote positive parenting (VIPP) focusing on maternal sensitivity and implemented in the baby's first year of life significantly protected children from developing clinical Total Problems at preschool age. Also, compared with the control group, fewer VIPP children scored in the clinical range for Externalizing Problems. No intervention effects on Internalizing clinical problem behavior were found. The VIPP effects on Externalizing and Total clinical Problems were not mediated by VIPP effects on sensitivity and infant attachment or moderated by mother or child variables. Maternal satisfaction with perceived support appeared to be associated with less children's Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total Problems. More research is needed to find the mechanisms triggered by VIPP, but the outcomes could be considered as promising first steps in the prevention of disturbing, externalizing behavior problems in young children.

AB Aggressive behavior in childhood has long been separated into that which is proactively motivated and that which is reactive. We report a meta-analytic review of the existing empirical literature that examines the associations of each type of aggression with six indices of psychosocial adjustment: internalizing problems, emotional dysregulation and ADHD-type symptoms, delinquent behaviors, prosocial behavior, sociometric status, and peer victimization. Even though not detectable in most single studies, meta-analytic combination revealed that reactive aggression was more strongly related to most of the indices of adjustment than was proactive aggression. This difference was small, however, and we argue that the difficulty in detecting differential correlates is due to the high intercorrelation between the functions of aggression, which appears to be an artifact of traditional measurement procedures. It is recommended that future research use measures that provide distinct assessment of the functions in order to more clearly distinguish the correlates of proactive and reactive aggression.

AB Objective: To examine the link between childhood overweight status and elementary school outcomes.
   Design: Prospective study design: multivariate regression models examining the association between changes in overweight status and school outcomes between kindergarten entry and end of third grade, after controlling for various child, family and school characteristics.
   Subjects: Nationally representative sample of US children who entered kindergarten in 1998, with longitudinal data on body mass index (BMI) and school outcomes at kindergarten entry and end of third grade.
   Measurements: Wide range of elementary school outcomes collected in each wave including academic achievement (math and reading standardized test scores); teacher reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems (BP), social skills (self-control, interpersonal skills) and approaches to learning; school absences; and grade repetition. Measurements of height and weight in each wave were used to compute BMI and indicators of overweight status based on CDC growth charts. A rich set of control variables capturing child, family, and school characteristics.
   Results: Moving from not- overweight to overweight between kindergarten entry and end of third grade was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with reductions in test scores, and teacher ratings of social- behavioral outcomes and approaches to learning among girls. However, this link was mostly absent among boys, with two exceptions - boys who became overweight had significantly fewer externalizing BPs (P < 0.05), but more absences from school compared to boys who remained normal weight. Being always- overweight was associated with more internalizing BP among girls but fewer externalizing BPs among boys.
   Conclusion: Change in overweight status during the first 4 years in school is a significant risk factor for adverse school outcomes among girls but not boys. Girls who become overweight during the early school years and those who start school being overweight and remain that way may need to be monitored carefully.

AB Purpose: To investigate the prevalence of mental disorder and comorbidity among American Indian children aged 10-12 years from four U.S. reservations and five Canadian reserves in the Northern Midwest.
   Method: Specially, trained Native interviewers administered the Diagnostic Interview for Children-Revised for 11 diagnostic categories to 736 tribally enrolled children (mean age 11 years) and their female caretakers.
   Results: Prevalence rates are reported by child self-report, female caretaker reports, and combined caretaker-child reports. Twenty-three percent (combined caretaker-child reports) of the children met criteria for one of the 11 disorders and 9% met criteria for two or more of the disorders. Externalizing disorders were more prevalent than internalizing disorders or substance abuse disorders. The strongest predictor of child mental disorder was a depressed female caretaker.
   Conclusions: Nearly one-fourth of Native children met criteria for at least one mental disorder. The presence of early mental disorder is an important risk factor for substance use and mental health problems in later life. We need systematic research to identify risk and protective factors for early mental health problems and to identify barriers to services utilization so that we can develop empirically informed, culturally specific prevention programs that address these needs.

AB Objective. To develop a brief questionnaire for health care professionals to use in screening children with asthma for psychosocial adjustment problems. Method. The initial version of the Childhood Asthma Resiliency Questionnaire (CARQ) listed 85 items focusing on self-esteem, medical fears, peer relationships, family relations, stress, and depression. The number of items was reduced after focus groups and pilot testing. In pilot tests, 100 children with asthma completed the CARQ. Parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Another sample of 73 children with mild asthma was also obtained. Results. The total CARQ score was significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with Total Problems, Internalizing, and Externalizing Problems on the CBCL. Children with more hospitalizations and more days of school missed from asthma had significantly higher scores on the CARQ compared to children with less functional morbidity. Conclusion. The CARQ appears to be a useful brief measure to help clinicians identify children at risk for problems adjusting to asthma.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine if (1) children with migraine experience greater sleep disturbances than their siblings, (2) those with more severe migraine have greater levels of sleep disruption, and (3) these sleep disturbances lead to greater behavioral problems and more missed school. Children aged 6 to 18 years with a diagnosis of migraine for > 6 months, who had at least one sibling without migraine in the same age range, were identified through our neurology clinic database or at the time of the clinic visit. Parents completed the (1) demographic, general health, and migraine information questionnaire; (2) Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire; and (3) Behavior Assessment System for Children: Second Edition (BASC-2) Parent Rating Scales for each child. Cases with migraine had higher total sleep (P < .02), sleep delay (P < .03), and daytime sleepiness scores (P < .001) than controls. Cases with more severe migraines had higher total sleep (P < .01) and sleep duration scores (P < .03) than those with milder headaches. In cases, higher total sleep scores predicted greater behavior problems on all four composite scales on the Behavior Assessment System for Children: Second Edition (Extemalizing Problems, P < .05; Internalizing Problems, P < .005; Behavior Systems Index, P < .003; and Adaptability Skills, P < .006). We conclude that children with migraine are prone to greater sleep and behavioral disturbances than children without headache. Sleep disorders should be routinely queried and appropriate advice on sleep hygiene provided.

AB Background: The objective was to determine whether the pattern of environmental and genetic influences on deviant personality scores differs from that observed for the normative range of personality, comparing results in adolescent and adult female twins. Methods: A sample of 2,796 female adolescent twins ascertained from birth records provided Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire data. The average age of the sample was 17.0 years ( S. D. 2.3). Genetic analyses of continuous and extreme personality scores were conducted. Results were compared for 3,178 adult female twins. Results: Genetic analysis of continuous traits in adolescent female twins were similar to findings in adult female twins, with genetic influences accounting for between 37% and 44% of the variance in Extraversion (Ex), Neuroticism (N), and Social Non-Conformity (SNC), with significant evidence of shared environmental influences (19%) found only for SNC in the adult female twins. Analyses of extreme personality characteristics, defined categorically, in the adolescent data and replicated in the adult female data, yielded estimates for high N and high SNC that deviated substantially (p < .05) from those obtained in the continuous trait analyses, and provided suggestive evidence that shared family environment may play a more important role in determining personality deviance than has been previously found when personality is viewed continuously. However, multiple-threshold models that assumed the same genetic and environmental determinants of both normative range variation and extreme scores gave acceptable fits for each personality dimension. Conclusions: The hypothesis of differences in genetic or environmental factors responsible for N and SNC among female twins with scores in the extreme versus normative ranges was partially supported, but not for Ex.

AB Background: Child labor refers to a state when a child is involved in exploitative economical activities that are mentally, physically, and socially hazardous. There are no prevalence studies on the magnitude of psychiatric disorders among child laborers. Methods: A cross-sectional population survey was conducted in Addis Ababa using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents ( DICA). Subjects were a random sample of 528 child laborers aged between 5 and 15 years and comprising child domestics, street-workers and private enterprise workers. These were compared with 472 non-economically active controls. Results: The aggregate prevalence of any DSM-III-R childhood emotional and behavioral disorders was found to be 16.5%, with 20.1% and 12.5% among child laborers and controls respectively, OR 1.89 (95% CI, 1.34-2.67, p <.01). Internalizing disorders such as mood disorders were significantly higher among the laborers than the non-laborers, OR 6.65 ( 95% CI, 2.20-22.52, p.0001). Anxiety disorder was seen over twofold among child laborers while psychosocial stressors were one and half times more likely among the study subjects than controls. When all factors were taken into account, child labor status was the only significant factor in determining DSM-III-R diagnosis. Conclusion: In this study childhood emotional and behavioral disorders are found to be more common among child laborers than among non-laborers. We recommend a larger study to look into childhood disorders and risk factors in child labor. As part of the concerted effort, government, NGOs, and the public should at least view child labor as a menace in a child's development, with risk of psychosocial difficulties.

AB Background: Family process variables have been linked to child problem behavior, but recent research suggests that child ethnicity may moderate relations between family process and child outcomes. The current study examined how ethnicity moderates relations between parent conflict, parent - child relationship quality, and internalizing problems. Methods: A sample of 101 mother - child dyads was drawn from a larger longitudinal study of childhood-onset depression. Maternal reports of family process factors were used with child reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: The results indicated a moderating effect of ethnicity for multiple indicators of internalizing symptoms, such that child-rearing disagreement and low levels of mother - child openness were associated with internalizing problems only for European American ( not African American) children. Conclusions: Findings suggest that ethnicity moderates the effects of family process factors on child psychopathology. Ethnic differences may be accounted for by the normativeness of family processes and the meaning that children of different ethnic backgrounds assign to these processes.

AB Background: Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of CBCL, TRF, and YSR were understudied. This study aimed at examining their test - retest reliability and criterion validity. Methods: Three Chinese community and clinic samples were recruited in Hong Kong. The parents, teachers, and youths respectively completed the CBCL, TRF, and YSR. Results: The Chinese CBCL, TRF, and YSR were test - retest reliable and valid. However, there was score/case attenuation at retest. CBCL and TRF appeared to screen externalizing and ADHD problems better, while YSR screened internalizing problems better. Conclusions: Clinicians should be cautious about score/ case attenuation at retest while using CBCL, TRF, and YSR to chart patients' progress. They should also recognize their different strengths in screening various disorders.

AB Predictors of adolescent functioning were studied in an ethnically diverse sample of girls with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 140) and age- and ethnicity-matched comparison girls (n = 88) who participated in naturalistic summer programs during childhood. Over a 5-year follow-up (sample retention = 92%; age range = 11.3-18.2 years), conduct problems were predicted by hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) symptoms and noncompliance (NC). Academic achievement was predicted only by inattention symptoms, whereas school suspensions and expulsions were predicted by inattention symptoms (ADHD sample only), NC, and negative peer status. Substance use was predicted by NC and HI symptoms. Internalizing problems were predicted by HI symptoms, NC, and covert antisocial behavior. Finally, initial peer status was the only significant predictor of later negative social preference.

AB This study examined the frequency of peer victimization and psychological symptom correlates among youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Schwartz Peer Victimization Scale, Children's Depression Inventory, and Asher Loneliness Scale were administered to 52 children and adolescents diagnosed with OCD. The child's parent or guardian completed the Child Behavior Checklist, and a trained clinician administered the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS). Fifty-two healthy controls and 52 children with Type 1 diabetes (TID) who were administered the Schwartz Peer Victimization Scale as part of another study were included for comparison purposes. Greater rates of peer victimization were reported in youth with OCD relative to healthy controls and children with Type I diabetes (TID). Peer victimization in the OCD sample was positively related to loneliness, child-reported depression, parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and clinician-rated OCD severity. Peer victimization fully mediated the relation between OCD severity and both depression and parent reports of child externalizing behaviors and partially mediated the relation between OCD severity and loneliness. Recognition of the magnitude of the problem and contribution problematic peer relations may play in comorbid psychological conditions is important for clinicians who see children with OCD.

AB In this study, the authors examined the association between childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety and mood disorders in adolescence. They compared a group of 142 adolescents ages 13 to 18 years with a history of ADHD in childhood to group of 100 community-recruited adolescents without ADHD. The two groups did not differ in rates of anxiety and mood disorders in adolescence.Within the ADHD group, however, anxiety and mood disorders in adolescence were predicted by childhood externalizing disorder symptoms and social problems but not by childhood internalizing disorder symptoms. The current findings provided little evidence of an overall increased risk for anxiety and mood disorders in adolescents who had childhood ADHD. Children with ADHD who have more severe externalizing symptoms and social problems in childhood may be at elevated risk for certain internalizing disorders.

Shawn attended a fourth-grade classroom in a self-contained school that served students with emotional and behavioral disorders. During language and math classes, Shawn exhibited high rates of off-task behavior. His teacher viewed these behaviors as disruptive, creating lost instructional time for all students. Functional assessment data indicated that Shawn's off-task behavior was maintained by attention (positive reinforcement) and escape from tasks (negative reinforcement). A function-based intervention including a communication system, a self-monitoring component, and extinction resulted in improvements in Shawn's behavior. The classroom teachers and Shawn rated the intervention favorably. Limitations and directions for future research are offered.

AB OBJECTIVES. Associations between sleep and internalizing problems are complex and poorly understood. To better understand these covarying difficulties, genetic and environmental influences were estimated by using a twin design.
   METHODS. Three hundred 8-year-old twin pairs reported on their anxiety and depression by completing the Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and the Children's Depression Inventory. Parents reported on their children's sleep problems by completing the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire.
   RESULTS. Children reported by their parents to have different types of sleep problems self-reported more depression symptoms than those without. The correlation between total sleep-problem score and depression was moderate. That between sleep problems and anxiety was smaller and was not examined further. The association between sleep problems and depression was mainly explained by genes, and there was substantial overlap between the genes influencing sleep problems and those influencing depression. There was smaller influence from environmental factors making family members alike, and environmental factors making family members different decreased the association between sleep problems and depression.
   CONCLUSIONS. A range of sleep difficulties are associated with depression in school-aged children, and the overall association between the 2 difficulties may be largely influenced by genes.

AB This study examined the equivalence of the Child Behavior Checklist/1(1)/(2)-5 (CBCL/1(1)/(2)-5) in 682 parents of 2- to 4-year-old children stratified by parent race/ethnicity (African American, Latino, and non-Latino White), family income (low vs. middle-upper), and language version (Spanish vs. English). Externalizing Scale means differed by income and child gender. Internalizing Scale means differed by income and parent race/ethnicity. Differential item analyses showed that few items functioned differently by racial/ethnic, language, and income group. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that the Externalizing Scale provided a good fit with the data across racial/ethnic and income groups. However, model fit was improved for the Internalizing Scale when factor weights were allowed to vary. Findings support the equivalence of the CBCL/1(1)/(2)-5 when used with parents of low-income preschool children from African American and Latino backgrounds, although further study of the factor structure for the Internalizing Scale is recommended.

TI Consumer satisfaction trajectories of adolescents during in-patient

AB Objective: Patient satisfaction with in-patient treatment and other aspects of process quality is usually examined cross-sectionally (e g. at discharge). Therefore, the knowledge about changes in patient satisfaction and, related issues, such as participation and motivation during-the treatment period, is limited. This study describes the development of a questionnaire covering these topics and the course and variability in these domains for different subgroups.
   Method: The study group comprises 88 adolescents (48 females, 40 males; aged 13 to 18 years) who delivered altogether 1,003 data points (median per person is 8). The questionnaire consisted of 16 items that were administered to them by computer twice a week at adolescent wards in two psychiatric departments. Statistical analysis was done using hierarchical linear modeling (growth curve models), which is well suited for the analysis of data with different numbers of assessment points and missing data.
   Results: Psychometric properties of the questions were good. The trajectories for all items are very heterogeneous with regard to the level.. The trends (slope of the growth curves) are around 0 in general satisfaction, i.e. the adolescents stay on their different levels during the treatment period. Concerning participation, however, there are diverging trends, in particular between the two departments, which may reflect the difference in the treatment experience of the teams, whereas age, gender and diagnosis (internalizing vs. externalizing) play a minor role.
   Conclusion: Evaluation of process characteristics has turned out to be feasible in clinical routine and promising for further insights into process quality.

ID INVOLVEMENT
AB To date, research examining the role of peers in the development of substance use has focused almost exclusively on externalizing behavior problems without considering internalizing behavior problems. This is a notable omission in the literature, because there is some evidence to suggest that internalizing behavior increases risk for substance use, and peers are considered to be among the strongest proximal influences of substance use. The current study considered both internalizing and extemalizing behavior problems and examined peer socialization and selection models of alcohol use using a 2-year longitudinal design. We examined potential reciprocal relations between internalizing and externalizing behavior and affiliations with delinquent peers, and how these variables predicted initiation of alcohol use. Participants were 86 children (71% male) ranging from 912 years of age (M= 10.87). Results were consistent with socialization, whereby delinquent peer affiliations were associated with increases in externalizing behavior, and subsequently early initiation of alcohol use. There was also evidence to suggest that internalizing behavior served as a protective factor for delinquent peer affiliations and for early initiation of alcohol use. Implications of these findings for prevention and intervention efforts are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescent individuating and relating autonomies were compared to the concepts of detachment and public conformity. Participants included 573 junior high and 673 senior high school students. Each type of autonomy had a distinctive function in intrapsychic or interpersonal domains and clearly differed from detachment and public conformity. In the competing model analysis, individuating autonomy was more associated than relating autonomy with adjustment variables in the personal domain, such as the global and personal aspects of self-esteem, the personal aspect of happiness, and internalizing problems (mainly anxiety and depression). Relating autonomy was more associated than individuating autonomy with adjustment variables in the interpersonal domain such as social skills and externalizing problems (mainly aggression and delinquent behaviour).

AB The objective of this study is to validate the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) for the legal guardians of unaccompanied refugee minors residing in the Netherlands. The legal guardians (caseworkers) of the unaccompanied minors (N=920) that participated in the study all received a CBCL to report on the mental health of the unaccompanied minor. The guardians filled in and returned 478 CBCLs. The results of the hierarchical confirmative factor analyses support a one-factor and a two-factor structure of Externalizing and Internalizing scales equally well. Moreover, the fit of the original individual eight first order factor models of the a priori CBCL subscales was found to be moderate. The total, Internalizing, and Externalizing scales show good internal consistency. The construct and concurrent validity of the CBCL were also examined and found to be moderate to good. The findings of this study suggest that the CBCL is a reliable and valid measure for use by guardians to assess the maladaptive emotional and behavior problems of unaccompanied refugee minors.

AB Juveniles in secure confinement allegedly suffer from more mental health problems than their peers. This may reflect background and behavioral characteristics commonly found in clients of both mental health and juvenile justice systems. Another explanation is that mental disorders increase the risk of arrest. These interpretations were tested on a sample of Pittsburgh boys (n = 736). Findings indicate that arrested youth exhibit more attention deficit hyperactivity (ADH) problems, oppositional defiant (OD) problems, and nondelinquent externalizing symptoms prior to their first arrests compared to their never-arrested peers. However, arrested and nonarrested youth score similarly on prior affective and anxiety problems and internalizing symptoms. Net of delinquency, substance use, and other selection factors, internalizing problems lower the risk of subsequent arrest, whereas OD problems and nondelinquent externalizing symptoms increase it. ADH problems have no effect on arrest net of delinquency and substance use. These findings lend only partial support to the criminalization hypothesis. Whereas some mental health symptoms increase the risk of arrest, others elicit more cautious or compassionate official responses.

AB Longitudinal relations between mothers' expressivity, children's effortful control, and their problem behaviors were examined when children (N = 181) were 6.5-10 years old (T2) and again 2 (T3) and 4 (T4) years later. Mothers reported on their expression of positive and negative dominant emotion. Mothers and teachers reported on children's effortful control and externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. In structural equation models, variables exhibited consistency over time. Further, the relation between mothers' expressivity (positive minus negative dominant emotion) at T2 and children's externalizing problems at T4 was mediated by T3 effortful control. The same process of mediation,was significant for teacher- but not mother-reported internalizing problems. The results provide one explanation for how emotion-related socializing behaviors influence children's problem behaviors.

AB Research has revealed numerous negative consequences associated with the sexual objectification of women. Guided by the constructs of self-objectification and objectified body consciousness (OBC), the present study sought to extend the objectification literature by examining the reasons women report smoking cigarettes in relation to viewing oneself as an object. Undergraduate women (N = 146) completed questionnaire packets assessing OBC, body image, self-esteem, smoking behavior and smoking motives. The results showed that current smokers scored higher on OBC components than did never smokers, and body shame significantly predicted smoking cigarettes in order to control appetite and weight. The results suggest that internalizing the prescribed cultural standard for the female body, a proposed consequence of viewing oneself as an outsider, may play a role in the behavioral choices made by women with respect to smoking.

AB This study examined gender and age differences in children's psychological response to parental victimization in a convenience sample of African American children. Thirty youths, ages six to 12, whose parents had been a victim of community violence (that is, gunshot or stabbing), and a control group of 30 children matched on variables of race, age, gender, and neighborhood served as the sample for this study. Parents completed a demographics sheet and the Child Behavior Checklist. Data were collected within six weeks of parental victimization. No significant difference was found in male and female youths' internalizing and externalizing behavior at ages six to eight. However, beginning at age nine there was a significant difference in behavior. Youths exposed to parental victimization internalized and externalized to a greater degree than those children who were not exposed. Males externalized more than females, and females internalized more than males. Thus, the perceived trauma response may vary as a function of the child's gender and developmental level or age. These findings suggest that gender-specific response related to trauma exposure may begin as early as age nine.

AB This study examined the differential developmental significance of multiple domains of peer reputation in childhood for current and future competence and symptoms. Participants were 205 children from a normative school cohort who completed assessments in grades 3-6 and then again 10 years later. Through re-analysis of original data from the Revised Class Play (RCP; N=612), new narrow-band subscales were examined as distinct correlates and predictors of competence in age-relevant developmental tasks and psychological well being as indexed by internalizing symptoms. Findings support the differentiation of peer exclusion, withdrawal, and sadness within the broad sensitive-isolated domain of reputation, as well as the distinctive meaning of reputations for Popularity-Leadership and Prosocial Behavior within the broad Sociable-Leader domain. When the Sensitive-Isolated predictors were considered, academic and job competence at the 10-year follow-up were predicted uniquely and negatively by peer exclusion, problems in the social and romantic domains were predicted distinctively by withdrawal from peers, and internalizing symptoms were uniquely predicted by childhood reputation as Sad-Sensitive. When the Sociable-Leader predictors were considered, academic and (for ethnic minority youth) job success was predicted by a Prosocial reputation, social success was forecasted by Popularity-Leadership, and romantic competence was predicted positively by Popularity-Leadership and negatively by Prosocial reputation. Negative academic and job outcomes were also predicted by a childhood reputation as Aggressive-Disruptive. Results are discussed in relation to conceptualizing and measuring peer social competence and its relation to later adaptation.

The sample comprised 240 adolescents assessed in 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th grades regarding their level of peer and academic hassles and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to construct latent variables of hassles and internalizing and extemalizing syndromes. Results varied by informant about the teens' symptoms. For adolescent report, the stress exposure model fit the data best for internalizing syndromes; that is, higher levels of stressors predicted significantly higher levels of self-reported symptoms 1 year later. For mother report of adolescents' symptoms, the stress generation model fit the data best for both internalizing and externalizing syndromes; that is, higher levels of adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as reported by their mothers, significantly predicted higher levels of hassles 1 year later.

AB Background: Differences in service utilization indicating that boys use more mental health services than girls were analyzed to see if they could be explained by known correlates of service use. These correlates were arranged into individual ( severe emotional disturbance, level of impairment and externalizing disorders), family ( parental education, psychopathology and parental concern) and school factors ( difficulties with school work). The objectives were to understand and identify the factors accounting for gender differences in mental health service utilization in order to develop alternatives to promote equity in service delivery. Methods: A representative sample of 1,896 children 4 to 17 years of age and their primary caretakers were interviewed for this study. Reports of service use were obtained using the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between gender and service use, adjusting for known correlates. Results: Our results showed that, except for impairment, other individual, family and school factors did not explain gender differences in service utilization. Males with impairment were 2.87 times more likely to receive services than impaired females (p <= .01), and this result continued to hold true for impaired undiagnosed boys compared to impaired diagnoses-free girls (p <= .001). Conclusions: Our findings showed a service disparity between impaired boys and girls who did not meet criteria for a DSM IV diagnosis, but no observed differences in service use between boys and girls who met criteria for severe emotional disturbance ( SED). Continued investigations are necessary to analyze, assess and understand the different circumstances that bring boys and girls into treatment, followed by the development of appropriate intervention programs at the school and community levels.

AB In this study, the authors tested a social ecological model of illness management in high-risk, urban adolescents with Type I diabetes. It was hypothesized that management behaviors would be associated with individual adolescent characteristics as well as family, peer, and provider relationships. Questionnaires were collected from 96 adolescents in poor metabolic control and their primary caregivers. Variables in each system were correlated with illness management. Multiple regression demonstrated that higher externalizing symptoms, poorer family relationships, lower satisfaction with providers, and greater age contributed to the variance in illness management. Internalizing symptoms and peer relationships were no longer significant in the model. Results support a social ecological model of illness management in high-risk youths. Interventions grounded in social ecological theory are discussed.

AB In this longitudinal study, the bidirectional relations between parenting and friends' deviance, on one hand, and early adolescent externalizing and internalizing problem behavior on the other hand, are examined. Of the 650 adolescents (13- to 14-year-olds) who filled out the Youth Self-Report and questionnaires about their parents at two times within a 1-year interval, 141 adolescents could be paired, at both assessments, with the same best friend who also filled out the questionnaires. Stable friends were used as a control for selection effects within friendships. The results showed significant effects of adolescent externalizing and internalizing problem behavior on parenting 1 year later but not vice versa. Friends' deviance affected adolescent externalizing but not internalizing problem behavior over time. The inclusion of friends' self-reports about their own behavior and the examination of reciprocal effects seems to be a step forward in understanding the processes among parents, peers, and early adolescent problem behavior.

   VICTIMIZATION; WITNESSES; CONFLICT
AB Few studies have examined the adjustment of battered women and their children after exiting domestic violence shelters. Participants were 62 women who had endured severe partner abuse, completed a shelter program with their children, and resided in the community for at least 6 months. Field interviews concerned mothers' and children's abuse histories and included measures of maternal depression, maternal trauma, and child behavior problems. Nearly all women had lived violence free since shelter exit. Child internalizing behaviors were associated with direct abuse, maternal depression, and shelter program. Externalizing behaviors were related to maternal depression and shelter program. Neither severity of interparental violence nor maternal trauma symptoms was related to child behavior problems. Mothers' family-of-origin abuse predicted current satisfaction with child functioning, beyond the effects of maternal depression and child behavioral problems. Findings suggest a need for postshelter therapeutic services and further research addressing the adjustment of such families.

AB Using data from 453 adolescents in Wave 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households, we examine how multiple dimensions of nonresident father-involvement are associated with different dimensions of child well-being. Father-child relationship quality and responsive fathering are modestly associated with fewer externalizing and internalizing problems among adolescents. The quality of the motherchild relationship, however, has stronger effects on child well-being. Nevertheless, even if adolescents have weak ties to mothers, those who have strong ties to nonresident fathers exhibit fewer internalizing problems and less acting out at school than adolescents who have weak ties to both parents. Adolescents are worst off on a range of outcomes when they have weak ties to both their mothers and nonresident fathers.
