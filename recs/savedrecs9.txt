AB Adolescence is a period of rapid changes in all aspects of human development. It is at this stage that difficulties and mental health problems occur more often. The purpose of the study was to identify both internalizing and externalizing behavior reported by adolescent in high school. The sample was composed by 298 participants between 12 and 18 years old (M = 14.98, SD = 1.28), of both sexes, (54.4 % women) from two public educational institutions where the majority was enrolled in the 4th year of high school (33.6 %). The sample was selected in a non-probabilistic manner for convenience, and all the participants were informed of the purpose and activities of the study, of the voluntary nature of their participation, and of the care to preserve the anonymity and confidentiality of all data collected. We used the self-report of young people between 11 and 18 years old (YSR 11-18, Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001) to identify the internalizing and externalizing behavior and their respective dimensions. The results show significant differences according to sex. Women scored higher than men in anxiety-depression, somatic complaints, attention problems, and internalizing behavior; while men scored higher in breaking the rules, and externalizing behavior.

AB The present study addresses the psychometric properties of the English version of the Dimensional Personality Symptom Item Pool (DIPSI), a comprehensive taxonomy of trait -related symptoms in childhood. The structural invariance of the English DIPSI and the original Flemish version was investigated in a large sample of Canadian (n = 341) and blemish (n = 509) adolescents, using both self and maternal ratings. The original 4-factor structure of the DIPS!, including the dimensions Emotional Instability, Disagreeableness, Introversion, and Compulsivity, was replicated in the Canadian sample across informants. Results provided support for metric invariance across the English and Flemish DIPSI Version, indicating that associations between variables across samples can be confidently made, although the meaning of specific items may slightly differ across the different DIPS1 versions. Across raters, the Flemish and English DIPSI dimensions showed a similar covariation pattern with internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. High intercorrelations between the DIPSI dimensions in both the Flemish and English version suggest low discriminant validity, potentially resulting from lower variance on personality pathology in general populations, from a general pathology factor, or from developmental issues. To conclude, the English version of the DIPSI can be considered a promising tool for assessing

AB Family problem-solving therapy (FPST) has been shown to reduce behavior problems after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear whether treatment gains are maintained. We sought to evaluate the maintenance of improvements in behavior problems after a Web-based counselor-assisted FPST (CAPS) intervention compared to an Internet resource comparison (IRC) intervention provided to adolescents within the initial year post-TBI. We hypothesized that family socioeconomic status, child educational status, and baseline levels of symptoms would moderate the efficacy of the treatment over time. Participants included 132 adolescents ages 12-17 years who sustained a complicated mild-to-severe TBI 1-6 months before study enrollment. Primary outcomes were the Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing and Externalizing Totals. Mixed-models analyses, using random intercepts and slopes, were conducted to examine group differences over time. There was a significant groupxtimexgrade interaction (F-(1,F-304)=4.42; p=0.03) for internalizing problems, with high school-age participants in CAPS reporting significantly lower symptoms at 18 months postbaseline than those in the IRC. Post-hoc analyses to elucidate the nature of effects on internalizing problems revealed significant groupxtimexgrade interactions for the anxious/depressed (p=0.03) and somatic complaints subscales (p=0.04). Results also indicated significant improvement over time for CAPS participants who reported elevated externalizing behavior problems at baseline (F-(1,F- 310)=7.17; p=0.008). Findings suggest that CAPS may lead to long-term improvements in behavior problems among older adolescents and those with pretreatment symptoms.

AB Childhood traumatic brain injury (CTBI) is one of the most common causes of impairment in children and adolescents, with psychosocial difficulties found to be the most persisting. Given that the transition into adolescence and adulthood can be a stressful period, it is likely that young people who have sustained a CTBI will be more vulnerable to developing psychosocial problems. To date, most research has focused on psychosocial development up to five years following a CTBI and it is unclear how survivors develop in the long-term as young adults. The aim of this research was to track the long-term psychosocial outcomes of children with CTBI and compare them with healthy controls over a period of 16 years. Seventy-five participants with a CTBI and 29 control participants were followed up at five time-points over a period of 16 years. To measure psychosocial functioning (social skills, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms), questionnaires were completed by the primary caregiver acutely (pre-injury baseline), then six months, five years, 10 years, and 16 years post-injury. No significant group differences were found regarding the developmental trajectory of social skills, or internalizing and externalizing symptoms between the CTBI and control groups. The severe CTBI group demonstrated a trend of lower social skills, while the mild CTBI group showed a trend of higher internalizing and externalizing skills at six months, five years, and ten years post-CTBI event, compared with other groups. The mild CTBI group scored in the borderline range for externalizing symptoms six months post-CTBI; however, all other mean scores were within the normal range. Over a period of 16 years, young adults with CTBI showed similar developmental trajectories regarding psychosocial outcomes, compared with healthy controls. This study confirmed previous literature that CTBI is associated with increased levels of psychosocial problems.

AB Background: The reproductive safety of selective reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressants needs to be established to provide optimal control of maternal depression while protecting the fetus.
   Objective: To define a child's neurodevelopment following prenatal exposure to SRIs and to account for genetic and environmental confounders in a sibling design using the Toronto Motherisk prospective database.
   Method: Intelligence and behavior of siblings prenatally exposed and unexposed to SRIs were assessed by using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Third Edition, Child Behavior Checklist, and Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised and subsequently compared. Mothers, diagnosed with depression using DSM-IV, were assessed for intelligence quotient (IQ) and for severity of depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Prenatal drug doses and durations of exposure, child's age, child's sex, birth order, severity of maternal depression symptoms, and Full Scale IQ, the primary outcome measure, of both the mother and the child were considered in the analyses.
   Results: Forty-five sibling pairs (ages 3 years to 6 years 11 months, prenatally exposed and unexposed to SRIs) did not differ in their mean +/- SD Full Scale IQs (103 +/- 13 vs 106 +/- 12; P = .30; 95% CI, -7.06 to 2.21) or rates of problematic behaviors. Significant predictor of children's intelligence was maternal IQ (P = .043, beta = 0.306). Severity of maternal depression was a significant predictor of Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing (P = .019, beta = 0.366), Externalizing (P = .003, beta = 0.457), and Total scores (P = .001, beta = 0.494). Drug doses and durations of exposure during pregnancy did not predict any outcomes of interest in the exposed siblings.
   Conclusions: SRI antidepressants were not found to be neurotoxic. Maternal depression may risk the child's future psychopathology. The sibling design in behavioral teratology aids in separating the effects of maternal depression from those of SRIs, providing stronger evidence in clinical decision-making.

AB Although clinical observations suggest that youth with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are unable to down-regulate physiological fear responses in innocuous situations, to date no studies have directly addressed this question. In this report we lay the groundwork for future investigation of the emotion regulation processes of youth with obsessive compulsive (OC) symptoms. Using a non-clinical community sample of school-aged children, we evaluated the association between parent-reported child OC symptoms and children's startle responses to experimental conditions with differing levels of threat. Children with higher OC symptoms evidenced signs of context insensitivity in their startle response and greater subjective distress. Specifically, greater OC symptoms were associated with higher startle magnitude during baseline and safe conditions, but lower startle magnitude during threat. Our findings have important implications for the conceptualization and assessment of emotion regulation difficulties among children displaying OC symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   PATTERNS; CHILDREN
AB Objective: The age-at-onset criterion for separation anxiety disorder was removed in DSM-5, making it timely to examine the epidemiology of separation anxiety disorder as a disorder with onsets spanning the life course, using cross-country data.
   Method: The sample included 38,993 adults in 18 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health Surveys. The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess a range of DSM-IV disorders that included an expanded definition of separation anxiety disorder allowing onsets in adulthood. Analyses focused on prevalence, age at onset, comorbidity, predictors of onset and persistence, and separation anxiety-related role impairment.
   Results: Lifetime separation anxiety disorder prevalence averaged 4.8% across countries (interquartile range [25th-75th percentiles]=1.4%-6.4%), with 43.1% of lifetime onsets occurring after age 18. Significant time-lagged associations were found between earlier separation anxiety disorder and subsequent onset of internalizing and externalizing DSM-IV disorders and conversely between these disorders and subsequent onset of separation anxiety disorder. Other consistently significant predictors of lifetime separation anxiety disorder included female gender, retrospectively reported childhood adversities, and lifetime traumatic events. These predictors were largely comparable for separation anxiety disorder onsets in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood and across country income groups. Twelve-month separation anxiety disorder prevalence was considerably lower than lifetime prevalence (1.0% of the total sample: interquartile range=0.2%-1.2%). Severe separation anxiety-related 12-month role impairment was significantly more common in the presence (42.4%) than absence (18.3%) of 12-month comorbidity.
   Conclusions: Separation anxiety disorder is a common and highly comorbid disorder that can have onset across the lifespan. Childhood adversity and lifetime trauma are important antecedents, and adverse effects on role function make it a significant target for treatment.

AB This study investigated Mexican immigrant parents' reports of perceived workplace discrimination and their children's behavior, parents' moods, and parent-child interactions. Parents of one hundred and thirty-eight 3- to 5-year-old children were asked to complete one survey daily for 2weeks (N=1,592days). On days when fathers perceived discrimination, fathers and mothers reported more externalizing child behaviors, and mothers reported fewer positive child behaviors. When mothers perceived discrimination, they reported more externalizing child behaviors; fathers reported more internalizing child behaviors. Parents reported worse mood on days with perceived discrimination. Perceived discrimination was not strongly related to parent-child interactions. For fathers, but less so for mothers, those whose psychological acculturation indicated separation had more negative relations between daily perceived workplace discrimination and child and family outcomes.

AB Objective. The presented systematic review aims at giving a comprehensive overview of studies assessing the relationship between sedentary behavior and indicators of mental health in school-aged children and adolescents.
   Methods. Six online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus) as well as personal libraries and reference lists of existing literature were searched for eligible studies.
   Results. Ninety-one studies met all inclusion criteria. There was strong evidence that high levels of screen time were associated with more hyperactivity/inattention problems and internalizing problems as well as with less psychological well-being and perceived quality of life. Concerning depressive symptoms, self-esteem, eating disorder symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, no clear conclusion could be drawn. But, taking quality assessment into account, self-esteem was negatively associated with sedentary behavior, i.e. high levels of time engaging in screen-based sedentary behavior were linked to lower scores in self-esteem.
   Conclusions. Overall, the association between sedentary behavior and mental health indicators was rather indeterminate. Future studies of high quality and with an objective measure of sedentary behavior will be necessary to further examine this association as well as to investigate longitudinal relationships and the direction of causality. Furthermore, more studies are needed to identify moderating and mediating variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We examined discrepant parent-child reports of subjective distress and psychosocial impairment.
   Method: Parent-child pairs (N = 112 pairs) completed the Health Dynamics Inventory at intake for outpatient therapy.
   Results: Average parent scores were significantly higher than average child scores on distress, impairment, and externalizing symptoms, but not internalizing symptoms. There were significant associations between parent-child discrepancy (i.e. children who reported greater distress or impairment than parents or vice versa) and child endorsement of several notable symptoms (rapid mood swings, panic, nightmares, and suicidal ideation).
   Conclusion: Parents tended to report more externalizing symptoms, distress, and impairment than children reported; however, when children report more distress and impairment than parents, this may indicate serious psychological problems.

AB Using data from the add-on 5-year cohort of In-Home Longitudinal Study of preschool aged Children of the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (FFCWS), we examined the mediating role of maternal warmth in the associations between positive and harsh maternal practices and children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. The sample consisted of 1,922 low-income Hispanic American, African American, and European American families. For European Americans, the links between maternal psychological aggression and hostility and children's externalizing behaviors were direct. Similarly, for Hispanic Americans, the links between maternal psychological aggression, physical assault, and hostility and externalizing behaviors were direct, as was the link between maternal physical assault and internalizing behaviors. For African Americans, maternal warmth partially mediated the links between maternal hostility and physical assault and externalizing behaviors. However, the associations between psychological aggression and externalizing and internalizing behaviors were direct. The data are discussed with respect to similarities in cultural pathways of influence between harsh maternal treatment and children's behavioral difficulties across ethnic groups.

AB Purpose: Prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure has been shown to increase DNA adduct levels and to affect neurodevelopment. Micronutrients may modify the adverse effect of PAH on neurodevelopment. Thus, we examined if micronutrient concentrations modified the association between PAH exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
   Methods: 151 children from a birth cohort who had micronutrient concentrations measured in cord blood and completed the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), between the ages of 6 and 9 years, were evaluated. Prenatal airborne PAH exposure was measured by personal air monitoring. The betas and 95% CI for the associations of antioxidant concentrations and PAH exposure with each of the outcomes of CBCL raw score and dichotomized standardized T-score (based on clinical cutpoints) were estimated, respectively, by multivariable poisson and logistic models.
   Results: Children below the median for alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol concentrations, compared to those above, were more likely to have thought problems, aggressive behavior and externalizing problems (p < 0.05). Lower carotenoid concentration was associated with more thought problems (MV beta= 0.60, p < 0.001) and externalizing problems (MV beta=0.13, p < 0.05) for the same contrast. No statistically significant associations were observed between retinol concentrations and neurodevelopmental symptoms. Overall, no consistent patterns were observed when we examined the interaction between antioxidants (e.g., alpha-tocopherol) and PAH in relation to CBCL symptoms (e.g., internalizing and externalizing problems, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Lower alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol and carotenoid levels may adversely affect healthy neurodevelopment, even after accounting for PAH exposure. Future research to confirm these findings are warranted given the importance of identifying modifiable factors for reducing harmful PAH effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The multiple-family group intervention is an effective, yet affordable, 8-week treatment that is conducted in a juvenile correctional institution in Alabama with adolescents who sexually offend and their families. Data from 115 incarcerated male adolescents and their male and female caregivers collected at pre-, post-, and 1-year follow-up were used to determine that problem behaviors (internalizing, externalizing) decreased over pre- and posttest and the significant decreases in maladaptive emotion regulation predicted those changes. Adolescent-reported anxiety over abandonment and attachment dependence on parents increased significantly; these changes were predicted by decreases in maladaptive emotion regulation. Linear growth models were also fit over the 3 time points and indicate decreases in adolescent problem behavior and maladaptive emotion regulation.

AB BackgroundFew epidemiologic studies have examined a full range of adolescent psychiatric disorders in the general population. The association between psychiatric symptom clusters (PSCs) and DSM-IV alcohol use disorders (AUDs) among adolescents is not well understood.
   MethodsThis study draws upon the public-use data from the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, including a study sample of 19,430 respondents aged 12 to 17. Logistic regression and exploratory structural equation modeling assess the associations between PSCs and DSM-IV AUDs by gender. The PSCs are based on brief screening scales devised from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Predictive Scales.
   ResultsSeveral PSCs were found to be significantly associated with DSM-IV AUDs, including separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder among both genders, and panic disorder and obsessive/ compulsive disorder among females. Consistent with the literature, the analysis of PSCs yields 3 factors identical for both genders2 internalizing factors (fear and anxiety-misery) and 1 externalizing factor. Adolescents who scored higher on the externalizing factor tended to have higher levels of the AUD factor. Female adolescents who scored higher on the internalizing misery factor and lower on the internalizing fear factor also tended to have higher levels of the AUD factor.
   ConclusionsThe associations that we found between PSCs and AUDs among adolescents in this study are consistent with those found among adults in other studies, although gender may moderate associations between internalizing PSCs and AUDs. Our findings lend support to previous findings on the developmentally stable associations between disruptive behaviors and AUDs among adolescents as well as adults in the general population.

AB BackgroundIn DSM-5, the agoraphobia core symptom criterion has been revised to require fear about multiple situations from across at least two distinct domains in which escape might be difficult or panic-like symptoms might develop. The present study examined patterns and correlates of the recent change in a sample of anxious youth with symptom presentations consistent with the DSM-IV agoraphobia definition and/or specific phobia (SP) to consider how the recent diagnostic change impacts the prevalence and composition of agoraphobia in children and adolescents.
   MethodAnalyses (N = 151) evaluated impairment and correlates of agoraphobic youth who no longer meet the DSM-5 agoraphobia criteria relative to agoraphobic youth who do meet the new DSM-5 criteria. Secondary analyses compared agoraphobic youth not meeting DSM-5 criteria to SP youth.
   ResultsOne-quarter of youth with symptom presentations consistent with the DSM-IV agoraphobia definition no longer met criteria for DSM-5 agoraphobia, but showed comparable severity and impairment across most domains to youth who do meet criteria for DSM-5 agoraphobia. Further, these youth showed higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and internalizing psychopathology relative to youth with SP.
   ConclusionsA substantial proportion of impaired youth with considerable agoraphobic symptom presentations have been left without a specified anxiety diagnosis by the DSM-5, which may affect their ability to receive and/or get coverage for services and their representation in treatment evaluations. Future DSM iterations may do well to include a circumscribed agoraphobia specifier that would characterize presentations of fear or anxiety about multiple situations, but that do not span across at least two distinct situational domains.

AB Moderately preterm (MP) birth is associated with higher rates of behavioural and emotional problems. To determine the extent to which low socioeconomic status (SES) contributes to these higher rates, we assessed independent and joint effects of MP birth and low SES, overall and by gender. Dutch preventive child health care centres provided a population-based sample of 915 MP children (32-36 weeks gestation) and 543 term-born children, born in 2002/2003. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, we determined the risk of behavioural and emotional problems per standard deviation (SD) decrease in gestational age and SES, using standardized measures for both. We also assessed three SES categories, being low (1SD or more below mean of standardized SES), intermediate (mean +/- A 1SD), and high (greater than mean + 1SD). The Child Behavior Checklist for 1.5-5 years was used to assess behavioural (externalizing), emotional (internalizing), and total problems at age 4 years. MP children with low SES had significantly higher total problem scores than those with high SES (11.3 vs. 5.1 %, respectively). Each SD decrease in SES was associated with a 42 % higher odds of elevated total problem scores (OR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.14-1.77). No joint effects were found, meaning that lower gestational age independently added to the risk of behaviour problems (OR 1.24, 95 % CI 1.00-1.56). Effects of MP birth and low SES were more pronounced in girls. In conclusion, MP birth and low SES multiply the risk of behavioural and emotional problems. The combination of risk factors identifies children who could benefit greatly from early intervention.

AB Foster parents need access to supports and resources in order to be satisfied with their caregiving role and continue providing foster care services. However, they often experience multiple demands in their role as a substitute caregiver that could lead to stress. Child behaviors especially may be a significant factor when considering sources of strain and may be a potential risk factor for negative outcomes such as dissatisfaction or the decision to discontinue providing foster care. The purpose of this study was to examine whether child disruptive behaviors moderated or influenced the nature or strength of the relationship between foster parent supports and satisfaction as a caregiver as well as intent to continue fostering. The sample consisted of 155 licensed foster caregivers from across the United States. Child behaviors served as a significant moderator between some types of supports and satisfaction. Implications for future research, practice, and policy are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While many youth are exposed to multiple forms of co-occurring violence, the comparative impact of different forms of violence on the mental health of children and adolescents has not been clearly established. Studies from low and middle income countries in particular are lacking. The present study examined the contribution of different forms of violence to internalizing and externalizing symptoms among young adolescents in South Africa. A community-based sample of 616 high school learners completed self-report scales assessing exposure to six different forms of violence and the severity of depression, aggression and conduct disorder symptoms. In bivariate analyses, all six forms of violence were significantly associated with internalizing and externalizing difficulties. When the contribution of all forms of violence to mental health outcomes was examined simultaneously, domestic victimization emerged as the strongest predictor of both internalizing and externalizing difficulties. Cumulative exposure to other forms of violence contributed further to the prediction of aggression and conduct disorder, but not depression. Recommendations for future research, and the implications of the findings for prioritizing the development of violence prevention and intervention initiatives in the South African context, are considered.

AB The current study examined patterns of psychopathology, drug and alcohol use, and sexual behavior associated with childhood abuse and neglect in a high-risk sample of low-income African American girls seeking mental health treatment. Participants (N = 177) were African American girls recruited from mental health clinics serving low-income communities in Chicago, IL and followed over six waves of data collection (T1-T6) reflecting early (mean age 14) to late (mean age 17) adolescence. Child abuse and neglect history was determined from adolescent and caregiver reports. Latent curve modeling examined patterns of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, drug and alcohol use, sexual experience, and risky sexual behavior reported by girls and associations with reported child abuse and neglect. Overall, these trajectories indicated a decrease in internalizing and externalizing symptoms, stability of drug and alcohol use, and an increase in sexual experience and risky sexual behaviors over time. Child abuse and neglect was associated with increased internalizing symptoms and sexual experience at baseline and with externalizing symptoms and risky sexual behavior both at baseline and the final point. Child abuse and neglect was not significantly associated with alcohol or drug use. This study adds to the literature on the long-term consequences of child abuse and neglect by demonstrating patterns of psychopathology and risky behavior that persist over time in a high-risk group of girls with self or parent reported histories of abuse and-neglect. Interventions that address externalizing problems and health risk behaviors may be of particular importance for this population. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB AimsTo explore associations between children's sleep problems, and behavioural difficulties and parenting approaches.
   BackgroundChildren commonly have problematic night waking; however, relationships between parenting cognitions and behaviours and children's sleep problems are rarely examined.
   DesignLongitudinal children's cohort study from 5-29months post birth.
   MethodsData were taken from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (1998-2007) at three phases: 5, 17 and 29months of age. Thousand four hundred and eighty-seven families were included in our study based on: participation from phase 1 (5-months old), both parents' reports on parenting cognitions/behaviours and child behavioural difficulties at 29months, and mothers' reports of children's sleep at 29months. In 2013, we conducted repeated measures anovas and manovas including children's gender.
   ResultsExtended night-time waking patterns (wakes of 20minutes) were associated with mothers' and fathers' lower sense of parenting impact and higher overprotectiveness and mothers' lower self-efficacy and higher coerciveness for 29-month-old children. In the extended waking group, mothers consistently reported lower self-efficacy, higher overprotectiveness and lower parenting impact at 5, 17 and 29months. For those children, fathers were only more overprotective at 5 and 29months. Regarding 29-month-old children's behaviour, children in the extended night waking group had highest scores on externalizing and internalizing behaviours. Girls had higher scores on shyness/inhibition and boys had higher scores on aggression/hyperactivity.
   ConclusionMothers' and fathers' parenting cognitions and behaviours are affected by 29-month-old children's night waking patterns and night waking patterns are associated with children's behavioural problems.

AB The study investigates whether cortical arousals and periodic limb movements during sleep are related to daytime psychological functioning in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis with associated nocturnal polyuria. Psychological functioning is evaluated on five domains: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-inattentive problems, quality of life, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and executive functioning. This multi-informant (parents, teachers, and children) and multi-method study included overnight video-polysomnography, questionnaires, and neuropsychological testing. Thirty children (7 girls) 6 to 16 years (mean 10.43 years, SD 3.08) were selected in a tertiary enuresis center. A high index of periodic limb movements during sleep was associated with a lower quality of life, according to the child. No significant correlations were found with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-inattentive problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and executive functioning.
   Conclusion: This study clarifies the relationship between sleep parameters and psychological functioning of the children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and associated nocturnal polyuria according to the child, the parents, and the teachers. Periodic limb movements during sleep are associated with a lower quality of life of the child.

AB Background: More knowledge is needed on potential associations between individual-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors and psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.
   Aims: To examine associations between, individual-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors and incident internalizing (anxiety and mood) disorders and externalizing (ADHD and conduct) disorders in children and adolescents, and to estimate the relative contributions of family and neighborhood to individual variation in these disorders.
   Method: We performed a three-level logistic regression on all 542,195 children born in Sweden in 1992 1996, nested in 427,954 families, which in turn were nested in 8475 neighborhoods. The children were followed from 2000 to 2010 for incident internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders, assessed from medical records.
   Results: 26,514 children (4.8%) were diagnosed with internalizing or externalizing psychiatric disorders. Approximately 29% of the total individual variance in internalizing disorders could be attributed to the family level, which includes both genetic and family environmental effects, and 5% to the neighborhood level. The corresponding figures for externalizing disorders were 43.5% and 5.5%, respectively. After adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic factors, high neighborhood deprivation was associated with increased risks of externalizing and internalizing psychiatric disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95% credible interval [CI] = 1.25-1.50 and OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.25-1.45, respectively), including conduct disorder (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.58-2.55), anxiety disorders (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.29-1.52), and mood disorders (OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 1.09-1.35). The strongest association between neighborhood deprivation and ADHD was observed in moderately deprived neighborhoods (OR = 131, 95% CI = 1.19-1.44).
   Conclusions: These findings call for policies to promote mental health that consider potential influences from children's family and neighborhood environments.conclusion Trial registration: Not applicable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This investigation evaluated a multilevel model of dispositional and environmental factors contributing to the development of internalizing problems from preschool-age to school-age. In a sample of 375 families (185 daughters, 190 sons) drawn from three independent samples, preschoolers' behavioral inhibition, cortisol and gender were examined as moderators of the links between mothers' negative parenting behavior, negative emotional characteristics, and socioeconomic status when children were 3.95 years, and their internalizing problems when they were 8.34 years. Children's dispositional characteristics moderated all associations between these environmental factors and mother-reported internalizing problems in patterns that were consistent with either diathesis-stress or differential-susceptibility models of individual-environment interaction, and with gender models of developmental psychopathology. Greater inhibition and lower socioeconomic status were directly predictive of more teacher reported internalizing problems. These findings highlight the importance of using multilevel models within a bioecological framework to understand the complex pathways through which internalizing difficulties develop.

AB This commentary discusses the articles in this special section with an emphasis on the specific utility of multivariate, multi-level models in developmental psychopathology for ultimately contributing to both etiologic insights and translational advances. These issues are considered not only in terms of the specific papers, but also within a larger set of questions regarding the opportunities (and challenges) currently facing the field. We describe why we believe this an exciting time for integrative team-science approaches to tackle these challenges-a time that holds great promise for rapid advances in integrative developmental science that includes a biological level of mechanistic understanding. In order to facilitate this, we outline a range of approaches within both translational neuroscience and translational developmental science that can be used as frameworks for understanding how such research can provide etiologic insights regarding real-world targets at the level of social, behavioral, and affective processes that can be modified during key developmental windows of opportunity. We conclude that a "construct validity" framework, where biological data form a critical, but not privileged, component of key etiological mechanisms, combined with a developmental perspective on key period of sensitivity to intervention effects, is most likely to provide significant translational outcomes.

AB Discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem have been linked with internalizing problems among mainly adolescents and adults. Longitudinal research on this association in children is lacking. This study examined the longitudinal link between self-esteem discrepancies and the development of internalizing problems in children. It furthermore examined the possible mediating role of self-esteem discrepancies in the longitudinal link between experiences of peer victimization and internalizing problems development. Children (N = 330, M (age) = 11.2 year; 52.5 % female) were followed over grades five (age 11 years) and six (age 12 years). Self-report measures were used annually to test for victimization and internalizing problems. Implicit self-esteem was assessed using an implicit association test, while explicit self-esteem was assessed via self-reports. Self-esteem discrepancies represented the difference between implicit and explicit self-esteem. Results showed that victimization was associated with increases in damaged self-esteem (higher levels of implicit than explicit self-esteem. Additionally, damaged self-esteem at age 11 years predicted an increase in internalizing problems in children over ages 11 to 12 years. Furthermore, damaged self-esteem mediated the relationship between age 11 years victimization and the development of internalizing problems. No impact of fragile self-esteem (lower levels of implicit than explicit self-esteem) on internalizing problems was found. The results thus underscore that, as found in adolescent and adult samples, damaged self-esteem is a predictor of increases in childhood internalizing problems. Moreover, damaged self-esteem might explain why children who are victimized develop internalizing problems. Implications are discussed.

DE Emotional problem; Behavioral problem; Disorders of sex development
   (DSD); Untreated; Indonesia
AB Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate emotional and behavioral problems among Indonesian patients with disorders of sex development (DSD) who recently came under clinical management. As diagnostic procedures and treatment had been delayed, patients progressively developed ambiguous bodies, difficult to conceal from outsiders.
   Method: We compared 118 Indonesian patients with DSD aged 6-41 years (60 children, 24 adolescents, 34 adults) and 118 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, and residential settings. We used the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), Youth Self-Report (YSR), and Adult Self-Report (ASR) to examine differences between patient and control groups as well as differences within patients groups.
   Results: On the CBCL, parents of young children with DSD reported significantly more emotional and behavioral problems than parents of matched control. Parents of daughters with CAH reported that their daughters withdrew themselves from social interactions. On the ASR, adults with DSD reported significantly more internalizing problems than controls, particularly anxiety and depression. No other differences in emotional functioning were found across different diagnostic groups.
   Conclusions: Indonesian patients with DSD who were untreated for most of their lives suffered more emotional and behavioral problems than matched controls. Differences and similarities between our findings and observations in patients from Western countries will be discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Universal screening for behavioral and emotional difficulties is integral to the identification of students needing early intervention and prevention efforts. However, unanswered questions regarding the stability of screening scores impede the ability to determine optimal strategies for subsequent screening. This study examined the 2-year stability of behavioral and emotional risk screening scores and investigated whether change could be predicted based on student characteristics or initial risk scores. As part of a district-wide screening effort, 863 middle and high school students completed the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System at two time points. Stability coefficients were moderate, with the majority of students remaining in a similar risk category across time. Gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, grade, school transition, and special education status were not predictive of movement across time. Initial risk score was predictive of movement from normal to at-risk categorization, with the internalizing domain being the most predictive of change.

AB Researchers have long theorized that genetic influence on mental health may differ as a function of environmental risk factors. One likely moderator of genetic and environmental influences on psychopathological symptoms is parenting behavior, as phenotypic research shows that negative aspects of parent-child relationships are associated with greater likelihood of mental illness in adulthood. The current study examined whether levels of reported parental discipline and affection experienced in childhood act as a trigger, or buffer, for adult mental health problems. Results from a nationwide twin sample suggest level of father's discipline and affection, as reported by now-adult twins, moderated genetic and environmental influences on internalizing symptoms in adulthood, such that heritability was greatest at the highest levels of discipline and affection. Father's affection also moderated the etiological influences on alcohol use problems, with greater heritability at the lowest levels of affection. No moderating effect was found for mothers. Findings suggest relationships with fathers in childhood can have long-lasting effects on the etiological influences on adult mental health outcomes.

AB The authors blended elements from the Stress Process Model and the Family Stress Model to investigate the direct and indirect effects of custodial grandmothers' (CGMs') coping resources (i.e., active strategies, passive strategies, and social support) on their psychological distress, their parenting practices, and their grandchild's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Participants included African American and White CGMs (N=733, M-age=56) who provided full-time care to a grandchild (M-age=9.8). Structural equation modeling revealed that social support and active coping were related to lower CGM distress and less ineffective parenting, whereas passive coping was associated with increased distress and more ineffective parenting. Ineffective parenting had direct effects on grandchildren's outcomes, whereas CGM coping resources had direct effects on ineffective parenting and indirect effects (through ineffective parenting) on grandchildren's externalizing and internalizing difficulties. The authors conclude that CGM coping resources affect the psychological well-being of both generations.

AB Very little research has examined familial aggregation of different mental health problems and distinguished between mothers and fathers as well as daughters and sons in large community samples. The purpose of the study was to examine associations between mental health problems in mothers versus fathers and internalizing problems in adolescent daughters versus sons. This cross-sectional study used data from a Norwegian community study (the HUNT3 study) consisting of 5,732 adolescents (ages 13-18) who had one (N = 2,503) or both parents (N = 3,229) participating. In adolescents, we measured subjective well-being (SWB), self-esteem, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and social anxiety, and in parents, symptoms of anxiety and depression, alcohol abuse, and maternal eating problems. We analyzed data with structural equation modeling. Findings showed that both maternal and paternal anxiety and depression were significantly associated with SWB, self-esteem, anxiety/depression, and social anxiety in both daughters and sons. The results indicated that associations between these problems were not dependent on parental or offspring sex. Parental alcohol abuse and maternal eating problems were not associated with any of the measured mental health problems in adolescents. Internalizing mental health problems appear aggregated in families, but do not seem to be affected by parental or offspring sex. When clinicians meet parents or adolescents displaying mental distress, it may be beneficial to assess the mental status of the entire family in order to evaluate the need for intervention.

TI Measuring Psychosocial Environments Using Individual Responses: an
   Application of Multilevel Factor Analysis to Examining Students in
   Schools
SO PREVENTION SCIENCE

AB Interest in understanding how psychosocial environments shape youth outcomes has grown considerably. School environments are of particular interest to prevention scientists as many prevention interventions are school-based. Therefore, effective conceptualization and operationalization of the school environment is critical. This paper presents an illustration of an emerging analytic method called multilevel factor analysis (MLFA) that provides an alternative strategy to conceptualize, measure, and model environments. MLFA decomposes the total sample variance-covariance matrix for variables measured at the individual level into within-cluster (e.g., student level) and between-cluster (e.g., school level) matrices and simultaneously models potentially distinct latent factor structures at each level. Using data from 79,362 students from 126 schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (formerly known as the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health), we use MLFA to show how 20 items capturing student self-reported behaviors and emotions provide information about both students (within level) and their school environment (between level). We identified four latent factors at the within level: (1) school adjustment, (2) externalizing problems, (3) internalizing problems, and (4) self-esteem. Three factors were identified at the between level: (1) collective school adjustment, (2) psychosocial environment, and (3) collective self-esteem. The finding of different and substantively distinct latent factor structures at each level emphasizes the need for prevention theory and practice to separately consider and measure constructs at each level of analysis. The MLFA method can be applied to other nested relationships, such as youth in neighborhoods, and extended to a multilevel structural equation model to better understand associations between environments and individual outcomes and therefore how to best implement preventive interventions.

AB Objectives: Children with hearing loss are at risk of developing psychopathology, which has detrimental consequences for academic and psychosocial functioning later in life. Yet, the causes of the extensive variability in outcomes are not fully understood. Therefore, the authors wanted to objectify symptoms of psychopathology in children with cochlear implants or hearing aids, and in normally hearing peers, and to identify various risk and protective factors.
   Design: The large sample (mean age = 11.8 years) included three subgroups with comparable age, gender, socioeconomic status, and nonverbal intelligence: 57 with cochlear implants, 75 with conventional hearing aids, and 129 children who were normally hearing. Psychopathology was assessed by means of self- and parent-report measures.
   Results: Children with cochlear implants showed similar levels of symptoms of psychopathology when compared with their normally hearing peers, but children with hearing aids had significantly higher levels of psychopathological symptoms, while their hearing losses were approximately 43 dB lower than those of children with implants. Type of device was related with internalizing symptoms but not with externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, lower age and sufficient language and communication skills predicted less psychopathological symptoms.
   Conclusions: Children who are deaf or profoundly hearing impaired and have cochlear implants have lower levels of psychopathological symptoms than children with moderate or severe hearing loss who have hearing aids. Most likely, it is not the type of hearing device but rather the intensity of the rehabilitation program that can account for this difference. This outcome has major consequences for the next generation of children with hearing loss because children with profound hearing impairment still have the potential to have levels of psychopathology that are comparable to children who are normally hearing.

AB Childhood friendships have been shown to impact mental health over the short term; however, it is unclear whether these effects are sustained into young adulthood. We studied the prospective association between childhood friendships and psychological difficulties in young adulthood. Data come from 1,103 French 22-35 year olds participating in the TEMPO study. Childhood friendships were ascertained in 1991 when participants were 4-16 years old. Psychological difficulties were measured in 2009 using the Adult Self-Report. Logistic regression models controlled for participants' age, sex, childhood psychological difficulties and parental characteristics. Young adults who had no childhood friends had higher odds of psychological difficulties than those with at least one friend: (adjusted ORs 2.45; 95 % CI 1.32-4.66, p = 0.01 for high internalizing symptoms; 1.81; 95 % CI 0.94-3.54, p = 0.08 for high externalizing symptoms). Social relations early in life may have consequences for adult psychological well-being.

AB The present study is informed by the theory of allostatic load to examine how multiple stress responsive biomarkers are related to mental health outcomes. Data are from the TRAILS study, a large prospective population study of 715 Dutch adolescents (50.9 % girls), assessed at 16.3 and 19.1 years. Reactivity measures of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) biomarkers (heart rate, HR; respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA; and pre-ejection period, PEP) to a social stress task were used to predict concurrent and longitudinal changes in internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed relatively few single effects for each biomarker with the exception that high HR reactivity predicted concurrent internalizing problems in boys. More interestingly, interactions were found between HPA-axis reactivity and sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity. Boys with high HPA reactivity and low RSA reactivity had the largest increases in internalizing problems from 16 to 19 years. Youth with low HPA reactivity along with increased ANS activation characterized by both decreases in RSA and decreases in PEP had the most concurrent externalizing problems, consistent with broad theories of hypo-arousal. Youth with high HPA reactivity along with increases in RSA but decreases in PEP also had elevated concurrent externalizing problems, which increased over time, especially within boys. This profile illustrates the utility of examining the parasympathetic and sympathetic components of the ANS which can act in opposition to one another to achieve, overall, stress responsivity. The framework of allostasis and allostatic load is supported in that examination of multiple biomarkers working together in concert was of value in understanding mental health problems concurrently and longitudinally. Findings argue against an additive panel of risk and instead illustrate the dynamic interplay of stress physiology systems.

AB Objective: To identify the association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors and determine if these apply equally to males and females. Method: The association between adult psychosocial functioning and childhood TBI for males and females was examined using groups with a history of childhood TBI (mild or moderate/severe) or orthopedic injury (injury age, 1-17, assessed 18-31 at >5 years postinjury), including rates of depression and anxiety disorders, substance abuse/dependence and offending behavior. Repeated-measures logistic regression was used to determine if the rates of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors varied by group and sex. Results: Overall rates of problem behaviors were significantly greater for both moderate/severe TBI (OR = 4.00) and mild TBI (OR = 3.60) groups compared with orthopedic controls. Females were significantly more likely than males to report a history of internalizing problems (OR = 2.22), whereas males were more likely than females to report externalizing problems (OR = 2.10). The sex difference in internalizing/externalizing problems was found consistently across TBI groups and controls. Conclusions: Childhood TBI is associated with psychosocial problems in adulthood, regardless of injury severity. How deficits are expressed differs between the sexes, with important implications for interventions strategies.

AB Child and adolescent patients may display mental health concerns within some contexts and not others (e.g., home vs. school). Thus, understanding the specific contexts in which patients display concerns may assist mental health professionals in tailoring treatments to patients' needs. Consequently, clinical assessments often include reports from multiple informants who vary in the contexts in which they observe patients' behavior (e.g., patients, parents, teachers). Previous meta-analyses indicate that informants' reports correlate at low-to-moderate magnitudes. However, is it valid to interpret low correspondence among reports as indicating that patients display concerns in some contexts and not others? We meta-analyzed 341 studies published between 1989 and 2014 that reported cross-informant correspondence estimates, and observed low-to-moderate correspondence (mean internalizing: r = .25; mean externalizing: r = .30; mean overall: r = .28). Informant pair, mental health domain, and measurement method moderated magnitudes of correspondence. These robust findings have informed the development of concepts for interpreting multi-informant assessments, allowing researchers to draw specific predictions about the incremental and construct validity of these assessments. In turn, we critically evaluated research on the incremental and construct validity of the multi-informant approach to clinical child and adolescent assessment. In so doing, we identify crucial gaps in knowledge for future research, and provide recommendations for "best practices" in using and interpreting multi-informant assessments in clinical work and research. This article has important implications for developing personalized approaches to clinical assessment, with the goal of informing techniques for tailoring treatments to target the specific contexts where patients display concerns.

AB Background: Interparental violence is both common and harmful and impacts children's lives directly and indirectly. Direct effects refer to affective, behavioral, and cognitive responses to interparental violence and psychosocial adjustment. Indirect effects refer to deteriorated parental availability and parent-child interaction. Standard Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be insufficient for children traumatized by exposure to interparental violence, given the pervasive impact of interparental violence on the family system. HORIZON is a trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy based group program with the added component of a preparatory parenting program aimed at improving parental availability; and the added component of parent-child sessions to improve parent-child interaction.
   Methods/design: This is a multicenter, multi-informant and multi-method randomized clinical trial study with a 2 by 2 factorial experimental design. Participants (N = 100) are children (4-12 years), and their parents, who have been exposed to interparental violence. The main aim of the study is to test the effects of two parental components as an addition to a trauma focused cognitive behavioral based group therapy for reducing children's symptoms. Primary outcome measures are posttraumatic stress symptoms, and internalizing and externalizing problems in children. The secondary aim of the study is to test the effect of the two added components on adjustment problems in children and to test whether enhanced effects can be explained by changes in children's responses towards experienced violence, in parental availability, and in quality of parent-child interaction. To address this secondary aim, the main parameters are observational and questionnaire measures of parental availability, parent-child relationship variables, children's adjustment problems and children's responses to interparental violence. Data are collected three times: before and after the program and six months later. Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses will be done.
   Discussion: The current study will enhance our understanding of the efficacy interparental violence-related parental components added to trauma focused cognitive behavioral group program for children who have been exposed to IPV. It will illuminate mechanisms underlying change by considering multiple dimensions of child responses, parenting variables and identify selection criteria for participation in treatment.

AB Background: Although anxiety and, to a lesser extent, depression are highly prevalent in children, these problems are, difficult to identify. The Revised Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) assesses self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in youth.
   Methods: The present study examined the factor structure, internal consistency, short-term stability, and validity including sensitivity to change of the RCADS in a multi-ethnic urban sample of 3636 Dutch children aged 8 to 13 years old.
   Results: Results indicate that the RCADS is a reliable and valid instrument. The original 6-factor structure was replicated to a fair extent in the present study (RMSEA = 0.048) and internal consistency was good (as = 0.70-0.96). ICCs for short-term stability were 0.76 to 0.86. Girls and children who indicated wishing to participate in a program targeting anxiety and depression had higher RCADS scores. Sensitivity to change analyses showed that the RCADS can detect changes in anxiety and depression symptoms in children who participated in a preventive intervention. The study showed low agreement between teacher and self-reported internalizing problems, even for children scoring above the 90th percentile of the RCADS, indicating a high level of problems, emphasizing the need to also take child reports into account when screening for anxiety and depression in children.
   Conclusion: This study shows that the RCADS can yield reliable data on a diversity of anxiety disorders and depression in urban children aged 8-13 from very diverse ethnic backgrounds.

AB Background: Effective interventions for maltreated children are impeded by gaps in our knowledge of the etiopathogenic mechanisms leading from maltreatment to mental disorders. Although some studies have already identified individual risk factors, there is a lack of large-scale multilevel research on how psychosocial, neurobiological, and genetic factors act in concert to modulate risk of internalizing psychopathology in childhood following maltreatment. To help close this gap, we aim to delineate gender-specific pathways from maltreatment to psychological disorder/resilience. To this end, we examine the interplay of specific maltreatment characteristics and psychological, endocrine, metabolomic, and (epi-)genomic stress response patterns as well as cognitive-emotional/social processes as determinants of developmental outcome. Specifically, we will explore endocrine, metabolomic, and epigenetic mechanisms leading from maltreatment to a higher risk of depression and anxiety disorders.
   Methods/design: Four large samples amounting to a total of N = 920 children aged 4-16 years will be assessed: Two cohorts with prior internalizing psychopathology and controls will be checked for maltreatment and two cohorts with substantiated maltreatment will be checked for internalizing (and externalizing) psychopathology. We will apply a multi-source (interview, questionnaires, official records), multi-informant strategy (parents, children, teachers) to assess maltreatment characteristics (e.g., subtypes, developmental timing, chronicity) and psychopathological symptoms, supplemented with multiple measurements of risk and protective factors and cutting-edge laboratory analyses of endocrine, steroid metabolomic and epigenetic factors. As previous assessments in the two largest samples are already available, longitudinal data will be generated within the three year study period.
   Discussion: Our results will lay the empirical foundation for (a) detection of early biopsychosocial markers, (b) development of screening measures, and (c) multisystem-oriented interventions in the wake of maltreatment.

AB Substance use is a risk behavior that tends to increase during adolescence, a time when part of the personality is still in development. Traditionally, personality psychopathology has been measured in terms of categories, although dimensional models have demonstrated better consistency. This study aimed to analyze differences in personality profiles between adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD n = 74) and matched community controls (MCC n = 74) using the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5) dimensional model. Additionally, we compared age at first drug use, level of drug use and internalizing and externalizing symptoms between the groups. In this study, the PSY-5 model has proved to be useful for differentiating specific personality disturbances in adolescents with SUD and community adolescents. The Disconstraint scale was particularly useful for discriminating adolescents with substance use problems and the Delinquent Attitudes facet offered the best differentiation.

AB Objective:
   To prospectively evaluate the neuropsychological effect of levetiracetam (LVT) in comparison with carbamazepine (CBZ) and its efficacy and tolerability as a monotherapy in children with focal epilepsy.
   Methods:
   A total of 121 out of 135 screened children (4-16 years) were randomly assigned to LVT or CBZ groups in a multicenter, parallel-group, open-label trial. The study's primary endpoints were defined as the end of 52 weeks of treatment, followed by analysis of changes observed in a series of follow-up neurocognitive, behavioral, and emotional function tests performed during treatment in the per protocol population. Drug efficacy and tolerability were also analyzed among the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (
   [GRAPHICS]
   , number NCT02208492).
   Results:
   Eighty-one patients (41 LVT, 40 CBZ) from the randomly assigned ITT population of 121 children (57 LVT, 64 CBZ) were followed up to their last visit. No significant worsening or differences were noted between groups in neuropsychological tests, except for the Children's Depression Inventory (LVT -1.97 vs CBZ +1.43, p = 0.027, [+] improvement of function). LVT-treated patients showed an improvement (p = 0.004) in internalizing behavioral problems on the Korean Child Behavior Checklist. Seizure-free outcomes were not different between the 2 groups (CBZ 57.8% vs LVT 66.7%, p = 0.317).
   Conclusions:
   Neither LVT nor CBZ adversely affected neuropsychological function in pediatric patients. Both medications were considered equally safe and effective as monotherapy in children with focal epilepsy.
   Classification of evidence:
   This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with pediatric focal epilepsy, LVT and CBZ exhibit equivalent effects on neuropsychological function.

AB This study focused on the emotion socialization practices (ESP) of mothers and fathers with their 4-year-old children in the U.S. and China in predicting children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Participants were 111 preschool children (58 Chinese, 53 U.S.) and their parents. Chinese parents were less supportive in response to their children's negative emotions than U.S. parents. Father's ESP were particularly salient predictors of Chinese children's behavior, whereas mother's ESP uniquely predicted U.S. children's behavior. Several interactions indicated that it was the combined influence of mothers' and fathers' ESP that predicted Chinese children's behavior, underscoring the importance of a family systems' perspective.

AB The goal of this study was to examine links between observed social participation in the schoolyard and indices of socio-emotional functioning in early adolescence. Participants were children (N = 290) aged 9 to 12 years. Social participation (e.g., solitary play, dyadic interaction, group interaction) was assessed in the schoolyard during recess and lunch using behavioral observations. Measures of perceptions of peer difficulties (e.g., perceived peer relations, loneliness) and internalizing problems (e.g., social anxiety, depression) were provided via maternal ratings and child self-reports. Results from cluster analyses revealed several subgroups of children characterized by distinct patterns of social participation. The groups also differed in terms of their socio-emotional functioning. For example, nonsocial children (who displayed the most frequent solitary activities) reported the highest levels of internalizing problems and more peer difficulties. Results are discussed in terms of the utility of observed social participation behaviors as marker variables for socio-emotional difficulties in early adolescence.

ID BARRATT; INHIBITION; DISORDER
AB Objectives. - The multidimensional aspect of the concept of impulsivity is proven by the composite structure of the rating scales of impulsivity. Several studies have already found correlations between trait-impulsivity and externalizing disorders. However, the studies interested in the relationship between trait-impulsivity and internalizing problems are rare. We have tried to explore correlations between impulsivity and externalization and internalization problems, in a population of adolescent outpatients.
   Methods. - We recruited 31 adolescent out-patients in the child and adolescent psychiatry department in the University Hospital of Monastir, Tunisia. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) was used to evaluate a multidimensional concept of trait-impulsivity, including the dimensions of "Motor", "Non-planning" and "Attentional" impulsivities. The Strength and Difficulties Scales (SDQ) was used to assess different domains of externalizing and internalizing problems, including "Emotional symptoms", "Conduct problems", "Hyperactivity" and "Peer problems".
   Results. - The sex-ratio was 1.21. The mean age was 15.19 +/- 1.27 years. All patients but one were attending school. The diagnosis was "Major Depressive Episode" in 32% and "Behavior Disorder" in 38%. The means of the scores of externalizing and internalizing problems were 9.35 +/- 4.41 and 9.65 +/- 3.26, respectively. The total score of the BIS was significantly related to both scores of externalizing and internalizing problems. The "Motor" impulsivity was specially correlated with the externalizing dimension of the SDQ. The non-planning impulsivity was correlated with both scores of externalizing and internalizing problems, but it was mainly related to internalizing problems. The attentional impulsivity was also correlated with both dimensions of externalizing and internalizing problems.
   Conclusion. - The dimensions of trait-impulsivity were correlated with various dimensions of the SDQ concerning externalizing and internalizing problems. That confirms the hypothesis that the impulsiveness is associated with wide domains of the psychopathology of the teenager which are not limited to behavior disorders. We can process these problems by influencing the "Motor impulsivity" and "Non-planning impulsivity". The cognitive and behavioral therapy and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor may be efficient. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2014.

AB Common causes of mental disorders are revealed by transdiagnostic perspectives. In this context, based on the study of Epkins and Heckler, the present study investigates common risk factors in depressive and anxiety symptomatics of children and adolescents. In a systematic literature search between 2012 and 2014, 35 studies were identified which demonstrated 44 common risk factors in internalising symptomatics in childhood and adolescence. Female gender, the onset of puberty, compliance with chronic illness, increased stress experience of children and mothers, negative parenting, misuse or rejective experiences in peers are evident factors in the developmental psychopathology of depression and anxiety disorders in childhood or adolescence. These common risk factors suggest a similar treatment of these diseases.

AB On March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake devastated the Tohoku region, which led to a tsunami and a nuclear disaster. While these three disasters caused tremendous physical damage, their psychological impact remains unclear. The present study evaluated traumatic responses, internalizing (i.e., anxiety and depression), and externalizing (i.e., anger) symptoms among Japanese young people in the immediate aftermath and 2.5 years later. A total of 435 undergraduates were recruited from universities in three differentially exposed regions: Fukushima, Tokyo, and Kyoto. They completed a set of questionnaires retrospectively (i.e., September to December 2013) to measure their traumatic responses, anxiety and depressive symptoms, functional impairment, and anger immediately after the disaster and 2.5 years later. Participants in Tokyo had the highest level of traumatic response and internalizing symptoms immediately after the earthquake, whereas those in Fukushima had significantly higher levels of trait anger, anger-in (holding one's anger in), and anger-out (expressing one's anger externally). In Kyoto, the levels of anxiety and depression after 2.5 years were significantly higher than they were immediately after the disasters. In conclusion, anger symptoms were high among young people who lived at or near the center of the disasters, while anxiety and depression were high among those who lived far away from the disasters. These findings suggest the importance of providing mental health services to young people who did not live near the disaster area as well as to those living in the directly affected area.

AB Maternal support has been widely cited as an important predictor of children's adjustment following disclosure of sexual abuse. However, few studies have examined these effects longitudinally. The current study examines the relationships between a multidimensional assessment of maternal support rated by both mothers and children and children's adjustment in various domains (internalizing, externalizing, anger, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms) concurrently and longitudinally. Participants were 118 mother-child dyads recruited from a Child Advocacy Center where children were determined through a forensic evaluation to be victims of sexual abuse. Child and mother ratings of maternal support and child adjustment were collected shortly after the forensic evaluation and at 9-month follow-up. Results were consistent with findings from past studies that maternal support is significantly related to children's post-disclosure adjustment and extends these findings longitudinally. Additionally, the study sheds light on differential relations between dimensions of maternal support (Emotional Support, Blame/Doubt, Vengeful Arousal, and Skeptical Preoccupation) and child adjustment and suggests the importance of using both child and mother ratings of maternal support in future research.

AB Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) commonly possess unique neurocognitive and neurobehavioral profiles that emerge within specific developmental periods. These profiles are distinct relative to others with similar intellectual disability (ID) and reflect underlying neuroanatomic findings, providing support for a distinctive phenotypic profile. This review updates what is known about the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes associated with DS across the lifespan. In early childhood, mild deviations from neurotypically developing trajectories emerge. By school-age, delays become pronounced. Nonverbal skills remain on trajectory for mental age, whereas verbal deficits emerge and persist. Nonverbal learning and memory are strengths relative to verbal skills. Expressive language is delayed relative to comprehension. Aspects of language skills continue to develop throughout adolescence, although language skills remain compromised in adulthood. Deficits in attention/executive functions are present in childhood and become more pronounced with age. Characteristic features associated with DS (cheerful, social nature) are personality assets. Children are at a lower risk for psychopathology compared to other children with ID; families report lower levels of stress and a more positive outlook. In youth, externalizing behaviors may be problematic, whereas a shift toward internalizing behaviors emerges with maturity. Changes in emotional/behavioral functioning in adulthood are typically associated with neurodegeneration and individuals with DS are higher risk for dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Individuals with DS possess many unique strengths and weaknesses that should be appreciated as they develop across the lifespan. Awareness of this profile by professionals and caregivers can promote early detection and support cognitive and behavioral development. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB ObjectiveThis study examined the influence of seizures, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), intelligence quotient (IQ), and symptoms of depression and anxiety on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 4-11years after pediatric epilepsy surgery.
   MethodsParticipants were 109 patients with childhood-onset intractable epilepsy; 71 had undergone surgery on average 6.9years before this study. Patients and their parents completed questionnaires assessing HRQOL and internalizing behavior, a measure of depression and anxiety symptoms.
   ResultsSimilar rates of recent seizure freedom were found for surgical and nonsurgical patients, although surgical patients had achieved seizure freedom sooner and with fewer AEDs. Few differences were found between surgical and nonsurgical patients. Differences emerged when comparing patients with continued seizures and those who had been seizure-free in the 12months preceding the study. Almost all HRQOL ratings were enhanced in seizure-free patients. Internalizing behavior (anxiety/depression) mediated the relationship between seizure freedom and better HRQOL, where seizure freedom led to better ratings of anxiety/depression, which in turn led to better ratings of HRQOL. AED use was found to be associated with social functioning, medication effects, and seizure worry. IQ and duration of follow-up were not found to independently influence HRQOL.
   SignificanceThe findings highlight the integral role of depression and anxiety symptoms in determining HRQOL; seizure control seems to play a secondary role. This study expands this relationship to individuals who have a history of intractable childhood epilepsy. The findings highlight the importance of managing depression and anxiety in improving the HRQOL and reducing seizure burden on patients.

AB It is well-known that childhood adversities can have long-term effects on mental health, but a lot remains to be learned about the risk they bring about for a first onset of various psychiatric disorders, and how this risk develops over time. In the present study, which was based on a Dutch longitudinal population survey of adolescents TRAILS (N = 1,584), we investigated whether and how childhood adversities, as assessed with three different measures, affected the risk of developing an incident depressive, anxiety, or disruptive behavior in childhood and adolescence. In addition, we tested gender differences in any of the effects under study. The results indicated that depressive, anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders each had their own, characteristic, pattern of associations with childhood adversities across childhood and adolescence, which was maintained after adjustment for comorbid disorders. For depressive disorders, the overall pattern suggested a high excess risk of incidence during childhood, which decreased during adolescence. Anxiety disorders were characterized by a moderately increased incident risk during childhood, which remained approximately stable over time. Disruptive behavior disorders took an intermediate position. Of the three childhood adversities tested, an overall rating of the stressfulness of the childhood appeared to predict onset of psychiatric disorders best. To conclude, the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder after exposure to adversities early in life depends on the nature of the adversities, the nature of the outcome, and the time that has passed since the adversities without disorder onset.

AB Longitudinal studies of the exact environmental conditions and personal attributes contributing to the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD) are rare. Furthermore, existing research typically examines risk factors in isolation, limiting our knowledge of the relative effect sizes of different risk factors and how they act in concert to bring about borderline personality pathology. The present study investigated the prospective effects of diverse acute and chronic stressors, proband psychopathology, and maternal psychopathology on BPD features in a high-risk community sample (N = 700) of youth followed from mid-adolescence to young adulthood. Multivariate analyses revealed significant effects of maternal externalizing disorder history, offspring internalizing disorder history, family stressors, and school-related stressors on BPD risk. Contrary to expectations, no interactions between chronically stressful environmental conditions and personal characteristics in predicting borderline personality features were detected. Implications of these findings for etiological theories of BPD and early screening efforts are discussed.

AB Children who have experienced interpersonal trauma are at an increased risk of developing dissociation; however, little is known about the prevalence or correlates of dissociation in young children. The current study examined symptoms of dissociation in 140 children (mean age = 51.17 months, range = 36-72 months, SD = 10.31 months; 50.0% male; 45.7% Hispanic) who experienced trauma (e.g., witnessing domestic violence, experiencing abuse). Child dissociation and exposure to traumatic events were assessed using a clinician-administered interview with the biological mother (mean age = 32.02 years, SD = 6.13; 49.3% Hispanic; 25.5% married or cohabitating). Mothers completed measures of maternal dissociation, depression/anxiety, and child behavior problems. At least subclinical dissociation was present for 24.3% of children. Robust regression with least trimmed squares estimation showed that greater maternal dissociation was related to greater child dissociation, adjusting for child internalizing symptoms, number of traumas, and maternal depression/anxiety, B = 0.09, (2) = 10.47, p < .001, R-2 Delta = .04. Children who experienced direct victimization did not exhibit a significantly higher level of dissociation compared to children who experienced other traumas, F(1, 138) = 3.76, p = .054, eta(2) = .03. These findings highlight the need to assess dissociation in traumatized young children.

AB Victimization by peers has been associated with low academic performance and internalizing problems. Still, not all students who experience peer victimization report a reduction in performance. The current study examines the potential protective nature of self-esteem and social self-efficacy in the relationship between peer victimization and academic performance. A sample of 231 middle school students participated. Schools reported academic performance and students completed self-report questionnaires. The ability of social self-efficacy and self-esteem in aiding academic and emotional resilience was explored as possible mediating and moderating variables using hierarchical regressions. Results supported the conclusion that the interaction of self-efficacy and self-esteem may moderate the relationship between peer victimization and academic performance. Those with above average social self-efficacy reported lower peer victimization and depression as well as higher academic performance. Implications for intervention are discussed.

AB BackgroundWe sought to develop an empirical, broad-based developmental model for sex differences in risk for symptoms of alcohol use disorders, here called alcohol problems (APs).
   MethodsWe assessed 18 risk factors in 5 developmental tiers in both members of 1,377 opposite-sex dizygotic twin pairs from the Virginia population-based twin registry. Analyses were conducted by structural modeling, examining within-pair differences.
   ResultsThe best-fitting model explained 73% of the variance in men and 71% in women for last year AP. Forty-nine percent of paths differed significantly across sexes. Ten variables had appreciably different predictive effects on AP in males versus females. Three were stronger in females: familial risk, early-onset anxiety disorders, and nicotine dependence. Seven predictors had a stronger total effect in males: novelty seeking, conduct disorder, childhood sexual abuse, parental loss, neuroticism, low self-esteem, and low marital satisfaction.
   ConclusionsIn a co-twin control design, which matches sisters and brothers on genetic and familial-environmental background, we found numerous sex differences in predictors of last year AP. Factors that were more prominent in men and in women were diverse, reflecting both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. The model was slightly more successful at predicting AP in men than in women.

AB Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children. Despite dramatic advances in pharmacological treatments, asthma remains a leading public health problem, especially in socially disadvantaged minority populations. Some experts believe that this health gap is due to the failure to address the impact of stress on the disease. Asthma is a complex disease that is influenced by multilevel factors, but the nature of these factors and their interrelations are not well understood. This paper aims to integrate social, psychological, and biological literatures on relations between family/parental stress and pediatric asthma, and to illustrate the utility of multilevel systemic models for guiding treatment and stimulating future research. We used electronic database searches and conducted an integrated analysis of selected epidemiological, longitudinal, and empirical studies. Evidence is substantial for the effects of family/parental stress on asthma mediated by both disease management and psychobiological stress pathways. However, integrative models containing specific pathways are scarce. We present two multilevel models, with supporting data, as potential prototypes for other such models. We conclude that these multilevel systems models may be of substantial heuristic value in organizing investigations of, and clinical approaches to, the complex social-biological aspects of family stress in pediatric asthma. However, additional systemic models are needed, and the models presented herein could serve as prototypes for model development.

AB IMPORTANCE Childhood sleep problems have been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, but there is limited knowledge as to the temporal association between sleep problems and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in young children.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether sleep problems in toddlers aged 18 months are related to both concurrent and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in preschool children aged 5 years.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A large population-based longitudinal study was conducted in September 2014 using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health from June 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008. A total of 32 662 children or pregnancies were included.
   EXPOSURES Sleep was assessed by mother-reported child sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Emotional and behavioral problems were measured with items from the Child Behavior Checklist and operationalized according to recommended clinical cutoffs, corresponding to T scores of greater than 65 (93rd percentile). Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using negative binomial regression, controlling for emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months and other relevant covariates.
   RESULTS Short sleep duration (<10 hours) in 556 children (1.7%) and frequent nocturnal awakenings (>= 3 times) in 1033 children (3.2%) at 18 months significantly predicted both concurrent and later incidence of emotional and behavioral problems at 5 years. The longitudinal RRs were generally larger for internalizing problems, with adjusted RRs of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23-2.08) for both short sleep duration and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.28-1.93) for nocturnal awakenings; RRs for externalizing problems were 1.77 (95% CI, 1.37-2.30) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.00-1.58), respectively. Additional adjustment for emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months slightly reduced the strength of these associations, and all RRs remained significant in the fully adjusted models.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early sleep problems predict later development of emotional and behavioral problems. Intervention studies are needed to examine whether sleep programs targeting early childhood may avert the onset of later adverse outcomes.

AB This study identified protective and risk factors of cannabis use initiation, including expectancies and social anxiety. A questionnaire was completed twice by 877 teenagers. Logistic regressions, mediation and moderation analyses were performed. Significant risk factors were alcohol use, peer users, perceptual enhancement, and craving expectancies. Protective factors were negative behavior expectancies and social anxiety. Social anxiety protected from initiation through the mediating role of perceptual enhancement and craving expectancies, whatever the role of peer users and alcohol use. Findings are discussed in terms of risk and protection, in an overall approach including internalizing factors. Results support the identification of an internalizing profile of adolescents for prevention or treatment and the importance of social anxiety and expectancies in intervention.

AB Internalizing problems in adolescence encompass behaviors directed inward at the self (Colman, Wadsworth, Croudace, & Jones, 2007). Several predictors have been linked to internalizing problems including antisocial and prosocial peers (Cartwright, 2007; Chung, 2010). Effortful control, a component of self-regulation, is one factor that could mediate the relationship between peer behaviors and individual outcomes. This study assessed the relationship between peer behaviors, effortful control, and adolescent internalizing problems. Participants were 151 middle school adolescents (M = 12.16 years old) who completed self-report questionnaires regarding behaviors of their peers, perceptions of effortful control, and experiences of internalizing problems. Structural equation modeling (SEM) yielded a significant negative relationship between antisocial peers and effortful control, and a significant positive relationship between prosocial peers and effortful control. In addition, effortful control significantly mediated the relationship between prosocial peers and internalizing problems, but not for antisocial peers. Implications for interventions related to adolescent health were discussed. (C) 2015 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Home-Start is a parenting support program in which mothers experiencing difficulties in family life and parenting, receive weekly support at home from a volunteer. The present study extends the work of Hermanns et al. (2013), by examining self-reported and observed parenting and child behavior outcomes at 10.6 year follow-up.
   Methods: The mothers of the Home-Start group (n = 59), who received Home-Start for on average 6.6 months, a comparison group, who reported elevated parenting stress and need for support (n = 56), and a randomly selected community sample (n = 36), reported on their feelings of competence about parenting, their parenting behavior and their child's problem behavior. Observational data were collected on five of the seven measurement occasions, until 8.8 year follow-up.
   Results: Improvements on feelings of competence, consistent and non-rejecting parenting behavior and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors during intervention period are sustained. That means that on the long term, the parent and child's improvements did not further improve, nor did they deteriorate. Observational measures showed a decrease in positive and negative parenting and positive and negative child behaviors in general for all groups.
   Conclusions: Home-Start, a volunteer-based community wide family support program, contributes to positive short term changes, which are sustained in the long-term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveThe psychosocial health of adolescents with severe obesity (BMI120% for age and gender) has only recently been the focus of empirical work.
   MethodsThis multisite studyan ancillary to a prospective longitudinal observational study documenting health in adolescents having weight loss surgery (WLS)presents preoperative/baseline data from 141 WLS adolescents and 83 nonsurgical comparisons (NSComps). Self-report data from adolescent and caregiver dyads characterize adolescent psychopathology and potential correlates.
   ResultsOne in three adolescents reported internalizing symptoms, and one in five endorsed externalizing symptoms in the clinical range. Generalized linear model analysis demonstrated that increased risk of psychopathology for adolescents with severe obesity was associated with family dysfunction, eating pathology, family composition, and seeking behavioral intervention (versus WLS), whereas better quality of life (QOL) was associated with lower psychopathology.
   ConclusionsWhile psychopathology rates are comparable to national samples, there is a subgroup of youth who present for behavioral weight loss services and are at greater risk for psychopathology relative to national adolescent base rates. Adolescents who achieve candidacy for WLS may be a highly selective population of youth with severe obesity and may have lower base rates of psychopathology compared to NSComps.

AB Mental health among children and adolescents is a growing national concern and schools have taken center stage in efforts to prevent problems and promote wellness. Although research and policymakers support the integration of mental health services into the schools, there is limited agreement on the ways to package or combine existing supports to achieve prevention-oriented goals. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and Social Emotional Learning (SEL) are 2 of the most widely adopted, evidence-based approaches that have been advocated to address student mental health. These universal prevention approaches, however, stem from different theoretical camps and are often advocated and implemented apart from one another. The purpose of this study was to examine the independent and combined effects of PBIS and SEL on student mental health outcomes. A quasi-randomized control design at the classroom level was used to make comparisons across 4 conditions: business-as-usual (BAU), PBIS alone, SEL alone, and COMBO condition with regard to their acceptability to teachers, integrity of program delivery, and student outcomes. As predicted, the COMBO condition produced significantly greater improvements in overall mental health and reductions in externalizing behaviors when compared to all other conditions. The results also indicated that the PBIS- and SEL-only conditions were both able to produce significant improvements in overall mental health functioning as compared with the BAU control. The implications of an integrated approach for school-based universal prevention and directions for future research are discussed.

AB The purpose of the current investigation was to compare 1,206 gifted and nongifted elementary students on the identification of emotional and behavioral risk (EBR) as rated by teachers and parents using a multigate, multi-informant approach to assessment. The Parent and Teacher Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) and the Behavioral and Emotional Screening System were used to assess behavioral functioning as rated by teachers and parents. There were significant differences between the number of gifted and nongifted children demonstrating emotional and behavioral risk, with parents and teachers identifying a higher number of boys and nongifted children as at risk. Among children demonstrating EBR, gifted children demonstrated elevated internalizing behaviors as rated by parents. Gifted students demonstrated higher academic performance regardless of risk level, suggesting higher cognitive abilities may be one of several protective factors that serve to attenuate the development of other social, emotional, or behavioral concerns. Implications for practice and future research needs are discussed.

AB The present study investigated the effectiveness of peer-mediated check-in/check-out (CICO) on the internalizing behaviors of elementary school students. A nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design across participants was utilized to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness for 3 students in 1st and 2nd grade. Two 5th grade students were trained to implement CICO under the supervision of an adult intervention specialist. The peer-mediated CICO procedure was effective for 2 of the 3 participants as evidenced by moderate to large effect sizes; however, all 3 participants were identified as "at-risk" on a universal screener for internalizing problems. The results suggest peer-mediated CICO may be a resource-efficient Tier II strategy to meet the needs of students engaging in internalizing behavior within a multitiered framework of service delivery.

AB Multitiered frameworks of service delivery have traditionally underserved students with mental health needs. Whereas research has supported the assessment and intervention of social and academic behavior across tiers, evidence is limited with regard to mental health concerns including internalizing behaviors (e.g., anxiety and depression). In particular, there is a notable shortage of brief anxiety assessment tools to be used for progress monitoring purposes. Moreover, traditional omnibus rating scale approaches may fail to capture contextually dependent anxiety. The purpose of the present investigation is to examine the sensitivity to change and concurrent validity of Direct Behavior Ratings (DBR; Chafouleas, Riley-Tillman, & Christ, 2009; Chafouleas, Riley-Tillman, & Sugai, 2007) of anxiety and traditional rating scales in measuring academic anxiety directly before, during, and after a potentially anxiety provoking stimulus. Research was conducted with 115 undergraduate students in a Southeastern university. Results indicated significant relationships between DBRs and pre- and postmeasures of anxiety. Change metrics suggested an overall lack of correspondence between DBR and the criterion measure, with DBR scales detecting greater change both across the testing situation and participants. The use of DBR for anxiety is considered within a multitiered, problem-solving framework. Feasibility and limitations associated with implementation are discussed.

AB To better understand the developmental contexts of mixed affect generated by the transition to adulthood, this study examined the relational correlates of self-reported stress and competence regarding the transition to adulthood. A sample of 223 college women reported on perceptions of parents, friends, and peers, as well as stress about taking on adult responsibilities (transition stress) and perceived competence regarding progress toward becoming an adult (transition competence). Results indicated distinctive relational correlates for transition stress versus competence. Transition stress was associated positively with over-involved parenting, parental attachment anxiety, and feeling behind peers in becoming an adult but not friendship quality, whereas transition competence was associated positively with friendship quality and feeling ahead of peers in becoming an adult but not parenting measures. Analyses controlled for internalizing distress, age, ethnicity, and family income. Results highlight the distinctive provisions afforded by close relationships for two key aspects of psychological experience during the process of becoming an adult.

AB This study validated the factor structure of the Parent Readiness for Change Scale (PRFCS) using a clinical sample of parents presenting for assessment and treatment because of their children's disruptive behaviors to an urban children's mental health program in Canada. Parents or guardians of 138 children (21.7 % female) aged six to twelve completed the PRFCS as part of their clinical assessment. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to identify the factor structure of the PRFCS and its potential utility in this clinical population. Construct validity was tested by examining parental readiness in relation to children's internalizing/externalizing problems, parenting behavior, and treatment participation. The original factor structure was replicated, suggesting three factors: Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Action. A second-order factor reflecting overall Readiness was observed that encompassed all three of these factors. A truncated version of the scale that included only a subset of items was determined to offer the best fit to data. Parents reporting higher levels of readiness had children with more emotional/behavior problems, reported higher levels of inconsistent discipline, and missed fewer treatment sessions. The PRFCS appears to be applicable to a clinical sample of children with disruptive behavior problems, and is associated with meaningful child- and parent-level constructs that are relevant in the context of clinical service delivery. Further research to develop clinical cut-offs may be useful in order for this promising theoretically-grounded measure to be effectively used as a screening tool to assist with treatment selection.

AB Despite decades of research examining diathesis-stress models of emotional disorders, it remains unclear whether dysfunctional attitudes interact with stressful experiences to shape affect on a daily basis and, if so, how clinical and genetic factors influence these associations. To address these issues, we conducted a multi-level daily diary study that examined how dysfunctional attitudes and stressful events relate to daily fluctuations in negative and positive affect in 104 young adults. Given evidence that clinical and genetic factors underlie stress sensitivity, we also examined how daily affect is influenced by internalizing and externalizing symptoms and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genotype, which have been shown to influence neural, endocrine, and affective responses to stress. In multivariate models, internalizing symptoms and BDNF Val66Met genotype independently predicted heightened negative affect on stressful days, but dysfunctional attitudes did not. Specifically, the BDNF Met allele and elevated baseline internalizing symptomatology predicted greater increases in negative affect in stressful circumstances. These data are the first to demonstrate that BDNF genotype and stress are jointly associated with daily fluctuations in negative affect, and they challenge the assumption that maladaptive beliefs play a strong independent role in determining affective responses to everyday stressors. The results may thus inform the development of new multi-level theories of psychopathology and guide future research on predictors of affective lability.

TI Externalizing spectrum or spectra? Underlying dimensions of the
   externalizing spectrum
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Externalizing spectrum; Alcohol dependence; Factor structure
AB Background: Major psychiatric disorders have been conceptualized to comprise of two dimensions namely, the internalizing and externalizing spectrum. Externalizing spectrum disorders consist of childhood disruptive behaviour disorders (DBD), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and substance use disorders. They are supposed to share common underlying personality traits. However, there is a need to explore the underlying dimensionality of externalizing spectrum of both disorders and traits in a mixed clinical and nonclinical sample from a non-western cultural-ethnic backdrop.
   Materials and methods: One hundred consecutive subjects with alcohol dependence (AD) and an equal number of biologically unrelated non-substance-dependent control subjects were recruited for the study. Subjects were examined for evidence of DBD and ASPD using Semi-Structured Assessment for Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA-IV). Validated instruments were used for the assessment of impulsivity, sensation seeking and hostility. Continuous scores generated from these instruments were converted to standardized Z scores to ensure comparability among different types of scales. Data were tested for normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Analysis was done by using principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation.
   Results: Factor analysis revealed two broad factors underlying the externalizing spectrum. The first factor included conduct, antisocial personality and oppositional defiant disorder. This factor was labelled as disruptive-dissocial. The second factor, which included AD and all personality traits, was labelled as impulsive-hostile.
   Conclusion: Within the externalizing spectrum, there are at least two distinct underlying dimensions: disruptive-dissocial and impulsive-hostile. If confirmed in other samples as well, this may have important implications for understanding and managing psychiatric and psychological issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aggression continues to be a serious problem among children, especially those children who have experienced adverse life events such as maltreatment. However, there are many maltreated children who show resilient functioning. This study investigated potential protective factors (i.e., child prosocial skills, child internalizing well-being, and caregiver well-being) that promoted positive adaptation and increased the likelihood of a child engaging in the healthy, normative range of aggressive behavior, despite experiencing physical maltreatment. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using two waves of data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW-I). Children who were physically maltreated were more likely to exhibit clinical levels of aggressive behavior at Time 1 than children who were not physically maltreated. Children's internalizing well-being, children's prosocial behavior, and caregivers' well-being were associated with lower likelihood of clinical levels of aggressive behavior at Time 1. Children's internalizing well-being and children's prosocial behavior remained significantly associated with nonclinical aggression 18 months later. These findings highlight the role of protective factors in fostering positive and adaptive behaviorsin maltreated children. Interventions focusing on preventing early aggression and reinforcing child prosocial skills, child internalizing well-being, and caregiver well-being may be promising in promoting healthy positive behavioral adjustment.

AB African American children are disproportionality diagnosed with disabilities and receive special education services. A cultural mismatch hypothesis posits that white teachers may be more likely to refer African American children for disability assessments. This study assessed differences in ratings of African American children's (N = 126) affective, anxiety, somatic, hyperactivity, oppositional, and conduct behaviors by themselves, their mothers, and teachers. The author hypothesized that teachers would have higher ratings of all externalizing behaviors than children and that children's ratings of all internalizing behaviors would be higher than their mothers' and teachers' ratings. This study found that teachers rated childrens' hyperactive behaviors statistically significantly higher than childrens' and mother's ratings. Children's ratings of their own affective, anxiety, and somatic behaviors were statistically significantly higher than mothers' and teachers' ratings of children's behaviors. Professionals who are involved in conducting assessments of diagnoses for children should receive training on the diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Prevention and interventions are needed to improve internalizing behaviors among African American children and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Social workers are in positions in which they can get to know children on an individual basis in and outside the school, and provide individual counseling, family support, and resources to address internalizing behaviors.

DE postpartum depression; father; child behaviors; interparental conflict
AB Maternal postpartum depression has been linked to later internalizing and externalizing behaviors in offspring; whereas, the consequences of paternal postpartum depression have received little attention. Further, research has produced inconsistent findings regarding mechanisms accounting for the link between postpartum depression and subsequent child behaviors. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to extend previous research by examining simultaneously the unique effects of maternal and paternal postpartum depression on child behaviors, and exploring the potential mediating roles of later depression and interparental conflict. The study included a sample of 199 couples whose index child was an average age of 4.5 months at the postpartum assessment and 45.5 months at the toddlerhood assessment. Findings suggest that both maternal and paternal depression in the postpartum period set the stage for future parental depression and interparental conflict. Parental depression during toddlerhood was associated with child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and represents a primary mechanism through which postpartum depression is linked to child behaviors for both male and female children. Interparental conflict was not a significant mediator, but may have an indirect role in internalizing and externalizing behaviors through its associations with parental depression. Clinical implications include the need for pediatric primary care providers to routinely implement systematic screening practices for parental mental health and to provide referrals to couples and parenting programs when depression is detected.

AB In the past two decades, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) an index of parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)-mediated cardiac control - has emerged as a reliable peripheral biomarker of emotion regulation (ER). Reduced RSA and excessive RSA reactivity (i.e., withdrawal) to emotional challenge are observed consistently among individuals with poor ER capabilities, including those with various forms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and those with specific psychopathological syndromes, including anxiety, phobias, attention problems, autism, callousness, conduct disorder, depression, non-suicidal self-injury, panic disorder, and trait hostility. Emerging evidence suggests that low RSA and excessive RSA reactivity index poor ER because they are downstream peripheral markers of prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction. Poorly modulated inhibitory efferent pathways from the medial PFC to the PNS result in reduced RSA and excessive RSA reactivity. According to this perspective, RSA is a non-invasive proxy for poor executive control over behavior, which characterizes most forms of psychopathology.

AB Scientifically sound and valid information concerning course and prediction of mental health problems in children and adolescents in the general population is scarce, although needed for public mental health issues and daily clinical practice.
   The psychopathological profiles of children and adolescents were analysed using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-P) in a longitudinal setting, also investigating the predictive value of the SDQ-scores.
   SDQ's total psychopathological difficulties, emotional symptoms and hyperactivity-inattention scores of n = 630 children and adolescents (age 6-18;11 years) were examined along four assessment measurement points (T-0-T-3) over 6 years, using data from the BELLA study. According to the English normative data, the participants were categorized as "normal", "borderline" or "abnormal" based on their SDQ-scores. Groups remaining within categories were descriptively determined by means of frequency analysis, a subsequent graphical evaluation displayed the transitions from T-0 to T-3 concerning the different categorical classifications. Finally, ordered probit regression was used to examine whether age, gender, socio-economic status (SES) and baseline impact-score (IS) correspond to the SDQ-predicted classification.
   As expected, low SES and high SDQ-IS were associated with significantly increased scores on all examined SDQ-scales. Regarding the long-term aspect of SDQ-scores it could be shown that most children and adolescents remained "normal" over a measurement period of 6 years, while only a small number of children and adolescents steadily remained "abnormal" or newly developed mental health problems, respectively. For example, on the "hyperactivity-inattention"-scale, only 1 % of the children and adolescents changed from "normal" to "abnormal" (T-0-T-3), whereas on the "emotional symptoms"-scale, 7 % changed from "normal" to "abnormal" (T-0-T-3). In general, the SDQ-category "borderline" and specifically the subscale "emotional symptoms" change in both directions. Abnormal SDQ-scores at baseline, SES, gender and IS were related to the prediction of the SDQ-sores at T3.
   An SDQ-screening of children and adolescents may help for early detection, prediction and treatment planning. Also, these results may contribute to a better understanding of the course of mental health problems in childhood and concurrently may allow a better psychoeducation and prevention.

AB The trend toward delayed childbearing is widespread in industrialized nations. Although the physical consequences for offspring in utero and in the prenatal period are well known, the psychologic consequences of older motherhood for offspring have received less attention in the literature. In contrast to the heightened physical risks for offspring, the existing research suggests that children of older mothers are often at lower risk for problem behavioral and academic outcomes compared with offspring of mothers in their teens and twenties. Maternal age is inextricably linked with a complex web of psychosocial variables, and the challenge for future research is to better understand the relative influence of these variables on the relationship between maternal age and offspring outcomes.

AB Purpose: Mental disorders are among the largest contributors to the global burden of disease. Since the cessation of the Sierra Leonean civil war in 2002, there have been few mental health resources available for war-affected youth. Co-occurring psychological problems are commonly reported by youth in the post-conflict setting, suggesting a need for evidence-based interventions that cater to comorbid psychological difficulties. This feasibility study outlines the implementation and evaluation of a mixed-methods approach for developing and piloting a culturally grounded group mental health treatmentdthe Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI)-for war-affected Sierra Leonean youth.
   Methods: Participating youth (N = 32; 50% female; ages, 15-24 years) were allocated to one of four gender-and age-stratified groups, facilitated by gender-matched Sierra Leonean interventionists. The intervention comprised adapted cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to address issues pertinent to war-affected youth. Analyses comprised assessments of reliable symptom change, mental health, functional adaptation, and interventionist fidelity outcomes.
   Results: The YRI was found to be acceptable, feasible and associated with reliable changes in internalizing and externalizing symptoms and improvements in functional impairments and emotion regulation (mean effect size, d = .64).
   Conclusions: Youth struggling with the mental health consequences of past trauma due to war merit special attention. The YRI presents a feasible and acceptable intervention for use in this low resource setting. A randomized controlled trial is planned to further test intervention effectiveness and scalability.

AB Objective: Building on an earlier study (Compas, Forehand, Thigpen, et al., 2011), tests of main effects and potential moderators of a family group cognitive-behavioral (FGCB) preventive intervention for children of parents with a history of depression are reported. Method: Assessed a sample of 180 families (242 children ages 9-15 years) in a randomized controlled trial assessed at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after baseline. Results: Significant effects favoring the FGCB intervention over a written information comparison condition were found on measures of children's symptoms of depression, mixed anxiety/depression, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems, with multiple effects maintained at 18 and 24 months, and on incidence of child episodes of major depressive disorder over the 24 months. Effects were stronger for child self-reports than for parent reports. Minimal evidence was found for child age, child gender, parental education, parental depressive symptoms, or presence of a current parental depressive episode at baseline as moderators of the FGCB intervention. Conclusions: The findings provide support for sustained and robust effects of this preventive intervention.

AB Adolescent mental health has become a public concern, and it is necessary to know how problem behaviors affect academic achievement. The current study surveyed 12,672 adolescents in eastern China, and results indicated clinical cut-offs on each problem behavior. We then examined how internalizing problems lead to negative academic results. Findings suggest Attention problems are a key factor. Anxiety/depression and somatic complaints have no direct effect on academic performance but are mediated by attention problems. This study can serve practice of schooling and parenting, and provide basis for developing clinical intervention strategy in China.

AB Disorganized attachment has been studied extensively in the developmental attachment literature, particularly with regard to infants and children. It has not been studied from a social psychological perspective in adulthood. In this article we contribute to the social psychology literature by beginning to explore the meaning and consequences of disorganized attachment for adults. Based on the literature on disorganization in infants, childhood, and adolescence, we develop a dimensional measure for assessing disorganization in adults and demonstrate that it predicts similar internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors to those observed in children and adolescents. Thus, this scale instrument should provide social psychologists with a means to assess disorganization in adulthood and begin to look at its consequences for romantic relationships. We discuss some of those potential consequences, thereby providing avenues for future research.

AB Sleep problems are common in children and adolescents. A growing body of research has explored the relationship between sleep problems and anxiety in youth. When reviewing the literature, methodologic inconsistencies need to be considered, such as variation in conceptualization of sleep problems, measurement of sleep, and the classification of anxiety. Despite this, there seems to be good evidence of concurrent and longitudinal associations between sleep difficulties and anxiety in community and clinical samples of young people. Potential mechanisms are proposed. There is a need for further exploration of these relationships, with the hope of aiding preventive capability and developing useful treatments.

AB The continuity, co-occurrence, and co-development of child internalizing and externalizing problems have been extensively studied and considered to be causally related either directly (directional model) or indirectly through an underlying shared or related liability factor (common vulnerability model). This study used child self-report to avoid rater bias in determining the continuity and cross-development of child internalizing and externalizing problems over a 1-year period, examining both direct pathway and indirect pathway by using maternal mental health as underlying explanatory mechanism. The Dominic Interactive, a computerized child self-report instrument, was used to assess internalizing and externalizing problems in 178 primary school children, aged 6-11 years old, over a 1-year time interval. Their mothers reported on their own maternal mental health at baseline. A cross-lagged path model was tested using Structural Equation Modeling. The results confirmed the stability of child-reported internalizing and externalizing problems but showed no cross-developmental paths. Maternal mental health at baseline was related to child externalizing behavior 1 year later. The theoretical explanations involve the developmental timing of the cross-developmental paths and the strong co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing problems at both time-points. This study showed the value of the Dominic Interactive as a child self-report instrument in addition to other informant measures in assessing child mental health problems over longer periods, especially when maternal mental health is involved. Furthermore, deprived maternal mental health warrants clinical attention to prevent externalizing problems in primary school children.

AB Challenging behaviors that disrupt the preschool classroom are increasingly common and can lead to poor outcomes in adulthood, such as delinquency, aggression, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a preschool-based mental health intervention on challenging behaviors amongst 3- and 4-year old children enrolled in four urban preschools in northern New Jersey. The intervention consisted of a mental health consultant providing a curriculum (Second Step) to all 3- and 4-year old children in the preschools, consultation with teachers, and play-therapy for identified children. The Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales (PKSB-2) was utilized to assess change in behavior between the beginning and the end of the school year and a cost-effectiveness analysis was also conducted. Results indicate improved behavior in all areas-social cooperation, social interaction, social independence, externalizing behavior and internalizing behavior-after 1 year of intervention and additional gains following 2 years of intervention. Further, the cost of providing this intervention was determined to be $900 per child, per year. While this study utilized a scale that yields risk levels based on normed comparisons, there was no comparison group in this study. It is uncertain how much change is related to maturation and other factors. However, this study does suggest that the intervention has merit for further research with this population and shows promise for providing a tiered approach to addressing the various degrees of challenging behaviors in the preschool classroom.

AB Research links racial identity to important developmental outcomes among African American adolescents, but less is known about the contextual experiences that shape youths' racial identity. In a sample of 491 African American adolescents (48 % female), associations of youth-reported experiences of racial discrimination and parental messages about preparation for racial bias with adolescents' later racial identity were examined. Cluster analysis resulted in four profiles of adolescents varying in reported frequency of racial discrimination from teachers and peers at school and frequency of parental racial discrimination coping messages during adolescents' 8th grade year. Boys were disproportionately over-represented in the cluster of youth experiencing more frequent discrimination but receiving fewer parental discrimination coping messages, relative to the overall sample. Also examined were clusters of adolescents' 11th grade racial identity attitudes about the importance of race (centrality), personal group affect (private regard), and perceptions of societal beliefs about African Americans (public regard). Girls and boys did not differ in their representation in racial identity clusters, but 8th grade discrimination/parent messages clusters were associated with 11th grade racial identity cluster membership, and these associations varied across gender groups. Boys experiencing more frequent discrimination but fewer parental coping messages were over-represented in the racial identity cluster characterized by low centrality, low private regard, and average public regard. The findings suggest that adolescents who experience racial discrimination but receive fewer parental supports for negotiating and coping with discrimination may be at heightened risk for internalizing stigmatizing experiences. Also, the findings suggest the need to consider the context of gender in adolescents' racial discrimination and parental racial socialization.

AB Internalizing disorders among youths represent a significant public health concern due to associated risk for future psychopathology, physical health costs, and the likelihood that affected children will experience difficulty transitioning to adult life. Despite the troubling aspects of internalizing disorders, there is a dearth of selective, Tier 2 interventions that educators can implement for students with identified internalizing problems as part of their school's multi-tiered system of support. To fill this void, the purpose this study was to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and integrity of a structured mentor-based program, the Courage and Confidence Mentor Program (CCMP), which represented a modified version of the Check-In/Check-out program. Single-case experimental methods, consisting of a multiple baseline across participants design, were used to evaluate the efficacy of the CCMP with five students. The results of visual analysis and single-case effect size estimates revealed that all participants demonstrated noticeable reductions in internalizing problems as measured by self-ratings of subjective units of discomfort and teacher reports on a standardized behavior rating scale. Limitations of the methods and directions for future research involving Tier 2 interventions for students with internalizing problems are discussed.

AB Using two waves of data, this study examined relations among neighborhood and housing disorder, parents' psychological distress, parenting behaviors, and subsequent youth adjustment in a low-income, multiethnic sample of families with children aged 6-16. Results supported the hypothesized indirect relation between disorder and youth outcomes via parenting processes. Higher levels of neighborhood and housing disorder were associated with higher levels of parents' psychological distress, which was in turn related to more frequent use of harsh and inconsistent discipline strategies and lower parental warmth. More frequent use of harsh and inconsistent discipline was associated with higher levels of youth internalizing and externalizing behaviors 3 years later. Housing disorder contributed more strongly to parents' psychological distress than neighborhood disorder, whereas neighborhood disorder contributed more strongly to youth externalizing behaviors compared to housing disorder. Multiple-group analyses showed that the patterns of relations were similar for younger and older children, and for girls and boys.

AB ObjectivesIn order to assist mental health services in developing countries, a key issue is the availability of psychometrically sound, brief, and cost-effective measures that have been tested within the relevant context. The present study was designed to evaluate within a young Bangladeshi population, the psychometric properties of two widely used Western measures of internalizing distress in young people: the short form of the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire.
   MethodThe sample included 1,360 children and adolescents aged 9-17years (M=12.3years, SD=2.12) recruited from six districts of Bangladesh, including both community and emotionally at-risk participants. A total of 179 children were re-tested on the measures within 3-4weeks.
   ResultsConfirmatory factor analyses showed single-factor structures for both scales in the total sample and in both community and at-risk participants separately. Multiple group analyses across gender and age-group within the at-risk and community samples showed that the single-factor structure was suitable regardless of subgroup. Analyses also indicated acceptable internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct validity for both scales.
   ConclusionThe two measures show promise as brief, reliable, and valid instruments for the assessment of internalizing distress among young people from Bangla-speaking communities.

AB This study examined peer victimization among a sample of youth who were seeking treatment at an outpatient anxiety disorders clinic. The study examined the association between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms and looked at whether frequent victimization was more common among youth with Social Phobia (SoP) as compared to youth with other anxiety disorders The study also examined the relation between SoP and peer victimization dimensionally. Participants were 90 youth (47 boys; M age = 11.06 years) and their parents. Results showed that peer victimization was associated with social anxiety symptoms, and relational victimization, in particular, was associated with internalizing problems among youth with anxiety disorders. Negative beliefs about the peer group accounted for some of this relation. Victimization was associated with symptomatology rather than diagnosis. Peer victimization is important to assess and consider in the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth.

AB Children's friendship quality is a particularly important risk or protective factor for internalizing problems and loneliness. Past research indicates that relationship satisfaction is related to perceived similarity; however, it is unclear whether this relation is seen in girls' friendship quality and whether this relation is significant over and above internalizing problems and loneliness.
   To improve our understanding of the unique relation between girls' perceived similarity to unfamiliar and familiar peers and friendship quality.
   116 girls aged 9-11 completed self-report questionnaires; we examined unique relations of girls' perceived similarity to expected friendship quality with three hypothetical unfamiliar girls (prosocial, withdrawn/depressed, and aggressive) and perceived friendship quality with a nominated friend.
   Girls' perceived similarity to all three unfamiliar girls was related to higher expected positive friendship quality, but it was only related to expected negative friendship quality for the unfamiliar aggressive girl. Girls' perceived similarity to her nominated friend was uniquely related to perceived positive but not negative friendship quality. Dyadic loneliness was inversely related to girls' perceived positive friendship quality with her nominated friend. Depression and dyadic loneliness were both positively related to girls' perceived negative friendship quality with her nominated friend.
   Girls' perceived similarity to familiar and unfamiliar peers is uniquely related to friendship quality. Training, prevention, and intervention programs targeting internalizing problems, loneliness, and social problems could benefit from incorporating this information.

AB In the current study, we examined a moderated mediation model using the risk and resilience framework. Specifically, the impact of family material hardship on adolescent problem behaviors was examined in a Chinese sample; we used the family stress model framework to investigate parental depression and negative parenting as potential mediators of the relation between family material hardship and adolescents' problem behaviors. In addition, based on resilience theory, we investigated adolescents' resilience as a potential protective factor in the development of their internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants included 1,419 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 15.38 years, SD = 1.79) and their primary caregivers. After controlling for covariates (age, gender, location of family residence, and primary caregiver), we found that parental depression and negative parenting mediated the association between family material hardship and adolescents' problem behaviors. Furthermore, the adolescent resilience moderated the relationship between negative parenting and internalizing problems in a protective-stabilizing pattern; in addition, a protective-reactive pattern also emerged when adolescent resilience was examined as a moderator of the relationship between negative parenting and externalizing problems. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of risk and resilience in youth development. Moreover, the findings have important implications for the prevention of adolescent problem behaviors.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of suicidal ideation and thoughts of death in elementary school children in a European survey and to determine the associated socio-demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: Data refer to children aged 6-12 (N=7062) from Italy, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Germany, and the Netherlands randomly selected in primary schools. Suicidal thoughts and death ideation were measured using a computerized pictorial diagnostic tool from the Dominic Interactive (DI) completed by the children. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was administrated to teachers and parents along with a socio-demographic questionnaire.
   Results: Suicidal ideation was present in 16.96% of the sample (from 9.9 in Italy to 26.84 in Germany), death thoughts by 21.93% (from 7.71% in Italy to 32.78 in Germany). Sl and DT were more frequent in single-parent families and large families. Externalizing disorders were strongly correlated with Sl and DT after controlling for other factors and this was true for internalizing disorders only when reported by the children.
   Conclusion: Recognizing suicidal ideation in young children may be recommended as part of preventive strategies such as screening in the context of the presence of any mental health problems whether externalizing or internalizing. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

AB Background: While ethnic diversity is increasing in many Western countries, access to youth mental health care is generally lower among ethnic minority youth compared to majority youth. It is unlikely that this is explained by a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders in minority children. Effective screening methods to detect psychiatric disorders in ethnic minority youth are important to offer timely interventions.
   Methods: School-based screening was carried out at primary and secondary schools in the Netherlands with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) self report and teacher report. Additionally, internalizing and psychotic symptoms were assessed with the depressive, somatic and anxiety symptoms scales of the Social and Health Assessment (SAHA) and items derived from the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS). Of 361 Moroccan-Dutch youths (ages 9 to 16 years) with complete screening data, 152 children were diagnostically assessed for psychiatric disorders using the K-SADS. The ability to screen for any psychiatric disorder, and specific externalizing or internalizing disorders was estimated for the SDQ, as well as for the SAHA and K-SADS scales.
   Results: Twenty cases with a psychiatric disorder were identified (13.2 %), thirteen of which with externalizing (8.6 %) and seven with internalizing (4.6 %) diagnoses. The SDQ predicted psychiatric disorders in Moroccan-Dutch youth with a good degree of accuracy, especially when the self report and teacher report were combined (AUC = 0.86, 95 % CI = 0.77-0.94). The SAHA scales improved identification of internalizing disorders. Psychotic experiences significantly predicted psychiatric disorders, but did not have additional discriminatory power as compared to screening instruments measuring non-psychotic psychiatric symptoms.
   Conclusions: School-based screening for psychiatric disorders is effective in Moroccan-Dutch youth. We suggest routine screening with the SDQ self report and teacher report at schools, supplemented by the SAHA measuring internalizing symptoms, and offering accessible non-stigmatizing interventions at school to children scoring high on screening questionnaires. Further research should estimate (subgroup-specific) norms and optimal cut-offs points in larger groups for use in school-based screening methods.

AB The relationship between age of onset for conduct disorder (CD) and the externalizing disorder attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well researched. However, little is known about associations between age of CD onset and comorbid internalizing disorders. This study examined whether age of CD onset significantly predicted the presence of a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder in a community-based sample of adolescents (n=147). Results showed each one-year increase in age of CD onset was significantly associated with increased probability of comorbid depression, but not significantly associated with the probability of a comorbid anxiety disorder. Analyses were replicated in subsamples of youth with (n=77) and without (n=70) ADHD. The significant positive relationship between age of CD onset and comorbid depression held in youth with ADHD only, while a negative relationship with anxiety emerged as significant in youth without ADHD.

AB Interest in youths' experience of the various forms of bullying has grown due to the numerous social-emotional correlates associated with bullying. Only recently has there been consideration of the school context in light of these associations. The current study examined the overlap in four different forms of bullying that youth commonly experience (i.e., verbal, relational, physical, electronic), with the aim of understanding their association with social-emotional correlates (i.e., internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, retaliatory attitudes) and exploring associations with school contextual factors such as supervision, school physical disorder, and behavioral expectations. Self-report data on the forms of peer bullying were collected from 24,620 adolescents (Grades 9-12; M age=15.98, SD age=1.32) enrolled in 52 high schools. Latent class analyses indicated significant overlap in the different forms of bullying victimization, with youth experiencing multiple forms of bullying reporting the greatest risk for social-emotional problems. A series of two-level hierarchical linear models revealed that indicators of school physical disorder and a lack of positive behavioral expectations were associated with increased risk for multiple forms of bullying. Several gender and age differences were also observed in relation to the patterns of bullying experienced. These findings extend prior research by emphasizing a potential link between the overlap in different forms of bullying and school contextual factors, even after controlling for individual-level risk factors.

AB This study examined the early childhood precursors and adolescent outcomes associated with grade school peer rejection and victimization among children oversampled for aggressive-disruptive behaviors. A central goal was to better understand the common and unique developmental correlates associated with these two types of peer adversity. There were 754 participants (46% African American, 50% European American, 4% other; 58% male; average age=5.65 at kindergarten entry) followed into seventh grade. Six waves of data were included in structural models focused on three developmental periods. Parents and teachers rated aggressive behavior, emotion dysregulation, and internalizing problems in kindergarten and Grade 1 (Waves 1-2); peer sociometric nominations tracked "least liked" and victimization in Grades 2, 3, and 4 (Waves 3-5); and youth reported on social problems, depressed mood, school adjustment difficulties, and delinquent activities in early adolescence (Grade 7, Wave 6). Structural models revealed that early aggression and emotion dysregulation (but not internalizing behavior) made unique contributions to grade school peer rejection; only emotion dysregulation made unique contributions to grade school victimization. Early internalizing problems and grade school victimization uniquely predicted adolescent social problems and depressed mood. Early aggression and grade school peer rejection uniquely predicted adolescent school adjustment difficulties and delinquent activities. Aggression and emotion dysregulation at school entry increased risk for peer rejection and victimization, and these two types of peer adversity had distinct as well as shared risk and adjustment correlates. Results suggest that the emotional functioning and peer experiences of aggressive-disruptive children deserve further attention in developmental and clinical research.

AB We examined evidence that peer victimization in middle childhood is a lead indicator of internalizing behavior problems and diagnostic outcomes during adolescence. This research was conducted as part of an ongoing multisite longitudinal investigation. The participants were 388 children (198 boys, 190 girls). Peer victimization was assessed with a peer nomination inventory that was administered when the average age of the participants was approximately 8.5 years. Internalizing problems were assessed using a behavior problem checklist completed by mothers in 9 consecutive years, and a structured clinical interview was administered to the participants in the summer following high school graduation (10-11 years after the victimization assessment). Peer victimization in middle childhood was correlated with internalizing problems on a bivariate basis through the late years of adolescence. Multilevel analyses also revealed associations between peer victimization and increases in internalizing problems over time. In addition, peer victimization had a modest link to unipolar depressive disorders in late adolescence. Victimization in the peer group during middle childhood appears to be a marker of long-term risk for internalizing behavior problems and unipolar depression.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine stability, correlates, and time-covarying associations of peer victimization. The total sample size was 1,206 adolescents (M-age at initial time point=9.74 years, SD=.60; 59.5% White, 21.6% African American, 12.9% Hispanic American, 6% Other/Unknown) followed across 9 yearly waves of data collection from elementary school through middle and high school (Grades 4-12). In each year, peer victimization was assessed with peer nominations; externalizing behavior, peer sociability, and school competence were assessed with teacher ratings; and internalizing behavior was assessed with self-reports. High stability of peer victimization was found across the 9 years of the study. Victimization correlated positively with externalizing and internalizing behaviors and negatively with peer sociability and school competence in the elementary school years, whereas only the association with peer sociability remained significant throughout the middle and high school years. Growth curve modeling showed that victimization, as a time-varying predictor across Grades 4 to 12, significantly predicted the level of each outcome measure at the end of the trajectory, and the rate of change leading up to this end point. Gender differences were found for each of the main results. The results of the current study highlight the importance of developing a long-term dynamic view and understanding of the emergence of peer victimization and its related consequences across childhood and adolescence. Although peer victimization is strongly linked to a variety of adjustment problems in elementary school, these associations seem to become weaker in middle and high school.

AB We report findings of a convergent validity study examining the internalizing subscale (SRSS-15) of the newly adapted Student Risk Screening Scale for Internalizing and Externalizing (SRSS-1E12) with the internalizing subscale of the Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, 1991) conducted in 13 schools across three states with 195 kindergarten through fifth-grade elementary students. Results of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics curves suggest the following cut scores for the SRSS-I5: 0-1 low risk, 2-3 moderate risk, and 4-15 high risk for internalizing behavior patterns, relative to the internalizing subscale of the TRF subscale. Limitations and future directions are discussed, along with illustrations of how to use the SRSS-15 scores for decision making in a tiered system of supports.

AB This study of 182 secondary special education students with emotional and/or behavioral disorders investigated their classification by their school districts, in particular how well they were distinguished and represented by their federal categories. The districts used four classification groups (emotional disturbance, other health impairment learning disability, and multiple disabilities), which were then compared on demographics, IQ and achievement scores, and teacher ratings of emotional and behavioral problems. Students in the four groups were significantly different only on IQ and achievement scores, but not on demographics or on emotional or behavioral problems. Criterion-based definitions were developed for the four categories. While showing little differentiation between or within the original categories, the definitions showed that 43% of the students appeared to have multiple disabilities (i.e., complex presentations of emotional/internalizing, behavioral/externalizing, ADHD, and/or learning disabilities). Based on these findings, a potential new special education category was investigated that could enhance the accurate characterization of these students for improved treatment planning, as the current classification process appears inadequate for such students.

AB This study investigated maternal and paternal reports about their very young boys and girls on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA). Two samples were recruited through child health centers in Northern Finland. The infant sample consisted of 227 children (112 boys and 115 girls) (mean age 13.0 +/- 1.1 months) and the toddler sample consisted of 208 children (94 boys and 114 girls) (mean age 19.3 +/- 1.4 months). Among the infants, girls obtained higher paternal competence total scores than boys, whereas among the toddlers, both maternal and paternal competence total scores were higher for girls compared to boys. In the problem total scale, boys were scored higher than girls by mothers, but not by fathers, in both age groups. In the externalizing problem domain, maternal scores were higher for boys compared to girls among both samples, whereas paternal scores were significantly higher for boys than for girls only among the infants. Also maternal internalizing problem scores were higher for boys than for girls among the toddlers. Compared to fathers, mothers perceived more social-emotional competencies in toddler boys and girls, as well as more total, externalizing and dysregulation problems in toddler boys. However, significant differences between the maternal and paternal BITSEA ratings were not found among the infants of either sex. The results suggest that sex differences in the social-emotional/behavior domain may be observed by the parents among children as young as 11 to 24 months of age. Our findings highlight the importance of paying attention to probable sex differences when assessing and treating early social-emotional/behavior problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) children who are non-disabled and otherwise healthy are at risk of neurodevelopmental impairments. Further understanding of these impairments is needed before commencement of formal education to optimise participation levels at a critical time point for these children.
   Aims: To explore motor co-ordination, postural stability, limb strength and behaviour of non-disabled four to five year old children with a history of extreme prematurity or ELBW.
   Study design: Prospective-descriptive-cohort-study.
   Subjects: 50 children born at less than 28 weeks gestation or who had a birth weight less than 1000 g with minimal/mild motor impairments and no significant neurological/cognitive impairments.
   Outcome measures: Movement Assessment Battery for Children second-edition (MABC-2), single leg stance test (SLS), lateral reach test, standing long jump test and Child Behaviour Checklist for preschool children (CBCL).
   Results: The mean percentile rank of the extremely preterm or ELBW sample on MABC-2 was 31% (SD 23%). SLS right (mean +/- SD; 4.6 +/- 2.5 s) and lateral reach to the right (10.0 +/- 3.9 cm) were slightly stronger than SLS left (4.4 +/- 33 s) and lateral reach left (9.9 +/- 35 cm). The average for standing long jump was 71.6 cm (SD 21.0 cm). All participants were classified as 'normal' on CBCL syndrome scale scores, internalizing and externalizing syndrome T scores and total problem T score.
   Conclusions: This sample of non-disabled extremely preterm or ELBW children performed in the lower range of normal. These children continue to be at risk of impairments, therefore, ongoing monitoring and tailored intervention may optimise development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the present study was to assess the associations among family religious practices, internalizing/externalizing behaviors, and body mass index in a sample of severely obese youth referred to an outpatient pediatric endocrinology clinic. The sample consisted of 43 obese youth (body mass index>95th percentile) aged 6-16 years (mean age=12.67 years). Approximately 93% of families endorsed their religious faith as Christian or Catholic. Parents of youth were administered a demographic questionnaire, religiosity questionnaire, and the Child Behavior Checklist. Three multiple linear regression models were examined with body mass index percentile, Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing Scale as outcome variables. A parent endorsing greater importance of religious faith in shaping family life was associated with lower child body mass index percentile (p<0.05) in the present sample. Greater family attendance at religious services was associated with higher child body mass index percentile (p<0.05). Our data suggest that church-based interventions may be one viable option for the delivery of lifestyle interventions in families of youth with severe obesity.

AB A large proportion of Inuit children in Arctic Quebec are adopted in accordance with traditional Inuit customs. In contrast to adoptions in Southern Canada and the United States, the child is adopted at birth and by a close family member; he or she knows who his or her biological parents are, and will typically have contact with them. Studies of other populations have reported an increased incidence of behavior problems in adopted compared with nonadopted children. This study examined the actual extent of the increase in the number of behavior problems seen in Inuit children adopted in accordance with traditional customs. In a prospective longitudinal study conducted in the Canadian Arctic (n = 46 adopted and 231 nonadopted children), prenatal and familial variables were documented at birth and at school age (M = 11.3 years). Behavior problems were assessed on the Teacher Report Form of the Child Behavior Checklist. Adopted children lived in more economically disadvantaged families, but their caregivers were less prone to depression, domestic violence, or alcohol abuse compared with those of the nonadopted children. The adoption status was not related to the teacher's report of attention problems, externalizing or internalizing behaviors, after controlling for confounders. Despite less favorable socioeconomic circumstances, a higher extent of behavioral problems was not seen at school age in Inuit children adopted at birth by a family member. Psychosocial stressors associated with adoption are more likely to be responsible for an association with higher levels of childhood behavior problems rather than adoption per se.

AB Using a high-risk community sample (N = 567), the current study examined risk for externalizing and internalizing problems in the children of parents with recovered and current substance use disorders (SUDs). This study also tested whether parenting mediated the relations between these variables. Results suggest that children of parents with current diagnoses were at elevated risk for externalizing and internalizing problems, but children of parents with recovered diagnoses were only at risk for externalizing problems. Perceived parental consistency of support mediated the relations between parent current SUD and child externalizing and internalizing problems. Disruption of the home environment may in part explain why children of parents with SUDs are at risk for externalizing and internalizing problems. However, even after parent SUD has remitted, children remain at risk for externalizing problems, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which parents confer risk for psychopathology.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Emerging evidence suggests that the tendency to generate stressful life events may be, at least in part, genetically determined. However, the role of the early environment in shaping responses to later stressors is crucial to fully specifying biogenetic models of stress generation. The current study examined the moderating role of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual maltreatment on the relation of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene to proximal independent, dependent, and dependent-interpersonal life events. This question was tested in a cross-sectional community sample of 297 adolescents and young adults. Childhood maltreatment history and proximal life events were assessed with state-of-the-art interviews that provide independent and standardized ratings of the environmental context. Consistent with the stress generation hypothesis, individuals with the risk s-allele of the serotonin transporter gene reported significantly higher rates of dependent and dependent-interpersonal life events than those homozygous for the l-allele, but only in the context of a history of maternal emotional maltreatment or sexual maltreatment. Neither serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms or childhood maltreatment, or their interaction, were associated with reports of independent life events. The current results demonstrate the importance of considering specificity in the early environmental context when examining the relation of genetic factors to the generation of proximal stress.

AB Objective: Indications for home treatment for specific diagnoses in child and adolescent psychiatry have not yet been evaluated. Method: In a recent intervention study (primary outcome: length of stay), 92 patients aged 5 to 17 years were randomized into an intervention group (early discharge followed by home treatment in combination with inpatient treatment, where needed) and a control group (regular length inpatient treatment). The aim of this explorative analysis was to retrieve additional information on "what works for whom." Outcome parameters were as follows: Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) at T1 (within 14 days after intake), T2 (end of treatment) and T3 (empty set 8.4-month follow-up). Multiple regression was used to investigate the association between diagnoses, treatment setting, age, sex, and improvement in both groups. Results: In children externalizing disorders were predominant, whereas in adolescents internalizing disorders were prominent. Patients improved equally under both types of treatment. Home treatment, however, was rated by the patients to be significantly more effective in adolescents (SDQ p =.017), boys (CIS p =.009, SDQp <.001), and with externalizing disorders (SDQp =.005). Conclusions: Home treatment may be considered an alternative to inpatient treatment, especially in boys with externalizing disorders.

AB Proactive and reactive functions of aggression are thought to manifest through different familial and emotional processes, even though they often co-occur. We investigated direct and indirect pathways through which maternal criticism and emotion regulation (ER) difficulties relate to reactive and proactive aggression in adolescence. Further, we examined how maternal criticism and emotion dysregulation interrelate, both concurrently and over time. Participants were 482 Dutch adolescents (M = 15.03, SD = 0.45, 57% boys) who self-reported on their ER difficulties, perceived maternal criticism, and reactive/proactive aggression. Cross-lagged panel modeling across four annual measurements revealed direct bidirectional links over time between maternal criticism and emotion dysregulation. Positive links over time from maternal criticism to proactive (but not reactive) aggression were also present. Emotion dysregulation and proactive aggression were linked only indirectly via maternal criticism. Gender did not significantly moderate these links. By revealing differential developmental pathways involving adolescents' ER and maternal criticism, the present study offers support for the dual function model of aggression.

   controls

AB OBJECTIVE: Cancer is diagnosed in approximately 1 per 1000 pregnant women. Lifesaving cancer therapy given to the mother during pregnancy appears in conflict with the interest of the developing fetus. Often, termination of pregnancy is suggested but has not been proven in any type of cancer to improve maternal prognosis, while very few studies have documented the long-term effects of in utero chemotherapy exposure on child outcome. To counsel patients about the risk of continuing a pregnancy while undergoing cancer treatment, we performed developmental testing to provide more detailed follow-up on children exposed in utero to chemotherapy.
   STUDY DESIGN: Mother-infant pairs, enrolled in the Cancer and Pregnancy Registry, were offered developmental testing for children who were >= 18 months of age. Based on age, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Third Edition, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, or the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test was administered. All parents or primary caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist, a parent questionnaire to assess behavior and emotional issues. Results of children exposed to chemotherapy before delivery were compared with children whose mothers were also diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy but did not receive chemotherapy before delivery.
   RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in cognitive skills, academic achievement, or behavioral competence between the chemotherapy-exposed group and the unexposed children. Of children, 95% scored within normal limits on cognitive assessments; 71% and 79% of children demonstrated at or above age equivalency in mathematics and reading scores, respectively; and 79% of children scored within normal limits on measures of behavior. Older children had significantly higher rates of internalizing behavior problems.
   CONCLUSION: We could not demonstrate a significant difference in cognitive ability, school performance, or behavioral competence for children exposed to chemotherapy in utero compared with nonexposed controls. The majority of these children scored within normal limits on all developmental measures. Premature birth was more prevalent in the chemotherapy-exposed group yet did not predict developmental outcome. Older children in the sample demonstrated higher rates of internalizing behavior problems.

AB Genetic influences on adolescent psychological development are likely to be mediated and moderated by pubertal hormones. Combining genetic analyses with advanced models of pubertal development, we extended work on the measurement and psychological significance of puberty. We examined how genetic and environmental influences on puberty vary by the way that development is described (logistic versus linear models versus traditional methods) and the different aspects of puberty (adrenarche vs. gonadarche), and how genes and environment contribute to the covariation between different descriptions and aspects of puberty, and between pubertal development and behavior problems (substance use, age at sexual initiation). We also considered how puberty moderated the heritability of psychological outcomes (internalizing and externalizing problems), and sex differences. Participants from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study (403 girls, 395 boys) reported their pubertal development annually from ages 9 through 15; they and their parents reported their behavior in mid-to-late adolescence. There was a large genetic contribution to pubertal timing for both sexes no matter how it was measured, but findings for pubertal tempo varied by method. Genetic covariation accounted for most of the phenotypic correlations among different indicators of pubertal timing, and between pubertal timing and psychological outcome. We consider the implications of our results for understanding how pubertal hormones mediate or moderate genetic and environmental influences on psychological development.

AB Although CBT has proven efficacious in the treatment of child social phobia (SP), most children do not present for treatment and child SP may be less responsive to treatment than other anxiety disorders. Intensive, group-based, SP-specific CBT may improve the efficacy of, and access to, treatment for child SP. The aim of this study was to provide a preliminary examination of such a program.
   Forty Australian children aged 7-12 years (15 male and 25 female) were allocated into treatment and waitlist groups. Clinical interviews to determine diagnostic status were conducted prior to treatment, following treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Parent and child questionnaire measures of child anxiety symptoms, internalizing symptoms, depression, social skills, social competence, and parental social anxiety were administered at the same time points. Treatment was delivered in 4 separate 3-hour sessions conducted over 3 consecutive weekends.
   At postassessment, 52.4% of children in the treatment group and 15.8% of children in the waitlist group were free of their SP diagnosis. At postassessment, compared to waitlist children, treatment group children demonstrated a greater drop in clinical severity, a greater increase in overall functioning, and held fewer clinical diagnoses. Treatment group children also reported a greater reduction in SP symptoms compared to waitlist children, and treatment group parents reported a greater reduction in child internalizing and anxiety symptoms, a greater increase in child social competence, and a greater decrease in parental SP symptoms, compared to parents of children in the waitlist group. By 6-month follow-up, 76.9% of the treatment group were free of their SP diagnosis and gains on all other measures were maintained.
   The results of this study are encouraging, and suggest that brief, intensive, group CBT for children with social anxiety is beneficial for many youngsters.

AB This three-wave longitudinal study of 173 Latino adolescents (M=16.16years, SD=0.65) is designed to understand the role of discrimination-related stress in mental health trajectories during middle to late adolescence with attention to differences due to immigration status. The results of the growth curve analysis showed that anxious-depressed, withdrawn-depressed, and somatic complaints significantly decreased over time. Furthermore, although discrimination-related stress was found to be significantly related to the trajectories of three types of mental health symptoms, the results revealed that immigration status moderated these relations such that discrimination-related stress was significantly related to these outcomes for Latino youth whose parents were born in the United States, while this relation was not significant for Latino children of immigrants.

AB This goal of this review was to explore empirical research examining the question of whether borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder of "personality" or a disorder arising out of experiences of childhood trauma. The review highlighted the complexities in the relationship between childhood disorder (CT) and BPD and identified important implications for research and practice. Although relationships between specific trauma types and outcomes in adulthood are inconsistent, overall associations between CT and the development of BPD are strong and consistently identified. Research exploring the specific mechanisms through which CT may be related to the development of BPD in adulthood is beginning to untangle the complex web of interrelated factors such as heritable personality traits, affect regulation and dissociation, and trauma symptoms as mediators in the relationship between CT and BPD. Our strongest recommendation is for future researchers to further explore transdiagnostic factors such as the self capacity of affect regulation to further disentangle the complex pathways between CT, inherited personality traits, and the development of all forms of traumatogenic psychopathologies in adulthood.

AB This longitudinal study explores differences between native Dutch and immigrant Moroccan adolescents in the relationship between internalizing and externalizing problems across time. By using generalized estimating equations (GEE), the strength and stability of associations between internalizing and externalizing problems in 159 Moroccan and 159 Dutch adolescents was studied over a period of 4 years. No differences in strength of co-occurring problems were found between Moroccan and Dutch adolescents. However, for Moroccan adolescents, associations between problems increased over time, whereas in Dutch adolescents, associations remained stable. The increase of co-occurring problems may be a result of undertreatment and increasing complexity of problems in Moroccans during adolescence. The results of this study imply that investigating processes leading to co-occurring problems in subgroups of adolescents, such as immigrant youths, is needed to optimize prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Objective: To assess the structural overlap between the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) among children in Uganda. Methods: Caregiver ratings for the BRIEF and CBCL were obtained for 2 independent samples of school-aged children: 106 children (5-12 years old, 50% males) with a history of severe malaria and on 144 HIV-infected children (5-12 years old, 58% males) in Uganda. Exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate the factor structure of the 8 subscales for the BRIEF and the 8 scales of the CBCL to determine correlation. Results: Overall, children in the severe malaria group had higher (increased symptom) BRIEF and CBCL scores than those in the HIV-infected group. Three factors that provided a reasonable fit to the data and could be characterized as 3 specific domains were identified: (1) Metacognition, which consisted of the scales in the BRIEF Metacognition domain, (2) Behavioral Adjustment, which comprised of the scales in the BRIEF Behavioral Regulation domain and the Externalizing Symptoms scales in the CBCL, and (3) Emotional Adjustment, which mainly consisted of the Internalizing Symptoms scales in the CBCL. The BRIEF Behavior Regulation and CBCL Externalizing Symptoms scales, however, did overlap in terms of assessing similar behavior symptoms. These findings were consistent across the severe malaria and HIV-infected samples of children. Conclusion: The BRIEF and CBCL instruments offer distinct, yet complementary, assessments of behavior in clinical pediatric populations in the Ugandan context, supporting the use of these measures for similar research settings.

AB Bullying is a common child and adolescent phenomenon that has concurrent and long-term implications for victims' psychological, psychosomatic, social, and academic functioning. Youth with chronic illnesses are at increased risk for being bullied, but few studies have evaluated specific risk and protective factors for medically fragile youth. Despite recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Adolescent Medicine that pediatric health care providers should contribute to bullying prevention and intervention efforts, researchers also have yet to identify the best ways for providers to intervene with medically fragile youth. In this article, the authors review risk and protective factors for bullying among healthy samples. Then, the authors specifically address the ways in which these risk and protective factors are likely to apply to children with fragile medical conditions, and they provide summaries of extant bullying research for selected examples of medically fragile pediatric populations. Finally, the authors present recommendations for intervening with medically fragile youth and suggest several areas in which additional research is needed.

AB BackgroundBipolar disorder (BD) is highly familial, but studies have yet to examine preschoolers at risk for BD using standardized, developmentally appropriate clinical assessment tools. We used such methods to test whether preschoolers at familial risk for BD have more observed difficulty modulating emotions and behaviors than do low-risk preschoolers. Identification of emotional and behavioral difficulties in at-risk preschoolers is crucial for developing new approaches for early intervention and prevention of BD.
   MethodsUsing the standardized disruptive behavior diagnostic observation schedule (DB-DOS) protocol for preschoolers, we compared 23 preschoolers (M-age: 4.53 0.73 years; 18 males) with a first-degree relative with BD to 21 preschoolers (M-age: 4.65 0.84 years; 11 males) without a family history of BD. We characterized psychopathology in this sample using the Preschool Aged Psychiatric Assessment and behavioral and emotional problems using the Child Behavior Checklist.
   ResultsHigh-risk preschoolers demonstrated significantly more intense, pervasive, and clinically concerning problems in anger modulation and behavior dysregulation on the DB-DOS than the low-risk group. High-risk relative to low-risk preschoolers, were also more likely to have maternal-reported anxiety and oppositional defiant disorders and internalizing and externalizing problems.
   ConclusionsClinically concerning problems in anger modulation and behavior regulation, measured during standardized laboratory observation, differentiate preschoolers at high familial risk for BD from those at low risk. Investigation in a large longitudinal sample is critical for replication and for determining whether these observed behavioral differences can be reliably used as prodromal indicators of mood disorders.

AB Background: The children of male veterans with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at particularly high risk of emotional and behavioral problems. However, no studies have examined non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in this population of youth.
   Aims: To determine the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of lifetime NSSI in a sample of psychiatric outpatient adolescent offspring of Croatian PTSD male veterans.
   Method: Consecutive outpatient adolescent offspring of Croatian male PTSD veterans, aged 12 to 18 years, were assessed on the Deliberate Self Harm Inventory, the Youth Self-Report, the Family Assessment Device, the Parental Bonding Instrument and the Demographics Questionnaire.
   Results: Of the whole sample, 52.7% of adolescents reported NSSI at least once during their lifetime. Lifetime NSSI was significantly associated with internalizing symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-4.42, p = .040), poor family functioning (adjusted OR = 6.54; 95% CI: 2.02-21.22, p = .002), lower maternal and paternal care (adjusted OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.40-0.56, p = .000 and adjusted OR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.91, p = .000, respectively) and higher paternal control (adjusted OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.59-2.14, p = .000) in multivariate analysis. No association was found between lifetime NSSI and any of the socio-demographic variables.
   Conclusion: NSSI is a significant clinical problem in outpatient adolescent offspring of PTSD male veterans, which may be influenced by clinical and family factors. Interventions aimed at reducing internalizing symptoms and improving family functioning and parental behaviors are needed in the treatment of adolescent offspring of male PTSD veterans engaging in NSSI.

AB Although the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) has limited use as a biomarker of depression given inadequate sensitivity and specificity, it marks prospective risk for suicide among adults. However, few studies have examined associations between the DST, suicidal ideation, and self-inflicted injury (SII) among adolescents, even though SII is the single best predictor of eventual suicide. We evaluated the DST as a correlate of suicidal ideation and retrospective reports of self-inflicted injury (SII) among adolescent girls, ages 13-17, with histories of depression (n = 28) or depression and self-harm (n = 29). Lower post-DST cortisol was associated with suicidal ideation and SII, over-and-above parent-reports and combined parent-/self-reports of internalizing and externalizing behavior. These findings are consistent with recent acquired capacity models of stress-related psychopathology in which hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function is altered through epigenetic/allostatic mechanisms among vulnerable individuals who incur adversity early in life.

AB The current study investigated brooding and co-rumination as moderators of the relationship between interpersonal and noninterpersonal stress and depressive symptom trajectories. The sample consisted of 368 early adolescents ages 9 to 15 (M = 11.72, 63 % female) who completed self-report measures of brooding, co-rumination, stress, and depressive symptoms at baseline with follow-up assessments of stress and depressive symptoms at 3, 8, and 12 months post-baseline. Data were analyzed using multi-level modeling. Results showed that the association between interpersonal stress and depressive symptoms was stronger for adolescents high on brooding, compared to adolescents low on brooding. Sex moderated a co-rumination x stress interaction, with girls high on co-rumination and boys low on co-rumination reporting the highest levels of depressive symptoms when faced with interpersonal stress across the 1-year study period. These findings shed light on pathways to depressive symptoms in early adolescence and suggest that adolescent boys and girls may differ in these pathways.

AB Compared to families of students with other types of disabilities, families of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are significantly more likely to enact their procedural safeguards such as mediation and due process. However, we do not know which school, child, and parent characteristics are associated with the enactment of safeguards. For this study, 507 parents of students with ASD responded to a national web-based survey. Parents who filed for due process or mediation were more likely to advocate for their child, have poor family-school partnerships, and have greater household incomes. Parents were also more likely to utilize their safeguards if their children were older, experiencing more internalizing behaviors, and educated in segregated placements. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB This study examined how child temperament moderated the effect of family conflict on behavior problems and social competence in a longitudinal sample of 118 Chinese children. Social competence and internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed first at three months after nursery entry (T1) and then at the end of the nursery year (T2). Temperament and physical and psychological modes of family conflict were assessed at T1. The results showed that temperament moderated the effect of physical conflict on externalizing problems at both T1 and T2, as well as the effect of psychological conflict on social competence and internalizing problems at T2. Children with difficult temperament were more susceptible to the negative influence of physical conflict (i.e., showing more externalizing and more rank-order increases in externalizing when exposed to more physically expressed conflict) and the positive influence of psychological conflict (i.e., showing more rank-order decreases in internalizing and increases in social competence when exposed to more openly and verbally expressed conflict). In contrast, children with easy temperament were less susceptible to the influence of physical conflict but more susceptible to the negative influence of psychological conflict (i.e., showing more rank-order decreases in social competence when exposed to more openly and verbally expressed conflict).

AB Numerous studies document concomitant features of sexual behavior problems (SBPs) among children 12 years of age or younger, but rarely does research involve child self-report assessments. This study provides the most comprehensive examination to date of self-reported concerns among children with SBP, using a large sample (N = 392) of clinically referred participants who reported sexual abuse histories. Children between the ages of 8 and 12 were categorized as demonstrating SBP (n = 203) or not demonstrating SBP (n = 189) as determined by scores on the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory. Children completed the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children, and caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Self-reports of children showed that those with SBP reported significantly greater concerns in all areas, including sexual preoccupation and sexual distress, than their peers not demonstrating SBP. Caregivers of children in the SBP group reported greater concerns of internalizing and externalizing problems than the caregivers of children who did not have SBP. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed. Specifically, it is recommended that future research improve on the manner in which sexual abuse and SBPs were defined and assessed.

AB This study utilized latent profile analysis to identify typologies of distress [i.e., patterns of posttraumatic stress (PTS), anxiety, and depression symptoms] among children exposed to Hurricane Katrina. Outcomes and risk factors for these pattern groups were examined. Participants were children (n = 353; ages 8-15 years) affected by Hurricane Katrina. Children were assessed at 3-7 months (Time 1) and 14-17 months (Time 2) post-Katrina. Results identified three pattern groups (No Disturbance, PTS Only, and Mixed Internalizing) at Time 1. Children in the No Disturbance group reported the lowest levels of internal distress, while the Mixed Internalizing group reported the highest levels of internal distress at Time 2. The Mixed Internalizing and the PTS Only groups reported greater school problems than the No Disturbance group at Time 2. Perceived life threat and community violence exposure were risk factors associated with higher likelihood of falling in the PTS Only and Mixed Internalizing groups, compared to the No Disturbance group. Immediate loss and disruption was also a risk factor associated with a higher likelihood of falling in the PTS Only group, compared to the No Disturbance group. Finally, social support from parents or a classmate/friend was a significant protective factor associated with a lower likelihood of falling into a symptomatic pattern group.

AB Moderating effects of kin social support on the association of kin undermining with mothers' and adolescents' adjustment and mothers' parenting were assessed among 200 African American mothers. Kinship social support was positively associated with mother's optimism and negatively associated with their depressive symptoms. Kin support was negatively associated with mother's report of adolescent's externalizing problems. In the area of parenting, kin support was positively linked to mother's emotional support and acceptance. In comparison, kin undermining was negatively associated with mother's optimism and positively linked depressive symptoms. Kin undermining was also positively associated with mother's report of adolescent's internalizing and externalizing problems. Kin undermining was negatively associated with mother's acceptance and positively associated with mother/adolescent communication problems. Moderating effects of kin social support revealed that the positive association of kin undermining with adolescent externalizing was less apparent as mothers reported higher compared to lower kin social support. Also, the positive association of kin undermining with mother/adolescent communication problems was less apparent as mothers reported higher compared to lower levels of kin support. The findings were discussed in terms of the need for more research on how families manage the beneficial and detrimental aspects of their social networks.

AB This study investigated incidence rates of internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the at-risk population of adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) and explored the shared and differing antecedents possibly underlying both maladaptive behavior types. The study aimed to examine a model of three personal vulnerability and protective factors in adolescents-negative affect, attachment to mothers, and sex-in predicting differences in externalizing and internalizing behaviors among adolescents with LD versus adolescents with typical development. Participants included 369 adolescents in Grades 10-11 (ages 15-17 years) from three demographically similar urban public high schools. Descriptive analyses yielded significant group differences on all three measures. Path analysis examined the contribution of this three-factor model for the adjustment of the LD and non-LD groups. A high fit emerged between the theoretical model and the empirical findings, supporting the study hypotheses concerning the role of all three personal factors in understanding differences in the two groups' internalizing and externalizing maladjustment. The present results also yielded partially different patterns of relations for the two groups, especially regarding adolescents' secure attachment to mothers and adolescents' sex as antecedents of maladaptive behavior. Results also indicated the mediating role of adolescents' negative affect in understanding how adolescents' sex and attachment to mothers were associated with their internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Discussion focused on understanding the differential value of these personal factors for understanding well-adjusted behavioral functioning in adolescents with versus without LD.

AB Existing literature suggests that the children of ill parents are susceptible to anxiety and depression. However, some may respond to threatening circumstances such as chronic illness or grief with positive emotions and finding benefits, including appreciation of life and greater emotional strength. We explored the college-age child response to parental illness by examining the relationship of dispositional gratitude, family variables, and characteristics of parental illness to college-age child depression and anxiety. College students completed self-report measures examining dispositional gratitude, family quality of life, depression, and anxiety. In comparison to the healthy parent group, the ill parent group experienced lower family quality of life. There were no significant between group differences in depression or anxiety levels. Dispositional gratitude moderated the relationship between parental health status and college-age child anxiety and depression. This suggests that dispositional gratitude may have served as a buffer against internalizing symptoms within the college- age children of ill parents.

AB Research suggests that genetic, prenatal, endocrine, and parenting influences across development individually contribute to internalizing and externalizing problems in children. The present study tests the combined contributions of genetic risk for psychopathology, prenatal environments (maternal drug use and internalizing symptoms), child cortisol at age 4.5 years, and overreactive parenting influences across childhood on 6-year-old children's internalizing and externalizing problems. We used data from an adoption design that included 361 domestically adopted children and their biological and adopted parents prospectively followed from birth. Only parenting influences contributed (independently) to externalizing problems. However, genetic influences were indirectly associated with internalizing problems (through increased prenatal risk and subsequent morning cortisol), and parenting factors were both directly and indirectly associated with internalizing problems (through morning cortisol). Results suggest that prenatal maternal drug use/symptoms and children's morning cortisol levels are mechanisms of genetic and environmental influences on internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems, in childhood.

AB The present investigation focused on adolescents' defiance against parents by drawing upon psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966) and self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Psychological reactance would be elicited when freedom is taken away, thereby motivating individuals to engage in oppositional behavior. Throughout four studies (total N=1,472, age ranging between 12 and 21years), it was examined whether a controlling parenting style related to adolescents' experiences of autonomy need frustration (i.e., pressure) and reactance. Reactance, in turn, would relate to more externalizing and internalizing problems. Support was obtained for these associations in community and clinical samples, making use of different informants, and controlling for responsiveness and rule setting. A vignette-based study provided further support. The discussion highlights theoretical and clinical implications.

AB Research on neurobiological development is providing insight into the nature and mechanisms of human neural plasticity. These mechanisms appear to support two different forms of developmental learning. One form of learning could be described as externalizing, in which neural representations are highly responsive to environmental influences, as the child typically operates under a mode of hedonic approach. A second form of learning supports internalizing, in which motive control separates attention and self-regulation from the immediate influences of the context, particularly when the child faces conditions of avoidance and threat. The dorsal cortical networks of externalizing are organized around dorsal limbic (cingulate, septal, lateral hypothalamic, hippocampal, and ventral striatal) circuits. In contrast, the ventral cortical networks of internalizing are organized around ventral limbic (anterior temporal and orbital cortex, extended amygdala, dorsal striatal, and mediodorsal thalamic) circuits. These dual divisions of the limbic system in turn self-regulate their arousal levels through different brain stem and forebrain neuromodulator projection systems, with dorsal corticolimbic networks regulated strongly by locus coeruleus norepinephrine and brain stem raphe nucleus serotonin projection systems, and ventral corticolimbic networks regulated by ventral tegmental dopamine and forebrain acetylcholine projections. Because the arousal control systems appear to regulate specific properties of neural plasticity in development, an analysis of these systems explains differences between externalizing and internalizing at multiple levels of neural and psychological self-regulation. In neuroscience, the concept of critical periods has been applied to times when experience is essential for the maturation of sensory systems. In a more general neuropsychological analysis, certain periods of the child's development require successful self-regulation through the differential capacities for externalizing and internalizing.

AB Prior research has found inconsistent evidence regarding the association among childhood adversity, inflammation, and internalizing symptoms, perhaps because previous studies have yet to adequately integrate important factors such as the timing of the adversity, genetic variation, and other relevant processes such as neuroendocrine regulation. The aims of the present study were threefold: (a) to determine whether the effect of the timing of child maltreatment on C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, varies by CRP gene variation; (b) to explore whether links between salivary CRP and childhood internalizing symptoms depend on the presence and timing of maltreatment experiences; and (c) to investigate the role of CRP in the relations between child neuroendocrine regulation and internalizing symptoms and examine whether these associations are moderated by the presence and timing of child maltreatment. Participants included a sample of 267 maltreated and 222 nonmaltreated children (M age = 9.72, SD = 0.99; 52.4% male; 66% African American) who attended a summer day camp research program designed for school-aged low-income children. Department of Human Services records were examined to determine the onset and recency of maltreatment for children in the maltreated group. The results indicated that among children with recent onset maltreatment, those with at least one A allele from CRP single nucleotide polymorphism rs1417938 evidenced significantly higher CRP levels compared to recently maltreated children carrying the TT genotype. Moreover, higher levels of CRP were associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms only for recently maltreated children. Finally, we did not find support for salivary CRP as a mechanism in the relation between neuroendocrine regulation and childhood internalizing symptoms. Our findings highlight the importance of the timing of child maltreatment and have important implications for characterizing variability in inflammation and internalizing symptoms among youth.

AB The family stress model represents a common framework through which to examine the effects of environmental stressors on adolescent adjustment. The model suggests that economic and neighborhood stressors influence youth adjustment via disruptions to parenting. Incorporating integrative developmental theory, we examined the degree to which parents' cultural value orientations mitigated the effects of stressors on parenting disruptions and the degree to which environmental adversity qualified the effect of parenting on adolescent adjustment. We tested the hypothesized integrative family stress model longitudinally in a sample of mother-youth dyads (N = 749) and father-youth dyads (N = 467) from Mexican origin families, across 3 times points spanning early to middle adolescence. Providing the first longitudinal evidence of family stress mediated effects, mothers' perceptions of economic pressure were associated with increases in adolescent externalizing symptoms 5 years later via intermediate increases in harsh parenting. The remaining findings supported the notion that integrative developmental theory can inform family stress model hypothesis testing that is culturally and contextually relevant for a wide range of diverse families and youth. For example, fathers' perceptions of economic pressure and neighborhood danger had important implications for adolescent internalizing, via reductions in paternal warmth, but only at certain levels of neighborhood adversity. Mothers' familism value orientations mitigated the effects of economic pressure on maternal warmth, protecting their adolescents from experiencing developmental costs associated with environmental stressors. Results are discussed in terms of identifying how integrative developmental theory intersects with the family stress model to set diverse youth on different developmental pathways.

AB Purpose: Cyberbullying appears to be on the rise among adolescents due in part to increased access to electronic devices and less online supervision. Less is known about how cyberbullying differs from traditional bullying which occurs in person and the extent to which these two forms overlap. Our first aim was to examine the overlap of traditional bullying (relational, verbal, and physical) with cyberbullying. The second aim examined student-and school-level correlates of cyber victimization as compared to traditional victims. The final aim explored details of the cyberbullying experience (e.g., who sent the message, how was the message sent, and what was the message about).
   Methods: Data came from 28,104 adolescents (grades, 9-12) attending 58 high schools.
   Results: Approximately 23% of the youth reported being victims of any form of bullying (cyber, relational, physical, and verbal) within the last month, with 25.6% of those victims reporting being cyberbullied. The largest proportion (50.3%) of victims reported they were victimized by all four forms, whereas only 4.6% reported being only cyberbullied. Multilevel analyses indicated that as compared to those who were only traditionally bullied, those who were cyberbullied were more likely to have externalizing (odds ratio = 1.44) and internalizing symptoms (odds ratio = 1.25). Additional analyses examined detailed characteristics of the cyberbullying experiences, indicating a relatively high level of overlap between cyber and traditional bullying.
   Conclusions: Implications for preventive interventions targeting youth involved with cyberbullying and its overlap with other forms of bullying are discussed. (c) 2015 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundWhile limited evidence suggests that omega-3 supplementation may reduce antisocial behavior in children, studies have not reported on posttreatment follow-up and most treatment periods have been of short duration. This study tests the hypothesis that omega-3 supplementation over 6months will reduce behavior problems in children both at the end of treatment and at 6months post treatment.
   MethodsIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, parallel-group trial, a community sample of 8-16year old children were randomized into a treatment group (N=100) and a placebo-control group (N=100). The supplementation consisted of a fruit drink containing 1g/day of omega-3 or a placebo consisting of the same fruit drink without omega-3. Participants, caregivers, and research assistants were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome measures of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems were reported by both caregivers and their children in a laboratory setting at 0months (baseline), 6months (end of treatment) and 12months (6months post treatment), together with the secondary outcome measures of parental antisocial behavior. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis including all participants. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov:
   ResultsSignificant groupxtime interactions were observed with the treatment group showing long-term improvements in child behavior problems. The average posttreatment effect size was d=-.59. Effects were documented for parent reports, but with the exception of proactive and reactive aggression, child-report data were nonsignificant. Parents whose children took omega-3 showed significant posttreatment reductions in their own antisocial and aggressive behavior. This improvement in caregiver behavior partly mediated the improvements observed in child behavior.
   ConclusionsFindings provide initial evidence that omega-3 supplementation can produce sustained reductions in externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Results are the first to report improvements in caregiver behavior, and to establish this improvement as a part-mechanism for the efficacy of omega-3.

AB Most research exploring the interplay between context and adolescent separation and detachment has focused on the family; in contrast, this investigation directs its attention outside of the family to peers. Utilizing a latent variable approach for modeling interactions and incorporating reports of behavioral adjustment from 14-year-old adolescents (N = 190) and their mothers, we examine how separation and detachment relate to adolescent-peer relationships, and whether peer relationships moderate how separation and detachment relate to adolescent internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Positive peer relationships were both associated with lower detachment and sharply attenuated relations between detachment and higher adolescent internalizing and externalizing. Separation from parents was unrelated to peer relationships, and regardless of whether peer relationships were positive, separation was not related to adolescent internalizing and externalizing. We integrate these findings with those from family-focused investigations and discuss their substantive and clinical implications.

AB Objective: The objectives of this study were to model growth in anxiety and depressive symptoms from late school age through young adulthood in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and controls with developmental delay (DD), and to assess relationships among internalizing growth patterns, participant characteristics, baseline predictors, and distal outcomes.
   Method: Data were collected between ages 6 and 24 years in 165 participants (n = 109 with ASD; n = 56 with non-spectrum DD), most of whom received diagnostic evaluations in both childhood and early adulthood. Questionnaires were collected approximately every 3 to 6 months between ages 9 and 24 years. Parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Adult Behavior Checklist (ABCL), and Developmental Behaviour Checklist anxiety-and depression-related subscale distributions were modeled with mixed-effects Poisson models, covarying diagnosis, age, verbal IQ (VIQ), gender, and significant 2- and 3-way interactions.
   Results: Anxiety was positively associated with VIQ, and controlling for VIQ, both anxiety and depressive symptoms were greater in ASD than non-spectrum participants. Female gender predicted greater increases over time in anxiety and depressive symptoms for both diagnostic groups. Lower maternal education was associated with increasing internalizing symptoms in a subset of less verbal individuals with ASD. In exploratory post hoc analyses, internalizing symptoms were associated with poorer emotional regulation in school age, and with lower life satisfaction and greater social difficulties in early adulthood.
   Conclusion: Findings support previous claims that individuals with ASD are at particular risk for affect- and anxiety-specific problems. Although symptom levels in females increase at a faster rate throughout adolescence, males with ASD appear to have elevated levels of depressive symptoms in school age that are maintained into young adulthood.

AB Objective: Little is known about the longitudinal genetic and environmental association between juvenile irritability and symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study's goal was to assess the relationship between these constructs across a critical developmental period spanning childhood to young adulthood.
   Method: Parents (n = 1,348 twin pairs) from the Swedish Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development completed the Child/Adult Behavior Checklist (CBCL/ABCL) about their twin children. Data were collected during a prospective, 4-wave study starting in childhood (ages 8-9 years) and ending in young adulthood (ages 19 20 years). An irritability score and an anxious/depressed score were computed from CBCL/ABCL item endorsements. Genetically informative cross-lagged models were used to estimate the genetic and environmental relationship between these 2 constructs across time.
   Results: Our models suggested that irritability more strongly predicted anxious/depressed symptoms than vice versa, consistent with a causal role of irritability on anxiety/depression at older ages. This relationship was significant only in late childhood/early adolescence. Additive genetic and unique environmental factors were significant contributors to both irritability and anxious/depressed symptoms and were both specific to and shared between these 2 constructs. The same common environmental factors influenced both constructs, although these factors accounted for a smaller amount of variance than genetic or unique environmental factors.
   Conclusion: This study adds to our understanding of the developmental relationship between irritability and anxious/depressed symptoms and the contribution of genes and environmental factors to their association across development. Findings suggest the need to monitor for emergence of internalizing symptoms in irritable children and their potential need for therapeutic intervention.

AB Modern definitions of complete mental health include both positive and negative indicators of psychological functioning. We examined the associations between peer relationships (victimization and receipt of prosocial acts) and multiple indicators of mental health that represent subjective well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, positive and negative affect) and psychopathology (general internalizing symptoms and externalizing problemsaggressive behavior) among 500 high school students in Grades 9 to 11. Peer experiences explained the most variance in positive affect (R-2 = 18%) and internalizing psychopathology (R-2 = 19%). Different types of peer experiences drove these effects, with relational victimization particularly salient to internalizing psychopathology and prosocial acts by peers most predictive of positive affect. Moderation analyses indicated that peers' prosocial acts did not serve a protective role in the associations between victimization and mental health. Instead, the presence of overt victimization negated the positive associations between prosocial acts and good mental health (high life satisfaction, low internalizing psychopathology). Understanding these associations illuminates the range of student outcomes possibly impacted by victimization and suggests that both limiting peer victimization and facilitating positive peer experiences may be necessary to facilitate complete mental health among high school students.

AB Studies regarding the relationship between attachment and psychopathology during adolescence have been performed separately for clinical and nonclinical adolescents and have used different assessment measures, which together might produce a methodological bias that increases the association between attachment and psychopathology. With the aim of avoiding this bias, the present study used identical measures to explore the relationship between attachment styles and internalizing or externalizing symptoms in clinical and nonclinical samples of adolescents. The sample consisted of 258 adolescents, 129 clinical and 129 nonclinical, aged between 14 and 18 years. The adolescents in each sample were matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Attachment was assessed using the CaMir Q-sort, and psychopathological symptoms were assessed by means of the Youth Self Report (YSR). The relationships between attachment and psychopathology were similar for clinical and nonclinical adolescents. A preoccupied attachment style predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms, somatic complaints, anxious-fearful behavior, verbal aggression, attention-seeking behavior, and thinking problems. Compared to previous studies, this research has made it possible to identify broader, stronger, and more specific associations between preoccupied attachment style and psychopathological symptoms in adolescents.

AB Over the last few decade child sexual abuse (CSA) have provoked a great deal of interest, both among the scientific community and the society, due to its prevalence and short and long term consequences. Although most of the studies examining CSA sequelae list numerous psychological, social, behavioral and physical difficulties, certainly not every child abuse survivor shows a significant harm thereafter, existing a great variability on the survivor's adjustment. In light of this diversity the present work, after review the short and long term consequences of GSA, attempt to discern which are the main variables that determine the effects of the abuse on the survivors. Characteristics of the abuse, survivor and perpetrator, situational factors and, specially, survivor's cognitive variables have been proved as efficient in order to explain the symptomatology severity. Specifically, studies have found that replacing avoidance coping strategies by approaching ones, eliminating self-blame and family blame attributions and the four traumagenic dynamics feelings, as well as promoting a secure attachment style would have a positive impact in order to prevent future problems caused by the experience of abuse.

AB Children with poor emotion knowledge (EK) skills are at risk for externalizing problems; less is known about early internalizing behavior. We examined multiple facets of EK and social-emotional experiences relevant for internalizing difficulties, including loneliness, victimization, and peer rejection, in Head Start preschoolers (N = 134; M = 60months). Results based on multiple informants suggest that facets of EK are differentially related to negative social-emotional experiences and internalizing behavior and that sex plays a moderating role. Behavioral EK was associated with self-reported loneliness, victimization/rejection, and parent-reported internalizing symptoms. Emotion recognition and expressive EK were related to self-reported loneliness, and emotion situation knowledge was related to parent-reported internalizing symptoms and negative peer nominations. Sex moderated many of these associations, suggesting that EK may operate differently for girls vs. boys in the preschool social context. Results are discussed with regard to the role of EK for social development and intervention implications.

AB The family context plays a critical role in the health of the child. This was the first study to examine the usefulness of the General Functioning subscale of the Family Assessment Device (FAD-GF) in assessing family functioning and its relationship to internalizing symptoms in school-aged children aged between 9 and 11 years of age. Eight hundred and forty-seven year 4 and 5 students from 13 schools (607 intervention students, and 240 control students) participated in the Aussie Optimism Positive Thinking Skills Program (AO-PTS) - a universal school-based program targeting internalizing symptoms. Students rated how 'healthy' they perceived their family to be at pre-test and at 6-months follow-up. Although some aspects of validity and reliability could be improved, results indicated that perceptions of family functioning at pre-test were predictive of internalizing symptoms at the 6-months follow-up. The FAD-GF therefore showed promise as a potential measure of family functioning for children as young as 9 years old. Regardless of children's pre-test levels of perceived family functioning, no intervention effects were found on the anxiety and depression scales; this finding suggests that child perceptions of family functioning may act as a general protective factor against internalizing symptomology.

AB Despite evidence for the associations of positive affect to prosocial behaviors and internalizing problems, relatively little is known about the underlying etiology. The sample comprised over 300 twin pairs at age 3. Positive affect, prosocial behaviors, and internalizing problems were assessed using the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (Goldsmith, 1996), the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children (Hogg et al., 1997), and the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 1.5-5 (Achenbach, 1991), respectively. Positive affect correlated positively with prosocial behaviors, and negatively with internalizing problems. Prosocial behaviors were negatively associated with internalizing problems. The relations of positive affect to prosocial behaviors and internalizing problems were due to environmental effects (shared and non-shared). In contrast, the link between prosocial behaviors and internalizing problems was entirely explained by genetic effects. The current study has moved beyond prior emphasis on negative affect and elucidated the less understood etiology underlying the associations between positive affect, prosocial behaviors, and internalizing problems. This study could guide the development of programs for promoting prosocial behaviors and alleviating internalizing problems in children.

AB The transition into foster care can be difficult for children. Research has consistently shown an increased risk for children in foster care to exhibit higher levels of problem behaviours in comparison to youth in the general population. The purpose of this study was to analyse the associations between the youths' perception of their relationship with their caregiver on their perception of their own internalizing and externalizing behaviours as well as the youths' perception of the relationships with caregivers and how caregivers report of youths' internalizing and externalizing behaviours. This study utilized the secondary data from the general release version of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being [National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (2009) Introduction to the wave 1 general and restricted use releases, Nation Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, Ithaca, NY]. Significant relationships between youths' perception of relationship with their caregiver were found with both youth perception of internalizing behaviours and caregiver perception of internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Results are explained with implications for practice, training, research and policy.

AB Monitoring and blunting are cognitive-affective informational processing styles that may predict future internalizing symptoms among youths with cystic fibrosis (CF). Forty-four youths with CF (9-23 years) and one of their parents completed measures of the youths' monitoring, blunting, and internalizing symptoms at baseline and again two years later. Monitoring was associated with higher levels of concurrent internalizing symptoms on self- but not parent report, and did not predict changes in future symptoms. Blunting, in contrast, predicted a relative decrease in self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms and in parent-report of youths' depressive symptoms at Time 2. Our findings suggest that blunting may be an important protective factor in the adjustment of youths with CF.

AB Objective. To examine the impact that domestic violence (DV) has on hindering the success of urban migrants in Peru and any association with maternal depression, impaired parenting, social capital, and child development.
   Methods. This was a cross-sectional study consisting of structured interviews with 97 mothers and their school-aged children in El Porvenir, a predominantly migrant area of the city of Trujillo, Peru. Data collection occurred in February-June 2011. Proven tools previously validated for use in Spanish were used to assess the following variables: maternal depression, social capital, domestic violence, parenting behaviors, child socioemotional development, and child cognitive development. Correlational, multiple regression, tests of interaction, and indirect/mediator models were used for analysis.
   Results. Sixty-five percent of women reported currently experiencing DV. DV strongly predicted depression (P < 0.001). Women who reported DV were less likely to be employed (P < 0.05), had lower cognitive social capital (P < 0.01), engaged in fewer caregiving activities (P < 0.05), had less maternal energy (P < 0.05), and were less warm (P < 0.05). DV was associated with internalizing behaviors in children (P < 0.01), with impaired parenting partially mediating this relationship.
   Conclusions. DV compromises women's mental health and parenting ability. High rates of DV among urban migrants affect the whole community by hindering employment potential and reducing trust among community members. Interventions targeting DV-related variables (e.g., substance abuse and limited job opportunities for men) could reduce the deleterious effects of DV on urban migrant communities across Latin America.

AB The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between attachment representations of preschool children living in different cultures and their social competence, and between their attachment representations and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. The participants of this study were 44 children:20 French and 24 Turkish. The data were collected from Besancon, France and Ankara, Turkey in the academic year 2011-2012. Two measurement instruments (Attachment Story Completion Task and Preschool Socioaffective Profile) were used for data collection.The research findings reveal that the rate of secure attachment is higher in girls compared to boys, and that nationality does not play a determining role in the attachment styles.In Turkish children, anger-aggression scores and anxiety-withdrawal scores do not differ significantly by the attachment style, whereas social competence differs significantly by the attachment style.In French children, externalizing behavior problems scores do not differ significantly by the attachment style, whereas social competence and internalizing behavior problems scores differ significantly by the attachment style.

AB Body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs; e.g., hair pulling, skin picking, and nail biting) can cause significant physical and psychological distress. However, data examining BFRBs in non-clinical youth is limited. This study examined parent-reports of the incidence and clinical correlates of BFRBs in 315 Salvadorian children (4-17 years). Forty-six percent had at least one BFRB; nail biting was commonly reported (34.6%), followed by skin picking (24.8%), and hair pulling (10.5%). Of those endorsing BFRBs, 13.7% reported elevated distress and/or interference due to these behaviors, including approximately one-third of skin pickers and hair pullers (8.3% and 2.9% of the total sample) and one-fifth of nail biters (7.3% of the total sample). Skin pickers and hair pullers, but not nail biters, had higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, poorer adaptive functioning, and more difficulties with inattention, compared to those who reported no BFRBs. Skin picking symptom severity was positively correlated with externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Nail biting symptom severity was associated with increased internalizing symptoms, while severity of hair pulling was not significantly associated with behavioral and emotional functioning. These data suggest that BFRBs are commonplace and may be associated with behavioral and emotional functioning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

ID CHILDREN; PROFILE; PERSONALITY; LIVES; ADHD
AB Introduction: Growing evidence suggests that an individual's style of processing sensory information plays a role in affective disorders. However, most of this work focuses on the relationship between sensory hypersensitivity and factors related to internalizing disorders. This study explores the association between sensory processing styles and impulsivity, a fundamental feature of externalizing disorders, in healthy adults.
   Method: Two hundred and twenty-six healthy individuals aged 18-60 years completed the adolescent/adult sensory profile, Barratt impulsiveness scale, and a computerized response inhibition task (go/no-go task).
   Findings: Low registration sensory processing scores were positively correlated with Barratt impulsivity scores. In addition, individuals high in low registration were more likely to meet criteria for high impulsivity. Individuals higher in sensory sensitivity made more impulsive errors on the response inhibition task.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that individuals with low registration are more impulsive. When helping clients manage impulsivity, occupational therapists should consider their sensory processing patterns and utilize interventions that address sensory needs. Future studies should examine these associations in clinical populations characterized by high rates of impulsive behavior.

AB The process of child's mental development depends heavily on the social interrelationship between the mother and her child. Schizophrenia in mothers potentially disrupts mother infant relationship and adaptation to motherhood. Literature is limited on evaluating the emotional and behavioral problems of children of mother having schizophrenia with nearly none from the Indian subcontinent. The aim of the current study was to examine the effect of psychosocial environment in children of females with schizophrenia. Thirty children of mothers suffering with schizophrenia were evaluated with Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents. The psychosocial environment was assessed using Parent Interview Schedule. Control group of 30 children were evaluated in the same way as the cases. The children of female patients with schizophrenia were found to score significantly higher on internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems on CBCL as compared to control group, along with significant differences in the psychosocial environment between the groups. We conclude that there is a need for screening and evaluation of children of mothers diagnosed with schizophrenia, for identifying and managing possible mental and behavioral problems in them, and to assess the psychosocial environment and provide interventions for issues related to it.

AB Investigations regarding the differences between Chinese only and non-only children primarily examine children's social behaviors, which are closely related to their early relationships with mothers and teachers. In recent years, the number of non-only children born in urban areas has increased because of the softening of the One-Child Policy, which leads to the distribution of non-only children shifting from being primarily in rural areas to being in both urban and rural areas. The present study investigates the current characteristics and influences of mother-child and teacher-child relationships on Chinese only and non-only children's early social behaviors from the perspective of urban and rural differences. Data were obtained from 126 rural only children, 94 rural non-only children, 168 urban only children and 155 urban non-only children from 38 semi-urban kindergartens in Beijing, China. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses found that mother-child closeness positively predicted children's social skills particularly in non-only children, whereas mother-child conflict positively predicted internalizing behavior problems in all four groups. Teacher-child conflict negatively predicted children's social skills most strongly in urban only children. Teacher-child conflict aggravated rural only children's, urban only children's and non-only children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, but mother-child closeness buffered rural only children's externalizing behavior problems. Findings underscore the importance for mothers to improve closeness, especially with rural only children, and for teachers to avoid conflict with both urban only and non-only children, as well as with rural only children.

AB Bullying is a widespread problem facing American adolescents. A better understanding of factors that may moderate the impact of bullying is important given its negative consequences for well-being. This study examines the association between bullying experiences and internalizing problems among a nationally representative sample of young adolescents. Additionally, we consider the ease of parental communication as a potential moderating factor in these associations. Using a structural equation modeling technique, results suggest that bullying is characteristically different for adolescent boys and girls and that its association with internalizing problems is stronger for adolescent females. Results also indicate that parental communication moderates the association between bullying and internalizing problems; higher levels of parental communication buffer adolescents against the negative influence of bullying.

AB Objective To examine the longitudinal relationship between neuropsychological functioning and internalizing symptoms, as mediated by social competence in youth with spina bifida (SB). Methods A total of 111 youth (aged 8-15 years, M = 11.37) with SB, their parents, and teachers completed questionnaires regarding attention, social competence, and internalizing symptoms. Youth also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results An indirect-only mediation model revealed that social competence mediated the relation between neuropsychological functioning and subsequent levels of teacher-reported internalizing symptoms, but not parent or youth report of internalizing symptoms. Specifically, better neuropsychological functioning was associated with better social competence, which, in turn, predicted fewer internalizing symptoms 2 years later. Conclusions Youth with SB with lower levels of neuropsychological functioning may be at risk for poorer social competence and, as a result, greater internalizing symptoms. Interventions that promote social competence, while being sensitive to cognitive capacities, could potentially alleviate or prevent internalizing symptoms in these youth.

AB Several theories propose a relationship between deficits in autonomy and relatedness and the development of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Empirical work supports relationships between maternal BPD and adolescent symptomatology, as well as between maternal autonomy and relatedness and adolescent symptomatology. However, no study has examined how individuals with BPD differ from normative comparisons on autonomy and relatedness, or whether mothers' BPD mediates the relationship between their autonomy and relatedness and their adolescents' symptomatology. We sampled 28 mothers with BPD and their adolescents aged 14-17 years, as well as 28 normative comparisons matched on demographic variables. We assessed BPD as a categorical diagnosis and along a continuum of self-reported borderline features. In a videotaped problem-solving interaction, controlling for current major depressive disorder, mothers with BPD were less likely to promote and more likely to inhibit relatedness, and they were marginally more likely to inhibit but equally likely to promote autonomy with their adolescents. Mothers' total borderline features mediated the relationship between mothers' promotion of autonomy plus relatedness and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms (anxious depression, withdrawn depression, somatic problems, rule breaking, and aggression) and adolescent borderline features (affective instability and self-harm). Mothers' total borderline features also mediated the relationship between mothers' inhibition of autonomy plus relatedness and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms (anxious depression, withdrawn depression, somatic problems, and aggression but not rule breaking) and adolescent borderline features (affective instability and self-harm). We discuss findings in terms of light shed on BPD and the effect of maternal BPD on adolescent development.

AB The main objective of this paper is to study the relationship between different areas of victimization (e.g., sexual victimization) and psychological symptoms taking into account the full range of victimizations adolescents suffer. The final aim is to contribute further evidence regarding the bias that those studies which focus on just one area of victimization may be introducing into our psychological knowledge. A total of 923 adolescents (62.4 % girls) between 14 and 18 years old were recruited from seven secondary schools in Catalonia, Spain. The Youth Self-report and the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire were employed to assess psychological problems (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) and victimization, respectively. The large majority of adolescents reported having experienced more than one area of victimization. However, Conventional Crime area was the one that was more reported in isolation. Overall, the explicative power of a particular area of victimization was greatly reduced or even lost its significance when the other areas were taken into account. However, some areas remained significant and were different by gender. Clinicians and researchers should take into account the whole range of victimizations adolescents suffer when intending to understand the psychological aftermaths of victimization. Some areas of victimization appear to be more important at explaining particular psychological symptoms, those being Peer and Sibling Victimization in the case of boys, and both Conventional Crime and Internet Victimization in the case of girls.

AB In this study, we compared internalizing and externalizing problem behavior of 67 Dutch adolescents (M-age = 16.04) in planned lesbian families who were matched with 67 adolescents in heterosexual-parent families. We also examined whether homophobic stigmatization was associated with problem behavior in adolescents with lesbian mothers after taking into account demographic characteristics, mothers' scores on emotional involvement, and adolescents' earlier problem behavior (measured at age 4-8 years old). Standardized instruments measuring problem behavior were completed by parents and adolescent offspring, and questions about stigmatization were answered by adolescents with lesbian mothers. The results revealed no differences in internalizing and externalizing problem behavior associated with family type. Offspring in lesbian families who reported more experiences of homophobic stigmatization also demonstrated more internalizing and externalizing problem behavior.

AB The present study investigates the trajectory of children's exposure to interparental conflict during adolescence, its effects on adolescents' psychological adjustment, as well as the ability of a family-centered prevention program to alter this trajectory. A total of 331 African American couples with an adolescent or preadolescent child participated in a randomized control trial of the Promoting Strong African American Families program, a newly developed program targeting couple and cocaregiving processes. Using a multi-informant, latent growth curve approach, child exposure to interparental conflict during adolescence was found to be stable over a period of 2 years among families in the control group, but significantly declined among families in the treatment condition. Rates of change were significantly different between intervention and control groups based on parents' report of youth exposure to interparental conflict, but not for child's report. Structural equation models found trajectory parameters of interparental conflict predicted changes in adolescent depressive symptoms, with increasing rates of changes in conflict associated with increases in adolescent internalizing symptoms over the 2-year duration of the study. Finally, a significant indirect effect was identified linking treatment, changes in parents' reports of child exposure to interparental conflict, and adolescent depressive symptoms. The implications for research and intervention are discussed.

AB Objective: Antenatal maternal anxiety predicts offspring neurodevelopment and psychopathology, although the degree to which these associations reflect postnatal influences is unclear. To limit this possibility, we assessed newborn neuronal microstructures using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and assessed neonatal microstructure variation in relation to antenatal anxiety and in prediction of infant socio-emotional behavior at age 1 year.
   Method: Dyads were drawn from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort, and included mothers who completed the Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26 weeks gestation (scoring >90, n = 20; scoring <70, n = 34) and their neonates (5-17 days postnatal) who took part in DTI.
   Results: Antenatal anxiety predicted variation in fractional anisotropy (FA) of regions important to cognitive-emotional responses to stress (i.e., the right insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), sensory processing (e.g., right middle occipital), and socio-emotional function (e.g., the right angular gyrus, uncinate fasciculus, posterior cingulate, and parahippocampus). In a subset of infants with Infant Toddler Socio-Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) data, some of these right lateralized clusters predicted infant internalizing (e.g., insula: beta = 0.511, p=.03) but not externalizing behavior 1 year later, although these analyses failed to withstand the correction for multiple comparisons.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest the need for larger-scale investigations of the role that corticolimbic structures play in regulating cognitive-emotional responses to threat, and potentially in mediating the cross-generational transmission of anxiety, as well as in underscoring the importance of early mother infant intervention programs.

AB Background: In recent years, several twin studies adopted a dimensional approach to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and estimated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in autistic traits. However, no study was performed on adults over 18 years of age and all but two studies were based on parent or teacher ratings. Also, the genetic and environmental contributions to the interplay between autistic traits and adult personality dimensions have not been investigated.
   Methods: A sample of 266 complete twin pairs (30% males, mean age 40 +/- 12 years) drawn from the population-based Italian Twin Register was administered the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125), and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Genetic structural equation modelling was performed with the Mx program. Estimates were adjusted for gender, age, and GHQ-12 score.
   Results: Genetic factors accounted for 44% and 20%-49% of individual differences in autistic traits and TCI dimensions, respectively. Unshared environmental factors explained the remaining proportion of variance. Consistently with the notion of a personality profile in ASD characterised by obsessive temperament, autistic traits showed significant phenotypic correlations with several TCI dimensions (positive: HA; negative: NS, RD, SD, C). Genetic and unshared environmental correlations between AQ and these TCI dimensions were significant. The degree of genetic overlap was generally greater than the degree of environmental overlap.
   Conclusions: Despite some limitations, this study suggests that genetic factors contribute substantially to individual differences in autistic traits in adults, with unshared environmental influences also playing an important role. It also suggests that autistic traits and the majority of temperament and character dimensions share common genetic and environmental aetiological factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study examined direct and interactive links between friendships and social, academic, and psychological adjustment problems (i.e., peer rejection as nominated by same-ethnic and cross-ethnic peers, teacher-reported academic engagement, and teacher-reported internalizing symptoms) among school-age children in multiethnic schools (n = 509, age: 9-10). The data, which included 2 time points with a 6-month interval, were drawn from a relatively large-sized, short-term longitudinal study. Results showed that cross-ethnic friendships (not same-ethnic friendships) were associated with greater academic engagement concurrently and predated decreased peer rejection and internalizing symptoms longitudinally, even after controlling for the availability of same-ethnic peers and classroom diversity. Furthermore, cross-ethnic friendships (not same-ethnic friendships) moderated the link between relational victimization and increased peer rejection and greater internalizing symptoms, such that this link was evidenced for children with fewer cross-ethnic friendships. However, the moderation effect was contingent upon the type of outcome variables and the ethnicity of the child. For example, the buffering effect against the negative contribution of relational victimization to internalizing symptoms was found particularly for African American children. The findings are discussed based on theories of normative development, ethnic socialization, and intergroup relations.

AB There is limited research examining psychological correlates of a uniquely racialized experience of the model minority stereotype faced by Asian Americans. The present study examined the factor structure and fit of the only published measure of the internalization of the model minority myth, the Internalization of the Model Minority Myth Measure (IM-4; Yoo et al., 2010), with a sample of 155 Asian American high school adolescents. We also examined the link between internalization of the model minority myth types (i.e., myth associated with achievement and myth associated with unrestricted mobility) and psychological adjustment (i.e., affective distress, somatic distress, performance difficulty, academic expectations stress), and the potential moderating effect of academic performance (cumulative grade point average). Results suggested the 2-factor model of the IM-4 had an acceptable fit to the data and supported the factor structure using confirmatory factor analyses. Internalizing the model minority myth of achievement related positively to academic expectations stress; however, internalizing the model minority myth of unrestricted mobility related negatively to academic expectations stress, both controlling for gender and academic performance. Finally, academic performance moderated the model minority myth associated with unrestricted mobility and affective distress link and the model minority myth associated with achievement and performance difficulty link. These findings highlight the complex ways in which the model minority myth relates to psychological outcomes.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine the unique and interactive contributions of infant negative emotionality and family risk factors in the development of internalizing-only, externalizing-only, and co-occurring behavior problems in early childhood. The sample included 412 infants and their primary caregivers. Interviews and temperament assessments took place when infants were 5-7 months old, and primary caregivers completed child behavior ratings at ages 2 1/2 and 5 years. Mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associations between infant risk factors and "pure" and co-occurring child behavior problems, and test whether these associations changed over time. The results of this study showed that hostile parenting during infancy increased the likelihood that children would develop internalizing-only problems, whereas infants who were highly distressed in response to novelty were at increased risk of developing externalizing-only problems. Multiple risk factors, including maternal anxious and depressive symptoms, family conflict, and younger maternal age, independently predicted early childhood co-occurring problems. Additionally, there was a significant interaction between infant anger/frustration and hostile parenting: In the context of hostile parenting, infants high in anger were at increased risk of developing early co-occurring problems, though this association faded by age 5. These findings point to the importance of considering the infant's family context, and differentiating between "pure" and co-occurring behaviors when examining the etiology of early childhood behavior problems.

AB This study tested 2 related hypotheses. The first holds that high co-rumination anticipates heightened internalizing problems. The second holds that positive relationships with friends exacerbate the risk for internalizing problems arising from co-rumination. A sample of MZ twins followed from birth (194 girls and 170 boys) completed (a) self-reports of friendship support, friendship negativity, and co-rumination with friends at age 12 and (b) measures of anxiety and depression at ages 12 and 13. Using a monozygotic twins-difference design, within-pair differences in co-rumination predicted increased within-pair differences in anxiety (but not depression), after removing the covariance between co-rumination and perceptions of friendship. In other words, the difference in co-rumination within each monozygotic twin pair predicted an increase in the difference in their anxiety levels, but not the difference in their depression levels. The discussion focuses on nonshared environmental influences, because the monozygotic twin-difference design eliminates the possibility that associations were driven by heritability or by shared environmental factors that underlie friendship experiences and internalizing problems.

AB This study investigated informant agreement on emotional and behavior problems and social skills in youth with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability using meta-analytic methods. Forty-nine studies were included, consisting of 107 effect sizes. The mean weighted effect size across all raters and all behaviors was .36, reflecting moderate agreement. Consistent with meta-analyses in typically developing youth, pairs of similar informants (e.g., parent-parent) demonstrated higher agreement compared to pairs of different raters (e.g., parent-teacher). With all rater pairs combined, agreement was significantly higher for externalizing problems ( = .42) than either internalizing problems ( = .35) or social skills ( = .30). Several factors appear to moderate the level of agreement among informants, including the youth's diagnosis, age, and IQ.

AB This study examined depressogenic thinking and shame proneness as factors in the development of internalizing problems in a longitudinal sample of 174 children (99 boys, 75 girls). At 7.6-9.4 years of age (Time 1), mothers assessed general internalizing problems in their children and depressogenic thinking, shame proneness, and anxiety were assessed by child self report. At 10.2-11.8 years of age (Time 2), mothers reassessed internalizing problems, and children reported their anxiety and depression. At 12.3-13.1 years of age (Time 3), children who had been high on any Time 2 measure of internalizing problems were selected for assessment of anxiety and depressive disorders. Depressogenic thinking and shame were significantly correlated and predicted subsequent problems. Depressogenic thinking predicted internalizing problems and anxious and depressive symptoms. Shame directly predicted boys' depressive symptoms, and indirectly predicted boys' general internalizing problems and girls' social anxiety. Depressive disorders in early adolescence were predicted specifically by shame. Findings suggest that both shame and depressive thinking contribute to the development of children's internalizing problems.

AB The present paper aims to longitudinally assess the emotional functioning of children of mothers with depression, anxiety, or eating disorders and of mothers with no psychological disorders and to evaluate the possible mediating role of fathers' psychological profiles on children's internalizing/externalizing functioning using SCID I, SCL-90/R and CBCL/1A1/2-5. The results showed maternal psychopathology to be strongly related to children's maladaptive profiles. Children of mothers with depression and anxiety showed higher internalizing scores than children of other groups. These scores increased from T1 to T2. Children of mothers with eating disorders showed higher and increasing externalizing scores than children of other groups. The data showed that fathers' interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety and psychoticism significantly predicted internalizing problems of the children. Moreover, interpersonal sensitivity and psychoticism significantly predicted externalizing problems. Our results confirmed the impact of maternal psychopathology on maladaptive outcomes in their children, which suggests the importance of considering paternal psychological profiles.

AB This longitudinal study examined psychopathology as an explanatory mechanism linking childhood violence exposure (CVE) to sexual risk in 177 African American girls recruited from mental health clinics serving low-income communities in Chicago. Beginning at average age 14, girls completed five interviews over 2 years and a sixth assessment including trauma history. CVE reflected sexual, physical, or witnessed violence before age 12. Latent growth modeling accounted for developmental change across the six time points. Externalizing, but not internalizing, symptoms mediated the pathway from CVE to number of partners (indirect effect = .16, 95 % CIBCBS = .04-.29) and inconsistent condom use (indirect effect = .11, CIBCBS = .004-.21). Externalizing problems associated with CVE may help to explain its relationship with sexual risk in low-income, treatment-seeking African American girls. Behavioral interventions addressing aggression, impulsivity, and general risk-taking may be most effective in reducing sexual risk in this population.

AB We sought to identify needs for behavioral health care in a large, urban pediatric primary care (PPC) clinic serving a population covered by Medicaid. Specifically, children (N = 197; 120 girls; 91 % African American) ages 8-17 years and their caregivers completed measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms (RCADS, RCADS-P, MASC, and SDQ). Clinical elevations on all but one domain of the SDQ were significantly higher than expected. However, self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms were consistent with expectations. These findings suggest urban, low-income, primarily African American youth presenting at a PPC clinic demonstrate significant levels of behavioral and emotional symptoms. Implications of the findings include the need to ask both parents and children about child behavioral health problems and the possible influence of screening tool selection on detection.

AB Data from two studies were utilized to examine whether the co-occurrence of maladaptive behaviors thought to serve an emotion regulating function would be associated with greater emotion regulation difficulties compared to one or none of these behaviors. Study 1 included an undergraduate sample (N = 119; 76 % female) and Study 2 included a sample of patients receiving treatment at a residential substance abuse treatment facility (N = 82; 48 % female). Subgroups were created based on the presence or absence of the following maladaptive behaviors: (a) deliberate self-harm (DSH) and disordered eating (Study 1); and (b) DSH, disordered eating, and substance misuse (Study 2). Subgroup differences in mean levels of emotion regulation difficulties (overall and six dimensions) were evaluated for each study. In Study 1, individuals who reported clinically-relevant levels of both DSH and disordered eating had more difficulties with emotion regulation (overall and three dimensions) compared to those who reported neither behavior. In Study 2, individuals who reported clinically-relevant levels of both DSH and substance misuse had more difficulties with emotion regulation (Study 2; overall and five dimensions) compared to those with only substance misuse. Overall, the results of these studies support the hypothesis that the co-occurrence of clinically-relevant maladaptive behaviors is associated with greater difficulties regulating emotions than the presence of only one maladaptive behavior (or no maladaptive behaviors). These findings suggest that clinical interventions targeting emotion regulation skills may be particularly useful for individuals who display a pattern of co-occurring maladaptive behaviors.

AB Emerging research has identified sub-dimensions of oppositional defiant disorder - irritability and defiance - that differentially predict internalizing and externalizing symptoms in preschoolers, children, and adolescents. Using a theoretical approach and confirmatory factor analyses to distinguish between irritability and defiance, we investigate the associations among these dimensions and internalizing (anxiety and depression) and externalizing problems (conduct problems) within and across time in a community-based sample of 662 youth (342 females) spanning ages 12 to 18 years old at baseline. On average, irritability was stable across assessment points and defiance declined. Within time, associations of irritability with internalizing were consistently stronger than associations of irritability with conduct problems. Defiance was similarly associated within time with both internalizing and conduct problems in mid-adolescence, but was more highly related to internalizing than to conduct problems by early adulthood (ages 18 to 25). Over time, increasing irritability was related to changes in both internalizing and conduct problems; whereas increases in defiance predicted increases in conduct problems more strongly than internalizing symptoms. Increases in both internalizing and conduct problems were also associated with subsequent increases in both irritability and defiance. Sex differences in these associations were not significant.

   MODEL
AB Conflict in specific family systems (e.g., interparental, parent-child) has been implicated in the development of a host of adjustment problems in adolescence, but little is known about the impact of family conflict involving multiple family systems. Furthermore, questions remain about the effects of family conflict on symptoms of specific disorders and adjustment problems and the processes mediating these effects. The present study prospectively examines the impact of family conflict and emotional security about the family system on adolescent symptoms of specific disorders and adjustment problems, including the development of symptoms of anxiety, depression, conduct problems, and peer problems. Security in the family system was examined as a mediator of these relations. Participants included 295 mother-father-adolescent families (149 girls) participating across three annual time points (grades 7-9). Including auto-regressive controls for initial levels of emotional insecurity and multiple adjustment problems (T1), higher-order emotional insecurity about the family system (T2) mediated relations between T1 family conflict and T3 peer problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Further analyses supported specific patterns of emotional security/insecurity (i.e., security, disengagement, preoccupation) as mediators between family conflict and specific domains of adolescent adjustment. Family conflict was thus found to prospectively predict the development of symptoms of multiple specific adjustment problems, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct problems, and peer problems, by elevating in in adolescent's emotional insecurity about the family system. The clinical implications of these findings are considered.

AB It has been theorized that perfectionistic parents will engage in behaviors characterized by overcontrol, which then increase child anxiety. Previous research has yet to test this theory within a single study. The current study investigated the proposed theory in a single model, examining the mediational roles of parent perfectionism and overcontrol in the association between parent and child anxiety. Participants were 77 parent-child dyads, with 46 parents and 40 children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Children were between 3 and 12 years old (57.1 % female, 76.6 % Caucasian, 22.1 % African American). Path analysis indicated that the overall model fit the data well. Analyses showed that parental overcontrol mediated the relation between parental perfectionism and child anxiety and parental perfectionism mediated the relation between parental anxiety and parental overcontrol. Further, parental perfectionism and overcontrol sequentially mediated the parent to child anxiety relation. However, when parental perfectionism was accounted for in the model, parental overcontrol did not mediate the relation between parent and child anxiety. The findings suggest that parent perfectionism and overcontrol, together, may represent a specific pathway of risk for the development of anxiety disorders in children. The implications of these findings are reviewed in the context of previous theory on parental perfectionism, overcontrol, and the development of child anxiety. The clinical importance of the findings and future directions are also discussed.

AB Problems associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) occur frequently in the general population and often co-occur with problems in other domains of psychopathology. In the research presented here these co-occurrence patterns were investigated by integrating a dimensional approach to ASDs into the more general dimensional framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Factor Analysis was used to develop hierarchical and bi-factor models covering multiple domains of psychopathology in three measurement waves of a longitudinal general population sample (N = 2,230, ages 10-17, 50.8 % female). In all adequately fitting models, autism related problems were part of a specific domain of psychopathology that could be distinguished from the internalizing and externalizing domains. Optimal model fit was found for a bi-factor model with one non-specific factor and four specific factors related to internalizing, externalizing, autism spectrum problems and problems related to attention and orientation. Autism-related problems constitute a specific domain of psychopathology that can be distinguished from the internalizing and externalizing domains. In addition, the co-occurrence patterns in the data indicate the presence of a strong general factor.

AB Despite the significant research that has been conducted regarding effortful control and children's adjustment, there is limited evidence of the potential for hot/cool dimensionality related to social competence in preschool-aged children. Seventy-four children (30 males and 44 females; mean age = 35, 24 months) and 22 female teachers participated in the research. Children were assessed using a battery of tasks to measure hot and cool inhibitory control tasks, and they were evaluated by their teachers for socio-emotional functioning. Results show that high performance on Hot Tasks (not on Cool Tasks) predicts social competence, while low performance on these tasks predicts aggressive behavior, demonstrating that hot and cool inhibitory control processes predict different outcomes. The implications of these findings for future theoretical and empirical development of the research in this field are discussed.

AB Based on Self-Determination Theory, our study examined the associations of maternal perspective taking (PT), clear expectations (CE), and their interaction during mother-male adolescent conflict with sons' externalizing and internalizing problems. Fifty-one mothers and their 16.5 year old sons were observed while conducting a revealed differences task. Maternal PT and CE during the interaction were assessed using new scales derived from the individuality and connectedness Q-sort. Sons' externalizing and internalizing problems were measured using the Youth Self Report. We found that higher maternal PT was associated with fewer externalizing problems of sons only when mothers also showed high levels of CE. Thus, in situations involving parent-adolescent conflict, parents' sensitivity to adolescent opposing perspective coupled with clear statements regarding the expected adolescent behavior may relate to better socio-emotional functioning of male adolescents.

AB Childhood physical abuse predicts emotional/behavioral, self-regulatory, and social problems. Yet factors from multiple ecological levels contribute to children's adjustment. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree to which the social-emotional adjustment of physically abused children in first grade would be predicted by a set of child-, parent-, and family-level predictors in kindergarten. Drawing on a short-term longitudinal study of 92 physically abused children and their primary caregivers, the current study used linear regression to examine early childhood child (i.e., gender, IQ, child perceptions of maternal acceptance), parent (i.e., parental mental health), and family relationship (i.e., sensitive parenting, hostile parenting, family conflict) factors as predictors of first grade internalizing and externalizing symptomatology, emotion dysregulation, and negative peer interactions. We used a multi-method, multi-informant approach to measuring predictors and children's adjustment. Internalizing symptomatology was significantly predicted by child IQ, parental mental health, and family conflict. Externalizing symptomatology and emotion dysregulation were predicted by child IQ. Although a large proportion of variance in measures of adjustment was accounted for by the set of predictors, few individual variables were unique predictors of child adjustment. Variability in the predictors of adjustment for physically abused children underscores the need for individualized treatment approaches.

AB Turkish immigrants represent the largest ethnic minority in Germany however information about the factors associated with their children's mental health is scarce. This study examined family and individual factors associated with the strengths and difficulties of Turkish immigrant children and adolescents in comparison with their German peers. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQs) were rated by participants' mothers (N = 480) and teachers (n = 164). Compared with German mothers (n = 121), Turkish immigrant mothers (n = 359) rated their children's total difficulties, their emotional symptoms and peer problems as well as their prosocial behavior as significantly higher. In contrast, there were no differences in the participating teachers' ratings of Turkish immigrant compared with German children's strengths and difficulties. Regression analyses revealed that child gender and family adversity were cross-culturally associated with SDQ scores whereas inconsistent parenting only affected German children's externalizing behavior problems. Factors associated with Turkish immigrant and German children's mental health problems are thus both cross-culturally comparable and culturally specific. More information is needed in order to identify individuals at highest risk to develop certain types of behavior problems and provide specific prevention strategies.

AB Previous studies have showed that traditional parenting dimensions (e.g., responsiveness, behavioral control, psychological control, and autonomy support) are related to adolescents' internalizing problems. The current study examined mindful parenting, a new approach to parenting based on the principles of mindfulness. Mindful parenting as operationalized in the present study consisted of six dimensions: listening with full attention, compassion for the child, non-judgmental acceptance of parental functioning, emotional non-reactivity in parenting, emotional awareness of the child, and emotional awareness of self. These six mindful parenting dimensions were assumed to be associated with adolescents' symptoms of depression and anxiety while controlling for traditional parenting dimensions and parental symptoms of depression and anxiety. The sample consisted of 901 adolescents (46.8 % girls, M (age) = 13.4 years) and their parents (94.2 % biological mothers, M (age) = 45.2 years). Results showed that of the six mindful parenting dimensions, only the dimension non-judgmental acceptance of parental functioning was significantly associated with adolescents' internalizing problems. This means that children of parents who reported higher levels of non-judgmental acceptance of their own functioning as a parent reported fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. These findings indicate that in future parenting research and practices, it is relevant to take parental thoughts, feelings, and attitudes with regard to their own role as a parent into account when studying the association between parenting and adolescents' internalizing problems.

AB Children's exposure to potentially traumatic events is related to negative mental health outcomes. To promote more positive outcomes, protective factors that can buffer the impact of these experiences need to be identified. The present study examined whether lower parental stress might function as a protective factor for children enrolled in a behavioral health system of care. Specifically, the relationship between a history of interpersonal trauma (physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing domestic violence) and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors were examined, as was the role of parenting stress in helping to explain this relationship. The sample included African American and Latino children (ages 5-19) from low-income families, who have a serious emotional disturbance, and received services in a school-based system of care. Results of path analyses revealed that parenting stress mediated the relationship between trauma exposure and internalizing problem behaviors. For the relationship between trauma exposure and externalizing problem behaviors, mediation approached significance. The findings suggest that family factors, such as parenting stress, could be potential modifiable protective factors for these children. Systems of care can use this information to encourage the implementation of more family-focused treatments and interventions.

AB We examined child temperament, maternal parenting, and the effects of their interactions with each other on child social functioning. A total of 355 children aged 5-18 years old (54 % male; mean age = 10.8) were evaluated. Regression equations were used to test models of the main and interactive effects of temperament and maternal parenting behavior on the Social Problems and Social Competence Subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a questionnaire assessing internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in children ages 4-18. Higher levels of child Novelty Seeking and Harm Avoidance and lower levels of Persistence were significantly associated with poorer social functioning. When accounting for child temperament, neither maternal parenting nor the interaction between maternal parenting and child temperament were significantly associated with social functioning. However, the interaction between maternal positive involvement and harm avoidance trended toward significance, such that at higher levels of harm avoidance, more extreme levels of maternal positive involvement were related to lower levels of social functioning. Further research on the interplay between child temperament and parenting across different stages of development is warranted.

AB This study prospectively examined pubertal timing and peer victimization as interactive predictors of depressive symptoms in a racially diverse community sample of adolescents. We also expanded on past research by assessing body esteem as a mechanism by which pubertal timing and peer victimization confer risk for depression. In all, 218 adolescents (53.4% female, 49.3% African American, 50.7% Caucasian) completed both a baseline assessment and a follow-up assessment approximately 8 months later. Early maturing Caucasian girls and late maturing African American girls experienced the greatest increases in depressive symptoms at follow-up if they experienced higher levels of peer victimization between baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, body esteem significantly mediated the relationship between pubertal timing, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms for girls of both races. The interaction of pubertal timing and peer victimization did not predict depressive symptoms for boys of either race. These results support body esteem as a mechanism that contributes to increased depression among girls in adolescencedespite a differential impact of pubertal timing for Caucasian and African American girls.

AB High prevalence rates of depression and anxiety among adolescents underscore the importance of identifying parental and adolescent behaviors that may lessen the risk for these outcomes. Previous research has shown that parental acceptance, parental knowledge, and child disclosure are negatively associated with internalizing behaviors. It is also important to explore the impact of internalizing behaviors on these parental and child constructs. The current study examined longitudinal relationships between parental acceptance, parental knowledge, child disclosure, and internalizing symptoms across a one-year time period. Participants were 358 adolescents (54 % female) and their primary caregivers, who were primarily African American (92 %). Parents and adolescents provided data through face-to-face interviews. Results showed that parental knowledge and parental acceptance predicted child disclosure, and child disclosure predicted parental knowledge one year later. Higher levels of parental acceptance predicted lower levels of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms, while higher levels of parental report of adolescents' internalizing symptoms predicted lower levels of parental knowledge. No differences in the strength of these relationships were found across grade or gender. These findings highlight the role of the adolescent's perceived acceptance by parents in promoting children's disclosure, and the benefits of parental acceptance in decreasing depressive symptoms over time. Overall, these results show the impact that both adolescent and parental behaviors and internalizing behaviors have on each other across time.

AB According to many public health experts, obesity is the most serious health threat facing today's early adolescents. This study examined the relationship between psychosocial adjustment (i.e., internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, interpersonal skills) and weight status change during early adolescence and possible moderating roles of gender, ethnicity, and acculturation. Data came from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a US nationally representative sample of children who entered kindergarten during 1998-1999 and were followed through eighth grade. The current study was initiated in the fifth grade (n = 6,860; 51 % female). At fifth grade, parents reported on household routines; children and teachers reported on indicators of psychosocial adjustment. At fifth and eighth grade, children's weight was measured. Girls' weight status stability and change was more likely than boys' to be associated with psychosocial adjustment, after accounting for household/child routines and demographic variables. Compared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic girls who exhibited higher levels of externalizing behaviors at fifth grade were more likely to become or stay obese at eighth grade. Hispanic girls who exhibited higher levels of internalizing behaviors at fifth grade were more likely to become or stay at a healthy weight at eighth grade, especially if they reported lower levels of acculturation. Lastly, African American girls with better interpersonal skills at fifth grade were more likely to stay obese at eighth grade. Implications for obesity prevention programs with early adolescents are discussed in the contexts of gender, ethnicity and acculturation.

AB Adolescents who like each other may become more similar to each other with regard to internalizing and externalizing problems, though it is not yet clear which social mechanisms explain these similarities. In this longitudinal study, we analyzed four mechanisms that may explain similarity in adolescent peer networks with regard to externalizing and internalizing problems: selection, socialization, avoidance and withdrawal. At three moments during one school-year, we asked 542 adolescents (8th grade, M-age = 13.3 years, 51 % female) to report who they liked in their classroom, and their own internalizing and externalizing problems. Adolescents tend to prefer peers who have similar externalizing problem scores, but no significant selection effect was found for internalizing problems. Adolescents who share the same group of friends socialize each other and then become more similar with respect to externalizing problems, but not with respect to internalizing problems. We found no significant effects for avoidance or withdrawal. Adolescents may choose to belong to a peer group that is similar to them in terms of externalizing problem behaviors, and through peer group socialization (e.g., enticing, modelling, mimicking, and peer pressure) become more similar to that group over time.

AB Background: Mental health problems of children are commonly treated by psychotherapy and other psychosocial treatments. Studies comparing different treatments in naturalistic clinical settings are few, however. Aims: We assessed the differences: 1) in symptoms and diagnoses; 2) in treatment outcome between psychotherapy and other psychosocial treatments; and 3) evaluated the effect of family background and life circumstances on the outcome. Methods: The data were collected from the psychiatric hospital records of Oulu University Hospital, Finland. All 118 children (aged < 16 years) referred to psychotherapy from the Department of Child Psychiatry in 1996-2005 and 118 age- and sex-matched children undergoing other psychosocial treatments were included. A lack of later recorded psychiatric problems was used as an indicator of good treatment outcome. Results: On referral, functional ability was severely impaired in almost half of the children (Children's Global Assessment Scale score < 55). Internalizing symptoms were more common in the psychotherapy group, while no difference was found in externalizing symptoms between the groups. In both groups, later psychiatric problems were associated with a child's low functional ability and poor parental coping with their responsibilities. Children with internalizing problems had impaired prognosis if they had psychosocial treatments other than psychotherapy. Conclusions: Individual psychotherapy should especially be considered for children with internalizing symptoms, but the outcome of psychiatric treatment depends not only on children's own functional abilities, but also on parental abilities.

AB The psychological effects of community violence exposure among inner-city youth are severe, yet little is known about its prevalence and moderators among suburban middle-class youth. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of community violence exposure among suburban American youth, to examine associated posttraumatic stress and to evaluate factors related to severe vs. less severe posttraumatic stress, such as co-existing internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as the effects of teacher support, parental warmth and support, perceived neighborhood safety and conventional involvement in this context.
   Data were collected from 780 suburban, predominantly Caucasian middle-class high-school adolescents in the Northeastern US during the Social and Health Assessment (SAHA) study.
   A substantial number of suburban youth were exposed to community violence and 24 % of those victimized by community violence developed severe posttraumatic stress. Depressive symptoms were strongly associated with higher levels and perceived teacher support with lower levels of posttraumatic stress.
   Similar to urban youth, youth living in suburban areas in North American settings may be affected by community violence. A substantial proportion of these youth reports severe posttraumatic stress and high levels of comorbid depressive symptoms. Teacher support may have a protective effect against severe posttraumatic stress and thus needs to be further assessed as a potential factor that can be used to mitigate the detrimental effects of violence exposure.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine mother and adolescent reports of relationship quality over time and to test whether mother-adolescent relationship quality intervened with the known association between maternal depressive symptoms and higher levels of adolescent externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors using actor-partner interdependence modeling. Data were from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect and included a sample of 278 mother-adolescent dyads at risk for child maltreatment. Results revealed that mothers and adolescents reported high-quality relationships at ages 12 and 14. Mother and adolescent reports of relationship quality were also interdependent such that one's perception of relationship quality significantly influenced the other's report of relationship quality. Importantly, mother-adolescent relationship quality significantly intervened in the association between maternal depressive symptoms and adolescent externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. These findings have implications for family interventions with mothers and adolescents to strengthen relationship quality.

AB Several studies have established that child interparental conflict evaluations link parent relationship functioning and adolescent adjustment. Using differential susceptibility theory and its vantage sensitivity complement as their framework, the authors examined differences between adolescents who vary in the DRD4 7 repeat genotype (i.e., 7+ vs. 7-) in how both interparental conflict and positivity affect adolescents' evaluations of interparental conflict (i.e., threat appraisals) and how these evaluations affect internalizing problems. Results from longitudinal multiple-group path models using PROSPER data (N = 452) supported the hypothesis that threat appraisals for 7+ adolescents would be more affected by perceptions of interparental positivity compared to 7- adolescents; however, threat appraisals for 7+ adolescents were also less affected by interparental conflict. Among 7- adolescents, interparental conflict perceptions were associated with higher threat appraisals, and no association was found for perceptions of positivity. For adolescents of both genotypes, higher threat was associated with greater internalizing problems.

AB Research indicates that educational, economic, and life success reflect children's nonacademic as well as academic competencies. Therefore, longitudinal surveys that assess educational progress and success need to incorporate nonacademic measures to avoid omitted variable bias, inform development of new intervention strategies, and support mediating and moderating analyses. Based on a life course model and a whole child perspective, this article suggests constructs in the domains of child health, emotional/psychological development, educational achievement/attainment, social behavior, and social relationships. Four critical constructs are highlighted: self-regulation, agency/motivation, persistence/diligence, and executive functioning. Other constructs that are currently measured need to be retained, including social skills, positive relationships, activities, positive behaviors, academic self-efficacy, educational engagement, and internalizing/emotional well-being. Examples of measures that are substantively and psychometrically robust are provided.

AB This study aimed to investigate the relations of adolescent sexual experiences (particularly early initiation) to a spectrum of emotional/behavioral problems and to probe possible gender difference in such relationships. The 10th (N = 8,842) and 12th (N = 10,083) grade students, aged 16-19 years, participating in national surveys in 2005 and 2006 in Taiwan were included for this study. A self-administered web-based questionnaire was designed to collect information on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual experience, substance use, and the Youth Self-Report Form. For the sexually experienced adolescents, their sexual initiation was classified as early initiation (< 16 years) or non-early initiation (16-19 years). Gender-specific multivariate response profile regression was used to examine the relationship between sexual experience and the behavioral syndromes. Externalizing problems, including Rule-breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior, were strongly associated with sexual initiation in adolescence; the magnitude of the association increased for earlier sexual initiation, especially for females. As to internalizing problems, the connection was rather heterogeneous. The scores on some syndromes, such as Somatic Complaints and Anxious/Depressed, were higher only for females with early or non-early sexual initiation whereas the score on Withdrawn, along with Social Problems that is neither internalizing nor externalizing, was lower for the sexually experienced adolescents than for the sexually inexperienced ones. We concluded that earlier sexual initiation was associated with a wider range of behavioral problems in adolescents for both genders, yet the increased risk with emotional problems was predominately found in females.

AB Large numbers of children over the world experience foster care each year. How best to satisfy their developmental needs and how to avoid placement breakdowns and negative consequences of foster care are important challenges. In this study, a series of four meta-analyses is performed to examine the longitudinal developmental outcomes of children in foster care. The focus is on adaptive functioning and behavioral outcomes. A literature search identified 11 studies suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis on adaptive functioning (N=1,550), 24 studies for the meta-analysis on internalizing problems (N=1,984), 21 studies for the meta-analysis on externalizing problems (N=1,729) and 25 studies for the meta-analysis on total behavior problems (N=2,523). No overall improvement or deterioration was found for adaptive functioning. However, studies with a timespan longer than one year and studies with larger sample sizes showed development toward more negative adaptive functioning than studies with shorter timespans or smaller samples. No overall increases or decreases in internalizing, externalizing or total behavior problems were found. Based on these results, it is concluded that foster care does not negatively or positively affect foster children's developmental trajectories. Given that many children enter foster care with problems, this is a worrying situation. Further longitudinal research to find the factors necessary for improving foster children's developmental chances is recommended. Furthermore, routine screening and targeted foster-care interventions are adviseable to ensure that all children, who cannot be raised by their own parents, receive the support conducive to their positive development.

AB Background: Neonates cared for in neonatal intensive care units are exposed to many painful and stressful procedures that, cumulatively, could impact later neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, a systematic analysis of these effects is yet to be reported.
   Objectives: The aim of this research was to review empirical studies examining the association between early neonatal pain experiences of preterm infants and the subsequent developmental outcomes of these children across different ages.
   Methods: The literature search was performed using the PubMed, PsycINFO, Lilacs, and SciELO databases and included the following key words: "pain," "preterm," and "development." In addition, a complementary search was performed in online journals that published pain and developmental studies to ensure all of the target studies had been found. The data were extracted according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results: Thirteen studies were analyzed. In infants born extremely preterm (gestational age <= 29 wk) greater numbers of painful procedures were associated with delayed postnatal growth, with poor early neurodevelopment, high cortical activation, and with altered brain development. In toddlers born very preterm (gestational age <= 32 wk) biobehavioral pain reactivity-recovery scores were associated with negative affectivity temperament. Furthermore, greater numbers of neonatal painful experiences were associated with a poor quality of cognitive and motor development at 1 year of age and changes in cortical rhythmicity and cortical thickness in children at 7 years of age.
   Conclusions: For infants born preterm, neonatal pain-related stress was associated with alterations in both early and in later developmental outcomes. Few longitudinal studies examined the impact of neonatal pain in the long-term development of children born preterm.

AB Childhood epilepsy is common in Africa. However, there are little data on the developmental and behavioral problems experienced by children living with epilepsy, especially qualitative data that capture community perceptions of the challenges faced by these children. Identifying these perceptions using qualitative approaches is important not only to help design appropriate interventions but also to help adapt behavioral tools that are culturally appropriate. We documented the description of these problems as perceived by parents and teachers of children with or without epilepsy. The study involved 70 participants. Data were collected using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions and were analyzed using NVIVO to identify major themes. Our analysis identified four major areas that are perceived to be adversely affected among children with epilepsy. These included internalizing and externalizing problems such as aggression, temper tantrums, and excessive crying. Additionally, developmental delay, especially cognitive deficits and academic underachievement, was also identified as a major problematic area. There is a need to supplement these findings with quantitative estimates and to develop psychosocial and educational interventions to rehabilitate children with epilepsy who have these difficulties.

AB Purpose: We sought to determine the extent to which initial levels and over-time trajectories of cultural stressors (discrimination, negative context of reception, and bicultural stress) predicted well-being, internalizing symptoms, conduct problems, and health risk behaviors among recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents. Addressing this research objective involved creating a latent factor for cultural stressors, establishing invariance for this factor over time, estimating a growth curve for this factor over time, and examining the effects of initial levels (intercepts) and trajectories (slopes) of cultural stressors on adolescent outcomes.
   Methods: A sample of 302 recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents in Miami (median of 1 year in the United States at baseline) and Los Angeles (median of 3 years in the United States at baseline) was recruited from public schools and assessed six times over a 3-year period.
   Results: Perceived discrimination, context of reception, and bicultural stress loaded onto a latent factor at each of the first five timepoints. A growth curve conducted on this factor over the first five timepoints significantly predicted lower self-esteemand optimism, more depressive symptoms, greater aggressive behavior and rule breaking, and increased likelihood of drunkenness and marijuana use.
   Conclusions: The present results may be important in designing interventions for Hispanic immigrant children and adolescents, including those within the present wave of unaccompanied child migrants. Results indicate targeting cultural stressors in interventions may have potential to improve well-being and decrease externalizing behaviors and substance use within this population.

AB Background: There is a burgeoning and varied literature examining the associations between parental factors and depression or anxiety disorders in children. However, there is hitherto no systematic review of this complex literature with a focus on the 5-11 years age range, when there is a steep increase in onset of these disorders. Furthermore, to facilitate the application of the evidence in prevention, a focus on modifiable factors is required.
   Methods: Employing the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of parental factors associated with anxiety, depression, and internalizing problems in children which parents can potentially modify.
   Results: We identified 141 articles altogether, with 53 examining anxiety, 50 examining depression, and 70 examining internalizing outcomes. Stouffer's method of combining p-values was used to determine whether associations between variables were reliable, and meta-analyses were conducted with a subset of eligible studies to estimate the mean effect sizes of associations between each parental factor and outcome. Limitations: Limitations include sacrificing micro-level detail for a macro-level synthesis of the literature, the lack of generalizability across cultures, and the inability to conduct a meta-analysis on all included studies.
   Conclusions: Parental factors with a sound evidence base indicating increased risk for both depression and internalizing problems include more inter-parental conflict and aversiveness; and for internalizing outcomes additionally, they include less warmth and more abusive parenting and over-involvement. No sound evidence linking any parental factor with anxiety outcomes was found. (C) 2015 Elsevier By, All rights reserved.

AB The aim was to investigate predictors of treatment dropout among 182 children (aged 8-15 years) participating in an effectiveness trial of manual-based 10-session individual and group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in community clinics. The dropout rate was 14.4%, with no significant difference between the two treatment conditions. We examined predictors for overall dropout (n=26), early (<= session 4, n = 15), and late dropout (>= session 5, n = 11). Overall dropout was predicted bylaw child and parent rated treatment credibility, and high parent self-rated internalizing symptoms. Low child rated treatment credibility predicted both early and late dropout. High parent self-rated internalizing symptoms predicted early dropout, whereas low parent rated treatment credibility predicted late dropout. These results highlight the importance of addressing treatment credibility, and to offer support for parents with internalizing symptoms, to help children and families remain in treatment.

AB Mothers and fathers often adopt different approaches to raising their children, and the influence of different parenting styles on the development of behavioral problems may be different for boys and girls. Using data from 89 subjects, 42 boys and 47 girls, with a mean age of 62.8 months (SD = 3.3), the current study tested the influence of early negative maternal and paternal parenting styles on the development of boys' and girls' aggressive and behavioral problems. Parents, when children aged 5-6, completed the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, and when children aged 8-9, the child behavior checklist. Children were evaluated for aggressive behavior with peers using the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scale at age 8-9. Our results show that an authoritarian maternal style is positively associated with both children's externalizing and internalizing problems while the combination of an authoritarian maternal style and a permissive paternal style was negatively associated with internalizing problems, but only in boys, and this type of family was positively associated with both types of aggressive behavior in girls and boys. Besides, the combination of a permissive maternal style and a permissive paternal style was positively related to girls' (but not boys') physical aggression.

AB Abundant research has shown that parental psychological control is related to internalizing problems across different life periods, including middle childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Relatively few studies, however, have addressed the mediating mechanisms that account for this relation. On the basis of self-determination theory, the aim of this study was to examine the mediating role of adolescents' need satisfaction in the association between perceived paternal and maternal psychological control and internalizing distress in Italian emerging adults. In a sample of 121 female college students, we found that satisfaction of basic psychological needs was a full mediator of the relationship between perceptions of psychological control and internalizing distress. We also found that psychological control was a better predictor of internalizing distress compared to low autonomy-support. These findings are discussed in light of self-determination theory. We also discuss how future research may further increase our understanding of the dynamics involved in psychologically controlling parenting and adjustment in adolescents and emerging adults.

TI Criterion validity of the general factor of psychopathology in a

AB BackgroundThe best-fitting model of the structure of common psychopathology often includes a general factor on which all dimensions of psychopathology load. Such a general factor would be important if it reflects etiologies and mechanisms shared by all dimensions of psychopathology. Nonetheless, a viable alternative explanation is that the general factor is partly or wholly a result of common method variance or other systematic measurement biases.
   MethodsTo test this alternative explanation, we extracted general, externalizing, and internalizing factor scores using mother-reported symptoms across 5-11years of age in confirmatory factor analyses of data from a representative longitudinal study of 2,450 girls. Independent associations between the three psychopathology factor scores and teacher-reported criterion variables were estimated in multiple regression, controlling intelligence, and demographic covariates.
   ResultsThe model including the general factor fit significantly better than a correlated two-factor (internalizing/externalizing) model. The general factor was robustly and independently associated with all measures of teacher-reported school functioning concurrently during childhood and prospectively during adolescence.
   ConclusionsThese findings weaken the hypothesis that the general factor of psychopathology in childhood is solely a measurement artifact and support further research on the substantive meaning of the general factor.

AB In the present study, we examined whether maternal psychosocial stress and children's coherence in story-stem narratives are associated with preschool children's internalizing symptoms and disorders, and whether narrative coherence moderates the association between maternal stress and children's internalizing symptoms and disorders. The sample consists of 236 preschool children (129 girls, 107 boys; M-age = 5.15 years) and their mothers. Mothers completed questionnaires on their psychosocial stress burden and on child symptoms. A diagnostic interview (the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment; Egger & Angold, 2004) was conducted with one of the parents to assess children's psychiatric diagnoses. Children completed 8 story stems of the MacArthur Story Stem Battery (Bretherton & Oppenheim, 2003). Story-stem narratives were coded for narrative coherence. Multivariate analyses were controlled for children's age, gender, verbal performance, and externalizing symptoms. Results showed that maternal psychosocial stress was significantly associated with child internalizing symptoms and disorders. Neither maternal stress nor children's internalizing symptoms or disorders were associated with narrative coherence. However, narrative coherence moderated the association between maternal stress and child internalizing symptoms. For children with more incoherent narratives, the association between maternal psychosocial stress and children's internalizing symptoms was significantly stronger than for children with more coherent narratives. The moderation effect of narrative coherence concerning children's internalizing disorders was found not to be significant. Our findings indicate that preschool children's cognitive-emotional organization in dealing with relational conflict themes seems to buffer their mental health when exposed to adverse circumstances in their everyday family life.

AB Better understanding risk factors for the development of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems can help with intervention and prevention efforts. Previous studies have found that an early menarcheal age predicts several adolescent problems, including depressive symptoms, delinquency, and early age at first intercourse. Few studies, nevertheless, have explicitly tested (a) whether the associations with menarcheal age vary across racial/ethnic groups or (b) whether the sources of the associations are within-families (i.e., consistent with a direct, causal link) or only between-families (i.e., due to selection or confounding factors). The current study analyzed data from a nationally representative US Sample of females (N = 5,637). We examined whether race/ethnicity moderated the associations between early menarche and several adolescent problems by using multiple-group analyses and we examined the degree to which genetic and environmental factors shared by family members account for the associations by comparing sisters and cousins with differing menarcheal ages. Menarcheal age predicted subsequent depressive symptoms, delinquency, and early age at first intercourse in the population. The magnitudes of the associations were similar across all racial/ethnic groups for all outcomes. The within-family associations (i.e., when comparing siblings and cousins with different menarcheal age) were large and statistically significant when predicting early intercourse, but not the other outcomes. The findings suggest that selection or confounding factors account for the associations between menarcheal age and subsequent depressive symptoms and delinquency, whereas the independent association between menarcheal age and early age at first intercourse is consistent with a direct, causal effect.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests a role for stress exposure, particularly during early life, and for variation in genes involved in stress response pathways in neural responsivity to emotional stimuli. Understanding how individual differences in these factors predict differences in emotional responsivity may be important for understanding both normative emotional development and for understanding the mechanisms underlying internalizing disorders, like anxiety and depression, that have often been related to increased amygdala and hippocampus responses to negatively valenced emotional stimuli. The present study examined whether stress exposure and genetic profile scores (10 single nucleotide polymorphisms within four hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis genes: CRHR1, NR3C2, NR3C1, and FKBP5) predict individual differences in amygdala and hippocampus responses to fearful vs. neutral faces in school-age children (7-12 year olds; N = 107). Experience of more stressful and traumatic life events predicted greater left amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli. Genetic profile scores interacted with sex and pubertal status to predict amygdala and hippocampus responses. Specifically, genetic profile scores were a stronger predictor of amygdala and hippocampus responses among pubertal vs. prepubertal children where they positively predicted responses to fearful faces among pubertal girls and positively predicted responses to neutral faces among pubertal boys. The current results suggest that genetic and environmental stress-related factors may be important in normative individual differences in responsivity to negative emotional stimuli, a potential mechanism underlying internalizing disorders. Further, sex and pubertal development may be key moderators of the effects of stress-system genetic variation on amygdala and hippocampus responsivity, potentially relating to sex differences in stress-related psychopathology.

AB Self-compassion is an attitude toward oneself that involves perceiving one's experiences as an opportunity for self-awareness and improvement, as well as limited self-judgment after failure. Self-compassion has not been extensively studied in adolescence, a time when self-perception and self-appraisals regarding success and failure take on notable importance. This study considered the connection between self-compassion, narcissism, self-esteem, aggression, and internalizing problems in a sample of 251 male adolescents, ages 16-18, attending a residential program. Self-compassion was negatively correlated with aggression and vulnerable narcissism and positively correlated with self-esteem. In general, self-compassion did not exhibit the hypothesized protective effect on the relation between narcissism and aggression. Findings indicate that, as expected, self-compassion is indicative of a relatively secure, positive sense of self in adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   Child maltreatment is a great public health concern that has long-term mental and physical health consequences and can result in death. We studied the effect of a nurse home visiting program on child maltreatment among young disadvantaged families in the Netherlands. This study is the first to investigate the effects of this program outside of the United States.
   Methods
   We conducted a single blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial that compared usual care with the nurse home visitation program, which began during pregnancy and continued until the children's second birthdays, in 460 disadvantaged women who were pregnant for the first time and <26 years of age. The primary outcome was the existence of a report about the child from a child protecting services agency (CPS reports). Secondary outcome measures included home environment and child behavior.
   Results
   Two hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to the control group, and 237 were assigned to the intervention group. Three years after birth, 19% of the children in the control group had a CPS report. The 11 percent of children in the intervention group with CPS files was significantly lower (relative risk 0.91, p-value 0.04). At 24 months, the intervention group scored significantly better on the IT-HOME. At 24 months after birth, the children in the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in internalizing behavior (relative risk 0.56, p-value 0.04) but no evidence of a difference from the control group in externalizing behavior (relative risk 0.71, p-value 0.12).
   Conclusion
   The number of CPS reports for the intervention group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Additionally, the long-term home environments were improved and internalizing behaviors of the children were lower in the intervention group.

AB Objective. The aim of this study is to compare suicidality, internalizing problems and externalizing problems among adolescent victims, bullies and bully-victims.
   Method. This study examined bullying involvement among a subset of the baseline sample of the Climate and Preventure study, a trial of a comprehensive substance use prevention intervention for adolescents in 2012. The sample included 1588 Year 7-9 students in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia.
   Results. Victims, bullies and bully-victims had more problems than uninvolved students. Students with internalizing problems were more likely to be a victim than a bully. Some externalizing problems (alcohol and tobacco use) were associated with increased odds of being a bully, but not others (cannabis use and conduct/hyperactivity symptoms). Suicidal ideation, internalizing problems and some externalizing problems increased the odds of being a bully-victim compared to being a bully or a victim.
   Conclusion. Early intervention for adolescents frequently involved in bullying may reduce the onset of substance use and other mental disorders. It would be advisable for bullying interventions to include a focus on substance use and mental health problems. A reduction in these chronic and detrimental problems among adolescents could potentially lead to a concomitant reduction in bullying involvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundFor a multi-center randomized trial investigating the effects of a 12-week physical and psychosocial intervention program for children with cancer, we invited 174 patients (8-18years old) on treatment or within 1year after treatment; about 40% participated. Reasons for non-participation were investigated.
   MethodsEligible patients received written and verbal information about the study. Those declining to participate were asked to complete questionnaires concerning: reasons for non-participation, daily physical activity, health-related quality of life (HrQoL), and behavioral problems. Participants completed the same questionnaires at baseline (excluding reasons for non-participation').
   ResultsOf 174 eligible patients, 106 did not participate; of these, 61 (57.5%) completed the one-time survey. The main reasons for non-participation as reported by the parents were too time consuming' and participation is too demanding for my child', while children most frequently reported too time consuming' and already frequently engaged in sports'. No differences between participants and non-participants were found for age, HrQoL, parental-reported behavior problems, sport participation, school type, BMI, and perceived health. A greater distance from home to hospital resulted in reduced participation (: -0.02; p=0.01). Non-participants rated their fitness level higher (p=0.03). Participating children (11-18years old) reported more behavioral problems (p=0.02), in particular internalizing problems (p=0.06).
   ConclusionsParticipation of childhood cancer patients in an intensive physical and psychosocial intervention program seems related to the burden of the intervention and the travel distance from home to hospital. In general, non-participants rated their fitness level higher compared with participants. Patients with more (internalizing) behavioral problems seem more likely to participate in the study.

AB Background. The aetiological pathways to borderline personality disorder (BPD) remain only partly elucidated. Retrospective research indicates that prenatal adversity may be an important early risk factor in the development of BPD. This requires corroboration with prospective longitudinal studies.
   Method. A community sample of 6050 mothers and their children (born between April 1991 and December 1992) were assessed. Maternal anxiety and depression and maternal alcohol and tobacco consumption were assessed during pregnancy (18 and 32 weeks gestation). Postnatal risks, including maladaptive parenting (suboptimal parenting and parent conflict), family adversity, maternal anxiety and depression and maternal alcohol and tobacco consumption, were assessed during early childhood. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed in late childhood. Trained psychologists interviewed children in late childhood to ascertain the presence of BPD (at least five probable/definite symptoms).
   Results. In unadjusted analyses, all prenatal risk factors (i.e. maternal alcohol and tobacco consumption and maternal anxiety and depression) were significantly associated with BPD. Following adjustment for sex, birthweight and postnatal exposure to anxiety and depression respectively, maladaptive parenting, family adversity and child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms, prenatal anxiety at 18 weeks gestation [ odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-2.09] and depression at 18 weeks (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.08-2.32) and 32 weeks (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.14-2.18) gestation remained significantly associated with BPD.
   Conclusions. This study provides prospective evidence of associations between prenatal adversities and BPD at 11-12 years. Prenatal anxiety and depression were independently associated with BPD, suggesting that they may exert direct effects on BPD during the prenatal period. This highlights the importance of programmes to reduce maternal stress during pregnancy.

TI Behavioral and emotional effects of repeated general anesthesia in young

SO SAUDI JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Behavior; child; emotional disturbances; repeated anesthetics
AB Background: Preclinical and clinical data suggest the possibility of neurotoxicity following exposure of young children to general anesthetics with subsequent behavioral disturbances. The aim of the study was to determine the overall effect of repeated general anesthesia on behavior and emotions of young children aged 1 1/2 -5 years old, compared to healthy children. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five children underwent repeated anesthesia and surgery were matched with the same number of healthy children who attended vaccination clinic, as a control group. Both groups were administered the child behavior checklist (CBCL) 1 1/2 -5 years and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) oriented scale. Behavior data were collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: The CBCL score revealed that children with repeated anesthesia were at risk to become anxious or depressed (relative risk [RR]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11 [1.5-80.7]), to have sleep (RR; 95% CI = 4.5 [1.1-19.4]), and attention problems (RR; 95% CI = 8 [1.1-60.6]). There was no difference in the risk between the two groups regarding emotionally reactive, somatic complaints, withdrawn problems, aggressive behavior, internalizing or externalizing problems. On DSM scale, children with repeated anesthesia were at risk to develop anxiety problems (RR; 95% CI = 3.7 [1.1-12.0]), and attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (RR; 95% CI = 3 [1.1-8.4]). There was no difference in the risk between the two groups regarding affective, pervasive developmental and oppositional defiant problems. Conclusion: Young children who undergone repeated surgical procedures under general anesthesia were at risk for subsequent behavioral and emotional disturbances. Proper perioperative pain management, social support, and avoidance of unpleasant surgical experiences could minimize these untoward consequences.

AB This article provides a review of the literature on dating violence (DV) perpetration, specifically sex similarities and differences in the correlates and predictors of DV perpetration and the utility of current theories to explain young men's and women's DV perpetration. Overall, many of the correlates and predictors of DV perpetration are similar among young men and women (e.g., witnessing interparental violence, experiencing child abuse, alcohol abuse, traditional gender roles, relationship power dynamics). However, young women's perpetration of DV is more strongly related to internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression), trait anger and hostility, and experiencing DV victimization than young men's perpetration, whereas young men's perpetration of DV is more consistently related to lower socioeconomic status and educational attainment, antisocial personality characteristics, and increased relationship length than young women's perpetration. Each theory offers insights into but does not fully account for the correlates and predictors of DV perpetration. Sociocultural theories may be useful in explaining the use of coercive control in relationships, and learning/intergenerational transmission of violence theories may be useful in explaining bidirectional couple violence. Future research should focus on integrative theories, such as in the social-ecological theory, in order to explain various forms of DV. Our understanding of young men's and young women's DV perpetration is limited by cross-sectional research designs, methodological inconsistencies, a lack of sex-specific analytic approaches, and a lack of focus on contextual factors; more multivariate and longitudinal studies are needed. Further, as DV prevention programming is often presented in mixed-sex formats, a critical understanding of sex differences and similarities in DV perpetration could ultimately refine and improve effectiveness of programming efforts aimed at reducing DV.

AB Objective: This prospective study aimed to investigate whether prior internalizing disorders (PIDs) moderate the relationship between stress exposure (SE) and the onset of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and nicotine dependence (ND) in deployed military personnel.
   Methods: 358 male soldiers were examined directly before and 12 months after return from deployment using standardized interviews. Combat experiences, concerns about family disruptions, and difficult living and working environment were assessed as different aspects of SE. PID diagnoses (mood disorders (PMDs), anxiety disorders (PADs)) and substance use disorders were defined according to the DSM-IV-TR.
   Results: PMDs were related to a stronger association between concerns about family disruptions and the risk of AUD onset (OR = 7.7,95% Cl 1.8-32.8, p = 0.006). The number of PID diagnoses (OR per diagnosis: 1.7,95% CI 1.0-2.8, p = 0.036) and PADs (OR: 2.6, 95% C11.1-63, p = 0.038) were further related to a stronger association between difficult living and working environment and the risk of AUD onset. With regard to ND, PMDs were related to a weaker association between difficult living and working environment and the risk of ND onset (OR = 0.4,95% Cl 02-0.8, p = 0.013).
   Conclusions: PIDs might be related to an increased risk for the onset of AUDs but not ND following SE. This effect is probably restricted to specific constellations of PADs, PMDs, comorbid PIDs and specific aspects of SE. These critical constellations of PIDs and SE might be a promising target for future research and could contribute to the development of preventive measures to reduce the risk of AUDs following SE.

AB BackgroundDue to the ongoing medical challenges we hypothesized that older adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) would report greater rates of internalizing symptoms and diagnoses. This study is a follow-up to a previous study [1] that found few differences between the emotional well-being of children ages 8-15 with SCD and comparison peers. Our aim is to re-assess internalizing symptoms of youth with SCD and comparison peers at age 18.
   ProcedureAt follow-up, trained staff members administered semi-structured psychiatric interviews and widely use behavioral health questionnaires to adolescents with SCD (n=48), their comparison peers (COMP; n=51) and a caregiver. Mood, internalizing symptoms and diagnoses, were evaluated cross-sectionally at the follow-up (age 18).
   ResultsPsychiatric interview data showed that COMP reported more phobias relative to adolescents with SCD; no significant differences were reported for any other current symptoms (depression, anxiety, or mania). Questionnaire data showed all scores in the normal range with two significant differences: older adolescents with SCD reported more symptoms of tension-anxiety and fatigue-inertia. Both groups reported significant rates of internalizing disorders with 31% of youth with SCD and 35% of COMP having a DSM-IV diagnosis.
   ConclusionsPsychiatric interview data for both groups of older adolescents suggested considerable psychopathology; questionnaire data for both groups were in the normal range. We report few significant differencesmore phobias in comparisons peers; more tension-anxiety and fatigue-inertia reported by youth with SCD. The overall findings suggest considerable resilience for youth with SCD, but both groups of adolescents report significant rates of psychopathology similar to national rates.

AB Background: Despite widespread awareness of the necessity of early intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), evidence is still limited, in part, due to the complex nature of ASDs. This exploratory study aimed to examine the change across time in young children with autism and their mothers, who received less intensive early interventions with and without applied behavior analysis (ABA) methods in community settings in Japan.
   Methods: Eighteen children with autism (mean age: 45.7 months; range: 28-64 months) received ABA-based treatment (a median of 3.5 hours per week; an interquartile range of 2-5.6 hours per week) and/or eclectic treatment-as-usual (TAU) (a median of 3.1 hours per week; an interquartile range of 2-5.6 hours per week). Children's outcomes were the severity of autistic symptoms, cognitive functioning, internalizing and externalizing behavior after 6 months (a median of 192 days; an interquartile range of 178-206 days). In addition, maternal parenting stress at 6-month follow-up, and maternal depression at 1.5-year follow-up (a median of 512 days; an interquartile range of 358-545 days) were also examined.
   Results: Large individual variations were observed for a broad range of children's and mothers' outcomes. Neither ABA nor TAU hours per week were significantly associated with an improvement in core autistic symptoms. A significant improvement was observed only for internalizing problems, irrespective of the type, intensity or monthly cost of treatment received. Higher ABA cost per month (a median of 1,188 USD; an interquartile range of 538-1,888 USD) was associated with less improvement in language-social DQ (a median of 9; an interquartile range of -6.75-23.75).
   Conclusions: To determine an optimal program for each child with ASD in areas with poor ASD resources, further controlled studies are needed that assess a broad range of predictive and outcome variables focusing on both individual characteristics and treatment components.

AB Narcissism levels have been increasing among Western youth, and contribute to societal problems such as aggression and violence. The origins of narcissism, however, are not well understood. Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first prospective longitudinal evidence on the origins of narcissism in children. We compared two perspectives: social learning theory (positing that narcissism is cultivated by parental overvaluation) and psychoanalytic theory (positing that narcissism is cultivated by lack of parental warmth). We timed the study in late childhood (ages 7-12), when individual differences in narcissism first emerge. In four 6-mo waves, 565 children and their parents reported child narcissism, child self-esteem, parental overvaluation, and parental warmth. Four-wave cross-lagged panel models were conducted. Results support social learning theory and contradict psychoanalytic theory: Narcissism was predicted by parental overvaluation, not by lack of parental warmth. Thus, children seem to acquire narcissism, in part, by internalizing parents' inflated views of them (e.g., "I am superior to others" and "I am entitled to privileges"). Attesting to the specificity of this finding, self-esteem was predicted by parental warmth, not by parental overvaluation. These findings uncover early socialization experiences that cultivate narcissism, and may inform interventions to curtail narcissistic development at an early age.

AB Sex hormones have been shown to contribute to the organization and function of the brain during puberty and adolescence. Moreover, it has been suggested that distinct hormone changes in girls versus boys may contribute to the emergence of sex differences in internalizing and externalizing behavior during adolescence. In the current longitudinal study, the influence of within-subject changes in puberty (physical and hormonal) on cortical thickness and surface area was examined across a 2-year span, while controlling for age. Greater increases in Tanner Stage predicted less superior frontal thinning and decreases in precuneus surface area in both sexes. Significant Tanner Stage and sex interactions were also seen, with less right superior temporal thinning in girls but not boys, as well as greater decreases in the right bank of the superior temporal sulcus surface area in boys compared to girls. In addition, within-subject changes in testosterone over the 2-year follow-up period were found to relate to decreases in middle superior frontal surface area in boys, but increases in surface area in girls. Lastly, larger increases in estradiol in girls predicted greater middle temporal lobe thinning. These results show that within-subject physical and hormonal markers of puberty relate to region and sex-specific changes in cortical development across adolescence.

AB Background: Numerous studies have explored how patients and their caregivers cope with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the literature completely lacks research on the psychological impact of the disease on patients' children. The aim of our study was to investigate the emotional and psychological impact of a parent with ALS on school-age children and adolescents in terms of problem behavior, adjustment, and personality characteristics.
   Methods: The study involved 23 children (mean age = 10.62 years, six females) with a parent suffering from ALS, and both their parents. Children were matched for age, gender, and birth-order with a control group of children with healthy parents. They were administered the Youth Self Report (YSR) questionnaire and the Rorschach Comprehensive System, and their healthy parent completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: Findings clearly showed that, compared with controls, children with a parent who had ALS had several clinically significant adverse emotional and behavioral consequences, with emotional and behavioral problems, internalizing problems, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Children of a parent with ALS scored higher than controls for the Total Problems, Internalizing Problems, Anxious/Depressed and Withdrawn/Depressed scales in the YSR. A relevant percentage of children fell within the clinical range (42.9%) and borderline range (28.6%) for Internalizing Problems, The Rorschach CS confirmed the substantial impact of ALS in a parent on their offspring in terms of internalizing behavior and depression, with adjustment difficulties, psychological pain, and thought problems.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that school-aged children and adolescents with a parent who has ALS are vulnerable and carry a substantially higher risk of internalizing behavior, depressive symptoms, and reactive problems than children with healthy parents. Families affected may need support to cope with such an overwhelming disease.

AB Background: Few studies have addressed the course and severity of maternal depression and its effects on child psychiatric disorders from a longitudinal perspective. This study aimed to identify longitudinal patterns of maternal depression and to evaluate whether distinct depression trajectories predict particular psychiatric disorders in offspring.
   Methods: Cohort of 4231 births followed-up in the city of Pelotas, Brazil. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3, 12, 24 and 48 months and 6 years after delivery. Psychiatric disorders in 6-year-old children were evaluated through the development and well-being assessment (DAWBA) instrument. Trajectories of maternal depression were calculated using a group-based modelling approach.
   Results: We identified five trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms: a "low" trajectory (34.8%), a "moderate low" (40.9%), a "increasing" (9.0%), a "decreasing" (9.9%), and a "high-chronic" trajectory (54%). The probability of children having any psychiatric disorder, as well as both internalizing and externalizing problems, increased as we moved from the "low" to the "high-chronic" trajectory. These differences were not explained by maternal and child characteristics examined in multivariate analyses. Limitations: Data on maternal depression at 3-months was available on only a sub-sample. In addition, we had to rely on maternal report of child's behavior alone.
   Conclusions: The study revealed an additive effect on child outcome of maternal depression over time. We identified a group of mothers with chronic and severe symptoms of depression throughout the first six years of the child life and for this group child psychiatric outcome was particularly compromised.

AB Mechanisms that account for treatment effects are poorly understood. The current study examined processes that may underlie treatment outcomes of an attachment-based intervention (Connect) for parents of pre-teens and teens with serious behavior problems. Parents (N =540) in a non-randomized trial reported on their teen's functioning prior to and following treatment. Results confirmed significant decreases in parents' reports of teens' externalizing and internalizing symptoms, replicating prior evaluations of this program. Reductions in parents' reports of teen attachment avoidance were associated with decreases in externalizing symptoms, while reductions in parents' reports of teen attachment anxiety were associated with decreases in internalizing symptoms. Parents' reports of improved teen affect regulation were also associated with decreases in both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results were comparable across gender and for parents of teens with pre-treatment externalizing symptoms in the clinical versus sub-clinical range. A model of therapeutic change in attachment-based parenting programs is discussed.

   THEORY
AB Vagal tone is a measure of cardiovascular function that facilitates adaptive responses to environmental challenge. Low vagal tone is associated with poor emotional and attentional regulation in children and has been conceptualized as a marker of sensitivity to stress. We investigated whether the associations of a wide range of psychosocial stressors with internalizing and externalizing psychopathology were magnified in adolescents with low vagal tone. Resting heart period data were collected from a diverse community sample of adolescents (ages 13-17; N=168). Adolescents completed measures assessing internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and exposure to stressors occurring in family, peer, and community contexts. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was calculated from the interbeat interval time series. We estimated interactions between RSA and stress exposure in predicting internalizing and externalizing symptoms and evaluated whether interactions differed by gender. Exposure to psychosocial stressors was associated strongly with psychopathology. RSA was unrelated to internalizing or externalizing problems. Significant interactions were observed between RSA and child abuse, community violence, peer victimization, and traumatic events in predicting internalizing but not externalizing symptoms. Stressors were positively associated with internalizing symptoms in adolescents with low RSA but not in those with high RSA. Similar patterns were observed for anxiety and depression. These interactions were more consistently observed for male than female individuals. Low vagal tone is associated with internalizing psychopathology in adolescents exposed to high levels of stressors. Measurement of vagal tone in clinical settings might provide useful information about sensitivity to stress in child and adolescent clients.

AB Anxiety and mood disorders are among the most prevalent mental health problems affecting our youth. We propose that assessment and treatment efforts in this area can benefit from a focus on developmentally sensitive neurobehavioral trait constructs, that is, individual difference constructs with direct referents in both neurobiology and behavior across the lifespan. This approach dovetails with the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative, which aims to improve classification and treatment of psychopathology by delineating dimensions of functioning that transcend measurement domains and traditional diagnostic categories. We highlight two neurobehavioral dimensions with clear relevance for understanding internalizing problems at differing ages: (a) defensive reactivity and (b) cognitive control. Individual differences in defensive reactivity are posited to reflect variations in sensitivity of the brain's negative valence systems, whereas differences in cognitive control are theorized to reflect variations in neural systems dedicated to regulating behavior and affect. Focusing on these target constructs, we illustrate a psychoneurometric approach to assessment of internalizing psychopathology entailing use of neural, self-report, and behavioral indicators. We address the feasibility of the psychoneurometric approach for clinical application and present results from a pilot study demonstrating expected associations for neural, parent-report, and behavioral measures of defensive reactivity and cognitive control with internalizing symptoms in preschoolers. Together, our conceptual and empirical analyses highlight the promise of multimethod, dimensional assessment of internalizing psychopathology in the lab and in the clinic.

AB This study examined the longitudinal relations of participants' self-reported ego-resiliency to internalize and externalize behavioural problems during the early adulthood. Participants were divided in two cohorts: 144 young adults (59.7% of females; mean age of 20 years at Time 1-T1 and 28 years at Time 3) were included in the first cohort and 119 young adults (48.7% of females; mean age of 21 years at T1 and 29 years at Time 4) were included in the second cohort. In a panel structural equation model controlling for stability of the constructs, we found that ego-resiliency predicted internalizing problems, and near significantly predicted externalizing problems, during the period of young adulthood. The posited conceptual model accounted for a significant portion of variance in the considered variables and has implications for interventions designed to promote and sustain ego-resiliency to counteract behavioural problems.

AB The present study aimed at identifying the full range of mental disorders comorbid to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents (age 4-17) diagnosed in Danish psychiatric hospitals between 1995 and 2010. A total of 14,825 patients were included in the study and comorbid disorders diagnosed concurrent with ADHD were identified. Associations of comorbid disorders with sex, age, and other mental disorders were investigated by logistic regression analysis. In the total sample, 52.0 % of the patients had at least one psychiatric disorder comorbid to ADHD and 26.2 % had two or more comorbid disorders. The most frequent comorbid disorders were disorders of conduct (16.5 %), specific developmental disorders of language, learning and motor development (15.4 %), autism spectrum disorders (12.4 %), and intellectual disability (7.9 %). Male sex was generally associated with an increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders while female sex was associated more frequently with internalizing disorders. The analysis of associations between the various comorbid disorders identified several clusters highlighting the differential developmental trajectories seen in patients with ADHD. The study provides evidence that comorbidity with mental disorders is developmentally sensitive. Furthermore, the study shows that particular attention should be given to patients with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and intellectual disability in future longitudinal analyses. These disorders are very frequent in patients with ADHD, and the affected patients might follow a different course than patients without these disorders.

AB One promising intervention to support the writing skills of students with and at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders is self-regulated strategy development (SRSD). The purpose of this study was to extend this line of inquiry to a residential setting with teachers serving as interventionists and determine the effects of the SRSD using the STOP and DARE mnemonic for persuasive writing on the writing performance (Correct Word Sequences, Essay Elements, and Essay Quality), and academic engagement of secondary students. In addition, this study extended this line of inquiry by looking at implementation of the intervention only 2 days per week, a lower treatment intensity than previous research has used to find statistically significant gains in writing. Results of a piecewise hierarchical linear model suggest statistically significant gains were made over the course of the intervention in writing and academic engagement when compared to baseline. In addition, student variables such as writing achievement, externalizing/internalizing behavior patterns, age, and attendance predicted writing and engagement. Results of generalization, fidelity, and social validity also are reported.

AB Behavioural adjustment is critical for children's school readiness. This study used data from a nationally representative sample of children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth Cohort. We examined the effects of interactions between children's negative emotionality, maternal sensitivity and preschool teacher sensitivity on children's kindergarten internalizing and externalizing behaviours. Parent report of children's negative emotionality and observations of maternal sensitivity were obtained at age 2years, teacher sensitivity was observed in preschool and teacher report of children's behaviour problems was obtained in kindergarten. Negative emotionality moderated links between maternal sensitivity, teacher sensitivity and children's internalizing behaviours. For children high in negativity, maternal sensitivity was positively associated with internalizing behaviour in the context of low teacher sensitivity, whereas for children low in negativity, maternal sensitivity was negatively associated with internalizing behaviour. For children high or low in negativity, internalizing behaviour was comparable when teacher sensitivity was high regardless of maternal sensitivity. Maternal sensitivity and teacher sensitivity interacted to predict externalizing behaviour regardless of child negativity. Children who experienced high teacher sensitivity displayed comparable externalizing behaviour regardless of maternal sensitivity. When children experienced low teacher sensitivity, maternal sensitivity was negatively associated with externalizing behaviour. Interactions between child characteristics and caregiving across developmental contexts are discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Insecure attachment and behavioral inhibition (BI) increase risk for internalizing problems, but few longitudinal studies have examined their interaction in predicting adolescent anxiety. This study included 165 adolescents (ages 14-17years) selected based on their reactivity to novelty at 4months. Infant attachment was assessed with the Strange Situation. Multimethod BI assessments were conducted across childhood. Adolescents and their parents independently reported on anxiety. The interaction of attachment and BI significantly predicted adolescent anxiety symptoms, such that BI and anxiety were only associated among adolescents with histories of insecure attachment. Exploratory analyses revealed that this effect was driven by insecure-resistant attachment and that the association between BI and social anxiety was significant only for insecure males. Clinical implications are discussed.

AB The aim of this study is to distinguish between consequences of neglect and poverty on problem behavior among preschool children. 72 children randomly chosen from the city of Granada (Andalucia, Spain), have been classified in three homogeneous groups according to demographic variables. Children in Group 1 (24 subjects) lived in slums (poverty) and suffered from neglect. Children in Group 2 lived in the same slums but did not suffer from neglect. Group 3 consisted of children from other neighborhoods of the city and did not suffer from neglect. Behavioral problems were evaluated with the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP) behavioral problems scale. 50% of the subjects in Groupl (neglected children) showed internalized behavior problems, and 0% in groups 2 and 3. Also 46% of Groupl showed the externalized one, and 12.5% of Group 2 and 8% of Group 3. It is concluded that neglected pre-school children (1-5 years) showed many behavior problems, mainly internalized and also externalized. However, neither the non-neglected children from a socially deprived environment (poverty), nor the children from the control group showed behavior problems. As a result, we can relate the behavior problems to neglect and not to social status or sociocultural environment.

AB Previous research has identified parental perfectionism as a risk factor for child anxiety. Yet few studies investigated why parental perfectionism may play such a role. Based on research suggesting parental verbal information and language use are associated with increased child fear beliefs and anxiety, the current study investigated the linguistic style of perfectionistic mothers and its relation to child anxiety. Participants were 71 mother-child dyads. Children were 3-12 years old, 57.7% female, and 30 were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Analyses showed that parental perfectionism was associated with increased second person pronouns, decreased adverbs, negative emotion words, and anger words. Second person pronouns and negative emotion words predicted child anxiety diagnostic status and mediated the relation between maternal perfectionism and child anxiety. These findings suggest that parental perfectionism may be associated with a specific language style that is related to child anxiety. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Recent models suggest that the relationships among cognitive vulnerabilities, stressors, and depression could be dynamic and bidirectional. This study investigated these transactional relationships among ruminative style, depressive symptoms, and stressors. Specifically, this study assessed rumination and stressors as predictors of depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms and rumination as predictors of stressors, and depressive symptoms and stressors as predictors of rumination. Method: A total of 1,000 adolescents (545 boys, Mean Age = 13.42 years) participated in the study. A fully cross-lagged panel design was used in which ruminative style, stressors, and depressive symptoms were assessed at three time points separated by 6 months (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3). Results: Rumination predicted an increase of depressive symptoms consistently over time. Time 1 depressive symptoms predicted Time 2 stressors, and Time 2 depressive symptoms predicted Time 3 stressors. Finally, Time 1 stressors predicted Time 2 rumination and Time 2 depressive symptoms predicted Time 3 rumination. The findings generally supported a reciprocal model where stressors and rumination contribute to the increase of depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms contribute to generate stress, and both the occurrence of stressors and depressive symptoms worsen ruminative style.

AB Purpose To compare children with mental and physical health problems regarding (1) perceived disease severity; (2) the impact of their condition on their families; (3) their utilization of health care services (including satisfaction with care); and (4) parents' health literacy about their child's condition and its treatment. Furthermore, we examined whether parents' health literacy differs between types of mental health condition.
   Methods Parental reports about their 9- to 14-year-old children with mental (n = 785) or physical health problems (n = 475) were analyzed from the population-based National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs in Switzerland.
   Results Mental health problems were perceived as being more severe (p < 0.001) and exerting a larger impact upon the family (e.g., financial impact) than physical health problems. Furthermore, fewer parents of children with a mental health problem mentioned having a particular person or place to contact if they needed information or advice regarding the child's condition (p = 0.004) and were satisfied with the health care services their child received (p < 0.001). The odds of low health literacy was higher among parents with children suffering from mental health problems vs. parents of children with physical health problems (OR in the adjusted model = 1.92; 95 % CI 1.47-2.50; p < 0.001); this finding held generally for mental health problem (although only a trend was observable for internalizing problems).
   Conclusions The large impact of children's mental health conditions on themselves and their families might be reduced by adapting the provision of health care and by increasing parents' health literacy.

AB The current study examined a temporal cascade linking mothers' history of abuse with their children's internalizing difficulties through proximal processes such as maternal postnatal depressive symptoms and responsive parenting. Participants consisted of 490 mother-child dyads assessed at three time points when children were, on average, 2 months old at Time 1 (T1), 18 months at Time 2 (T2), and 36 months at Time 3 (T3). Maternal abuse history and depressive symptoms were assessed via questionnaires at T1. Observations of responsive parenting were collected at T2 and were coded using a validated coding scheme. Children's internalizing difficulties were assessed in the preschool period using averaged parental reports. Path analysis revealed that maternal physical abuse was associated with depressive symptoms postnatally, which were in turn associated with children's internalizing behavior at 36 months of age. We also found that the association between physical abuse history and responsive parenting operated indirectly through maternal depressive symptoms. These findings remained after controlling for covariates including socioeconomic status, child gender, and age. After accounting for physical abuse history, sexual abuse history was not associated with child internalizing problems either directly or indirectly through maternal depressive symptoms and/or parenting behavior. Thus, mothers' physical abuse history is a risk factor for relatively poor mental health, which is itself predictive of both later parenting behavior and children's internalizing problems.

AB Shared pleasure (SP) was analyzed in fifty-eight 2-month-old infants and their mothers in face-to-face interaction (T1, at 2 months). The association of SP with child's emotional and behavioral outcome at 2 years (T2) was examined. SP as a possible protecting factor in the presence of parental psychopathology also was studied. Mean duration of SP moments (SP-MD) was related to subsequent socioemotional outcome of the child: Infants of dyads with longer SP-MD showed fewer internalizing and externalizing problems 2 years later. In hierarchical linear regressions, SP-MD uniquely and significantly contributed to internalizing problems after adjusting for infant and maternal factors and mother's interactive behavior. SP protected the child against the influence of parental psychopathology. Father's mental health problems during the follow-up increased the child's risk for higher externalizing and internalizing problems, but only among children with short SP-MD at T1. Internalizing symptoms at T2 increased when moving from the category no mental health problems to mental health problems in one parent and further to mental health problems in both parents, but this increase was found only among those with short SP-MD at T1. SP in parent-child interaction is an important feature that fosters positive psychological development and moderates the health effects of other risks such as parental psychopathology.

AB BackgroundMany children with language impairment present with deficits in other areas, including executive functioning (EF), attention and behaviour. Similarly, many children receiving services for attention or behaviour problems have deficits in language ability.
   AimsTo evaluate the relations among EF, language ability and behaviour problems in a sample of school-age children with a wide range of language and behaviour profiles. The following research questions were addressed: Does performance on EF tasks predict language ability? Do language ability and EF predict problems with attention, internalizing and/or externalizing?
   Methods & ProceduresEF was defined as referring to the separable, yet related, processes of shifting, updating working memory and inhibition as specified in the latent variable model of EF. Children aged 8-11 years recruited from an urban school district completed standardized language and cognitive assessments and a computerized task assessing EF. Their parents completed standardized questionnaires assessing the children's EF and problem behaviours. Regression analyses were conducted.
   Outcomes & ResultsRegression analyses revealed that EF did not contribute to language ability beyond the variance accounted for by nonverbal reasoning. Language ability contributed to attention problems when entered as a single predictor, but was no longer significant when the EF measures were added to the model. Language ability did not significantly contribute to internalizing or externalizing behaviour problems. Parent-reported inhibition was a robust predictor of attention, internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems.
   Conclusions & ImplicationsIn this sample of school-age children, language ability was related to attention problems, but not to internalizing or externalizing. Children with behaviour problems may have particular difficulty with inhibition.

AB Patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) who are successfully treated with irradiation are at increased risk for cognitive and psychosocial late effects. Conformal radiation therapy (CRT) allows sparing of cognitive deficits, but how it affects emotional and behavioral functioning remains unclear. We performed a prospective longitudinal study of the emotional and behavioral functioning of pediatric patients with LGG in the first 5 years post-CRT. Ninety-five pediatric patients with LGG treated on an institutional Phase II trial (August 1997-June 2009) underwent neuropsychological assessments pre-CRT and 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months post-CRT. Parent-reported scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were analyzed. Three competence scales (School Competence, Social Competence, and Activities), two summary scales (Internalizing Problems and Externalizing Problems), and two subscales of theoretical interest (Attention Problems and Social Problems) from the CBCL were used. Among 80 eligible patients [44 female, 68 white], 51 had pilocytic astrocytoma and 13 had optic pathway glioma. Mean age at diagnosis was 6.8 years (SD = 4.3 years) and at CRT initiation was 8.9 years (SD = 3.4 years). Before CRT, deficits were demonstrated on the competence scales (mean scores below normative mean) and the Attention Problems and Social Problems subscales (mean scores above normative means). This trend continued at 5 years post-CRT. Longitudinal trajectories of emotional and behavioral functioning were stable over 5 years. Emotional and behavioral deficits remain relatively stable over the 5 years post-CRT in patients with LGG, suggesting that CRT may not exacerbate pre-existing psychosocial difficulties in this population.

AB There is considerable research implicating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a common reaction to intimate-partner violence (IPV; Golding, 1999). PTSD is categorized as a single disorder; however, there is significant heterogeneity in its symptom-presentation patterns (Dickstein, Suvak, Litz, & Adler, 2010). Researchers have posited underlying personality characteristics as potentiating different expressions of PTSD (Miller, Greif, & Smith, 2003). Specifically, a model with 3 personality subtypes (i.e., externalizing, internalizing, and simple) has been proposed to explain PTSD symptom-pattern heterogeneity (Miller, 2003; Miller & Resick, 2007). The current study tested the PTSD personality-subtype model in a sample of 129 women exposed to a range of IPV experiences. Temperament patterns of women reporting clinically significant PTSD symptoms replicated the 3 personality-subtype patterns found in previous investigations (i.e., an externalizing subtype group characterized by high negative emotionality and low disinhibition, an internalizing subtype group characterized by high negative emotionality and low positive emotionality, and a simple subtype group characterized by midrange scores across the temperament variables; Miller et al., 2003; Miller, Kaloupek, Dillon, & Keane, 2004; Miller & Resick, 2007). Differences between personality-subtype groups and women without clinically significant PTSD symptoms were found (p < .05), with women reporting personality patterns consistent with the internalizing and externalizing subtype groups exhibiting higher comorbid personality pathology and psychological difficulties. Implications are discussed for personality as a risk or resiliency factor in PTSD and as contributing to explaining PTSD symptom heterogeneity.

AB This study examined individual and family characteristics that predicted early positive change in the context of Multisystemic Therapy (MST). Families (n = 185; 65% male; average youth age 15 years) receiving MST in community settings completed assessments at the outset of treatment and 6-12 weeks into treatment. Early positive changes in youth antisocial behavior were assessed using the caregiver report on the Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing Behaviors subscale and youth report on the Self-Report Delinquency Scale. Overall, families showed significant positive changes by 6-12 weeks into treatment; these early changes were maintained into midtreatment 6-12 weeks later. Families who exhibited clinically significant gains early in treatment were more likely to terminate treatment successfully compared with those who did not show these gains. Low youth internalizing behaviors and absence of youth drug use predicted early positive changes in MST. High levels of parental monitoring and low levels of affiliation with deviant peers (mechanisms known to be associated with MST success) were also associated with early positive change.

The final sample included 432 students across 38 second grade classrooms. Social skills and problem behaviors were measured via the SSIS rating scale for all participants, and direct observations were completed for a subsample of participants within each classroom. Results indicated that the SSIS-CIP demonstrated positive effects on teacher ratings of participants' social skills and internalizing behaviors, with the greatest changes occurring in classrooms with students who exhibited lower skill proficiency prior to implementation. Statistically significant differences were not observed between treatment and control participants on teacher ratings of externalizing problem behaviors or direct observation.

AB This study investigates the relation of defense mechanism to children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, as assessed from mothers' report at age 9 and 12 years, based on archival data. The defense mechanisms of denial, projection, and identification were assessed from Thematic Apperception Test stories told by the children at age 9 years, using the Defense Mechanism Manual (Cramer, The development of defense mechanisms: Theory, research and assessment. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1991a; Protecting the self: Defense mechanisms in action. New York: Guilford Press, 2006). The results showed that the use of identification predicted a decrease in externalizing behaviors between age 9 and 12 years. In contrast, change in internalizing behaviors was not predicted by defense use, but the use of projection was related to fewer internalizing behaviors at both ages. These findings are consistent with the idea that behavioral intervention stressing self-regulation can be effective in reducing externalizing problems, but internalizing problems require an intervention that is sensitive to the underlying behavioral inhibition in these children.

TI Predictors Associated With Improved Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Outcome

AB Objective: To identify predictors of treatment response in a large sample of pediatric participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Nordic Long-term Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) Treatment Study (NordLOTS) included 269 children and adolescents, 7 to 17 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD. Outcomes were evaluated after 14 weekly sessions of exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
   Method: The association of 20 potential predictors, identified by literature review, along with their outcomes, was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) posttreatment. A CY-BOCS total score of <= 15 was the primary outcome measure.
   Results: The univariate analyses showed that children and adolescents who were older had more severe OCD, greater functional impairment, higher rates of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms before treatment had significantly poorer outcomes after 14 weeks of treatment. However, only age was a significant predictor in the multivariate model.
   Conclusion: In the multivariate analysis, only age predicted better treatment outcome. Using univariate analysis, a variety of predictors of poorer treatment outcome after CBT was identified. The high impact of comorbid symptoms on outcome in pediatric OCD suggests that treatment should address comorbidity issues. The lack of a family predictor may be related to high family involvement in this study. Future research strategies should focus on optimizing intervention in the presence of these characteristics to achieve greater benefits for patients with OCD.

AB Patients with the 22q11-deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at an increased risk of developing schizophrenia. Besides the effects of genetic variation, environmental factors could also be important in modifying the risk of schizophrenia in 22q11DS patients. In particular, previous studies have shown the importance of stress as a precipitating factor of psychosis. An incongruence between the perceived and actual severity of behavioral and cognitive domains could lead caregivers, and even the children themselves, to make demands that are insufficiently adapted to the child's abilities, causing stress and anxiety. Here, we investigate whether such diagnostic discrepancies are indeed present by comparing parent and teacher reports on behavioral concerns in children with 22q11DS. Behavioral questionnaires (CBCL and TRF) were prepared for both parents and teachers of 146 children with 22q11DS. We found that in line with previous reports, internalizing behavior was more frequently reported than externalizing behavior. While the behavioral profiles reported by parents and teachers were remarkably similar, the teachers' ratings were significantly lower (Total problem score p = .002). Age and IQ were not significantly associated with the severity of reported concerns. Our results indicate that indeed a disparity often exists between parents' and teachers' perceptions of the severity of a child's behavioral deficits. This may result in (substantially) different demands and expectations being placed on the child from the two fronts. We speculate that the stress resulting from this lack of cohesion between parents and teachers could precipitate, at least in some 22q11DS children, the emergence of psychosis.

AB Background: Problem drinking in college is a longstanding problem with potentially severe consequences. More recently, problem drinking has been linked to emotion regulation difficulties. However, these results are mixed and emphasize the need to examine moderating variables that may strengthen the problem drinking/emotion regulation relationship. Two such variables are child/adolescent sexual abuse (CASA) and drinking refusal self-efficacy (DRSE). Objectives: The current study hypothesized that the relations between emotion regulation difficulties and problem drinking would be most salient for college students with increased CASA exposure and decreased DRSE. Secondary analyses examined the hypothesis taking into consideration cumulative child/adolescent trauma exposure. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 200) completed a large survey battery for course credit. Results: Three-way interactions across the CASA and cumulative trauma models were significant and in a similar direction. Results indicated that for students without trauma exposure, problem drinking was the greatest for those with decreased DRSE and increased emotion regulation difficulties. As trauma exposure increased, problem drinking was the greatest for those with decreased DRSE and decreased emotion regulation difficulties (or superior perceived regulatory abilities). Conclusion: Discussion highlights the importance of considering DRSE and the possibility of reduced insight in trauma-exposed students, who may perceive alcohol use as an adaptive regulatory strategy.

AB Background: The effects of mental illness stigma on adolescents receiving psychiatric treatment may largely be determined by their coping strategies. Yet, little is known about adolescents' use of stigma-coping strategies, or how helpful these are for addressing stigma-related stress.
   Aims: This study explores how adolescents discharged from psychiatric hospitalization anticipate coping with a hypothetical social stigma event related to hospitalization. We examine how well anticipated coping strategies predict adolescents' self-stigma ratings following 6 months. To evaluate the direction of causality, the reverse order of effects, the influence of self-stigma on coping strategies, is also assessed.
   Methods: A voluntary sample of 80 adolescents participated in two face-to-face interviews that assessed coping and self-stigma. Anticipated (baseline) and actual (follow-up) coping strategies were measured with a modified Response to Stress Questionnaire (primary and secondary control engagement coping, disengagement) and two stigma-specific strategies developed for this study (disconfirming stereotypes and aggression/confrontation). Relationships between anticipated coping strategies and self-stigma were assessed with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression; multivariate general linear modeling (GLM) and structural equation modeling (SEM) explored the reverse associations.
   Results: Youth reporting higher self-stigma ratings at follow-up anticipated using more disengagement and effort to disconfirm stereotypes and less secondary control engagement coping at baseline. Anticipated use of secondary control engagement coping was uniquely significant in predicting participants' self-stigma when controlling for baseline self-stigma. At the same time, higher baseline self-stigma ratings predicted less adaptive coping (disengagement and effort to disconfirm stereotypes) at follow-up.
   Conclusions: The results point to the particular importance of secondary control engagement coping for helping to mitigate the impact of peer prejudice or discrimination on self-stigma among youth receiving psychiatric services. At the same time, higher initial levels of self-stigma likely drive less adaptive coping with peer stigma. These bidirectional influences point to a vicious cycle between internalizing negative stereotypes and coping in ways that perpetuate negative outcomes.

AB Unresolved pediatric pain, both acute and chronic, has been associated with negative short- and long-term physical and mental health outcomes. This study sought to determine whether an association existed between self-reported pain coping skills and anxiety levels in a cohort of pediatric burn patients, and whether gender would influence their responses. The sample comprised burn-injured children in attendance at one of three mature burn camp sites. The self-report measures utilized included the 41-item Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders Child Version and the 39-item Pain Coping Questionnaire. Parental consent was obtained. A psychologist administered the measures. Participants included 187 youth, mean age 12.4 +/- 2.4 years, girls (n = 89) boys (n = 98) with 67% reporting visible burn scars. Among boys, the use of Internalizing Coping Strategies was moderately correlated with elevated scores on Panic Disorder symptoms (r = .42, P < .001). Among girls, the use of Internalizing Coping Strategies was associated with elevated Generalized Anxiety (r = .51, P < .001), Panic Disorder (r = .46, P < .001), and Total Anxiety Symptom Scores (r = .49, P < .001). Those children who reported using Behavioral Distraction Strategies did not have any elevated anxiety scores. These findings suggest that burn-injured children, who employ Internalization as their pain coping strategy, may be more vulnerable to the development of long-term anxiety disorder, which, if left untreated may result in a negative psycho/social outcome. Applicability to Practice: Assessment of in-patient pediatric patients with the Pain Coping Questionnaire may help to identify children who are more likely to experience long-term anxiety. Future studies should seek to confirm these findings and determine whether improved pain management and early treatment of anxiety can help to diminish the long-term implications of unhelpful pain strategies and increased anxiety in burn-injured children.

AB Maternal substance abuse and mental disorders can have adverse impacts on child development. We investigated the impact of maternal mental health on child behaviors based on a long-term follow-up study of mothers and their children approximately 10 years after mothers' admission to drug abuse treatment. Mothers (n = 396) were assessed at admission to drug treatment during 2000-2002, and at follow-up in 2010-2011. At follow-up, each mother was asked to assess one target child using the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18. Mothers' mental disorder diagnoses were obtained from records maintained by the California Department of Mental Health in 2009. About 46 % of mothers had comorbid mental disorders; 27 % had depressive disorder, 15 % bipolar disorder, 15 % adjustment disorder, 13 % anxiety disorder, and 6 % psychotic disorder. Of these mothers, more than half had two or more mental disorder diagnoses. The average age of the target child was approximately 10 years old (range 6-17). Relative to children of mothers without comorbid mental disorders, children were more likely to demonstrate internalizing behaviors if their mothers had comorbid depression/anxiety disorders (OR = 2.0, 95 % CI 1.0-4.0) or severe mental disorders (psychoses, bipolar) (OR = 3.4, 95 % CI 1.5-7.6). For externalizing behaviors, family problems was the only significant predictor (OR = 3.2, 95 % CI 1.7-6.0 for children of mothers with depression/anxiety disorders, OR = 3.9, 95 % CI 1.9-7.8 for severe mental disorders). Addressing maternal mental disorders (particularly severe mental disorders) and family problems are important for child well-being as these factors were significantly related to emotional and problem behaviors of children.

AB Using data on 2,535 children included in the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, we investigate how the legal status of immigrant parents shapes their children's behavioral functioning. Variation in internalizing and externalizing problems among Mexican youth with undocumented mothers, documented or naturalized citizen mothers, and U.S.-born mothers is analyzed using a comparative framework that contrasts their experience with that of other ethnoracial groups. Our findings reinforce the importance of differentiating children of immigrants by parental legal status in studying health and well-being. Children of undocumented Mexican migrants have significantly higher risks of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than their counterparts with documented or naturalized citizen mothers. Regression results are inconsistent with simple explanations that emphasize group differences in socioeconomic status, maternal mental health, or family routines.

AB Objective To investigate psychosocial characteristics of children and parents as predictors and moderators of the effect of a group intervention for children with chronic illness and their parents. Methods Data from a randomized controlled trial were used, including 194 children (8-18 years) who were assigned to a child-only intervention, a parent-child intervention, or a wait-list control group. Longitudinal multilevel regression analyses were used to test effects on change in parent and child reported internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Results For children with a more disengaged coping style or lower self-worth and for children who experienced a more secure parent-child relationship, the parent-child intervention was more effective than the child-only intervention in reducing behavior problems. Conclusions Children who are more "at risk" appear to gain more from participating in an intervention, especially if their parents are involved as well. However, the benefit of parents' involvement may depend on the quality of the parent-child relationship.

   CHILD CONFLICT
AB Among immigrant Asian and Latino groups, the contrast between collectivism in traditional heritage and individualism in the mainstream American cultures presents unique challenges for their family relationships. This systematic review was designed to answer 3 fundamental questions: to what extent do(es) (a) acculturation mismatch (AM) correlate with intergenerational cultural conflict (ICC); (b) ICC correlate with offspring's mental health and educational outcomes; and (c) demographic and study characteristics moderate these relationships. Sixty-one research reports were reviewed, with 68 independent study samples (N = 14,453; 41 and 27 Asian and Latino/a samples, respectively) subjected to 3 meta-analyses. AM positively correlated with ICC (r = .23), which in turn negatively correlated with offspring mental health (r = -.20) and educational outcomes (r = -.09). Findings provided support for acculturation gap-distress theory. While these effect size estimates were small, participant and methodological variables affected their magnitude. Contrary to findings on intergenerational conflict within mainstream nonimmigrant families, the relationships among AM, ICC, and mental health were larger in young adult than adolescent groups within immigrant families. ICC significantly correlated with internalizing problems and adaptive functioning, but not externalizing problems. AM was more closely related to ICC among women and second-generation immigrant offspring. AM and ICC were more problematic among offspring who were low-risk and lived in less ethnically disperse regions, particularly when studied in cross-sectional studies. Effect sizes also differed significantly across measurement tools for the key constructs. Limitations to generalizability (few studies on educational outcomes, relative underrepresentation of Latino/a to Asian American samples), and implications for intervention and future research are discussed.

AB IntroductionFew studies have examined anxiety and depression experiences of primary (middle) school-aged children from ethnically diverse backgrounds, and most have relied on parents or others as informants. The present study aimed to investigate self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms in Singaporean primary school-aged children. Age, gender, and ethnic differences and interactions were explored as well as similarities and differences between Singaporean children and US norms.
   MethodsA large representative community sample of 1655 8- to 12-year-old Singaporean children (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) completed the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) as part of a larger epidemiological study of mental health in Singaporean children.
   ResultsRates of clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression were 9.3% and 16.9% on the MASC and the CDI, respectively. Separation and social anxieties were most common. Evidence of a gender difference in levels of emotional symptoms was most evident in Indian children, with girls reporting more symptoms than boys. The relationship between age and internalizing problems was weak.
   DiscussionA substantial minority of primary school-aged Singaporean children reported elevated anxious and depressive symptoms. Better understanding of the factors that contribute to the development and maintenance of these problems can help the development of culture-specific interventions and facilitate the planning of community-tailored services and initiatives.

AB Objective: Examine the efficacy of a parent-augmented One-Session Treatment (A-OST) in treating specific phobias (SP) in youth by comparing this novel treatment to child-focused OST, a well-established treatment.
   Method: A total of 97 youth (ages 6-15, 51.5% female, 84.5% White) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for SP were randomized to either A-OST or OST. SPs were assessed with semistructured diagnostic interviews, clinician improvement ratings, and parent and child improvement ratings. In addition, measures of treatment satisfaction and parental self-efficacy were obtained. Blind assessments were completed pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1 month and 6 months following treatment. Analyses were undertaken using mixed models. In addition, gender, age, internalizing/externalizing problems, parent overprotection, and parent anxiety were examined as potential predictors and moderators of treatment outcome.
   Results: Both treatment conditions produced similar outcomes with approximately 50% of youth in both treatments diagnosis free and judged to be much or very much improved at posttreatment and 1-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, however, the treatments diverged with OST resulting in marginally superior outcomes to A-OST, contrary to predictions. Only age of child predicted treatment outcome across the two treatments (older children did better); unexpectedly, none of the variables moderated treatment outcomes.
   Conclusions: Parent augmentation of OST produced no appreciable gains in treatment outcomes. Directions for future research are highlighted.

AB Children involved with child protection services (CPS) are diagnosed and treated for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at higher rates than the general population. Children with maltreatment histories are much more likely to have other factors contributing to behavioural and attentional regulation difficulties that may overlap with or mimic ADHD-like symptoms, including language and learning problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, attachment difficulties, mood disorders and anxiety disorders. A higher number of children in the child welfare system are diagnosed with ADHD and provided with psychotropic medications under a group care setting compared with family-based, foster care and kinship care settings. However, children's behavioural trajectories change over time while in care. A reassessment in the approach to ADHD-like symptoms in children exposed to confirmed (or suspected) maltreatment (e.g. neglect, abuse) is required. Diagnosis should be conducted within a multidisciplinary team and practice guidelines regarding ADHD diagnostic and management practices for children in CPS care are warranted both in the USA and in Canada. Increased education for caregivers, teachers and child welfare staff on the effects of maltreatment and often perplexing relationship with ADHD-like symptoms and co-morbid disorders is also necessary. Increased partnerships are needed to ensure the mental well-being of children with child protection involvement.

AB In this article, we review evidence from recent behavior genetic studies that examined the covariance among common childhood psychopathological conditions and tested specific hypotheses regarding common and broadband-specific underlying features of childhood psychopathology. Specifically, we review the distinction between internalizing and externalizing disorders, the support for the generalist genes and specialist environments model, negative emotionality as a heritable underlying feature common to both internalizing and externalizing disorders, and daring as a heritable broadband-specific underlying feature that distinguishes externalizing disorders from internalizing disorders. We also discuss the implications of research in the search for specific genes that influence childhood psychopathology and suggest avenues for new research.

AB This study was to examine profiles of eating problems (EPs), mood and anxiety disorders and their comorbidities; explore risk patterns for these disorders; and document differences in health service utilization in a national population. Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey of Mental Health and Well-being. The lifetime prevalence of EPs was 1.70% among Canadians, compared with 13.25% for mood disorder, 11.27% for anxiety disorder and 20.16% for any mood or anxiety disorder. Almost half of those with EPs also suffered with mood or anxiety disorders. A similar pattern in depressive symptoms was found among individuals with major depression and EPs, but individuals with EPs reported fewer symptoms. Factors associated with the comorbidity of EPs and mood and anxiety disorders were identified. Individuals with EPs reported more unmet needs. Patients with EPs should be concomitantly investigated for mood and anxiety disorders, as similar interventions may be effective for both.

AB Continuity and change in children's involvement in bullying was examined across the transition to middle school in relation to externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in fifth grade and peer affiliations in fifth and sixth grades. The sample consisted of 533 students (223 boys, 310 girls) with 72% European American, 25% African American, and 3% Other. Although externalizing and internalizing behavior problems in fifth grade were related to bullying involvement in sixth grade, the prediction of stability and desistance in bullying and victimization status was enhanced by information about students' peer group trajectories. Furthermore, peer group trajectories uniquely explained the emergence of bullying and victimization in middle school.

AB Parents and adolescents often provide different ratings of youths' behavior problems, yet few studies have examined such disagreement and its effect on later adjustment, especially among at-risk adolescents. The purpose of this study was to investigate, among a sample of adolescents in foster care, whether the degree of caregiver-adolescent disagreement on adolescents' internalizing problems would be associated with adolescent externalizing problem behaviors over time. Two measures of adolescent caregiver agreement, the Pearson's r and intraclass correlations, were used with data drawn from a nationally representative study of children on foster care. Growth curve analyses of 180 adolescents revealed that the higher adolescent and caregiver agreement on adolescents' internalizing problems at Wave I, the slower the increase in externalizing problems over time.

AB In this naturalistic study of adolescents' text messaging, participants (N=172, 81 girls, age 14) were given BlackBerry devices configured to save their text messages to a secure archive for coding. Two 2-day transcripts collected 4months apart within the same academic year were microcoded for content. Results showed that most text message utterances were positive or neutral and that adolescents sent text messages primarily to peers and to romantic partners. Only a few sex differences emerged. Frequency of text messages containing negative talk positively predicted overall internalizing symptoms and anxious depression. Text messaging about sex was positively associated with overall internalizing and somatic complaints for girls, but not for boys.

AB While an accumulating body of research has documented increased risk of psychopathology among children of depressed fathers, most studies have used cross-sectional design, and little is known about offspring outcomes beyond childhood. Using prospective data from a community sample (N=395), we found that paternal depressive symptoms when children were in early adolescence (age 13) predicted offspring depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 21, controlling for baseline youth symptoms, maternal depressive symptoms, and other known correlates of internalizing problems in early adulthood. Associations were not moderated by maternal depressive symptoms or child gender. These results suggest that the unique and long-term effects of paternal depression on children's risk of mood disorders may persist into adulthood.

AB Child maltreatment has been linked with a number of risk behaviors that are associated with long-lasting maladaptive outcomes across multiple domains of functioning. This study examines whether the ages of onset of four risk behaviors-sexual intercourse, alcohol use, drug use, and criminal behavior-mediate the relationship between child maltreatment and outcomes in middle adulthood among a sample of court-documented victims of child abuse/neglect and matched controls (N = 1,196; 51.7 % female; 66.2 % White, 32.6 % Black). Adult outcomes included employment status, welfare receipt, internalizing symptoms of anxiety and depressive symptoms, substance use problems, and criminal arrests. The results indicated gender differences in these relationships. For females, age of onset of sexual intercourse mediated the relationship between child abuse/neglect and both internalizing symptoms and substance use problems in middle adulthood. For males, age at first criminal arrest mediated the relationship between child abuse/neglect and extensive involvement in the justice system in middle adulthood. Age of onset of alcohol use and drug use did not mediate the relationship between child abuse/neglect and middle adult outcomes. This study expands current knowledge by identifying associations between early initiation of risk behavior in one domain and later, continuing problems in different domains. Thus, early initiation of specific risk behaviors may have more wide-ranging negative consequences than are typically considered during intervention or treatment and strategies may need to target multiple domains of functioning.

AB The purpose of this research was to determine the influence of two subcomponents of auditory short-term memory on the developmental trajectories of behavior problems. The sample included 7,058 children from the NLSY79 - Children and Young Adult survey between the ages 5 and 14 years. Results suggested that anxious/depressed behavior increases during childhood and hyperactive and antisocial behavior problems decrease over the course of childhood. Children who scored higher on the Digit Span Backwards test demonstrated lower initial anxious/depressed, antisocial, and hyperactive behaviors, and children who scored higher on the Digit Span Forwards test demonstrated lower initial hyperactive behaviors. Some effects varied by sex; boys who scored higher on the Digit Span Forwards test decreased in antisocial behaviors at a slower rate than those who scored lower on the test. Thus, short-term memory associated with rehearsal mechanisms appears to influence initial levels of various problem behaviors for both males and females, while storage capacity influences initial hyperactive behavior for both males and females and the course of antisocial behavior in males.

AB Although it is hypothesized that children with different insecure attachment patterns may experience a variety of peer difficulties, the question has been investigated almost exclusively for externalizing and internalizing behaviors with peers. The purpose of this study was to investigate how each of the insecure attachment patterns is related to other features of peer relationships using data from the NICHD SECC (N = 1,140 families). Secure children were rated by mothers and teachers as less excluded by peers than avoidant and disorganized children, although the latter was only significant for boys. No behaviors were uniquely associated with ambivalent children. Avoidant children were rated high by mothers and teachers on asocial behavior, and lowest by teachers on relational aggression. Disorganized children were rated low by mothers on prosocial behavior and high on peer victimization as reported by mothers and teachers. Teachers rated disorganized children as showing higher levels of relational aggression than securely- and ambivalently-attached children. The pattern of findings revealed mixed evidence for the specificity hypothesis.

AB The sociopolitical context of Norway includes low poverty rates and universal access to subsidized and regulated Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC). In this context, the association between family income dynamics and changes in early child behavior problems was investigated, as well as whether high-quality ECEC buffers children from the effects of income dynamics. In a population-based sample (N=75,296), within-family changes in income-to-needs predicted changes in externalizing and internalizing problems (from ages 18 to 36months), particularly for lower income children. For internalizing problems, ECEC buffered the effect of income-to-needs changes. These findings lend further support to the potential benefits of ECEC for children from lower income families.

AB In the past years, there is growing recognition of a syndrome of disturbed grief referred to as prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Although mostly studied in adults, clinically significant PGD symptoms have also been observed in children and adolescents. To date, no effective treatment for childhood PGD yet exists. We recently developed a nine-session cognitive-behavioural treatment for childhood PGD combined with five sessions of parental counselling. In the current article, we present outcomes of treatment of 10 consecutive children and adolescents turning to our university clinic with elevated PGD symptoms as their primary problem and main reason to seek therapy. Patients were significantly improved at post-treatment, with large improvements in self-rated PGD and post-traumatic stress (effect sizes>0.8) and small to moderate improvement in depression and parent-rated internalizing and externalizing problems (0.2<effect sizes<0.8). Additional predictor analysis of outcomes suggested that, among other things, this treatment approach is less efficacious for children and adolescents further removed from loss and those confronted with suicidal loss. That said, the treatment appears promising, and controlled evaluation is clearly indicated. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In a sample of 7- to 8-year-old children (N=760), we examined the associations between personality traits, oral fluency and sociometric popularity. Extending upon research conducted with older populations, we found parent ratings of extraversion at age 7 to predict popularity one year later. More importantly, we expected and found teacher-rated oral fluency to partially mediate the positive association between extraversion and popularity. This mediation effect was independent of psychometrically assessed working memory, academic skills and gender. Our results can be interpreted as suggesting that a Matthew effect, similar to the one proposed for early reading skills and cognitive ability, may be operating in the domain of social competence.

AB Background and objectives: Disturbed body perception is a common characteristic of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childhood sexual abuse (CSA). We examined the extent to which biased information processing of body related stimuli was related to CSA
   Methods: Patients with PTSD after CSA (PTSD group; n = 61) were compared to healthy controls (HC group; n = 30). The PTSD group was subdivided into patients with comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD; PTSD+ group) and patients without BPD (PTSD-group). We used an emotional Stroop task (EST) with body-related words to assess biased information processing.
   Results: Only patients in the PTSD+ group but not in the PTSD-group showed a significantly stronger attentional bias to body related words compared to the HC group (p = .009).
   Limitations: Recruitment in in-patient setting might have led to a non-representative sample of PTSD patients. The PTSD patients were not characterized regarding anything other than the mentioned mental disorders.. Potentially, the body related words may have been associated with offenders' body areas, but not with the patients.
   Conclusion: We found that patients with PTSD and comorbid BPD had a stronger attentional bias towards body related stimuli in comparison to other groups. This suggests that the observed attentional bias is a product of CSA combined with the emotion regulation difficulties characteristic of BPD. Future studies should test whether directly targeting body-related abnormalities in information processing can improve existing treatments for patients with CSA and BPD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Economic hardship and poor parenting behaviors are associated with increased risk for mental health problems in community adolescents. However, less is known about the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) and parenting behaviors on youth at elevated risk for mental health problems, such as teens seeking outpatient psychiatric care. This study examined whether family SES and parent positive communication were directly and indirectly associated with mental health symptoms 6 months later in urban teens seeking outpatient treatment, after accounting for baseline levels of symptoms. At baseline, adolescent participants (N = 346; 42 % female; 61 % African-American) ages 12-19 years old (M = 14.9; SD = 1.8) and their primary caregivers reported on SES and teen internalizing and externalizing symptoms and engaged in a videotaped discussion of a real-life conflict to assess parent positive communication. At 6-month follow-up, 81 % (N = 279) of families were retained and teens and caregivers again reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized models with a sample of 338, using the full information likelihood method to adjust for missing data. For parent-reported externalizing symptoms, SEM revealed support for the indirect association of SES with follow-up externalizing symptoms via parent positive communication and externalizing symptoms at baseline. For parent reported internalizing symptoms, there was a direct association between SES and follow-up internalizing symptoms, but not an indirect effect via parent positive communication. Youth-reported symptoms were not associated with SES nor with parent positive communication. Current findings extend prior research on adolescent mental health in a diverse sample of urban youth seeking outpatient psychiatric care. These families may benefit from interventions that directly target SES-related difficulties and parent positive communication.

AB Peer problems are common among children with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). However, the extent to which children's peer functioning varies across settings is unknown, as is the incremental power of peer functioning in different settings in predicting subsequent psychopathology. Participants were 57 children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who had peer sociometric nominations collected in general education classrooms and a Summer Treatment Program (STP) with all-EBD peers. Significant, small-to-medium correlations existed between nomination rates across settings. Lower rates of STP positive nominations and higher rates of STP negative nominations (but not classroom nominations) predicted exacerbated self-reported depression and antisocial behavior 1 year later. Lower rates of STP positive nominations, but higher rates of classroom positive nominations, predicted increased self-reported depression 2 years later. For children with high rates of classroom positive nominations, higher rates of STP positive nominations predicted reduced parent-reported internalizing behavior 1 year later. For children with low rates of classroom negative nominations, higher rates of STP negative nominations predicted increased teacher-reported externalizing behavior 1 year later and self-reported depression 2 years later. Results suggest that sociometric nominations collected within an EBD peer group may have stronger predictive power for later adjustment than nominations collected in a mainstream classroom.

AB Objectives To investigate which disruptive behaviors in preschool were normative and transient vs markers of conduct disorder, as well as which disruptive behaviors predicted the persistence of conduct disorder into school age.
   Study design Data from a longitudinal study of preschool children were used to investigate disruptive behaviors. Caregivers of preschoolers ages 3.0-5.11 years (n = 273) were interviewed using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment to derive the following diagnostic groups: conduct disorder, externalizing disorder without conduct disorder, internalizing disorder without externalizing disorder, and healthy. At school age, participants were again assessed via an age-appropriate diagnostic interview. Logistic and linear regression with pairwise group comparisons was used to investigate clinical markers of preschool conduct disorder and predictors of school age conduct disorder.
   Results Losing one's temper, low-intensity destruction of property, and low-intensity deceitfulness/stealing in the preschool period were found in both healthy and disordered groups. In contrast, high-intensity argument/defiant behavior, both low- and high-intensity aggression to people/animals, high-intensity destruction of property, high-intensity deceitfulness/stealing, and high-intensity peer problems were markers of preschool conduct disorder and predictors of school age conduct disorder. Inappropriate sexual behavior was not a marker for preschool conduct disorder but was a predictor of school age conduct disorder.
   Conclusion These findings provide a guide for primary care clinicians to help identify preschoolers with clinical conduct disorder and those who are at risk for persistent conduct disorder in childhood. Preschoolers displaying these symptoms should be targeted for mental health assessment.

DE Shyness; friendship relationship; psychological adjustment
AB Objectives
   The goals of this study were to explore the relationship between shyness and the quantitative and qualitative aspects of friendship during adolescence and to analyse the moderating role of such variables in the relationship between shyness and internalizing difficulties.
   Methods
   A total of 683 adolescents who were attending secondary and high schools in Florence were enrolled: 398 early adolescents (220 males and 178 females) aged 11 to 13 (M = 12.32; SD = 0.71) and 285 late adolescents (161 males and 124 females) age 17 to 19 (M = 17.71; SD = 0.68). Subjects completed a battery of questionnaires that included measures of shyness, quantitative and qualitative aspects of friendship and internalising problems. Shyness was assessed using the Italian version (Ponti & Tani, 2009) of the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale (RCBS; Cheek, 1983). Reciprocal friendships were measured using friendship nominations (Bukowski, Hoza, & Boivin, 1994) and friendship qualities were assessed via the Italian version ( Ponti, Guarnieri, Smorti, & Tani, 2010) of the Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS; Bukowski et al., 1994), which assesses 5 dimensions: conflict, companionship, help, security and closeness. Internalising problems were assessed using the Italian version (Pastorelli, Gerbino, Vecchio, Steca, Picconi & Paciello, 2002) of the Youth Self Report (YSR) developed by Achenbach (1991). Two analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to assess between group differences in the number of reciprocal friendship and in levels of social rejection. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were conducted to assess between group differences in friendship relationship qualities. Finally, a series of hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to explore the moderating role of the quality of friendship relationship on the correlation between shyness and psychological adjustment.
   Results
   The results indicated that shyness does not affect the quantitative aspects of friendship considered. However, shy adolescents perceived their friendship relationships as characterized by more negative aspects than did their peers. Moreover, the moderating role only of qualitative aspect of friendship was seen: participants who perceived their friend as helpful and supportive showed significantly fewer internalising problems related to shyness.
   Conclusions
   Overall, these results showed that the quantitative aspects of friendship do not vary as a function of shyness, but that, in contrast, the qualitative aspects of reciprocal friendships vary significantly between shy and non-shy individuals. In other words, shy individuals have the same number of reciprocal friendships and were not significantly more rejected by their peers than non-shy adolescents, but they do show a friendship relationship quality characterised by more negative aspects than their peers. Moreover, these results demonstrated the importance that a positive friendship relationship has in influencing individual well-being, such as internalising difficulties, especially for shy individuals.

DE ADHD; attention problems; late effects; neurocognition;

AB Background. Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for neuropsychological late effects, yet identifying those in need of evaluation and obtaining needed services can be challenging for the medical team. Finding time-and cost-effective screening measures that can be used to identify children in need of evaluation is a clinical priority. Our objective was to investigate the association between parentrated attention problems and related neuropsychological impairments in childhood cancer survivors as a means of identifying those at high risk for difficulties.
   Methods. Cognitive and psychosocial data of survivors who completed neuropsychological evaluations were retrospectively abstracted. Parents of 70 survivors of pediatric cancer (mean age, 11.6 years) completed the Conners Parent Rating Scale and the Child Behavior Checklist. Children also completed a measure of intellectual functioning. The 18 symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were abstracted from the Conners questionnaire, and participants were classified according to whether or not they met attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom criteria (>= 6 inattentive symptoms).
   Results. Survivors who met symptom criteria for ADHD (27%) demonstrated greater impairments in IQ and working memory, but not processing speed, than survivors who did not. Meeting ADHD symptom criteria was also associated with greater externalizing and social problems but not more internalizing symptoms. ADHD symptom screening was associated with low sensitivity (range = 26.3%-69.2%) but stronger specificity (range = 75.0%-82.7%) for neuropsychological difficulties.
   Conclusion. Parental ratings of attentional symptoms may be a useful way to screen survivors who may be in need of a full neuropsychological assessment.

AB Aim of this study is to validate the Italian version of the Parenting Alliance Measure (PAM). Participants were 350 mothers and 350 fathers of children (49.3% girls) aged 1-15 years. Confirmatory factor analyses were performed to individuate the dimensionality of Italian PAM. The scale's internal consistency and invariance over mothers and fathers were examined. The scale's concurrent validity was explored by investigating the associations of PAM dimensions with parenting stress and children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. In a subsample of 175 couples of parents we also explored the associations among PAM dimensions with marital adjustment. A 2-factor structure model was the most effective PAM structure for both mothers and fathers. This solution obtained the partial scalar invariance over mothers and fathers and internal validity of the scale was confirmed. The dimension Communication and Team Work was the most associated with all the other variables in the expected directions, for both parents.

AB Background: While emotion dysregulation represents an important mechanism underpinning psychological responses to trauma, little research has investigated this in refugees. In the current study, we examined the mediating role of emotion dysregulation in the relationship between refugee experiences (trauma and living difficulties) and psychological outcomes.
   Methods: Participants were 134 traumatized treatment seeking refugees who completed measures indexing trauma exposure, post migration living difficulties, difficulties in emotion regulation, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and explosive anger.
   Results: Findings revealed distinctive patterns of emotion clysregulation associated with each of these psychological disorders. Results also indicated that emotion regulation difficulties mediated the association between both trauma and psychological symptoms, and living difficulties and psychological symptoms. Limitations.: Limitations include a cross-sectional design and the use of measures that had not been validated across all cultural groups in this study.
   Conclusions: These findings underscore the key role of emotion dysregulation in psychological responses of refugees, and highlight potential directions for treatment interventions for traumatized refugees. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus is believed to underlie the development of much psychopathology. However, to date only limited longitudinal data relate early behavior with neural structure later in life. Our objective was to examine the relationship of early life externalizing behavior with adolescent brain structure. We report here the first longitudinal study linking externalizing behavior during preschool to brain structure during adolescence. We examined the relationship of preschool externalizing behavior with amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex volumes at age 15 years in a community sample of 76 adolescents followed longitudinally since their mothers' pregnancy. A significant gender by externalizing behavior interaction revealed that males-but not females-with greater early childhood externalizing behavior had smaller amygdala volumes at adolescence (t = 2.33, p =.023). No significant results were found for the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex. Greater early externalizing behavior also related to smaller volume of a cluster including the angular gyrus and tempoparietal junction across genders. Results were not attributable to the impact of preschool anxiety, preschool maternal stress, school-age internalizing or externalizing behaviors, or adolescent substance use. These findings demonstrate a novel, gender-specific relationship between early-childhood externalizing behavior and adolescent amygdala volume, as well as a cross-gender result for the angular gyrus and tempoparietal junction.

AB Background: Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) is associated with multiple adverse childhood outcomes including externalizing behaviors. However, the association between MSDP and internalizing (anxiety and depressive) behaviors in offspring has received less investigation. We aimed to assess the association between MSDP and childhood internalizing (anxiety and depressive) behaviors in a very large, well-characterized cohort study.
   Methods: We assessed the association between MSDP and internalizing behaviors in offspring utilizing information drawn from 90,040 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Mothers reported smoking information, including status and frequency of smoking, twice during pregnancy. Mothers also reported their child's internalizing behaviors at 18 months, 36 months, and 5 years. Associations between MSDP and childhood internalizing behaviors, including dose-response and timing of smoking in pregnancy, were assessed at each time point.
   Results: MSDP was associated with increased internalizing behaviors when offspring were aged 18 months (B = 0.11, P < 0.001) and 36 months (B = 0.06, P < 0.01), adjusting for numerous potential confounders. Higher rates of smoking (e.g., > 20 cigarettes per day) were associated with higher levels of internalizing behaviors. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy appeared to be the critical period for exposure.
   Conclusions: We found evidence supporting a potential role for MSDP in increasing internalizing (anxiety and depressive) behaviors in offspring. We also found evidence supportive of a possible causal relationship, including dose-dependency and support for a predominant role of early pregnancy exposure. Further investigation utilizing genetically informed designs are warranted to assess this association.

AB Context: Preterm survivors exhibit neurodevelopmental impairments. Whether this association is influenced by antenatal glucocorticoid treatment and glucocorticoid sensitivity is unknown.
   Objectives: This study aimed to study the effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) polymorphisms on behavior and intelligence quotient (IQ).
   Design: This study was part of the 19-year follow-up of the Project On Preterm and Small-for-gestational- age birth cohort.
   Setting: Multicenter study.
   Patients: Three hundred forty-four 19-year-olds born very preterm (gestational age < 32 wk), of whom 71 had received betamethasone antenatally.
   Intervention: Single antenatal treatment course of betamethasone.
   Main Outcome Measures: Behavior (Young Adult Self Report and Young Adult Behavior Checklist for parents) and IQ (digital Multicultural Capacity Test-intermediate level).
   Data were analyzed by linear regression and presented as regression coefficient (95% confidence interval [CI]).
   Results: Sex ratio, GR (R23K; N363S) and MR (-2G/ C; I180V) genotypes were equally distributed between treated and nontreated subjects. Independent of treatment, R23K carriers had improved IQ scores (beta= 9.3; 95% CI, 3.4 to 15.1) and a tendency toward more favorable total problem behavior scores (beta =-8.5; 95% CI, -17.3 to 0.2); -2G/CCC carriers had poorer IQ scores (beta = -6.2; 95% CI, -10.5 to -1.9); I180V carriers had more favorable internalizing behavior scores (beta = -2.0; 95% CI, -3.9 to -0.1). Antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was associated with more unfavorable behavior scores, especially internalizing behavior (beta = 2.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 4.5). Interaction between GR and MR polymorphisms and antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was observed, with poorer IQ scores for exposedN363S carriers; poorer intellectual subdomain scores for exposed I180V-carriers; more favorable total problem behavior scores for exposed R23K carriers.
   Conclusions: Genetic variations in glucocorticoid sensitivity and antenatal glucocorticoid treatment are associated with IQ and behavior in young adult preterm survivors.

AB Background. Preoperative anxiety at induction and postoperative emergence delirium (ED) in children are associated with postoperative behavioral changes and adjustment disorders. This study's. aim is to assess the value of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) score in order to predict anxiety during induction and emergence delirium after anesthesia in children undergoing elective day-care surgery.
   Methods. Anxiety at induction, assessed by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS), was studied as outcome in 401 children (60.1% male, age range: 1.5-16 years). For 343 of these children (59.8% male, age range: 1.5-16 years) ED could be investigated postoperatively, as assessed by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scale (PAED). Demographic data, healthcare contacts, anesthesia and surgical data were registered. Preoperative emotional/behavioral problems, during the 6 months prior to surgery, were assessed by the CBCL. Hierarchical, multiple regression was used to test whether anxiety and ED could be predicted by CBCL scores.
   Results. Children with a higher CBCL score on preoperative internalizing problems (e.g. anxious/depression) showed preoperative more anxiety at induction (P=0.003). A higher CBCL score on preoperative emotional/behavioral problems was not associated with ED.
   Conclusion. 'The CBCL predicted anxiety at induction but not ED.

AB Relational aggression is associated with negative psychosocial consequences, but more information is needed about connections between relational aggression and other problems. This review and meta-analysis examines the association between relational aggression and internalizing symptoms in 24,622 children between the ages of 5 and 17 years old, gathered from 42 studies. In addition to evaluating the overall relation between these constructs, this review examines the state of the literature with respect to six potentially important moderators of the relation: age, type of internalizing symptom (depression versus anxiety), sex, ethnicity, reporter, and type of aggression (relational versus indirect). The overall association was significant (average r =.24). Findings were inconclusive with respect to age as a moderator of this relation. There was no difference in relational aggression's association in boys compared to girls. The relation was slightly stronger for indirect versus relational aggression and for anxiety than depression. Almost no data address how associations vary as a function of ethnicity. Associations were substantially stronger when the same informant was used to assess both constructs. Findings point to the importance of identifying and addressing relational aggression in childhood, and the importance of collecting data from multiple informants.

AB Exposure to multiple traumas has been shown to result in many negative mental health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociation, which involves disruptions in memory, identity, and perceptions, may be a component of PTSD, particularly among individuals who have experienced childhood trauma. Emotion regulation difficulties are also strongly associated with childhood trauma and emotion dysregulation may be a particularly important factor to consider in the development and maintenance of dissociative symptoms.
   The goal of the present study was to determine whether emotion dysregulation mediated the relationship between PTSD symptoms and dissociation in a sample of 154 (80% female, 97% African-American) adults recruited from a public, urban hospital. PTSD was measured using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, emotion dysregulation was measured using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and dissociation was measured using the Multiscale Dissociation Inventory. A linear regression analysis showed that both PTSD and emotion dysregulation were statistically significant predictors of dissociation even after controlling for trauma exposure. Alexithymia and an inability to use emotion regulation strategies in particular were predictive of dissociation above and beyond other predictor variables. Using bootstrapping techniques, we found that overall emotion dyregulation partially mediated the effect of PTSD symptoms on dissociative symptoms. Our results suggest that emotion dysregulation may be important in understanding the relation between PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Treatment approaches may consider a focus on training in emotional understanding and the development of adaptive regulation strategies as a way to address dissociative symptoms in PTSD patients.

AB Previous research has shown that families with a parent who has bipolar disorder (BD) may experience family functioning difficulties. However, the association between family functioning and psychopathology among offspring of parents with BD, and offspring characteristics that may moderate this association, remains poorly understood. This study examined the cross-sectional associations between family functioning (cohesion, expressiveness, and conflict) and psychopathology in 117 offspring (ages 5-18) of 75 parents with BD. We also examined whether age and sex differences moderated these associations. We measured offspring psychopathology by examining current dimensional symptoms and DSM-IV emotional and behavioral disorders. Correlational analyses indicated that higher family conflict and lower cohesion were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms in offspring. Lower family cohesion was also associated with current offspring mood disorders. Moderation analyses indicated, first, that the link between lower family cohesion and internalizing symptoms was stronger for younger offspring compared to older offspring. Second, higher family conflict and current mood disorder were associated in younger males but not in older males or in females. Results remained the same after controlling for parental anxiety or substance use disorder comorbidity. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for family functioning when working with offspring at risk for BD, while also recognizing that the connections between family functioning and offspring outcomes are complex and differ based on offspring sex and developmental stage.

AB Among the available treatments for disruptive behavior problems, a need remains for additional service options to reduce antisocial behavior and prevent further development along delinquent and violent pathways. The Stop Now and Plan (SNAP) Program is an intervention for antisocial behavior among boys between 6 and 11. This paper describes a randomized controlled treatment effectiveness study of SNAP versus standard behavioral health services. The treatment program was delivered to youth with aggressive, rule-breaking, or antisocial behavior in excess of clinical criterion levels. Outcomes were measured at 3, 9, and 15 months from baseline. Youth in the SNAP condition showed significantly greater reduction in aggression, conduct problems, and overall externalizing behavior, as well as counts of oppositional defiant disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Additional benefits for SNAP were observed on measures of depression and anxiety. Further analyses indicated that the SNAP program was more effective among those with a higher severity of initial behavioral problems. At 1 year follow-up, treatment benefits for SNAP were maintained on some outcome measures (aggression, ADHD and ODD, depression and anxiety) but not others. Although overall juvenile justice system contact was not significantly different, youth in SNAP had significantly fewer charges against them relative to those standard services. The SNAP Program, when contrasted with standard services alone, was associated with greater, clinically meaningful, reductions in targeted behaviors. It may be particularly effective for youth with more severe behavioral problems and may result in improvements in internalizing problems as well.

AB Education professionals and researchers are concerned by school bullying and cyberbullying because of its repercussions on students' health and the school climate. However, only a few studies investigating the impact of school versus cyberbullying have systematically explored whether student victims and perpetrators are involved in school bullying only, cyberbullying only, or both. The aim of the present study was thus to examine the possible overlap, as well as the similarities and/or differences, between these two forms of bullying when taking modality of involvement into account. Individual interviews were conducted with 1422 junior high- and high-school students (girls = 43%, boys = 57%, mean age = 143 +/- 2.7 years). Results showed that cyberbullying and school bullying overlapped very little. The majority of students involved in cyberbullying were not simultaneously involved in school bullying. Moreover, results indicated that psychosocial problems (psychological distress, social disintegration, general aggression) varied according to the form of bullying. Victims of school bullying had greater internalizing problems than cybervictims, while school bullies were more aggressive than cyberbullies. Given the sizable proportion of adolescents involved in bullying (school and cyber) and its significant relationship with mental health, the issue warrants serious attention from school and public health authorities.

AB Background: Increased intra-subject reaction time variability (RT-ISV) as coarsely measured by the standard deviation (RT-SD) has been associated with many forms of psychopathology. Low-frequency RT fluctuations, which have been associated with intrinsic brain rhythms occurring approximately every 15-40 s, have been shown to add unique information for ADHD. In this study, we investigated whether these fluctuations also relate to attentional problems in the general population, and contribute to the two major domains of psychopathology: externalizing and internalizing problems.
   Methods: RT was monitored throughout a self-paced sustained attention task (duration: 9.1 +/- 1.2 min) in a Dutch population cohort of young adults (n = 1455, mean age: 19.0 +/- 0.6 years, 55.1% girls). To characterize temporal fluctuations in RT, we performed direct Fourier Transform on externally validated frequency bands based on frequency ranges of neuronal oscillations: Slow-5 (0.010-0.027 Hz), Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), and three additional higher frequency bands. Relative magnitude of Slow-4 fluctuations was the primary predictor in regression models for attentional, internalizing and externalizing problems (measured by the Adult Self-Report questionnaire). Additionally, stepwise regression models were created to investigate (a) whether Slow-4 significantly improved the prediction of problem behaviors beyond the RT-SD and (b) whether the other frequency bands provided important additional information.
   Results: The magnitude of Slow-4 fluctuations significantly predicted attentional and externalizing problems and even improved model fit after modeling RT-SD first (R-2 change = 0.6%, P < .01). Subsequently, adding Slow-5 explained additional variance for externalizing problems (R-2 change = 0.4%, P < .05). For internalizing problems, only RT-SD made a significant contribution to the regression model (R-2 = 0.5%, P < .01), that is, none of the frequency bands provided additional information.
   Conclusions: Low-frequency RT fluctuations have added predictive value for attentional and externalizing, but not internalizing problems beyond global differences in variability. This study extends previous findings in clinical samples of children with ADHD to adolescents from the general population and demonstrates that deconstructing RT-ISV into temporal components can provide more distinctive information for different domains of psychopathology.

AB The ability to regulate behaviors and emotions depends in part on the ability to flexibly monitor one's own progress toward a goal. Atypical patterns of response monitoring have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the current study we examined the error related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index of response monitoring, in relation to behavioral, social cognitive, and emotional presentation in higher functioning children (8-16 years) diagnosed with autism (HFA: N = 38) and an age- and IQ-matched sample of children without autism (COM: N = 36). Both HFA and COM participants displayed larger amplitude responses to error compared to correct response trials and these amplitudes did not differ by diagnostic group. For participants with HFA, larger ERN amplitudes were associated with more parent-reported autistic symptoms and more self-reported internalizing problems. However, across the full sample, larger ERN amplitudes were associated with better performance on theory of mind tasks. The results are discussed in terms of the utility of electrophysiological measures for understanding essential moderating processes that contribute to the spectrum of behavioral expression in the development of ASD.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Early first sexual intercourse (FSI) is a risk factor for unplanned teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted infection, and adverse social, emotional, and physical health outcomes in adolescence and into adulthood. The aim of this study was to examine relationships between internalizing (eg, anxious/depressed, withdrawn) and externalizing (eg, delinquent, aggressive) behavior problems in childhood and age at FSI.
   METHODS: We used a large, population-based birth cohort (The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort [Raine] Study) to address this question. Child behavior was measured by using the Child Behavior Checklist collected from parents at ages 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 and scores calculated for total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problems. At age 17, 1200 participants reported sexual behavior.
   RESULTS: Participants with clinically significant Child Behavior Checklist scores (T >= 60) were at increased risk for earlier first sexual intercourse (FSI) (<16 years). Adjusted odds ratios revealed that total and externalizing behavior problems from age 5 years onward significantly increased the risk of earlier FSI for boys. In girls, externalizing problems from age 10 years increased the risk for earlier FSI. Internalizing problems at ages 8 and 10 were significantly associated with early FSI for boys but not girls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Externalizing behavior from as early as 5 in boys and 10 in girls is a significant risk factor for earlier age at FSI. Adolescent sexual health promotion should consider early intervention in children with behavior problems, particularly boys.

DT Review
ID PSYCHOTHERAPY; EFFICACY
AB The authors conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review that examined 23 studies evaluating the effectiveness of child centered play therapy (CCPT) conducted in elementary schools. Meta-analysis results were explored using a random effects model for mean difference and mean gain effect size estimates. Results revealed statistically significant effects for outcome constructs, including externalizing problems (d=0.34), internalizing problems (d=0.21), total problems (d=0.34), self-efficacy (d=0.29), academic (d=0.36), and other behaviors (d=0.38). Further, a systematic review was conducted on all studies compared with Outcome Research Coding Protocol criteria. Results indicated that CCPT studies provided quantitative support and qualitatively promising to strong evidence in support of its use in the schools.

AB This study examined the development of baseline autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) physiological activity from 12 to 36 months as well as antecedents (poverty) and consequents (behavior problems) of individual differences in physiological development. Children (N=179; 50% poor; 56% African American; 52% mate) provided saliva samples at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. Latent growth curve models indicated that nonlinear change was evident for both sAA and cortisol, with sAA increasing and cortisol decreasing with age. Children residing in poor households exhibited lower initial levels of sAA, but not cortisol. African-American children showed slightly smaller decreases in cortisol over time. Initial levels of sAA predicted higher levels of internalizing behaviors at 36 months and both initial levels of and total change in sAA predicted higher levels of externalizing behaviors at 36 months. There was no evidence that sAA or cortisol mediated the relationship between poverty and later behavior problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Theories on children's depression, anxiety, and social anxiety note aspects of parenting such as acceptance/rejection and behavioral control. Despite these theoretical relations and high rates of comorbidity among children's internalizing symptoms, no studies have examined multiple aspects of parenting and children's symptoms of depression, anxiety, and social anxiety simultaneously. We examined mother- and child-reported mothers' parenting behaviors (acceptance/rejection and behavioral control) and their combined, independent, and specific relations with children's depression, anxiety, and social anxiety symptoms in a community sample of 124 mother-child dyads (children 10-12 years old). Children's report of maternal behavioral control was related to mothers' report of children's anxiety problems. Importantly, children's report of mothers' acceptance/rejection was an independent predictor of all three child-reported symptom types, and child- and/or mother-report of maternal acceptance/rejection was an independent predictor of mothers' report of children's anxiety and affective problems. After controlling for anxiety, social anxiety, and both together, children's perceived maternal acceptance/rejection emerged as a specific and unique predictor of children's depression symptoms. But, after controlling for depression, parenting behaviors were no longer related to children's anxiety and social anxiety. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed, as well as directions for future research.

AB The current report describes the results of the first known study examining the impact of parental deportation on the mental health of children using psychometrically reliable and valid assessment instruments. Participants reported on the current internalizing and externalizing problems of children under their care using the Spanish language version of the Child Behavior Checklist and completed a trauma history and demographic questionnaire that asked specifically about parental deportation status. Children with a deported parent (n = 23) were significantly more likely to display externalizing and internalizing problems than children whose parents were not deported or in the process of deportation (n = 52). Associated demographic characteristics and trauma history were controlled in these analyses. The results are discussed in the context of evolving immigration policy in the United States.

AB Research indicates that parents' methods of emotion socialization impact the development of their children's emotion expressivity, which, in turn, is implicated in the emergence of internalizing symptoms. Relatively little research, however, has examined the emotion socialization behaviors that mothers and fathers use to socialize their children's emotion regulation with respect to how these behaviors may differentially predict depressive symptoms in their sons and daughters. In the current study, the relations among these three variables were investigated by having mothers and fathers report on their children's dysregulation and regulation coping of anger and sadness. Sons and daughters reported on their perceived receipt of parents' responses to their anger and sadness expressivity, as well as their own depressive symptoms. Correlational analyses revealed that unsupportive responses to emotional expressivity were related to greater child emotion dysregulation, poorer emotion coping, and depressive symptoms. Moderation analyses revealed that, for both mothers and fathers, at high levels of unsupportive responses to emotions, children were perceived to have more anger dysregulation, less anger coping, less sadness coping, and more depressive symptoms. Regression analyses indicated that mothers' unsupportive responses to sadness and fathers' unsupportive responses to anger are associated with their children's depressive symptoms. These findings support the notion that mothers and fathers play unique roles in children's emotion regulation skills and subsequent risk for depression.

AB This study tested whether family income and stress in the parent-youth relationship might mediate links between parent symptoms and youth problems, and whether the process might differ for youth externalizing versus internalizing problems. We used a multiple mediation technique to test pathways by which family income and stress in the parent-child relationship might relate to parent-youth symptom associations in a sample of clinically-referred 7-13 year-olds (32 % female; M age = 10.16 years). Family income and stress jointly mediated the relation between parent symptoms and youth externalizing problems but not between parent symptoms and youth internalizing problems. Future longitudinal research should investigate whether low income and parent-youth stress may deplete the parental resources needed to manage youth externalizing behavior. This study extends existing literature by suggesting a specific pattern by which two identified risk factors for youth problems may operate jointly, and by showing specificity to externalizing problems.

AB Maternal depression relates to child internalizing outcomes, but one missing aspect of this association is how variation in depressive symptoms, including mild and moderate symptoms, relates to young children's outcomes. The current study examined a moderated mediation model to investigate how maternal behaviors may mediate this association in the context of child temperament and gender. Mothers and toddlers completed a free-play/clean-up task in the laboratory. Mothers rated their depressive symptoms and their toddlers' temperament and internalizing behaviors. Results indicated a significant indirect effect of maternal warmth on the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and toddler internalizing outcomes for boys with low negative emotionality. Toddler gender and temperament moderated the relation between maternal intrusiveness and toddler internalizing outcomes, but mediation was not supported. Results highlight the important interaction between child and maternal variables in predicting child outcomes, and suggest mechanisms by and conditions under which mild maternal depressive symptomatology can be a risk factor for toddler internalizing outcomes.

AB The objective of this study is to compare energetic expenditure in day-to-day activities among subjects with internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety), externalizing disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder) and healthy children and adolescents without any psychiatric diagnosis. One hundred and five (n = 105) students from a community sample were evaluated throughout a structured psychiatric interview and categorized into three groups: internalizing (n = 54), externalizing (n = 12) and typically developing controls (TDC, n = 39). Energetic expenditure was evaluated using 3-day physical activity record. Subjects with internalizing disorders performed activities with lower energetic expenditure as compared to those with externalizing disorders and TDC. Participants with externalizing disorders had more energetic expenditure variability. Our study suggests that internalizing disorders are associated with activities of low energetic expenditure in day-to-day activities, extending previous findings with physical exercise. These findings may further contribute to the understanding of the associated morbidity previously described in patients with internalizing disorders.

AB An ecological stress process model was employed to explore relations between children's exposures to family and community violence and child mental health, and emotionally-regulated coping (ERC) as a protective factor among Latino, European-American, and African-American school-aged children (n = 91; girls, n = 50[54 %]) living in single-parent families who were either homeless and residing in emergency shelters or housed but living in poverty. Mothers reported domestic violence experiences and their child's history of physical/sexual abuse, community violence exposures, and mental health. Children reported on exposure to community violence, internalizing symptoms, and coping. The mental health impacts of multi-level violence exposures and ERC as a moderator of associations between violence exposures and child mental health was tested with structural equation modeling. Family abuse was uniquely associated with PTSD, and community violence with anxiety and aggression. Latent interaction tests revealed that ERC moderated relations between family abuse and anxiety, aggression and PTSD. Emotionally-regulated coping appears to play a protective role for children's mental health in contexts of violence exposure, offering opportunities for intervention and prevention.

AB Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability for the onset of internalizing psychopathology. Characterizing developmental patterns of symptom stability, progression, and co-occurrence is important in order to identify adolescents most at risk for persistent problems. We use latent growth curve modeling to characterize developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms and four classes of anxiety symptoms (GAD, physical symptoms, separation anxiety, and social anxiety) across early adolescence, prospective associations of depression and anxiety trajectories with one another, and variation in trajectories by gender. A diverse sample of early adolescents (N = 1 065) was assessed at three time points across a one-year period. All classes of anxiety symptoms declined across the study period and depressive symptoms remained stable. In between-individual analysis, adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms experienced less decline over time in symptoms of physical, social, and separation anxiety. Consistent associations were observed between depression and anxiety symptom trajectories within-individuals over time, such that adolescents who experienced a higher level of a specific symptom type than would be expected given their overall symptom trajectory were more likely to experience a later deflection from their average trajectory in other symptoms. Within-individual deflections in GAD, physical, and social symptoms predicted later deflections in depressive symptoms, and deflections in depressive symptoms predicted later deflections in GAD and separation anxiety symptoms. Females had higher levels of symptoms than males, but no evidence was found for variation in symptom trajectories or their associations with one another by gender or by age.

AB Emotional variability reflects the ability to flexibly switch among a broad range of positive and negative emotions from moment-to-moment during interactions. Emotional variability during mother-adolescent conflict interactions is considered to be important for healthy socio-emotional functioning of mothers and adolescents. The current observational study examined whether dyadic emotional variability, maternal emotional variability, and adolescent emotional variability during conflict interactions in early adolescence predicted mothers' and adolescents' internalizing problems five years later. We used data from 92 mother-adolescent dyads (Mage T1 = 13.05; 65.20 % boys) who were videotaped at T1 while discussing a conflict. Emotional variability was derived from these conflict interactions and it was observed for mother-adolescent dyads, mothers and adolescents separately. Mothers and adolescents also completed questionnaires in early adolescence (T1) and five years later in late adolescence (T6) on mothers' internalizing problems, and adolescents' anxiety and depressive symptoms. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that less dyadic emotional variability in early adolescence predicted relative increases in mothers' internalizing problems, adolescents' depressive symptoms, and adolescents' anxiety symptoms from early to late adolescence. Less maternal emotional variability only predicted relative increases in adolescents' anxiety symptoms over time. The emotional valence (e.g., types of emotions expressed) of conflict interactions did not moderate the results. Taken together, findings highlighted the importance of considering limited emotional variability during conflict interactions in the development, prevention, and treatment of internalizing problems of mothers and adolescents.

AB Driven by the social development model, this study examines the associations of family functioning, school climate, and internalizing symptoms with disordered eating attitudes in early adolescence. Results from a representative sample of 848 sixth- and seventh-grade students indicate that disordered eating attitudes are positively correlated with family conflict and maternal psychological control and perceived friction and competition among classmates, in addition to female gender, depressive symptoms and social anxiety. Contrary to our hypotheses, perceived cohesion among classmates is positively associated with disordered eating attitudes. These findings highlight the importance of interpersonal relationships at the school and family level, as well as internalizing symptoms, in shaping disordered eating attitudes during adolescence.

AB The popularity of communication technologies such as text messaging, e-mail, instant messaging, and social networking sites has grown exponentially, especially among adolescents. At the scale of growth along with the pressures and normative use of communication technology, psychological effects of these technologies need to be further assessed.
   The purpose of this study was to determine if technology usage and preference for using communication technology in social situations are related to adolescent development in regard to peer relationships, identity development, and psychological adjustment.
   Participants (N = 268; 69 % female; 81.9 % White) from three public high schools were surveyed in their classroom.
   Time spent using communication technology was associated with less relationship avoidance, but greater internalizing symptom severity, identity distress, existential anxiety, and peer aggression. Preference for using technology for interpersonal communication was associated with greater peer aggression, relationship anxiety, and existential anxiety. Those with a preoccupied attachment style (high in relationship anxiety, but low in relationship avoidance) reported the most time using communication technology. Communication technology usage was not related to identity exploration, commitment, or status, but it did predict psychological symptom severity over and above the identity and relationship variables.
   Communication technology usage was found to be related to identity and relationship problems, and was linked to greater maladjustment, even after controlling for identity and relationship difficulties.

AB Bullying behavior is related to higher levels of internalizing distress and can be defined as including three aspects: frequency, intentionality, and power differential. However, bullying behavior is most often measured using only one aspect: frequency.
   The current study investigated the relative importance of several important constructs associated with bullying and their relations to social-emotional outcomes. Specifically, three aspects of bullying behavior were assessed: frequency, intentionality, and power differential.
   The relations between these aspects of victims of bullying and social-emotional outcomes were investigated in a sample of 612 7th and 8th grade students in a large suburban middle school.
   Results showed that power differential and intentionality meaningfully contributed to anxiety, depression, and self-esteem over and above frequency.
   Our findings demonstrate strong support for the utility of assessing power differential and intentionality along with frequency of victimization experiences, as there was predictive power in intentionality and power differential above and beyond frequency in relation to concurrent levels of anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

AB This study examined the extent to which family dinnertime rituals serve a protective role for families experiencing high levels of stress. Using data from a longitudinal study of working-class couples, the role of dinnertime rituals as a moderator of mothers' and fathers' parenting stress and child psychosocial outcomes was investigated. Greater dinnertime rituals reported by fathers moderated the effect of parenting stress on internalizing problems for girls, but not for boys. Fathers' reports of dinnertime rituals were related to fewer behavioral symptoms, internalizing problems and externalizing problems, and greater adaptive skills for girls. No significant interaction effects for mothers' parenting stress or rituals were found, but there were significant main effects of mothers' parenting stress and dinnertime rituals on child outcomes. These findings suggest that dinnertime rituals can potentially moderate the effects of parenting stress on child outcomes and fathers and daughters showed the greatest benefits of these family practices.

AB Children's sleep problems are common and associated with increased risk for adjustment problems. We examined daily links between children's sleep and mood, using a daily diary method and actigraphy. We also tested children's daily mood as a mediator of relations among sleep and children's broader internalizing and externalizing symptoms. A community sample of 142 children (mean age=10.69years; 57% girls; 69% European American, 31% African American) and their parents participated. For 1week, children wore actigraphs and parents completed a daily telephone interview about their child's mood. Following the week of actigraphy, mothers and fathers reported on their child's adjustment. Multi-level models indicated within-person relations between children's mood and subsequent sleep fragmentation (indicated by increased activity) and sleep latency, and between-person relations between sleep latency and subsequent mood on the next day. Significant indirect effects were found such that a more negative daily mood (aggregated across diary days) mediated relations between poor sleep efficiency and longer sleep latency and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Findings extend previous research by highlighting disruptions to children's daily mood as a potential mechanism linking sleep problems to children's mental health.

AB While research has shown that sleep problems and substance use are reciprocally associated in adults, much less is known about this association in early adolescence. The main aim of the current longitudinal study was to explore bidirectional relationships between sleep problems, substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems in young adolescents. A prospective design was used incorporating two waves (approximately 1 year interval). A total of 555 young adolescents (290 females, M age = 13.96) participated in this study. All participants completed self-report measures in classrooms during regular school hours (questionnaires about sleep quality and sleep hygiene were used to measure sleep problems). The results indicated that sleep problems predicted changes in substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems over time, but problem behaviours did not predict changes in sleep problems, adjusted for gender, age and puberty. One exception was that alcohol use negatively predicted changes in sleep problems. This study suggests that sleep problems are important precursors of substance use, internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence.

AB We report findings of two exploratory validation studies of a revised instrument: the Student Risk Screening Scale for Early Childhood version (SRSS-EC). The SRSS-EC was modified to reflect characteristics of externalizing and internalizing behaviors manifested by preschool-age children. In Study 1, we explored the reliability of SRSS-IE (Student Risk Screening Scale-Internalizing and Externalizing) 14 scores by examining item-level data, internal consistency, and factor structure using exploratory factor analysis with 489 preschool-age students. Results supported retention of 11 items, resulting in the SRSS-EC 11 (with SRSS-EC E7 externalizing subscale and SRSS-EC I4 internalizing subscale). Next, we established convergent validity of the SRSS-EC 11 with two well-established screening tools: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Early Screening Project. In Study 2, we reported findings of a confirmatory factor analysis and a subsequent convergent validity study with 737 preschool-age students to determine generalizability. We offered limitations and future directions.

AB Coercive control is a relationship dynamic that is theorized to be key for understanding physical intimate partner violence (IPV). This research examines how coercive control in the context of physical IPV may influence child adjustment. Participants were 107 mothers and their children, aged 7 to 10 years. In each family, mothers reported the occurrence of at least one act of physical IPV in the past 6 months. Mothers reported on physical IPV and coercive control, and mothers and children reported on children's externalizing and internalizing problems. Coercive control in the context of physical IPV related positively with both mothers' and children's reports of child externalizing and internalizing problems, after accounting for the frequency of physical IPV, psychological abuse, and mothers' education. This research suggests that couple relationship dynamics underlying physical IPV are potentially important for understanding how physical IPV leads to child adjustment problems.

AB Objective: The Affordable Care Act provides funding for home-visiting programs to reduce health care disparities, despite limited evidence that existing programs can overcome implementation and evaluation challenges with at-risk populations. The authors report 36-month outcomes of the paraprofessional-delivered Family Spirit home-visiting intervention for American Indian teen mothers and children.
   Method: Expectant American Indian teens (N=322, mean age=18.1 years) from four southwestern reservation communities were randomly assigned to the Family Spirit intervention Plus optimized standard care or optimized standard care alone. Maternal and child outcomes were evaluated at 28 and 36 weeks gestation and 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months postpartum.
   Results: At baseline the mothers had high rates of substance use (>84%), depressive symptoms (>32%), dropping out of school (>57%), and residential instability (51%). Study retention was >= 83%. From pregnancy to 36 months postpartum, mothers in the intervention group had significantly greater parenting knowledge (effect size=0.42) and parental locus of control (effect size=0.17), fewer depressive symptoms (effect size=0.16) and externalizing problems (effect size=0.14), and lower past month use of marijuana (odds ratio=0.65) and illegal drugs (odds ratio=0.67). Children in the intervention group had fewer externalizing (effect size=0.23), internalizing (effect size=0.23), and dysregulation (effect size=0.27) problems.
   Conclusions: The paraprofessional home-visiting intervention promoted effective parenting, reduced maternal risks, and improved child developmental outcomes in the U.S. population subgroup with the fewest resources and highest behavioral health disparities. The methods and results can inform federal efforts to disseminate and sustain evidence-based home-visiting interventions in at-risk populations.

AB Methylmercury (MeHg) is a neurotoxicant and may have an adverse impact on child behavior. However, this impact was found to be inconsistent in fish-eating populations. Although the positive effects of the nutrients provided by a fish diet may overcome the effect of MeHg, the possibility of genetic variants influencing an individual's response to MeHg has also been discussed. The role of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele (epsilon 4) on MeHg related neurotoxicity is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of APOE variants in the relationship between cord blood mercury (Hg) and child behavior.
   A total of 166 subjects were recruited at delivery, and their cord blood was collected for laboratory analyses of Hg and the APOE genotype. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was administered to the subjects when they reached the age of two years.
   An increase in cord blood Hg concentrations in APOE epsilon 4 carriers was consistently associated with an increased score for all CBCL syndromes. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the group of epsilon 4 carriers with an elevated cord blood Hg concentration had significantly higher scores in the syndrome categories of general internalizing, emotionally reactive, and anxiety/depression as well as CBCL total scores. Furthermore, general externalizing and aggressive syndromes were borderline significantly higher in this group. In conclusion, we suggest that APOE may modify the toxicity of MeHg. APOE epsilon 4 carriers may be more vulnerable to the effects of MeHg on child behavior at the age of two years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Compared to youths who believe that personal traits are malleable, those who believe that personal traits are fixed experience more academic and self-regulatory distress. Recently, studies have begun to explore relations between beliefs about the malleability of personal traits, or implicit theories, and youth mental health problems. We synthesized this emerging body of research in youths (ages 4-19) across 45 effect sizes from 17 research reports. Studies were included if they assessed youth mental health and implicit theories and did not manipulate implicit theory or affective/behavioral states prior to measuring these variables. Our random-effects meta-analysis using clustered data analysis techniques (i.e., effect sizes nested within samples) revealed that youths holding entity theories the belief that personal traits are fixed showed more pronounced mental health problems. This association between entity theories and mental health problems was evident across methodological factors and problem types (internalizing versus externalizing; psychopathology versus general distress). Limitations include the small number of eligible studies, insufficient data to test further demographic moderators, and few longitudinal studies on this topic. Overall, findings support the value of parsing the implicit theory-mental health link in youths. Implicit theories may prove to be promising targets for treatment and prevention of youth mental health problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research SummaryWe use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,197) to consider the heterogeneous effects of maternal incarceration on 9-year-old children. We find that maternal incarceration has no average effects on child wellbeing (measured by caregiver-reported internalizing problem behaviors, caregiver-reported externalizing problem behaviors, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Third Edition scores, and child-reported early juvenile delinquency) but that the effects vary by mothers' propensities for experiencing incarceration. Maternal incarceration is deleterious for children of mothers least likely to experience incarceration but mostly inconsequential for children of mothers more likely to experience incarceration.
   Policy ImplicationsIt is important that public policies take into account the fact that not all children experience similar effects of maternal incarceration. For children of mothers who are unlikely to experience incarceration, the negative consequences of maternal incarceration could be driven by at least three factors, all of which may operate simultaneously and all of which potentially call for different policy interventions: (a) jail incarceration as opposed to prison incarceration, (b) incarceration for a crime that did minimalor noharm to their children, and (c) inadequate family supports for coping with maternal incarceration. We discuss these policy implications.

AB BackgroundPrenatal maternal depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms have been found to be associated with child and adolescent behavior problems. In this paper, we investigate their impact on behavior problems and depressive symptoms in adulthood.
   MethodsParticipants included 3,099 mother-offspring pairs from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), an Australian based, prebirth cohort study. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) with parallel processes to identify trajectories of maternal depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms over four time periods between the mothers' first clinic visit and 5 years postpregnancy. We fitted the estimates from the maternal trajectories in multivariate logistic regression models to predict internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 21. We adjusted for a wide range of prenatal and postnatal factors, including maternal life events, relationship quality, contact with the new born, as well as concurrent maternal depressive and anxious symptoms and father's history of mental health problem.
   ResultsLCGA found seven groups of mothers; one group of mothers exhibited high levels of depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms during pregnancy but not at later time points. Their offspring experienced increased levels of behavior problems and depressive symptoms.
   ConclusionsThis paper provides the first evidence that high levels of maternal subjective depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms experienced in early pregnancy may predict internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and depressive symptoms in young adults.

   DIURNAL CORTISOL; ALLOSTATIC LOAD; SEX-DIFFERENCES; LIFE EVENTS
AB Cross-sectional research suggests that individuals at risk for internalizing disorders show differential activation levels and/or dynamics of stress-sensitive physiological systems, possibly reflecting a process of stress sensitization. However, there is little longitudinal research to clarify how the development of these systems over time relates to activation during acute stress, and how aspects of such activation map onto internalizing symptoms. We investigated children's (n = 107) diurnal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity via salivary cortisol (morning and evening levels) across 29 assessments spanning 6+ years, and related longitudinal patterns to acute stress responses at the end of this period (age 9-10). Associations with child psychiatric symptoms at age 10 were also examined to determine internalizing risk profiles. Increasing morning cortisol levels across assessments predicted less of a cortisol decline following interpersonal stress at age 9, and higher cortisol levels during performance stress at age 10. These same profiles of high and/or sustained cortisol elevation during psychosocial stress were associated with child anxiety symptoms. Results suggest developmental sensitization to stress-reflected in rising morning cortisol and eventual hyperactivation during acute stress exposure-may distinguish children at risk for internalizing disorders.

TI Maternal and Childhood Psychological Factors Predict Chronic Disabling
   Fatigue at Age 13 Years

AB Purpose: To investigate whether premorbid maternal and childhood psychological problems are risk factors for chronic disabling fatigue at age 13 years among children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort.
   Methods: Chronic disabling fatigue was defined as fatigue of at least 3-month, and up to 5-year, duration that prevented school attendance or hobbies/sport/leisure activities, and for which other causes were not identified. Maternal psychological factors were symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed up to eight times between pregnancy and age 6 years. We investigated critical periods for maternal effects and effects of paternal depression at three time points. Child psychological factors included internalizing and externalizing problems and upsetting life events occurring at age 7-8 years.
   Results: Of 5,657 children, 110 (1.9%) had chronic disabling fatigue at age 13 years. Maternal anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.31 per episode), maternal depression (AOR, 1.24; CI, 1.11-1.39 per episode), child psychological problems (AOR, 1.19; CI, 1.00-1.41 per problem), and upsetting events (AOR, 1.22; CI,.99-1.58 per event) were associated with chronic disabling fatigue. Associations of child psychological problems and upsetting events were attenuated (AOR, 1.12; CI,.93-1.33 per problem; AOR, 1.19; CI,.94-1.52 per event) after further adjusting for maternal anxiety and depression.
   Conclusions: Pediatricians need to be aware that children whose mothers experience anxiety and/ or depression between pregnancy and child's age 6 years have an increased risk of developing chronic disabling fatigue in early adolescence. Conversely, clinicians need to be alert to fatigue in children whose mothers have longstanding anxiety and depression. These findings suggest the importance of family-based approaches to treatment.

AB BackgroundGiven mixed findings as to whether stressful experiences and relationships are associated with increases or decreases in children's cortisol reactivity, we tested whether a child's developmental history of risk exposure explained variation in cortisol reactivity to an experimentally induced task. We also tested whether the relationship between cortisol reactivity and children's internalizing and externalizing problems varied as a function of their developmental history of stressful experiences and relationships.
   MethodParticipants included 400 children (M=9.99years, SD=0.74years) from the Children's Experiences and Development Study. Early risk exposure was measured by children's experiences of harsh, nonresponsive parenting at 3years. Recent risk exposure was measured by children's exposure to traumatic events in the past year. Children's cortisol reactivity was measured in response to a social provocation task and parents and teachers described children's internalizing and externalizing problems.
   ResultsThe effect of recent exposure to traumatic events was partially dependent upon a child's early experiences of harsh, nonresponsive parenting: the more traumatic events children had recently experienced, the greater their cortisol reactivity if they had experienced lower (but not higher) levels of harsh, nonresponsive parenting at age 3. The lowest levels of cortisol reactivity were observed among children who had experienced the most traumatic events in the past year and higher (vs. lower) levels of harsh, nonresponsive parenting in early childhood. Among youth who experienced harsh, nonresponsive parent-child relationships in early childhood and later traumatic events, lower levels of cortisol reactivity were associated with higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems.
   ConclusionsHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity to psychological stressors and the relationship between HPA axis reactivity and children's internalizing and externalizing problems vary as a function of a child's developmental history of exposure to stressful relationships and experiences.

AB This study examined the mediating effect of parents' psychological aggression in the relationship between parenting stress and children's internalizing (anxiety/depression, withdrawal) and externalizing (aggression, delinquency) problem behaviors 1 year later. Using a sample of 311 intact 2-parent Chinese families with preschoolers, findings revealed that maternal parenting stress had direct effects on children's internalizing and externalizing problem behavior and indirect effects through maternal psychological aggression. However, neither direct nor indirect effects of fathers' parenting stress on children's internalizing and externalizing problem behavior were found. The findings highlight the importance of simultaneously studying the effects of both mothers' and fathers' parenting on their children within a family systems framework.

   PERSPECTIVES
AB Using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we examined children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems from age 5 to 15 years in relation to whether they had experienced a parental divorce. Children from divorced families had more behavior problems compared with a propensity-score-matched sample of children from intact families, according to both teachers and mothers. They exhibited more internalizing and externalizing problems at the first assessment after the parents' separation and at the last available assessment (age 11 years for teacher reports, or 15 years for mother reports). Divorce also predicted both short-term and long-term rank-order increases in behavior problems. Associations between divorce and child behavior problems were moderated by family income (assessed before the divorce) such that children from families with higher incomes prior to the separation had fewer internalizing problems than children from families with lower incomes prior to the separation. Higher levels of predivorce maternal sensitivity and child IQ also functioned as protective factors for children of divorce. Mediation analyses showed that children were more likely to exhibit behavior problems after the divorce if their postdivorce home environment was less supportive and stimulating, their mother was less sensitive and more depressed, and their household income was lower. We discuss avenues for intervention, particularly efforts to improve the quality of home environments in divorced families.

AB This study examined how self and parental ratings of trait emotional intelligence (trait El), relate to self and parental ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems. A total of 263 adolescents between 13 and 17 years and their parents participated in the study, completing two forms of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue-AF and TEIQue-360 degrees) and the Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL-YSR and CBCL-parents' report). Results revealed a strong correspondence between father and mother ratings, especially for externalizing problems. A doubly MANOVA, with gender as the between-subjects variable, rating source (father, mother, and adolescent) as the within-subjects variable, and the four trait El factors as dependent variables revealed a significant effect of ratings. Both fathers and mothers attributed higher Well-being and Self-control to their children than the children attributed to themselves. The findings showed that while multisource ratings of trait El generally converge, they are differentially predictive of external criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Moderating effects of family factors on the association between children's reinforcement sensitivity and problem behaviour have been examined in a community sample of 533 children aged from 3 to 17years. Family type and living in urban areas exacerbated the effect of sensitivity to reward on externalizing, internalizing and impact of problems on everyday life; a high level of the father's education exacerbated the effect of sensitivity to reward on externalizing; family aggression and harsh parenting were found to strengthen the link between sensitivity to reward and the impact of problems on everyday life, whereas family cohesion buffered the negative effect of sensitivity to reward on externalizing and the impact of problems in everyday life.

AB Background. Knowledge of long-term health related outcomes in contemporary populations born extremely preterm (EP) is scarce. We aimed to explore developmental trajectories of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior from mid-childhood to early adulthood in extremely pretermand term-born individuals.
   Methods. Subjects born at gestational age <= 28 weeks or with birth weight <= 1,000 g within a region of Norway in 1991-92 and matched term-born control subjects were assessed at 10 and 18 years. HRQoL was measured with the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and behavior with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), using parent assessment at both ages and self-assessment at 18 years.
   Results. All eligible EP (n = 35) and control children participated at 10 years, and 31 (89%) and 29 (83%) at 18 years. At 10 years, the EP born boys were given significantly poorer scores by their parents than term-born controls on most CHQ and CBCL scales, but the differences were minor at 18 years; i.e., significant improvements had occurred in several CHQ (self-esteem, general health and parental impact-time) and CBCL (total problem, internalizing and anxious/depressed) scales. For the girls, the differences were smaller at 10 years and remained unchanged by 18 years. Emotional/behavioral difficulties at 10 years similarly predicted poorer improvement on CHQ-scales for both EP and term-born subjects at 18 years. Self-assessment of HRQoL and behavior at 18 years was similar in the EP and term-born groups on most scales.
   Conclusions. HRQoL and behavior improved towards adulthood for EP born boys, while the girls remained relatively similar, and early emotional and behavioral difficulties predicted poorer development in HRQoL through adolescence. These data indicate that gender and a longitudinal perspective should be considered when addressing health and wellbeing after extremely pretermbirth.

AB The development of sleep-wake regulation in infants depends upon brain maturation as well as various environmental factors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate sleep duration and quality as a function of child attachment to the mother. One hundred and thirty-four mother-child dyads enrolled in the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) project were included in this study. Attachment was assessed with the Strange Situation procedure at 36months and maternal sleep reports were collected at 6, 12, 24 and 36months. Differences in sleep characteristics were assessed with mixed models with one factor (attachment group) and one repeated measure (age). Children classified as disorganized had a significantly lower duration of nocturnal sleep, went to bed later, signaled more awakenings, had shorter periods of uninterrupted sleep (only at 12months) and had shorter periods of time in bed (only at 6months) than children classified as secure and/or ambivalent (p<0.05). This is the first study to show that children with insecure disorganized attachment present a distinct sleep pattern in comparison with those with secure or ambivalent attachment between 6 and 36months of age. Sleep disturbances could exacerbate difficulties in these families that are already considered vulnerable.

AB This longitudinal study examines links among adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms, the prenatal environment (e.g., nicotine exposure) and pre/perinatal maternal health, and cardiovascular risk factors. Girls (N = 262) ages 11-17 reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors and mothers reported about the prenatal environment and maternal health during pregnancy and 3 months post-pregnancy. Adolescent cardiovascular risk included adiposity, smoking, blood pressure, and salivary C-reactive protein. Internalizing symptoms mediated relations between prenatal exposures/maternal health and adiposity; externalizing symptoms mediated relations between prenatal exposures and adolescent smoking. Health care providers who attend to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in girls may ultimately influence cardiovascular health, especially among those with pre/perinatal risk factors.

AB The purpose of this pilot study was to determine both the feasibility and effects of music therapy on children who have been exposed to ongoing child abuse and poverty in South Korea. Four out of the 42 children, who had been identified as being exposed to the ongoing child maltreatment and poverty with marked behavioural problems, were randomly selected to receive once a week individual music therapy for 15 consecutive sessions. Both standardized measurements and behavioural observation were used to establish the effects and feasibility of music therapy. While the descriptive statistics for the mean scores of the pooled results were considerably reduced after music therapy in every measure, indicating overall improvements in both internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems, there was a conspicuous variability in individual scores that contradicted the group results. Effect sizes of change scores for most sub-scales were medium to large, however these were non-significant. The preferred musical activities of the children were recorded, as well as their behavioural and musical characteristics. The overall quantitative and observational findings are generally in support of music therapy intervention for children in this study, highlighting the importance of careful consideration for both the implementation of music therapy programmes and the interpretation of results.

AB Children of incarcerated mothers are at increased risk for social and emotional difficulties, yet few studies have investigated potential mechanisms of risk within this population. This research simultaneously examined the association of children's experience of incarceration-specific risk factors (e.g., witness mother's arrest) and environmental risks (e.g., low educational attainment) to children's psychological maladaptation using a multi-informant design and a latent variable analytic approach. Participants were 117 currently incarcerated mothers (64.1% African American), their 151 children (53.6% boys, M age=9.8 years, range=6-12 years, 61.7% African American), and the 118 caregivers (74.8% female, 61.9% grandparents, 62.2% African American) of the children. Mothers, children, and caregivers each provided accounts of children's experiences related to maternal incarceration and children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Mothers and caregivers each supplied information about 10 environmental risk factors. Findings from structural equation modeling indicate that children's incarceration-specific risk experiences predict internalizing and externalizing behavior problems whereas the influence of environmental risks was negligible. Follow-up analyses examining the contribution of specific risks indicate that significant predictors differ by reporter and separate into effects of family incarceration history and direct experiences of maternal incarceration. Incarceration-specific experiences place children at higher risk for maladjustment than exposure to general environmental risk factors. These findings indicate the need to critically examine children's exposure to experiences related to maternal incarceration and family incarceration history to help to clarify the multifaceted stressor of maternal incarceration.

AB This study examined the moderating effects of family cohesion on the relationship between community violence and child internalizing and externalizing problems at age 18. The study sample consisted of 728 children and families who were part of the Infant Health and Development Program, an intervention study for low-birthweight, preterm infants. Six of eight sites in the Infant Health and Development Program were in large metropolitan areas; two served rural and urban areas. About half of the sample was African American. Research teams collected data from caregivers multiple times in the first 3 years of the target child's life, and at 4, 5, 61/2, 8, and 18 years. Caregivers reported on community violence, neighborhood problems with (a) drug users/sellers; (b) delinquent gangs; and (c) crime, assaults, and burglaries reports when children were 4, 5, and 8 years of age. Family cohesion was assessed twice, at ages 61/2 and 8 years, using caregiver reports on the Family Environment Scale. Adolescent self-report of Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Problems at age 18 were assessed using the Behavior Problems Index. In this study, the association between adolescent psychosocial outcomes and community violence were moderated by family cohesion and gender such that being in a highly cohesive family as a child protected male children from the negative effects of community violence. Findings demonstrate the long-term protective effects of family cohesion on child behavioral development for male children but suggest a need to examine additional supports for females exposed to community violence during childhood.

AB Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality among undergraduates represent important public health issues. This analysis identified risk factors that distinguished 3 groups, those who reported no history of self-harm; self-injury, but no suicide attempts (NSSI only); and self-injury and a suicide attempt (NSSI + SA) in the past year. Methods: Data came from 16,044 undergraduates who completed the Fall 2010 National College Health Assessment. Results: Over 3% of students reported NSSI, and one third of these individuals also attempted suicide. Factors that distinguished the NSSI only and NSSI + SA groups from the no self-harm group included current depressive symptoms, nonheterosexual orientation, an eating disorder/extreme weight control behavior, and diagnosis of an internalizing disorder. Factors that distinguished the NSSI + SA group from the NSSI only group were current depressive symptoms and diagnosis of an internalizing disorder. Conclusions: Students experiencing mental health problems demonstrate increased risk for NSSI and/or suicidal behavior.

AB Facial emotion-recognition difficulties have been reported in school-aged children with behavior problems; little is known, however, about either this association in preschool children or with regard to vocal emotion recognition. The current study explored the association between facial and vocal emotion recognition and behavior problems in a sample of 3 to 6-year-old children. A sample of 57 children enriched for risk of behavior problems (41 were recruited from the general population while 16 had been referred for behavior problems to local clinics) were each presented with a series of vocal and facial stimuli expressing different emotions (i.e., angry, happy, and sad) of low and high intensity. Parents rated children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Vocal and facial emotion recognition accuracy was negatively correlated with externalizing but not internalizing behavior problems independent of emotion type. The effects with the externalizing domain were independently associated with hyperactivity rather than conduct problems. The results highlight the importance of using vocal as well as facial stimuli when studying the relationship between emotion-recognition and behavior problems. Future studies should test the hypothesis that difficulties in responding to adult instructions and commands seen in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be due to deficits in the processing of vocal emotions.

AB Reintegration after military deployment is a significant family stressor. Guided by Eisenberg's heuristic model of socialization of emotions, the present study examined the relationships between parental emotion socialization, children's emotionality and children's internalizing symptoms using a military sample. It was also investigated whether gender of parents and children impacted parental emotion socialization. Questionnaires were gathered from 248 families with a 4-12 year old child (M = 7.78) in which a parent had been deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. Children's emotionality was positively correlated with children's internalizing symptoms and non-supportive parental emotion socialization. Independent-t-tests and two-way ANOVAs showed that mothers reported more supportive reactions towards children's negative emotions than fathers. Father reports of expressive encouragement were positively associated with child reports of anxiety and depression. Child gender did not influence how parents responded to negative emotions. Implications and future directions were discussed.

AB Background: Although excessive fears are common in preschool children, validated assessment tools for this age are lacking. Our aim was to modify and provide preliminary evidence of the utility of a preschoolers' fear screening tool, a parent-reported Fear Survey Schedule for Preschool Children (FSS-PC).
   Methods: 109 Israeli preschool children (aged 4-6 years) with chronic night time fears (NF) and 30 healthy children (controls) participated. The FSS-PC analysis included: 1) internal reliability, 2) correlations between FSS-PC scores and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) measures, 3) differences between NF and a comparison sample of FSS-PC scores, and 4) FSS-PC sensitivity in detecting change in NF following an intervention for NF.
   Results: There were low-to-medium positive correlations between the FSS-PC scores and several internalizing scales of the CBCL measures. FSS-PC scores in the NF group were significantly higher than the control children's score. FSS-PC scores had adequate internal reliability and were also sensitive for detecting significant changes in fear levels following behavioral interventions.
   Limitations: Unique cultural and environmental circumstances and specific study group.
   Conclusions: This new version of the FSS-PC may provide clinicians with a novel and useful screening tool for early assessment of fear- and anxiety-related phenomena of preschool children.

AB The present study investigated Muslim American mothers' perceptions of and reactive actions to child behavior problems, as well as factors (type of problem, severity of problem, religiosity, acculturation, and child gender) associated with their perceptions and reactive actions. Twenty Muslim American mothers having a child between the ages of 4 and 18 responded to four vignettes created by crossing the two dimensions of problem type (internalizing and externalizing) and problem severity (low and moderate), as well as to demographic, religiosity, and acculturation measures. Type and severity of behavior problem had significant relationships with mothers' perceptions of seriousness, level of worriedness, and unusualness. Religiosity and acculturation were not associated with mothers' perceptions but were associated with some reactive actions. Also, the participants tended to turn for help to nonprofessional (e.g., family and friends) sources more than to fellow community members and medical/mental health professionals. Implications of the results for community-based education and intervention programs are considered.

AB Purpose: In this study we aimed to examine the outcome of children's severe psychiatric disorders from preschool into later childhood and adolescence.
   Method: Forty preschool children (28 boys and 12 girls) treated in a tertiary referral mental health center, evaluated at admission and 5.5 +/- 1.2 years thereafter.
   Results: Seven (58.3%) children diagnosed with internalizing disorders at baseline were free of any psychiatric diagnosis at follow-up (p=0.02). Conversely, only one child (8.3%) diagnosed with comorbid disruptive-internalizing disorders at baseline was free of any psychiatric disorder at follow-up (p=1.0). Seven (43.7%) children diagnosed with disruptive disorders at baseline were free of psychiatric diagnoses at follow-up (p=0.02).
   Limitations: The small sample size and naturalistic nature of the study.
   Conclusion: The trajectories of severe psychiatric disorders at preschool years are similar to those reported in community samples and differ according to the baseline diagnosis. Children with internalizing disorders show a much better recovery rate than those with comorbid disruptive and internalizing disorders.

AB In this article the authors present a review of previous reviews and meta-analyses, identifying and summarizing the empirical research base on risk and protective factors for future psychosocial problems-specifically externalizing and internalizing problems-among preschool children. The authors also discuss risk and protective factors in the framework of concepts such as evidence-based practice, risk-focused prevention and treatment, and the Risk, Need, and Responsivity principles. They conclude that there is an extensive amount of research on risk and protective factors for preschool children that could and should be used by well educated professionals to help children to a better life.

AB Background: The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a widely used self-report questionnaire for the assessment of anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents with well documented predictive validity of the total score and subscales in internalizing and mixed clinical samples. However, no data exist on the screening efficiency in an inpatient sample of adolescents. Aim: To examine the psychometric properties and screening efficiency of the MASC in a high comorbid inpatient sample. Method: The current study used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to investigate the predictive value of the MASC total and subscale scores for the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-age children Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), DSM-IV diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and social phobia (SoP) in a highly comorbid inpatient sample of adolescents (11-18 years). Results: The MASC total score predicted any anxiety disorder (AD) and GAD moderately well. Physical symptoms predicted GAD moderately well. Social anxiety and separation anxiety/panic did not predict SoP or SAD, respectively. Physical symptoms and harm avoidance also predicted the presence of major depressive disorder. Conclusions: The findings support the utility of the MASC total score to predict the presence of any AD and GAD. However, the utility of the social anxiety and separation anxiety/panic subscales showed limited utility to predict the presence of SAD and SoP, respectively. The MASC has probably a more limited function in screening for AD among a highly comorbid inpatient sample of severely affected adolescents. Our results should be interpreted in the light of a small, mixed sample of inpatient adolescents.

AB Objective. To investigate the psychological outcome and the agreement between self-ratings and proxy-ratings in young individuals after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods. Twenty pairs of former patients who sustained a severe TBI in their adolescence or early adulthood and their significant others (SOs) were contacted around 66 months after injury to complete a measure of psychological and behavioral problems. The Adult Self-Report 18-59 and the Adult Behavior Checklist 18-59 were used. Results. Results showed significant differences compared to the normative sample in the domains withdrawal, attention, and intrusive and internalizing problems. Good or excellent levels of agreement were found between the self-rating and the proxy-rating in overt areas such as somatic complaints and aggressive and intrusive behavior. Fair or poor levels of agreement were found in nonovert areas such as anxiety and depression, withdrawal, thought and attention problems, and personal strength. Conclusion. The findings show that young patients experience psychological dysfunction. Our study suggests that the use of either a self-rating or a proxy-rating would be appropriate for evaluating overt domains, regarding the good to excellent levels of agreement. However, in nonovert domains, such as withdrawal and attention, an additional proxy-rating from a SO could provide supplementary information and build a more complete objective assessment.

AB Survivors of moderate-severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are at risk for long-term cognitive, emotional, and behavioural problems. This prospective cohort study investigated self-reported executive, emotional, and behavioural problems in the late chronic phase of moderate and severe TBI, if demographic characteristics (i.e., age, years of education), injury characteristics (Glasgow Coma Scale score, MRI findings such as traumatic axonal injury (TAI), or duration of posttraumatic amnesia), symptoms of depression, or neuropsychological variables in the first year after injury predicted long-term self-reported function. Self-reported executive, emotional, and behavioural functioning were assessed among individuals with moderate and severe TBI (N = 67, age range 15-65 years at time of injury) 2-5 years after TBI, compared to a healthy matched control group (N = 72). Results revealed significantly more attentional, emotional regulation, and psychological difficulties in the TBI group than controls. Demographic and early clinical variables were associated with poorer cognitive and emotional outcome. Fewer years of education and depressive symptoms predicted greater executive dysfunction. Younger age at injury predicted more aggressive and rule-breaking behaviour. TAI and depressive symptoms predicted Internalizing problems and greater executive dysfunction. In conclusion, age, education, TAI, and depression appear to elevate risk for poor long-term outcome, emphasising the need for long-term follow-up of patients presenting with risk factors.

AB Background: The psychological strain of migrants has been increasingly discussed in recent years. A special emphasis should be put on adolescents of second-generation immigrants, as they account for one third of the immigrant population in Germany. Objective: What is the degree of behavioral and emotional problems among Turkish migrant and German adolescents? Do perceived discrimination and acculturative stress have an impact on behavioral and emotional problems? Method: N-1 = 522 and N-2 = 91 adolescents (age = 14-17 years) were assessed regarding behavioral and emotional problems (Studies 1 and 2), acculturative stress, and perceived discrimination (Study 2). Results: In both studies, internalizing problems were reported significantly more often by girls than by boys. This finding was also observed for the Turkish group in the interview mode of Study 2. Perceived discrimination mediated the correlation between acculturative stress and behavioral and emotional problems. Conclusion: In the form of perceived discrimination, the cultural background of adolescents in Germany has an indirect impact on their mental health.

AB Background: The Brief Problem Monitor (BPM) is a short version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and its derived questionnaires and has already been psychometrically tested and approved in its English original version. The German translation likewise comprises three subscales (Internalizing-INT, Attention Problems-ATT, and Externalizing-EXT) and is available for multiple informants (parent, teacher, and youth report). Method: The psychometric characteristics (reliability and validity) of the German translation were examined by means of clinical as well as population-based samples of children aged 6-18 years. Results: The results indicate good reliability and, with some constraints, good validity. Conclusion: The German translation of the BPM can be judged as a reliable and valid instrument.

AB It is a frequently replicated finding that children with migrant background score low on intelligence tests. There is also a broad empirical basis regarding the intelligence-test data of children with F diagnoses according to the ICD-10. However, the interaction of both migration background and psychiatric disorders relating to intelligence-test data has not been examined. This study focuses on the impact of migration background and the interaction of migration background and psychiatric disorders on cognitive performance (Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children [K-ABC]; Melchers & Preu beta, 2009). It is based on a pediatric outpatient sample of 526 preschool and school children including 238 children with migration background. Most of the children included have F diagnoses such as learning disabilities and behavioral disorders. The present study found a significant effect for migration background (MANOVA), but no significant interaction with psychiatric disorders. The results underline the crucial meaning of migration background as a variable to explain limited performances in intelligence tests.

TI Failing Adolescents: Social Control, Political Economy & Human
   Development in post-war Sri Lanka
SO STABILITY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In post-war societies adolescents occupy liminal spaces - where social, political, economic, spatial and biological boundaries are still fluid and undetermined - and present a particular challenge for post-war communities as well as service providers. Drawing on a study from two war-affected villages in Sri Lanka, this paper examines the multi-faceted challenges that adolescents face in communities attempting to retain and redefine boundaries, identities, and social and moral regulation in a postwar context. It explores the dynamics of post-war change, especially in the social and moral regulation of sexuality, and its implications for adolescent girls and boys grappling with biological and social transformation - from internalizing gender norms to taking on adult economic roles. A second key concern of this paper is to underline how the post-war political economic context within which their communities are embedded shapes adolescents' negotiation with personal and social transformation. A third key concern is to highlight the legacies of war in the form of surveillance, silences and complex psychosocial problems that adolescents are confronted in post-war contexts and the risk of cycles of inter-generational violence. Finally, the paper examines the role and relevance of formal services in areas such as education, reproductive health, community mobilization, or psychosocial support in the lives of adolescents. It also considers the often overlooked but fundamental support from families and communities in bolstering the resilience of adolescents as they go through this challenging life phase in difficult and complex circumstances.

ID 'PRIORESSS-TALE'
AB The Prioress's Prologue and Tale demonstrate how a speaker's authority can be established through internalizing existing texts and their portrayal of exemplary figures. In the tale-telling contest in the Canterbury Tales, the speakers' social status is not as important as the moral weight and pleasure that the performance of the tale gives to the audience. In this circumstance, the Prioress establishes her stance as a tale-teller that can "ben holden digne of reverence" by performing not only the Tale, but its protagonist, whose youth, innocence, and complete reliance on the Virgin Mary make him a miracle and a wonder. Moving away from the General Prologue's depiction of a mock courtly lady, the Prioress in her Prologue is presented as a meta-Clergeon, who gets to share the impact and influence that her protagonist has as a spectacle/miracle. By presenting the Prioress in such a way, Chaucer utilizes the medieval notion of self-formation through reading and memory and explores ways in which speakerly authority can be established.

AB This study examined the role of mother-child attachment security in the development of children's depressive symptoms in middle childhood. The quality of attachment was assessed in a sample of one hundred and thirty-nine 9-12 year-old children using self-report questionnaire Security Scale (version for mother). Depressive symptoms were measured by Children's Depression Inventory. When child's sex and age were controlled for, mother's availability was a particularly important predictor of lower levels of depression and the majority of symptoms, whereas mother's reliance was not. Findings are further discussed within the context of normative changes in attachment in middle childhood and previous research on associations between attachment and internalizing problems.

AB Neural changes were investigated for children with disruptive behavior problems one year after a treatment program ended. Thirty-nine children and their parents visited the research lab before, after, and a year after treatment ended. During those lab visits, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during a challenging Go/No-go task. Treatment consisted of intensive 14-week combined cognitive behavioral therapy and parent management training sessions. For the analysis, participants were divided into long-term improvers (IMPs) and long-term nonimprovers (NIMPs) based on changes in their externalizing problem scores. The results showed early no-go theta power (4-8Hz, 100-250ms) decreased for long-term IMPs compared to NIMPs. When participants were divided based on changes in their comorbid internalizing symptoms, effects were stronger and reductions in theta power were found for early as well as later phases (250-650ms). We provided preliminary evidence that theta power is a useful neural measure to trace behavioral change linked to improved self-regulation even up to a year after treatment ended. Results may have implications for the characterization of children with disruptive behavior problems and may lead to the development of novel markers of treatment success.

AB This study was the first to position itself in the intersection on research on center-based care and on chronic absenteeism. Given the growth in the utilization of center-based care and given the recent vocalized policy concerns of the detrimental effects of chronic absenteeism in early school years, this study inquired as to whether attending center-based care predicted differential odds of early absence patterns. Using a newly-released national large-scale study of children (the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011), the findings indicated that children who attended center-based care in prekindergarten had lower odds of being chronically absent in kindergarten. The conclusions were consistent even after employing multiple methodological approaches (fixed effects, propensity score matching) as well as exploring multiple definitions of chronic absenteeism, though were not differentiated by socioeconomic status. Additional noteworthy findings are discussed, including the significance of children's internalizing symptoms and parental mental health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated five to six year old children's ability to regulate negative and positive emotions in relation to psychosocial problem behavior (N = 53). It was explored, whether mothers' supportive and nonsupportive strategies of emotion socialization influence children's problem behavior by shaping their emotion regulation ability Mothers reported on children's emotion regulation and internalizing and externalizing problem behavior via questionnaire, and were interviewed about their preferences for socialization strategies in response to children's expression of negative affect. Results showed that children with more adaptive expression of adequate positive emotions had less internalizing behavior problems. When children showed more control of inadequate negative emotions, children were less internalizing as well as externalizing in their behavior. Furthermore, results indicated indirect relations of mothers' socialization strategies with children's problem behavior. Control of inadequate negative emotions mediated the link between non-supportive strategies on externalizing problem behavior. Results suggest that emotion regulatory processes should be part of interventions to reduce the development of problematic behavior in young children. Parents should be trained in dealing with children's emotions in a constructive way.

AB Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol use, and alcohol-related consequences have been linked to emotion dysregulation. Sex differences exist in both emotion regulation dimensions and alcohol use patterns. This investigation examined facets of emotion dysregulation as potential mediators of the relationship between PTSD symptoms and alcohol-related consequences and whether differences may exist across sexes. Methods: Participants were 240 college students with a trauma history who reported using alcohol within the past three months and completed measures of PTSD symptoms, emotion dysregulation, alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences, and negative affect. The six facets of emotion dysregulation were examined as mediators of the relationship between PTSD symptoms and alcohol-related consequences in the full sample and by sex. Results: There were differences in sexes on several variables, with women reporting higher PTSD scores and lack of emotional awareness. Men reported significantly more drinks per week in a typical week and a heavy week. There were significant associations between the variables for the full sample, with PTSD showing associations with five facets of emotion dysregulation subscales: impulse control difficulties when upset, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, nonacceptance of emotional responses, lack of emotional clarity, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies. Alcohol-related consequences were associated with four aspects of emotion dysregulation: impulse control difficulties when upset, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, nonacceptance of emotional reponses, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies. Two aspects of emotion regulation, impulse control difficulties and difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior, mediated the relationship between PTSD symptoms and alcohol-related consequences in the full sample, even after adjusting for the effects of negative affect. When examined separately by gender, impulse control difficulties remained a mediator for men and difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior for women. Conclusions: These analyses shed light on processes that may underlie self-medication of PTSD symptoms. Gender-specific interventions targeting emotion dysregulation may be effective in reducing alcohol-related consequences in individuals with PTSD. Women may possibly benefit from interventions that focus on difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, while men may benefit from interventions that target impulse control difficulties when upset.

AB The authors examined factors theorized to contribute to adaptive functioning in 56 parentally bereaved children (age 7-13) who had lost their caregiver within the previous 6 months. Adaptive functioning, defined as falling below clinical threshold levels on all measures of depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, characterized 57% of the sample. Linear mixed modeling revealed that children in the adaptive functioning group had lower mean scores on avoidant coping and higher mean scores on coping efficacy, religiosity, parental positive reinforcement, and parental empathy. Findings suggest that adaptive functioning following parental loss is related to both child-intrinsic factors and child-extrinsic factors.

AB Objectives: Several strategies have been found to be effective for the treatment of childhood behavioral sleep disorders. One which has yet to be evaluated is the Zurich 3-step concept, which combines basic notions of the two-process model of sleep regulation (introducing a regular rhythm and adjusting bedtime to sleep need) with behavioral strategies. This uncontrolled before-and-after study describes our concept and its step-wise approach, assesses changes in sleep-wake variables and behavior problems, and also examines associations between changes in sleep-wake variables and behavior problems.
   Methods: A total of 79 children with sleep problems (age range 6-47 months, 42% females) were included. Sleep problems were assessed by the Infant Sleep Questionnaire, sleep-wake variables by diary and actigraphy, and behavior problems of children >= 18 months by the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: A significant decrease in nocturnal wake duration (Cohen's d = -0.34) and a significant increase in the duration of the longest continuous nocturnal sleep period (Cohen's d = 0.19) were found from before to after intervention (on average 2.7 months, SD 1.5). The variability for sleep onset and end time decreased, and actigraphically measured circadian rest-activity cycle measures improved. Parent-reported internalizing and total behavior problems also decreased (Cohen's d = 0.66).
   Conclusions: The findings of both objective and subjective assessment techniques suggest that the Zurich 3-step concept is effective. Thus, the intervention concept may be useful in clinical practice with sleep-disordered children.

AB Our article reviews and celebrates Susan Nolen-Hoeksema's remarkable contributions to psychological and clinical science, focusing on her vast body of theoretical and empirical work and her influence on colleagues and students. Susan spent her career trying to understand how and why a style of regulating emotions called rumination increases vulnerability to depression and exacerbates and perpetuates negative moods. More broadly, we describe research by Susan and her colleagues on the predictors of depression in childhood and adolescence; gender differences in depression and rumination in adolescence and adulthood; roots, correlates, and adverse consequences of ruminative response styles; and rumination as a transdiagnostic risk factor for not only depression but also a host of psychological disorders, including anxiety, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Susan's intellectual legacy is evident in her impressive publication and citation record, the clinical applications of her work, and the flourishing careers of the students she mentored.

AB The aim of the present study was to explore the psychometric properties of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) among Turkish adolescents. A total of 595 high school students (300 females and 295 males) whose ages ranged between 14 and 17 years participated in the study, and were administered the DERS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and the Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI). Confirmatory factor analyses supported the six-factor structure of the DERS among adolescents. In addition, results indicated sound internal consistency as well as concurrent validity. It is concluded that the DERS is a valid age-appropriate measure for investigating emotion regulation difficulties in adolescents.

AB In this study, we aimed to examine the associations between child-perceived teacher-child relationships, children's appraisals of interactions with their teacher, and internalizing problems. Five hundred third- to sixth-graders reported about their experiences of closeness, conflict, and negative expectations in the relationship with their teacher. Furthermore, their appraisals of fictive interactions with their teachers were measured. Internalizing problems were measured by children's self-reported depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints. The negative relation between closeness and internalizing problems in children was fully mediated by children's appraisals. The associations between conflict and negative expectations, respectively, and children's internalizing problems were only partly mediated. Effects for the negative relationship dimensions as well as the negative appraisals in the associations were stronger than effects for positive perceptions about the teacher. It can be concluded that child perceptions about the teacher matter for internalizing children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using daily diary data, this study examined cross-day associations between family conflict and school problems and tested mediating effects of daily negative mood and moderating effects of psychological symptoms. For 2weeks, parents and adolescents (N=106; M-age=15.4) reported daily conflict; adolescents reported daily negative mood and school problems. Results indicated bidirectional, multiday spillover between parent-adolescent conflict and school problems with daily negative mood statistically accounting for spillover both within and across days. Externalizing symptoms strengthened links between father-adolescent conflict and school problems, whereas depressive and anxious symptoms strengthened links between parent-adolescent conflict and daily negative mood. By demonstrating cross-domain transmission of daily problems, these findings highlight the salience of everyday events as possible intervention targets.

AB Internationally adopted (IA) children often have delays at adoption and undergo massive catch-up after adoption. Before achieving developmental catch-up, however, delays at adoption present a risk for IA children's adjustment, but it remains unknown whether such delays foreshadow IA children's outcomes after catch-up development has completed or ceased. In the current analysis, we utilized menarche as a practical marker to indicate the cessation of developmental catch-up. We investigated how delays at arrival predicted long-term outcomes in 132 postmenarcheal teens (M = 14.2 years, SD = 1.7) who were adopted from China at 16.6 months (SD = 17.1). In 2005, adoptive parents provided data of medical evaluation results on their children's delay status in gross motor skills, fine motor skills, social development, emotional development, and cognitive development. Six years later in 2011, data on parent-child relationship quality were collected from parents, and data on the adoptees' academic competence and internalizing problems were also collected from both parents and adoptees. We found that gross motor delay at arrival predicted academic performance (parent-report: b = -.34, p < .01) and internalizing problems (self-report: b = .26, p < .05; parent-report: b = .33, p < .01). Other delays were not significant in predicting any of the outcomes. The impact of early nutritional deprivation on gross motor development was discussed.

AB Sixty-eight meta-analyses and survey articles were systematically reviewed with regard to efficacy of parent-centered interventions for children aged two to twelve years and to their effectiveness in the treatment of different psychiatric disorders. All in all, it turned out that the close involvement of the parents in the treatment of children (especially of younger children) with internalized disorders is useful. A cognitive-behavioral approach involving the parents seems to be particularly effective. In externalized behavior problems behavioral parent training shows positive results not only with regard to a reduction of these problems, but also with regard to parenting behavior and-parental wellbeing. It is highly recommendable that especially behavioral parent-centered interventions of proven efficacy should be applied more often in the future and payment by the health insurance should be made possible.

AB There is a need for a brief measure of emotion dysregulation that can be used in large-scale studies. This study evaluated the construct validity of a short, self-report instrument of emotion dysregulation. Subjects (N=2197) were recruited from primary care clinics of an urban public hospital as part of a study of trauma-related risk and resilience. Emotion dysregulation was measured using the Emotion Dysregulation Scale, short version (EDS-short), a12-item self-report measure assessing emotional experiencing, cognition, and behavior. EDS-short was first compared with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Then, the construct validity of the EDS-short in predicting depression, posttraumatic stress, substance abuse, borderline pathology, suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, positive affect, and resiliency was assessed. We found a significant positive correlation between EDS-short and DERS. The EDS-short was significantly predictive of higher reported depressive, posttraumatic stress, substance abuse, and borderline symptoms, and lower reported positive affect and resiliency, over and above demographic characteristics and negative affect. Our results demonstrate that the EDS-short is a useful instrument for measuring emotion dysregulation in traumatized populations. A brief measure of emotion dysregulation is critical as the field moves forward in studying the wide ranging negative effects of emotion dysregulation across psychiatric disorders and outcomes.

Contemporary theory suggests that this relationship could be moderated by individual differences in environmentally sensitive biological systems. This study investigated whether the interaction between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) arousal moderated the link between harsh discipline and behavior problems. Three saliva samples were collected on a single day from 425 inner city youth (50% male, age 11-12 years, 80% African American) and were later assayed for cortisol (HPA) and alpha-amylase (ANS). Problem behavior was assessed by self-and parent-report using the Child Behavior Checklist. Youth also reported the level of harsh discipline that they experienced. Harsh discipline was positively associated with externalizing and internalizing problems only when there were asymmetrical profiles of HPA activity and ANS arousal. This pattern was evident for boys but not girls. Findings are discussed in relation to prevailing theories suggesting that biological susceptibility translates adversity into risk for behavior problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescents' and emerging adults' social interactions increasingly revolve around cellphone use, but little research has investigated the psychological properties of cellphone interactions. The current study explored co-rumination via cellphone; that is, the use of cellphone functions to excessively communicate about problems or negative feelings. Face-to-face co-rumination and co-rumination via cellphone were examined as potential moderators of the association between perceived interpersonal stress and psychosocial well-being (i.e., positive mental health and social burnout) in a sample of 142 college students. Face-to-face co-rumination was not a moderator. However, co-rumination via cellphone was a significant moderator such that higher levels of perceived interpersonal stress were associated with lower levels of well-being only among college students who reported higher levels of co-rumination via cellphone. Co-rumination via cellphone should be further investigated to elucidate its developmental trajectory and mental health correlates.

AB Objective: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a commonly used measure of child and adolescent functioning, and a handful of items from the CBCL are often used to measure sleep functioning. The objective of this study was to examine the convergent, discriminant, and external validity of the individual CBCL sleep items and a CBCL sleep composite with validated measures of sleep functioning and youth adjustment as well as sleep disorder diagnoses.
   Methods: The participants were 383 youths (ages 6-18 years; 52.5% male; 80% non-Hispanic White) evaluated in a behavioral sleep medicine clinic. A sleep psychologist diagnosed sleep disorders following a comprehensive evaluation. Parents completed the CBCL in addition to the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and the Sleep Disorders Inventory for Students (SDIS). Adolescents completed the Adolescent Sleep-Wake Scale (ASWS).
   Results: Individual CBCL sleep items were generally associated with sleep scales on validated sleep measures and with sleep disorder diagnoses. The CBCL sleep composite was associated with total scores on each of the sleep-specific measures, as well as with the CBCL attention, social, internalizing, and externalizing problems scales.
   Conclusions: Although the CBCL is inadequate for thoroughly assessing sleep problems and disorders, sleep items on the CBCL may be useful in epidemiological/archival studies that lack a more comprehensive sleep measure or to clinicians who do not use other validated sleep measures in their typical practice. Individual CBCL sleep items may be optimal when assessing specific facets of sleep functioning whereas the CBCL sleep composite may be optimal when examining overall sleep functioning and external correlates of sleep.

AB While the influence of mother-child relationships on children's recovery following sexual abuse has been documented, less is known about the possible contribution of father-child relationships on outcomes. The present study explored the contribution of children's perception of security in their relationship to the father on internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, while controlling for socio-demographic variables and variables associated with the mother-child relationship. Participants were 142 children who disclosed sexual abuse involving a perpetrator other than the biological father. Regression analyses indicated that children's perception of security to fathers contributed to the prediction of parental reports of children's behavior problems, even after controlling for maternal psychological distress and perception of security to mothers.

AB Two clinical and 2 structured clinical interviews were used to identify children with posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD), traumatized children without PTSD, and nontraumatized controls. Parents evaluated child conduct by marking the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-48 (CPRS-48; Conners, 1989). Data analysis indicated that the CPRS-48 Total scores and the Anxiety and Psychosomatic subscales scores of the PTSD group significantly exceeded the scores of the comparison groups. Children with PTSD and traumatized children without PTSD did not significantly differ on the Hyperactivity Index. The Hyperactivity Index scores of traumatized children without PTSD and nontraumatized controls were not significantly different. Nonsignificant differences were observed between groups on the CPRS-48 Impulsivity-Hyperactivity, Conduct Problems, and Learning subscales. Overall, PTSD was marked by higher internalizing scores and trauma exposure without PTSD was not associated with increased psychological morbidity.

AB Young victims of sexual abuse often show adaptation difficulties following disclosure, such as internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems (Trask, Walsh, & DiLillo, 2011; Rakow, Smith, Begle, & Ayer, 2011). In addition, parental factors are likely to play an important role in the occurrence of child behaviour problems (Kouyoumdjian, Perry, & Hansen, 2009). To date, sense of competency of the nonabusive parent and child attachment security have not been extensively examined to explain child adaptation following the abuse. The objective of the current study is to examine the link between parental sense of competency, child attachment security, and the presence of internalizing and externalizing problems among 96 preschool children victims of sexual abuse. Results indicate that attachment insecurity, as assessed by the Attachment Q-Sort completed by the mother, is associated with a greater likelihood of child behaviour problems. Specifically, the more securely attached a child is to their parent, the less that child will show internalizing and externalizing problems. Results also show that parental sense of competency, that is, their perception of the help and support they can offer the child, does not contribute to child adaptation, except in cases of children with externalizing disorders. Our results underscore the importance of intervention aiming the promotion of parent-child relationships and maternal sensitivity in families confronted with child sexual abuse.

AB The present study aimed to determine if emotion regulation mediates the relationship between emotional maltreatment and disordered eating behavior in adolescents. Participants were 222 secondary school pupils (aged 14-18 years) from a state high school in the UK. Standardized questionnaire measures were used to gather self-report data on emotional abuse and emotional neglect, functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies and disordered eating behavior. Results showed that disordered eating was associated with emotional abuse, dysfunctional emotion regulation and being female. Multiple mediation analysis found an indirect relationship between emotional abuse and disordered eating through dysfunctional emotion regulation. Interestingly, emotional neglect predicted lower levels of functional emotion regulation. The findings support previous research showing emotion regulation to mediate the relationship between childhood abuse and disordered eating in adults and a differential effect of abuse and neglect on emotion regulation. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm the direction of relationships; however these data suggest that dysfunctional emotion regulation is a significant variable in the development of disordered eating and may be a useful target for intervention.

AB This is the first study to describe the relation between attachment security, emotion regulation, and symptom change in a sample of adolescents completing inpatient treatment in a naturalistic setting. We examined whether attachment security predicted symptom change, and whether emotion regulation capacities mediated this relation. A sample of n = 194 inpatient adolescents was assessed (65.5 % female, M (age) = 15.45 years, SD = 1.44) at admission and discharge and analyses were conducted in accordance with the aforementioned objectives including testing of moderation and mediation models. We found that securely attached adolescents experienced greater reduction in internalizing symptoms from admission to discharge, even when controlling for length of stay. Nonacceptance of emotional responses mediated the relation between maternal attachment security and internalizing symptom change. These findings did not hold for externalizing symptoms, nor when paternal attachment was explored. Attachment plays an important role in symptom change for internalizing problems, with nonacceptance of emotional responses partially mediating this link. Possible explanations for the absence of moderation for paternal attachment and externalizing problems are discussed, as are explanations for the mediating effect of emotion regulation.

AB The psychobiology of stress involves two major components, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Research has revealed the association between behavior problems and the psychobiology of stress, yet findings are inconsistent and few studies have addressed the moderate correlations between behavior problems. This study examines the individual and interactive effects of HPA and ANS on child behavior problems while taking into account the comorbidity of externalizing and internalizing problems. Four saliva samples were collected from each participant in a community sample (N = 429; aged 11-12 years; 50.49 % male), which were assayed for cortisol (HPA) and alpha-amylase, sAA (ANS). Children's behavior problems were assessed using parent-report and self-report versions of the Child Behavior Checklist. Latent variables were constructed to represent trait-like individual differences in cortisol and sAA. Low levels of HPA axis activity were associated with higher levels of both externalizing and internalizing problems, but only among children with low ANS arousal. The association between externalizing and internalizing problems diminished to non-significant after taking into account the influence of HPA axis activity and ANS arousal, which suggests that the psychobiology of stress explains a fair proportion of comorbidity of behavior problems. The findings support that interaction between HPA axis and ANS functioning has potential to clarify prior mixed findings and advance our understanding of the child behavior problems.

AB Adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience emotional and behavioural difficulties which contribute to stress and conflict in their family relationships. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a promising intervention for these families. We evaluated the efficacy of an adaptation of a MBCT intervention for 13-18 year olds with ADHD and their parents. Adolescents (n = 18) and parents (n = 17) attended 8 weekly parallel group sessions. Participants completed questionnaires at four time points: 4 weeks before the intervention to control for general time effects, on the first and last days of the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Participants reported on adolescent ADHD symptoms, internalizing and externalizing problems, functional impairment, family functioning, parenting stress, and mindfulness. There were no significant changes on parent rated variables during the baseline period. Results of repeated measures ANOVA revealed reductions in the adolescents' inattention, conduct problems, and peer relations problems after the intervention, according to parental report. Parents also reported reductions in parenting stress and increases in mindful parenting. Adolescents did not report improvements on any variables during the intervention period. Paired t-tests indicated that improvements in adolescent symptomatology and mindful parenting were maintained 6 weeks after the intervention ended. Parents reported additional reductions in parenting stress at follow-up. Adolescents reported reductions in internalizing problems at follow-up. Overall, our results support and extend the preliminary findings of previous investigations of MBCT showing it to be a promising treatment for adolescents with ADHD and their parents.

AB Early life stress can alter hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function. Differences in cortisol levels have been found in preterm infants exposed to substantial procedural stress during neonatal intensive care, compared to infants born full-term, but only a few studies investigated whether altered programming of the HPA axis persists past toddler age. Further, there is a dearth of knowledge of what may contribute to these changes in cortisol. This prospective cohort study examined the cortisol profiles in response to the stress of cognitive assessment, as well as the diurnal rhythm of cortisol, in children (n = 129) born at varying levels of prematurity (24-32 weeks gestation) and at full-term (38-41 weeks gestation), at age 7 years. Further, we investigated the relationships among cortisol levels and neonatal procedural pain-related stress (controlling for multiple medical confounders), concurrent maternal factors (parenting stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms) and children's behavioral problems. For each aim we investigate acute cortisol response profiles to a cognitive challenge as well as diurnal cortisol patterns at home. We hypothesized that children born very preterm will differ in their pattern of cortisol secretion from children born full-term, possibly depended on concurrent child and maternal factors, and that exposure to neonatal pain-related stress would be associated with altered cortisol secretion in children born very preterm, possibly in a sex-dependent way. Saliva samples were collected from 7-year old children three times during a laboratory visit for assessment of cognitive and executive functions (pretest, mid-test, end-study day acute stress profile) and at four times over two consecutive non-school days at home (i.e. morning, mid-morning, afternoon and bedtime diurnal rhythm profile). We found that cortisol profiles were similar in preterm and full-term children, albeit preterms had slightly higher cortisol at bedtime compared to full-term children. Importantly, in the preterm group, greater neonatal procedural pain-related stress (adjusted for morphine) was associated with lower cortisol levels on the study day (p=.044) and lower diurnal cortisol at home (p=.023), with effects found primarily in boys. In addition, child attention problems were negatively, and thought problems were positively, associated with the cortisol response during cognitive assessment on the study day in preterm children. Our findings suggest that neonatal pain/stress contributes to altered HPA axis function up to school-age in children born very preterm, and that sex may be an important factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Individual differences in the psychobiology of the stress response have been linked to behavior problems in youth yet most research has focused on single signaling molecules released by either the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis or the autonomic nervous system. As our understanding about biobehavioral relationships develops it is clear that multiple signals from the biological stress systems work in coordination to affect behavior problems. Questions are raised as to whether coordinated effects should be statistically represented as ratio or interactive terms. We address this knowledge gap by providing a theoretical overview of the concepts and rationales, and illustrating the analytical tactics. Salivary samples collected from 446 youth aged 11-12 were assayed for salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-s) and cortisol. Coordinated effect of DHEA-s and cortisol, and coordinated effect of sAA and cortisol on externalizing and internalizing problems (Child Behavior Checklist) were tested with the ratio and the interaction approaches using multi-group path analysis. Findings consistent with previous studies include a positive association between cortisol/DHEA-s ratio and internalizing problems; and a negative association between cortisol and externalizing problems conditional on low levels of sAA. This study highlights the importance of matching analytical strategy with research hypothesis when integrating salivary bioscience into research in behavior problems. Recommendations are made for investigating multiple salivary analytes in relation to behavior problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of early intervention to prevent adult psychopathology and improve well-being in early-starting conduct-problem children.
   Method: Kindergarteners (N=9,594) in three cohorts (1991-1993) at 55 schools in four communities were screened for conduct problems, yielding 979 early starters. A total of 891 (91%) consented (51% African American, 47% European American; 69% boys). Children were randomly assigned by school cluster to a 10-year intervention or control. The intervention goal was to develop social competencies in children that would Carry them throughout life, through social skills training, parent behavior-management training with home visiting, peer coaching, reading tutoring, and classroom social-emotional curricula. Manualization and supervision ensured program fidelity. Ninety-eight percent participated during grade 1, and 80% continued through grade 10. At age 25, arrest records were reviewed (N=817, 92%), and condition-blinded adults psychiatrically interviewed participants (N=702; 81% of living participants) and a peer (N=535) knowledgeable about the participant.
   Results: Intent-to-treat logistic regression analyses indicated that 69% of participants in the control arm displayed at least one externalizing, internalizing, or substance abuse psychiatric problem (based on self-or peer interview) at age 25, in contrast with 59% of those assigned to intervention (odds ratio=0.59, CI=0.43-0.81; number needed to treat=8). This pattern also held for self-interviews, peer interviews, scores using an "and" rule for self-and peer reports, and separate tests for externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and substance abuse problems, as well as for each of three cohorts, four sites, male participants, female participants, African Americans, European Americans, moderate-risk, and high-risk subgroups. Intervention participants also received lower severity-weighted violent (standardized estimate=-0.37) and drug (standardized estimate=-0.43) crime conviction scores, lower risky sexual behavior scores (standardized estimate=-0.24), and higher well-being scores (standardized estimate=0.19).
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the efficacy of early intervention in preventing adult psychopathology among high-risk early-starting conduct-problem children.

AB This study is the first to investigate the longitudinal effects of gene-environment interplay between DRD4 genotype and maternal sensitivity on child externalizing behavior. Multiple measures of maternal sensitivity (14, 36, and 48 months) and externalizing behavior (18 months, 36 months, and 5 years) were assessed in a large cohort study (N=548). Early maternal insensitivity (14 months) was associated with early externalizing behavior (18 months) in a for better and for worse manner, but only in children with at least one DRD4 7-repeat, consistent with a differential susceptibility model. Later insensitivity (48 months) predicted externalizing behavior at age 5 independent of DRD4 genotype. A structural equation model including all measures across time supported the differential susceptibility model: The overall effect of early maternal sensitivity on later externalizing behavior was significant only for children with a DRD4 7-repeat allele. The results highlight the importance of studying gene-environment interactions across development. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 57: 35-49, 2015.

AB Temperament is an important predictor of socioemotional adjustment, such as externalizing and internalizing symptoms. However, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between temperamental predispositions and these outcomes, implying that other factors also contribute to the development of internalizing and externalizing problems. Self-regulation is believed to interact with temperament, and has been studied as a predictor for later socioemotional outcomes. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a psychophysiological measure of self-regulation that has been studied as a moderator of risk. The primary aim of the present study was to test if RSA baseline and RSA reactivity would moderate the link between temperament and socioemotional outcomes. Mothers reported the temperament of their infants (20 months; N=154), RSA was collected at 24- and 42-months, and mothers reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors at kindergarten entry. RSA baseline and RSA reactivity moderated the relation between exuberant temperament and externalizing behaviors. However, these results were only significant for girls, such that high RSA baseline and greater RSA suppression predicted more externalizing behaviors when exuberance was high. Fearful temperament predicted later internalizing behaviors, but no moderation was present. These results are discussed in light of recent evidence regarding gender differences in the role of RSA as a protective factor for risk. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The present study examined clinical and demographic risk factors associated with parent-rated emotional-behavioral and executive functioning in children and adolescents with epilepsy. The medical records of 152 children and adolescents with epilepsy referred for neuropsychological evaluation were reviewed. Results indicated that the sample displayed significantly elevated symptoms across the emotional-behavioral and executive domains assessed. Executive functioning and behavioral symptoms had the highest rates of clinically elevated scores, with lowest rates of elevated scores in internalizing and externalizing emotional problems. Only 34% of those participants with clinically significant emotional-behavioral or executive functioning difficulties had a history of psychological or counseling services, highlighting the underserved mental health needs of this population. In regard to clinical factors, themajority of seizure-related variables were not associated with emotional-behavioral or executive functioning. However, the frequency of seizures (i. e., seizure status) was associated with behavioral regulation aspects of executive functioning, and the age at evaluation was associated with externalizing problems and behavioral symptoms. Family psychiatric history (with the exception of ADHD) was associated with all domains of executive and emotional-behavioral functioning. In summary, emotional-behavioral and executive functioning difficulties frequently co-occur with seizures in childhood epilepsy, with both seizure-related and demographic factors contributing to the presentation of such neurobehavioral comorbidities. The present findings provide treatment providers of childhood epilepsy with important information to assist in better identifying children and adolescents who may be at risk for neurobehavioral comorbidities and may benefit from intervention.

AB Background: Although previous studies indicated a positive association between restrictive anorexia-nervosa (AN-R) and autistic traits, the potential interference of psychiatric internalizing comorbidity on this association is not yet fully investigated.
   Materials and methods: The aim of this study was to explore autistic traits and internalizing psychopathology in adolescents (age range: 11.7-17.2 years) with AN-R. Twenty-five patients referred to two tertiary-care hospitals were compared to a large control group (N=170) with no differences in age and sex. AN-R patients and controls filled out instruments assessing autistic traits (autism spectrum quotient [AQ]), psychopathology (youth self-report [YSR] 11-18), and eating patterns (eating attitude test [EAT]). In order to disentangle the possible mediating role of internalizing symptoms on autistic traits, two separate control groups (called True and False healthy control, both composed of 25 eating-problem-free participants) were derived from the whole control group on the basis of the presence or absence of internalizing problems in the YSR.
   Results: AN-R patients scored significantly higher on AQ compared to the whole control group and to controls without internalizing problems (True HC), but these differences disappeared when only controls with internalizing problems (False HC) were considered.
   Conclusion: Autistic traits in AN-R individuals may have been overestimated and may partly be due to comorbid internalizing symptoms in investigated patients.

AB Parents of children with developmental disabilities (DD) are at increased risk of experiencing psychological stress compared to other parents. Children's high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems have been found to contribute to this elevated level of stress. Few studies have considered the reverse direction of effects, however, in families where a child has a DD. The present study investigated transactional relations between child behavior problems and maternal stress within 176 families raising a child with early diagnosed DD. There was evidence of both child-driven and parent-driven effects over the 15-year study period, spanning from early childhood (age 3) to adolescence (age 18), consistent with transactional models of development. Parent-child transactions were found to vary across different life phases and with different domains of behavior problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a widely used child mental health questionnaire with five hypothesized subscales. There is theoretical and preliminary empirical support for combining the SDQ's hypothesized emotional and peer subscales into an 'internalizing' subscale and the hypothesized behavioural and hyperactivity subscales into an 'externalizing' subscale (alongside the fifth prosocial subscale). We examined both structures using the teacher informant version data from two Arab countries, namely Saudi Arabia (323) and Oman (439). Multigroup CFAs based on structural equation modelling revealed culture invariance for the SDQ The three-factor model showed a better description of the SDQ structure. The analysis also revealed gender invariance for the SDQ three and five factor models in both the Omani and Saudi samples. There were gender differences in all the three and five factors between the Saudi and Omani samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VALIDATION; DISORDERS; TRAUMA
AB ObjectiveTheoretical models of emotion regulation difficulties in anorexia nervosa (AN) specify a role for factors that predispose to or precipitate emotion dysregulation. The current study considered whether childhood abuse (i.e., emotional, sexual, physical) might be related to emotion regulation difficulties and eating disorder symptom severity in patients with AN. Childhood abuse was hypothesized to relate to AN symptoms indirectly via emotion dysregulation.
   MethodParticipants were 188 patients with AN presenting to an intensive treatment facility. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and Eating Disorder Examination were used to assess childhood abuse, emotion dysregulation, and AN symptom severity, respectively.
   ResultsOf the three forms of childhood abuse, reports of emotional abuse were most strongly related to emotion regulation difficulties and AN symptom severity. Mediation analyses revealed that emotion dysregulation significantly explained the relationship between childhood emotional abuse and AN symptomatology, and mediation effects did not differ by AN subtype (i.e., restricting vs. binge-eating/purging).
   DiscussionFindings provide initial support for a model in which childhood emotional abuse precipitates emotion dysregulation and the development of AN. Future studies with longitudinal designs and control groups are necessary to examine the direction and specificity of these cross-sectional associations (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB AimTo characterize the prospective trajectory of parent-reported behavior and social competence problems in children with new or recent onset epilepsy from diagnosis to 5 to 6years after diagnosis compared to healthy control participants.
   MethodThirty-five children (21 males, 14 females; mean age 14y 1mo [SD 3y 4mo] range 8-18y) with new/recent onset idiopathic generalized (IGE) and 34 children with localization-related epilepsies (LRE; 19 males, 15 females; mean age 10y 8mo [SD 2y 2mo] range 8-18y) underwent behavioral assessment (Child Behavior Checklist) at baseline, 2years, and 5 to 6years after diagnosis. The assessment comprised the summary scales Total Behavior Problems Internalizing Problems, Externalizing Problems, and Total Competence. Sixty-two children with normal development served as comparison participants. Analyses were based on random effects regression modeling comparing trajectories with respect to time since epilepsy diagnosis among groups.
   ResultsDifferences in parent-reported behavioral problems between LRE and IGE syndrome groups and healthy comparison participants were detectable at or near the time of diagnosis and remained either stable (competence) or tended to abate (behavior problems) over the ensuing 5 to 6years without evidence of progressive worsening. These trends were evident for both LRE and IGE groups, with no differences between them.
   InterpretationBehavior and competence problems in children with LRE and IGE are not characterized by progressive worsening over a 5- to 6-year period. Behavioral problems are present near the time of diagnosis and tend to abate over time, with competence problems being more persistent across serial assessments, and present in both LRE and IGE groups.

AB Cognitive appraisal has been shown to mediate the relationship between stressors and internalizing symptoms, but not among newcomer immigrant youth facing ambiguous discrimination. Using a mixed-methods design with a sample of newcomer adolescents from African, Arab, Asian, Caribbean, European, and Latin American countries, this study measured the perceived occurrence of discrimination (attribution to discrimination) and its perceived degree of severity (cognitive appraisal) in relation to internalizing symptoms and academic achievement. Attribution to discrimination predicted greater internalizing symptoms, and appraisal mediated this relationship. The mediation effect was found for younger, but not older adolescents. Quantitative results suggest that perceiving discrimination to be threatening, not just that it occurred, relates to psychological health. Qualitative results suggest that for newcomer adolescents, discrimination is a highly prevalent and complex stressor with multiple psychosocial ramifications.

AB Background: Parental characteristics can increase the risk of the development of adolescent depression. In this study, we focus on the parental factors of parents in a non-intact relationship, dissatisfaction with personal economy, physical illness or disability, and internalizing and externalizing problems. The aim is to examine which of these parental risk factors, separately for mothers and fathers, are associated with clinical depression in adolescents in a community sample. Methods: In the Youth and Mental Health study, 345 adolescents (mean age +/- standard deviation 15.0 +/- 0.6 years, range 13.8-16.6 years; 72.5% girls) and their parents (79% at least one parent) completed questionnaires and the diagnostic interview Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). Adolescents were classified into current major depressive disorder or dysthymia (n = 46), depression not otherwise specified (n = 48), or no depression (n = 251). The parental risk factors were based on interview and the Adult Self-Report. Risk factors associated with mothers (n = 267) and fathers (n = 167) were separately analyzed using ordinal logistic regression with current depression category as the dependent variable. All analyses were adjusted for youth sex and age. Results: Mothers' economical dissatisfaction, physical illness/disability, internalizing problems and externalizing problems were associated with adolescent current depression (P <= 0.02). Adjusting for all other factors, only mothers' internalizing problems (P < 0.001) remained significantly associated with adolescent depression. Fathers' risk factors were not associated with adolescent depression. Conclusion: Characteristics of mothers are associated with adolescent current depression. Mothers' internalizing problems is independently strongly associated with increased risk of current adolescent depression. Clinicians should assess mothers' mental health when treating depressed adolescents.

This article describes a developmental bio-psycho-social model of gender differences in emotion expression in childhood. Prior empirical research supporting the model, at least with mostly White middle-class U.S. samples of youth, is presented. Limitations to the extant literature and future directions for research on gender and child emotion are suggested.

AB Using a correlational multivariate research design, partial least squares (PLS) was applied to examine the direct and indirect influence of pre-adoption risks, family functioning, and adoption secrecy on the adjustment (which is defined in this study as the internalizing and externalizing behaviors) of Filipino adopted children. Thirty-two sets of Filipino adoptees and their respective adoptive mothers participated in the study. Family functioning was found to predict the adjustment of Filipino adopted children while adoption secrecy predicted family functioning. Adopted children's perception of their family functioning and adoption openness buffer the impact of the early adversity experienced by the adopted children. Implications on the clinical practice and adoption practices in the Philippines are discussed.

AB Background: This study adds to the limited evidence concerning the benefits of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) with depressed adolescents. It evaluates the long-term effects of group versus individual delivery of this treatment approach. Aims: To conduct a small-scale examination of the long-term efficacy of group versus individual delivery of IPT for depressed adolescents. Method: Thirty-nine adolescents, aged 13-19 years, with a primary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, were randomly assigned in blocks to either group or individual delivery of IPT. Standardized clinical interview and questionnaire assessments were conducted at pre-and posttreatment, and 12-month follow-up. Results: Intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses indicated significant improvements in depression, anxiety, youth-reported internalizing problems, and global functioning from pre-to posttreatment for those receiving IPT, with no significant differences in outcome between group and individual formats of delivery. Improvements were maintained at 12-month follow-up. Completer analyses also revealed significant and sustained improvements on these measures for those receiving IPT, with no differences in outcome between therapy formats for most measures. Individual IPT showed significantly greater improvements than group IPT in parent-reported internalizing problems for the completer but not the ITT analyses. Conclusions: Both individual and group formats of IPT offer promise in producing long-term benefits in the treatment of depression among adolescents.

AB Purpose: To investigate the behavioral and social competency profiles of individuals who stutter and to compare them with persons who do not stutter, according to their parents; to correlate the behavioral and the social competence performances with the severity of stuttering. Methods: Sixty-four participants, aged 6 to 18 years, of both genders, were divided into two groups: the study group (SG), composed of 32 individuals with persistent developmental stuttering, and the control group (CG), composed of 32 fluent individuals. The procedures used were fluency assessment, stuttering severity instrument, and the Child Behavior Checklist inventory. Results: In the behavioral profile of the SG, the mean of the total score and that of the internalizing problems were classified as clinical. The comparison between the groups showed differences in the behavioral profile concerning the total score, and in the internalizing and externalizing problems; and in the social profile, concerning the total score and activity scale. There were no statistically significant differences in the scales among the mild, moderate, and severe stuttering. Conclusion: According to the information provided by parents, children who stutter showed peculiar behavior and social competence, with a higher tendency to manifest alterations in this area, in comparison to those who do not stutter. Fear, nervousness/tension, guilt, anxiety, perfectionism, and worry were the most frequent alterations in relation to the behavior, whereas damages in the social field and in the habitual communication situations characterized the social competence of persons who stutter.

AB Family obligation is an important aspect of family relationships among families from Mexican backgrounds and can have significant implications for adolescents' well-being. Prior research and theory regarding youths' obligations offer conflicting hypotheses about whether it is detrimental or beneficial for adolescents' well-being. In the current longitudinal study, we used a daily diary method among 428 Mexican American adolescents and their parents to closely examine the impact of adolescents' family obligation values and family assistance behaviors on internalizing symptoms over time. The authors closely examined the role of the family context in these associations. Results suggest that family obligation values relate to declines in adolescents' internalizing symptoms, whereas family assistance behaviors are both a protective and risk factor, depending on the family context. Only when youths provide family assistance in response to acute changes in parental physical and psychological distress do family assistance behaviors relate to increases in adolescents' internalizing symptoms.

AB Theoretical views and empirical findings suggest interrelations among attachment security, emotion dysregulation and anxiety in childhood and adolescence. However, the associations among the three constructs have rarely been investigated in children, and no study has yet addressed these associations in adolescence. The aim of the present study was to test a model of the interrelations among the three factors on a sample of 673 youths (age 9-16), using structural equation modelling. In accordance with theoretical conceptualisations, it was hypothesised that attachment security would relate to anxiety and that emotion dysregulation would help explain the association between attachment security and anxiety. Results showed that more securely attached youths reported less emotion dysregulation and that youths who had fewer emotion regulation difficulties experienced less anxiety. The association between attachment security and anxiety was mediated by emotion dysregulation. The model was confirmed for both children and adolescents. Findings are discussed with respect to theoretical implications, as well as future directions.

AB Behavioral sleep problems are common in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as are internalizing and externalizing comorbidities. The prevalence of these difficulties and the extent to which they co-exist in children with ADHD could inform clinical practice, but remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the association between sleep problems and internalizing and externalizing comorbidities in children with ADHD. Children aged 5-13 years were recruited from 21 pediatric practices across Victoria, Australia (N = 392). Internalizing and externalizing comorbidities (none, internalizing, externalizing, co-occurring) were assessed by the telephone-administered Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children IV/Parent version. Sleep problem severity was assessed by primary caregiver report (no, mild, moderate or severe problem). Moderate/severe sleep problems were confirmed using International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Seven specific sleep problem domains (bedtime resistance, sleep anxiety, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, night waking, parasomnias and daytime sleepiness) were assessed using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using adjusted logistic and linear regression models. Compared to children without comorbidities, children with co-occurring internalizing and externalizing comorbidities were more likely to have moderate/severe sleep problems (adjusted OR 2.4, 95 % CI 1.2; 4.5, p = 0.009) and problematic sleep across six of seven sleep domains. Children with either comorbidity alone were not at risk of moderate/severe sleep problems, but at the sleep domain level, children with internalizing alone had more sleep anxiety, and those with externalizing alone had less night waking. In conclusion, children with ADHD experiencing co-occurring internalizing and externalizing comorbidities are at an increased risk of sleep problems.

   internalizing problems
AB BACKGROUND
   In the period of middle childhood, social experiences (both educational and social) may constitute a critical moment in time for the ultimate results of development in the case of an individual. Negative life events and coping skills may guarantee a positive or negative direction of development, exerting an influence on the mental health of children. In the study, a four-factor model of mental health was adopted, taking into consideration psychopathological symptoms within the scope of externalizing and internalizing disorders, the level of the performance of developmental tasks, and the sense of life satisfaction. The present study investigated the correlation between stress, coping and mental health in children in middle childhood.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   The study included 182 individuals aged between 9 and 12 years. The following aspects were subjected to assessment: the level of mental health, the number and severity of negative life events, and the strategies of coping with stress. In order to determine the strongest predictors of the four dimensions of mental health of children, hierarchical regression analysis was applied.
   RESULTS
   It was found that the strongest predictor of mental health of children in the period of middle childhood was individual and accumulated negative stress events. Lower significance was found for the subjective assessment of the severity of events being experienced. It was found that a factor protecting against disorders was active methods of coping.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The study suggests that it is not only psychopathological symptoms that constitute the negative consequence of the effect of stress. Negative stress events influence the positive dimensions of mental health, including the level of performance of developmental tasks and the sense of life satisfaction in children in the period of middle childhood. The obtained results show the specific character of the discussed period of development. However, these issues still need to be explored further.

AB Amid recent progress in cognitive development research, high-quality data resources are accumulating, and data sharing and secondary data analysis are becoming increasingly valuable tools. Integrative data analysis (IDA) is an exciting analytical framework that can enhance secondary data analysis in powerful ways. IDA pools item-level data across multiple studies to make inferences possible both within and across studies and can be used to test questions not possible in individual contributing studies. Some of the potential benefits of IDA include the ability to study longer developmental periods, examine how the measurement of key constructs changes over time, increase subject heterogeneity, and improve statistical power and capability to study rare behaviors. Our goal in this article is to provide a brief overview of the benefits and challenges of IDA in developmental research and to identify additional resources that provide more detailed discussions of this topic.

AB The objective of this study was to examine how quantity, type, and quality of care interact in predicting externalizing and internalizing behaviors of 36-month-old children attending Quebec's educational child care from their first years of life. To do so, the authors examined two hypothesized models: (1) a mediation model where quantity, type, and structural quality of care influences children's behaviors through process quality and (2) a moderation model where process quality interacts with quantity, type, and structural quality of care in influencing children's behaviors. The results of this study were consistent with the moderation model. They suggest conditions under which several features of process quality are associated with a lower occurrence of externalizing and internalizing behaviors during an important period of behavioral development and before school entry.

AB Parents of children with significant externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems habitually report greater parenting stress compared to parents of children without these challenges. One avenue to alleviate parenting stress and ameliorate youth outcomes is youth mentoring, which includes a supportive adult paired with a child with the objective of engendering positive outcomes. The researcher sought to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of mentoring programs for children with significant externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems on parenting stress and youth outcomes and (b) explore moderator variables that may influence program effectiveness. Five studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Results revealed a small effect of these specialized mentoring programs on youth outcomes and parenting stress. Moderator analyses revealed program characteristics that enhance effectiveness. Mentoring programs that target children with significant behavioral and emotional problems may function as an additional service to improve youth outcomes and family functioning.

AB Background: Adolescent males have a low rate of seeking help for mental health problems. The onset for many psychiatric disorders occur during the adolescence. Previous studies have identified previous help seeking, parental opinion, parental divorce and suicidal thoughts as factors associated with contacting mental health services. Yet studies on the rate of use of mental health services remain few, as do studies concerning factors associated with use of mental health services. Aims: To study prevalence and risk factors of use of mental health services among Finnish adolescent males. Methods : Factors associated with use of mental health services during the preceding 12 months were studied in a general population sample of 4309 men attending military call-up in 2009. The mean age was 18.3 +/- 0.45 years. Results : Within the previous 12 months, 3.2% of men had used mental health services and an additional 2.3% had considered contacting mental health services. Factors associated with service use were living alone, having a poor paternal relationship, having no contact with father, death of father, high internalizing symptoms, suicidal thoughts, regular smoking and use of illicit drugs. Frequent drunkenness was associated with mental health service use, whereas occasional use of alcohol was inversely associated with use of mental health services. Conclusions: The rate of mental health service use among males in late adolescence is very low. The inability of young people to contact service providers should be addressed more efficiently. Clinical implications: A majority of the troubled men did not contact professionals for help, although approximately a quarter of the men had a self-perceived mental health problem. A major challenge is to find ways for mental health services to be made more accessible to adolescent males.

AB Millions of children and adolescents each year are exposed to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), placing them at risk for posttraumatic stress (PTS) disorder symptoms. Medical providers play an important role in the identification and treatment of PTS, as they are typically the initial point of contact for families in the wake of a PTE or during a PTE if it is medically related (eg, injury/illness). This paper offers a review of the literature focused on clinical characteristics of PTS, the assessment and diagnosis of PTS, and current effective treatments for PTS in school-age children and adolescents. The clinical presentation of PTS is often complex as symptoms may closely resemble other internalizing and externalizing disorders. A number of screening and evaluation tools are available for medical providers to assist them in the accurate diagnosis of PTS. Treatment options are available for youth at minimal risk of PTS as well as for those with more intensive needs. Additional training regarding trauma-informed medical care may benefit medical providers. By taking a trauma-informed approach, rooted in a solid understanding of the clinical presentation of PTS in children and adolescents, medical providers can ensure PTS does not go undetected, minimize the traumatic aspects of medical care, and better promote health and well-being.

AB We examined the self-reported anxiety in different situations (social anxiety, cognitive fears, fears of injury) and the use of regulation strategies (problem orientation, problem avoidance and seeking social support) in a sample of N = 175 primary school children (mean age 8 years 4 months). At time of recruitment we oversampled for children with internalizing symptoms. In addition, mothers rated the overall anxiety of their children. According to their mothers 14.3 % of the children showed anxiety symptoms in an abnormal range which is comparable to prevalence rates of children from population samples. 19.4 % of the children described themselves as being anxious in an abnormal range. The correlations between different measures of children's self-reported anxieties were low to moderate. We found no significant correlations between mothers' and children's reports. The higher children's self-reported overall and cognitive anxiety, the more frequently they reported seeking social support in frightening situations. Girls reported more frequently pm cognitive fears than boys. Regarding regulation strategies we found that boys reported more problem orientation than girls whereas girls reported more social support seeking than boys. The results are discussed and practical implications are outlined.

AB We provide a summary of a recently published study on Psychoanalytic Child Therapy (PaCT; Gottken, White, Klein, von Klitzing, 2014) for young children with emotional and affective symptoms. Consisting of approximately 20 psychotherapy sessions, therapists treat families in parent-child, child-alone, parent-alone settings, aiming to uncover and work through a relational theme underlying the symptoms. Thirty families were entered into a wait-list controlled study in an outpatient setting (n = 18 treatment group; n = 12 waitlist) with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of PaCT (Gottken u. von Klitzing, 2014) for 4- to 10-year-olds with anxiety disorders. After treatment, over half of the children of the treatment group no longer met criteria for anxiety disorder while no children of the control group remitted during the wait-list interval. In addition, parent, child and teacher reports showed significant symptom reduction. The pattern of results lend preliminary support to psychodynamic intervention as an effective tool for treating childhood anxiety and affective disorders and call for future randomized controlled trials to provide additional evidence for these promising effects.

AB Background. Mothers' self-reported stroking of their infants over the first weeks of life modifies the association between prenatal depression and physiological and emotional reactivity at 7 months, consistent with animal studies of the effects of tactile stimulation. We now investigate whether the effects of maternal stroking persist to 2.5 years. Given animal and human evidence for sex differences in the effects of prenatal stress we compare associations in boys and girls.
   Method. From a general population sample of 1233 first-time mothers recruited at 20 weeks gestation we drew a random sample of 316 for assessment at 32 weeks, stratified by reported inter-partner psychological abuse, a risk indicator for child development. Of these mothers, 243 reported at 5 and 9 weeks how often they stroked their infants, and completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 2.5 years post-delivery.
   Results. There was a significant interaction between prenatal anxiety and maternal stroking in the prediction of CBCL internalizing (p= 0.001) and anxious/depressed scores (p< 0.001). The effects were stronger in females than males, and the three-way interaction prenatal anxietyxmaternal strokingxsex of infant was significant for internalizing symptoms (p= 0.003). The interactions arose from an association between prenatal anxiety and internalizing symptoms only in the presence of low maternal stroking.
   Conclusions. The findings are consistent with stable epigenetic effects, many sex specific, reported in animal studies. While epigenetic mechanisms may be underlying the associations, it remains to be established whether stroking affects gene expression in humans.

AB Little is known about the prevalence of clinical weight problems for youth living in residential care. Therefore, this study examined the prevalence and correlates of overweight and obesity in a large sample of youth (N = 1709) entering a residential care program. Results indicated that 48% of youth were overweight or obese at the time of intake, which is much higher than national pediatric rates. Females had higher rates of overweight/obesity, as did youth referred from moderately restrictive placements such as foster care. Youth who were overweight/obese had greater internalizing symptoms at intake. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB This article analyzes the relation between the expression of affection in the couple and the presence of psychopathological problems in children with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The sample is composed of 68 children aged 6 to 18 and their families. This work has been developed in the context of social services. The child psychopathology was assessed through the Child Behavior Inventory for parents (CBCL), and the expression of affection in the marital relationship through the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS). The study concludes that the father's level of satisfaction with the expression of affection in the relationship is negatively related to the presence of anxious/depressive symptoms, somatic symptoms, depressive isolation and internalized problems in children. The mother's expression of affection is negatively related to somatic symptoms, internalized problems, externalization of the conflict and general psychopathology of the child.

AB There is a need for longitudinal research to understand how psychopathology relates to the onset and maintenance of substance use from adolescence into young adulthood. Hence, we investigate the longitudinal, reciprocal influences of internalizing (anxiety and depression) and externalizing (oppositional defiance) symptoms on heavy episodic drinking (HED; >= 5 drinks per occasion) and alcohol-related harms in a community-based sample of youth aged 12-27 years. Participants were chosen from the Victoria Healthy Youth Survey, followed six times, biennially between 2003 and 2013 (N = 662). Analyses used cross-lagged panel models to examine reciprocal relations over time. Differences across age and sex were also tested. Defiance symptoms predicted increases in HED, which reciprocally predicted increases in defiance symptoms for females. Internalizing symptoms were related to HED within time for females. Alcohol-related harms had reciprocal positive associations with internalizing and defiance symptoms for both males and females. Associations were largely invariant across age groups, suggesting that the presence and strength of associations persisted across development. While -psychopathology preceded the onset of HED and harms, the overall findings suggest that these risk processes are mutually reinforcing across development and that youth may become entrenched in an interdependent cycle that significantly increases their risk of comorbid disorders in adulthood.

AB This study examined whether urgency, a disposition to rash action under conditions of strong emotion, moderates associations between internalizing symptoms and alcohol use and related expectancies. Data from the Camden Youth Development Study, a longitudinal, community-based study of early adolescents (N = 144, mean age at intake = 11.9 years; 65% Hispanic, 30% African-American; 50% male), were used. Self-report questionnaire measures of depressive symptoms, social and generalized anxiety symptoms, urgency, alcohol use, and alcohol expectancies were used. Mixed models were used to examine the effects of internalizing symptoms, urgency, and their interaction on alcohol use and expectancy trajectories over time. Depressive symptoms interacted with urgency such that youth with high levels of both tended to have elevated levels of global positive alcohol expectancies. Social anxiety symptoms interacted with urgency to be associated with increasing levels of social behavior alcohol expectancies such that youth with high levels of both tended to experience particular increases in these expectancies over time. Generalized anxiety was not found to be associated with alcohol-related constructs. Therefore, high levels of urgency combine with depressive and social anxiety symptoms to be associated with particularly increased risk for alcohol expectancies that are associated with later alcohol use and problems, indicating particular risk for youth with these combinations of personality traits and psychopathology symptoms.

AB Research has shown that learning disabilities are associated with internalizing problems in (pre) adolescents. In order to examine this relationship for math disability (MD), math achievement and internalizing problem scores were measured in a representative group of 1,436 (pre) adolescents. MD was defined by a discrepancy between math achievement and IQ. Internalizing problems were measured through a multi-informant (parents, teachers, self-report) approach. The results revealed that MD puts (pre) adolescents at a higher risk for internalizing problems. External and self-ratings differed between boys and girls, indicating that either they show distinct internalizing symptoms or they are being perceived differently by parents and teachers. Results emphasize the importance of both a multi-informant approach and the consideration of gender differences when measuring internalizing symptomatology of children with MD. For an optimal treatment of MD, depressive and anxious symptoms need to be considered.

AB Deficits in emotional reactivity are frequently reported in Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs). A deficit in prosocial emotions, namely the callous unemotional traits (CU), may be a mediator of emotional reactivity. Our aim is to investigate subjective emotional reactivity towards visual stimuli with different affective valence in youths with DBDs and healthy controls. The clinical sample included 62 youths with DBDs (51 males, 8 to 16 years, mean 11.3 +/- 2.1 years), the control group 53 subjects (36 males, 8 to 16 years, mean 10.8 +/- 1.5 years). The groups were compared using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU), and the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), which explores the affective (pleasant/unpleasant emotional reaction) and arousal (low/high intensity of emotion) dimensions. The DBD group presented higher scores in externalizing and internalizing CBCL scores, and in ICU callous and indifferent subscales. At the IAPS, DBD patients differed from controls in the affective valence of the images, rating less unpleasant neutral and negative images. The CU traits were the only predictor of emotional reactivity in the DBD sample. A less aversive way to interpret neutral and negative stimuli may explain why DBD patients are less responsive to negative reinforcements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appear to be more vulnerable to the development of other psychiatric disorders than the general population. The proposed neurotoxic mechanisms of manganese involve striatal dopamine neurotransmission, implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD. We investigated whether the adverse impact of manganese is particularly Pronounced in children with ADHD. Blood manganese concentration and diagnosis of ADHD were assessed in a general population of 890 children, aged 8-11 years. The main outcome measure was the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). A significant interaction was found between ADHD status and blood manganese level in predicting CBCL total problems score as well as anxiety/depression, social problems, delinquent behavior, aggressive behavior, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. The directions of the interactions indicated that blood manganese level was more positively correlated with CBCL scores in ADHD children than in the healthy population. In ADHD children, only the fifth quintile of blood manganese concentration was significantly associated with the CBCL total problems score. ADHD children may be more vulnerable than the general school-age population to the neurotoxic effects of manganese exposure, which lead to an elevated risk of developing comorbid mental conditions.

AB Background: Common negative events can precipitate the onset of internalizing symptoms. We studied whether their occurrence in childhood is associated with mental health trajectories over the course of development.
   Methods: Using data from the TEMPO study, a French community-based cohort study of youths, we studied the association between negative events in 1991 (when participants were aged 4-16 years) and internalizing symptoms, assessed by the ASEBA family of instruments in 1991, 1999, and 2009 (n=1503). Participants' trajectories of internalizing symptoms were estimated with semi-parametric regression methods (PROC TRAJ). Data were analyzed using multinomial regression models controlled for participants' sex, age, parental family status, socio-economic position, and parental history of depression.
   Results: Negative childhood events were associated with an increased likelihood of concurrent internalizing symptoms which sometimes persisted into adulthood (multivariate ORs associated with >==3 negative events respectively: high and decreasing internalizing symptoms: 5.54, 95% CI: 3.20-9.58; persistently high internalizing symptoms: 8.94, 95% CI: 2.82-28.31). Specific negative events most strongly associated with youths' persistent internalizing symptoms included: school difficulties (multivariate OR: 5.31, 95% CI: 2.24-12.59), parental stress (multivariate OR: 4.69, 95% CI: 2.02-10.87), serious illness/health problems (multivariate OR: 4.13, 95% CI: 1.76-9.70), and social isolation (multivariate OR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.00-5.08).
   Conclusions: Common negative events can contribute to the onset of children's lasting psychological difficulties.

AB Children born very preterm are exposed to repeated neonatal procedures that induce pain and stress during hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The COMT Va1158Met genotype is involved with pain sensitivity, and early life stress is implicated in altered expression of methylation of the serotonin transporter. We examined: (1) whether methylation of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter differs between very preterm children and full-term controls at school age, (2) relationships with child behavior problems, and (3) whether the extent of neonatal pain exposure interacts with the COMT Va1158Met genotype to predict SLC6A4 methylation at 7 years in the very preterm children. We examined the associations between the COMT genotypes, neonatal pain exposure (adjusted for neonatal clinical confounders), SLC6A4 methylation and behavior problems. Very preterm children had significantly higher methylation at 7/10 CpG sites in the SLC6A4 promoter compared to full-term controls at 7 years. Neonatal pain (adjusted for clinical confounders) was significantly associated with total child behavior problems on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) questionnaire (adjusted for concurrent stressors and 5HTTLPR genotype) (p = 0.035). CBCL Total Problems was significantly associated with greater SLC6A4 methylation in very preterm children (p = 0.01). Neonatal pain (adjusted for clinical confounders) and COMT Met/Met genotype were associated with SLC6A4 promoter methylation in very preterm children at 7 years (p = 0.001). These findings provide evidence that both genetic predisposition and early environment need to be considered in understanding susceptibility for developing behavioral problems in this vulnerable population.

AB The prevalence of depression is high in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), but its etiology has not yet been studied in this group. Emotion dysregulation is a well-known contributor to the development of depression in typically developing (TD) children, which might also apply to children with ASD. In this study, we examined the longitudinal relationship between three different ways of emotion regulation (approach, avoidance and worry/rumination) and depressive symptoms in children with ASD and a group of TD children which were compatible with the ASD group (age 9-15-years old). Children filled out self-report questionnaires at 3 time points (with a 9-month break between each session). To account for missing data multiple imputations were used. A regression model with clustered bootstrapping was used to establish which factors contributed to depression and to identify possible differences between the ASD and TD group. Approach and avoidant strategies prevented the development of depressive symptoms in both respective groups, whereas elevated levels of worry/rumination in turn increased children's depressive symptoms. Besides differences in absolute levels (children with ASD scored higher on symptoms of depression and lower on approach strategies than the TD group), no other differences between the groups emerged.

AB Background: Some evidence suggests that children with specific behavioral problems are at risk for motor problems. It is unclear whether neurological condition plays a role in the propensity of children with behavioral problems to develop Motor problems.
   Aims: To examine the relation between behavioral problems, motor performance and neurological condition in school-aged children.
   Study design: Cross-sectional study.
   Subjects: 174 children (95 boys) receiving mainstream education and 106 children (82 boys) receiving special education aged 6 to 13 years (mean 9 y 7 m, SD 1 y 10 m).
   Outcome measures: Behavior was assessed with questionnaires: the parental Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher's Report Form (TRF). Motor performance was assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC). MABC-scores >= 5th percentile were considered as age-adequate and scores <5th percentile indicated definite motor problems. Neurological condition was assessed in terms of Minor Neurological Dysfunction (MND).
   Results: The majority of specific behavioral problems were associated with definite motor problems, except somatic complaints and rule breaking behavior. Children with externalizing problems, according to the CBCL or TRF, and motor problems had more often MND than children with externalizing problems only. The same holds true for internalizing problems according to the CBCL
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that various forms of behavioral problems were associated with motor problems. Especially children with motor and behavioral problems showed MND. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines long-term effects of a transition to parenthood program, Family Foundations, designed to enhance child outcomes through a strategic focus on supporting the coparenting relationship. Roughly 5 to 7 years after baseline (pregnancy), parent and teacher reports of internalizing and externalizing problems and school adjustment were collected by mail for 98 children born to couples enrolled in the randomized trial. Teachers reported significantly lower levels of internalizing problems among children in the intervention group compared with children in the control group and, consistent with prior findings at age 3, lower levels of externalizing problems for boys in the intervention group. Baseline level of observed couple negative communication moderated intervention effects for parent and teacher report of child adjustment and teacher report of school adjustment and adaptation. Effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.98. Results indicate that relatively brief preventive programs for couples at the transition to parenthood have the capacity to promote long-term positive benefits for children's adjustment. Although we attended to missing data issues in several ways, high levels of attrition in this long-term follow-up study is a cause for caution.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate and compare emotional and behavioral problems in Turkish adoptees and non-adopted peers raised by their biological parents.
   Materials and Methods: The study included 61 adopted children (34 female and 27 male) aged 6-18 years and 62 age- and gender-matched non-adopted children (35 female and 27 male). Parents rated their children's problem behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist/6-18, temperament characteristics using the School Age Temperament Inventory, their own personality traits using the Basic Personality Traits Inventory, and their parenting styles using the Measure of Child Rearing Styles. Children rated their parents' availability and reliability as attachment figures using the Kerns Security Scale and parenting styles using the Measure of Child Rearing Styles. Adolescents aged 1118 years self-rated their problem behaviors using the Youth Self Report. Group differences and correlations were analyzed.
   Results: There were non-significant differences in all scale scores between the adopted and non-adopted groups. In contrast to the literature, age of the children at the time of adoption was not associated with problem behaviors or attachment relationships. On the other hand, the findings indicate that as the age at which the children learned that they had been adopted increased emotional and behavioral problems increased.
   Conclusion: Adoption alone could not explain the problem behaviors observed in the adopted children; the observed problem behaviors should be considered within the context of the developmental process.

AB Children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) are at increased risk of experiencing behavioral difficulties including externalizing and internalizing problems. While there is mounting evidence about mental health problems in children exposed to IPV, most of the research to date focuses on IPV exposure as a unitary, homogeneous construct. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between subtypes of IPV exposure on child functioning and presence of harm within a child welfare sample. Given the evidence of the "double whammy" effect, co-occurring 1PV exposure was also examined. Using data from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect - 2008 (n = 2,184) we examined whether specific IPV exposure subtypes or their co-occurrence resulted in a greater risk of child maladjustment. Information was obtained from child welfare workers' reports. Caregiver and household risk factors were also examined. Co-occurring IPV exposure resulted in the greatest risk for reported child maladjustment. Exposure to emotional IPV and direct physical IPV were significantly associated with increased risk of internalizing problems and presence of harm. Caregiver mental health and lack of social support emerged as significant risk factors for behavior problems. This study adds to the evidence that exposure to subtypes of IPV may be differentially related to child functioning. Given that risk factors and child functioning is part of the decision-making framework for case worker referrals, this study provides important preliminary evidence about how the child welfare system operates in practice with respect to sub-types of exposure to IPV. These findings suggest that intervening with children exposed to different types of 1PV may require a tailored approach. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current study extends research on the effects of institutionalization, most notably by examining whether-and how-both pre-institutional maltreatment in the family and the stability and consistency of institutional care interact to shape emotional and behavioral development. Fifty Portuguese children, placed in residential institutions when 8 days to 26 months of age, were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist when aged 18-31 months. Caregiver-rated internalizing and externalizing behavior problems proved to be unrelated to both early family and institutional experiences, as main effects, but the interaction of these factors significantly predicted externalizing problems: a history of maltreatment in the family coupled with unstable institutional caregiving arrangements predicted especially elevated levels of externalizing problems. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of more distal and proximate developmental experiences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is argued that the adolescent onset of social anxiety disorder (SAD) may be partly attributable to an increase in avoidance of social situations across this period. The current cohort-sequential study investigated developmental pathways of social avoidance in adolescence and examined the explanatory role of social anxiety and negative cognitive processes. A community sample of youth (9-21 years, N=331) participated in a four-wave study. Trajectory analyses revealed two pathways; an increased avoidance pathway and a low avoidance pathway. The pathways were hardly distinguishable at age 9 and they steadily diverged across adolescence. Logistic regression analyses showed that social anxiety and post-event rumination were significantly related to the increased avoidance pathway; anticipatory processing and self-focused attention were not. The findings suggest that adolescence is a key developmental period for the progression of social avoidance among youth who show relatively high levels of social anxiety and post-event rumination.

AB This study investigated the consistency of discrepancy scores between adolescent and parent reports across several psychosocial constructs (adolescent internalizing, externalizing, emotion regulation difficulties, parent rewarding responses to adolescent emotions, and parent depressive symptoms). Sixty-two adolescents (67.7% females; 76.7% African American) and one of their parents participated. Most of the associations among discrepancy scores were equivalent. There was one instance in which the association among two discrepancy scores (youth internalizing and externalizing) was stronger than the others and one instance in which the association was weaker than the others (youth internalizing and parent rewarding). These results suggest that discrepancies between adolescent and parent reports are not necessarily a stable characteristic of the dyad and depend on the construct under consideration.

AB Objective: There are no published studies examining concurrent associations between temperament and behavior during toddlerhood in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (OBD), a population at high familial risk for psychopathology. Better understanding of early determinants contributing to well-being or mental illness in this high-risk population has the potential to aid in the identification of problem domains to be targeted clinically, and facilitate the development of early intervention and prevention initiatives for an appropriate subgroup of children at the youngest possible age.
   Methods: A total of 30 offspring of mothers with BD (mean age=25.4 +/- 4.9 months) participated in this study at Emory University. The mothers completed the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: The results of the correlational analyses indicated that the broad temperament dimension Negative Affectivity and the individual ECBQ scales Sadness and Shyness were positively associated with the broad CBCL dimension Internalizing Problems, whereas Sociability was negatively associated with Internalizing Problems. In addition, the temperament scales Soothability and Frustration were negatively and positively associated with Internalizing Problems, respectively. All ECBQ scales included in the broad temperament dimension Effortful Control, except for Cuddliness, were significantly negatively associated with the broad CBCL dimension Externalizing Problems. A significant sex difference was found for the ECBQ scale Positive Anticipation and the CBCL scale Sleep Problems, with a higher mean rank score for girls than for boys.
   Conclusions: This is the first systematic investigation of temperament and behavior and concurrent associations between these two domains in toddlers of mothers with BD. The present findings provide a platform for future investigations of the contribution of temperament and early behavior to potential well-being or mental illness in OBD.

ID MALTREATMENT
AB Despite the fact that neglect ranks among the most common forms of reported childhood maltreatment, there is a lack of agreement regarding its precise description and nosology.
   This article gives recommendations regarding a comprehensive assessment of neglect and the various subtypes, emphasizes the complexities of its definition and incidence and demarcates the boundaries relative to other forms of maltreatment.
   This article summarizes the current empirical literature as well as preliminary descriptive results drawn from the "analyzing pathways from childhood maltreatment to internalizing symptoms and disorders in children and adolescents (AMIS)" research project regarding the frequency of neglect within a sample of 4-16-year-olds drawn from the Leipzig Child Protective Services (CPS). Maltreatment experiences were assessed using standardized interviews with caregivers as well as detailed analysis of the CPS records using the maltreatment classification system (MCS).
   Emotional and physical neglect represent the most common forms of neglect in this CPS sample. Due to the poorly defined criteria emotional neglect may present the greatest challenge for assessment.
   Effective interventional efforts hinge on an objective and multidimensional assessment of neglect, while taking the severity, frequency, duration, the perpetrator as well as the developmental period of the child into account.

AB This study explored the directionality of the relations between global life satisfaction (LS) and internalizing and externalizing behaviors using a sample of regular education students who were initially enrolled in Grade 7 (n = 470). Self-report measures of internalizing and externalizing behaviors and LS were administered on 2 occasions, 6 months apart, to students from a Southeastern U.S. middle school. Short-term longitudinal analyses revealed that neither externalizing behaviors nor internalizing behaviors at Time 1 predicted LS at Time 2. However, LS at Time 1 predicted externalizing behaviors at Time 2. LS at Time 1 also predicted internalizing behaviors at Time 2, but the results were moderated by student gender. At higher levels of LS, boys reported lower levels of internalizing behaviors at Time 2. The overall results suggested that lower levels of LS are an antecedent of increased maladaptive behaviors among early adolescents. Alternatively, higher levels of LS may be a protective factor against subsequent externalizing behaviors among boys and girls and internalizing behaviors among boys. Furthermore, the results provide further support for the discriminant validity of positive and negative measures of mental health and suggest that LS measures may provide useful information for comprehensive adolescent health screening and monitoring systems.

AB Despite the increasing prevalence of 3-generation family households (grandparent, parent, child), relatively little research has studied these households during early childhood. Using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (N = similar to 6,550), this study investigated the associations between 3-generation coresidence in early childhood and school readiness, and how the associations differed by maternal age, race/ethnicity, nativity, relationship status, and poverty. For the full sample of children, no associations between 3-generation coresidence and school readiness were found. Analyses by demographic characteristics found that race/ethnicity and nativity moderated the associations, whereas maternal age, relationship status, and poverty did not. The study found that 3-generation coresidence was associated with lower levels of expressive language for White, Asian, and Black children but more expressive language for Hispanic children. Coresidence was also associated with more externalizing behavior for White and American Indian/Alaskan Native children but less externalizing behavior for Hispanic and Black children. Analyses by maternal nativity found that for children of immigrant mothers, 3-generation coresidence was associated with more expressive language and less externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Interactions between race/ethnicity and nativity found that the positive associations for Hispanic children were concentrated among children of immigrant parents. No differences were found between grandmother-only and grandmother/grandfather 3-generation family households. Overall, the findings suggest there may be heterogeneity by race/ethnicity and nativity in the associations between 3-generation coresidence and school readiness.

AB Working memory (WM) deficits have been shown to be associated with core ADHD symptoms, worse academic achievement and peer-relationship problems. Internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, have also been associated with impaired WM performance. However, the association of anxiety and depression and WM performance remains unclear for children and adolescents with ADHD. Further, it is unknown how these comorbid conditions might affect WM performance in the two main ADHD subtypes. The association of anxiety and depression and the specific components of spatial (SWM) and verbal working memory (VWM) were examined in 303 children and adolescents with ADHD, combined type (ADHD-CT) and 77 ADHD, inattentive type (ADHD-IA) compared to 128 age- and gender-matched typically developing participants. The relationship between anxiety and depression and WM was assessed using multiple linear regression analyses and separate simple regression analyses. Higher levels of anxiety/depression were associated with (1) increased between-search errors in the typically developing participants alone, (2) a better strategy performance in the ADHD-CT group, and (3) a better spatial span performance in the ADHD-IA group. VWM was equally impaired in the ADHD-CT and ADHD-IA groups, independent of the levels of anxiety and depression. The results suggest that the effects of internalizing symptoms on WM differ in typically developing children and adolescents compared to those with ADHD. Further, high levels of anxiety and depression modified WM performance differently according to the specific ADHD subtypes. This might help explain contradictory findings observed in previous studies of mixed samples of participants with ADHD-CT and ADHD-IA.

AB Childhood behavioral problems have been associated with earlier childbearing, but their life-course reproductive consequences are unknown. The present study examined whether and how behavioral problems assessed in childhood predict fertility patterns over the life course in women and men. Participants were 9,472 individuals from the British National Child Development Study (4,739 men and 4,733 women). Childhood externalizing and internalizing behaviors were rated by teachers at ages 7 and 11. Information on fertility history was derived from interviews at ages 33, 42, and 46, including date of pregnancy, whether the pregnancy was planned or non-planned, and pregnancy outcome (live birth, miscarriages/stillbirth, induced abortion). Transition to parenthood and fertility rate were assessed using survival analysis and age-stratified regression models. In both sexes, higher externalizing behavior was associated with higher rate of pregnancies, especially non-planned pregnancies in adolescence and early adulthood, but this association attenuated or even reversed later in adulthood. Internalizing behavior was associated with lower pregnancy rates, especially planned pregnancies and later in adulthood, and particularly in men. In women, higher internalizing behavior was also associated with earlier transition to parenthood. Externalizing behavior in women predicted higher risk of miscarriages and induced abortions, while internalizing behavior predicted lower risk for these outcomes. These findings suggest that childhood behavioral problems have long-term associations with fertility behavior over the life course, including earlier transition to parenthood, lower probability of normative family formation later in adulthood, and higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB Objective: To review published reports on Web-based treatment and prevention programs for depression, anxiety, and suicide prevention in children, adolescents, and emerging adults. Method: A systematic search of the PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science databases was conducted in December 2013. Programs were classified according to evidence-base level (Well-Established, Probably Efficacious, Possibly Efficacious, Experimental, and Of Questionable Efficacy). Results: Of the 14,001 citations initially identified, 25 articles met inclusion criteria for Web-based interventions. These described 9 programs, of which 8 were Internet based and 1 was a mobile application. No Web-based interventions for suicide prevention were identified. Of the randomized controlled trials (n = 14) and open trials (n = 3) identified, 10 reported significant postintervention reductions in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety or improvements in diagnostic ratings, with small to large effect sizes. Many of these studies also reported significant improvements at follow-up. The methodological quality of the studies varied. Many programs were limited by their small sample sizes and use of waitlist or no-treatment control groups. Conclusion: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of Web-based interventions for youth depression and anxiety. Additional research and program development are needed to fill the current gaps in the literature.

AB Group-based modeling techniques are increasingly used in developmental studies to explore the patterns and co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing problems. Social competence has been found to reciprocally influence internalizing and externalizing problems, but studies on its associations with different patterns of these problems are scarce. Using data from a Finnish longitudinal normal population sample, trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems were formed using the Child Behavior Checklist completed by the mother at the child's age of 4- to 5-years-old, 8- to 9-years-old, and 16- to 17-years-old (N=261). The results indicate that adolescent's self-reported internalizing and externalizing problems based on the Youth Self Report were associated with the trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems. Social competence both in early childhood and in adolescence was poorer among children with chronic internalizing problems and among those with adolescent-onset externalizing problems. One-third of the children who had a chronically high level of internalizing problems had an initially high but decreasing level of externalizing problems, while 33% of the adolescents with adolescent-onset externalizing problems had a chronically high level of internalizing problems. School psychologists are encouraged to screen for internalizing problems from children with behavioral, academic or social problems.

ID EATING-DISORDERS; INTERNET; GIRLS; DISSATISFACTION
AB In this paper we provide a commentary on Perloff's theoretical perspectives and agenda for research that examines the effects of social media on young women's body image concerns. Social media are the main form of mass media being used by the youth of today, and researchers in the U.S. and Australia have commenced studying how these may be affecting body image concerns. However, the processes underlying how social media may influence young people's body image appear to be no different from underlying other forms of mass media. Research is needed to more fully evaluate youth's experiences of online appearance culture and how this may foster both negative and positive peer interactions. We also need more studies which compare the influences on social media with other media forms as there is no clear evidence that social networking sites and other forms of social media are more detrimental to one's body image than other forms of media. We also consider factors that may protect young people from internalizing appearance ideals that are promoted by the mass media. In addition, we consider broader conceptualizations of body image so that a wider range of human experiences can be studied.

AB This study investigated the impact of infant maltreatment on juvenile rhesus monkeys' behavioral reactivity to novel stimuli and its associations with amygdala volume. Behavioral reactivity to novel stimuli of varying threat intensity was measured using Approach/Avoidance (AA) and Human Intruder (HI) tasks. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure amygdala volume. Interestingly, group behavioral differences were context-dependent. When exposed to a human intruder, maltreated subjects displayed more anxious behaviors than controls; however, when presented with fear-evoking objects, maltreated animals exhibited increased aggression and a shorter latency to inspect the objects. Finally, under testing conditions with the lowest levels of threat (neutral novel objects) maltreated animals also showed shorter latencies to inspect objects, and reduced avoidance and increased exploration compared to controls. This suggests alterations in threat assessment and less behavioral inhibition in animals with early adverse experience compared to controls. Some of these behavioral responses were associated with amygdala volume, which was positively correlated with abuse rates received during infancy, particularly reflecting a relationship with exploration, consistent with previous studies.

AB Parental intrusiveness is associated with internalizing problems in healthy children. Given the unique demands that childhood cancer places on parents, it is important to determine whether intrusiveness operates differently in survivors of childhood cancer. The current study tested whether cancer survivorship moderates the relation between maternal directiveness-one aspect of intrusiveness-and children's internalizing problems. Survivors (7-12 years old) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 25) and their mothers, and healthy controls (n = 22) and their mothers engaged in parent-child interactions. Mothers completed a measure of children's psychosocial adjustment, and observations of 10-min parent-child interactions were obtained. Cancer survivorship moderated the relation between directiveness and children's withdrawn/depressed symptoms. Maternal directiveness was associated with increased withdrawn/depressed symptoms for children in the control group. This association was not significant for survivors of ALL. Findings suggest that childhood cancer may alter the context in which children experience maternal directiveness.

AB The goals of the current study were to apply the construct of stereotype accuracy to the domain of college women's perceptions of the effects of full-time maternal employment on children. Both accuracy/inaccuracy and positive/negative direction were examined. Participants were 1,259 college women who provided stereotyped projections about the effects of full-time employment on children's IQ scores, formal achievement tests, school grades, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Their stereotype effect sizes were compared to meta-analytic effect sizes used to estimate the actual effects of maternal employment on children. Individual differences in these stereotypes were also examined. Results indicate that, on average, college women overestimated the negative effects of full-time maternal employment on child outcomes, especially behavior problems. Significant variability in the direction and accuracy of the stereotypes was explained by individual characteristics such as gender ideology, extrinsic work values, and beliefs about the costs of maternal employment. Concerns are that college-educated young women may retreat from the labor force due to stereotypes about the effects of their future employment on children. Efforts by researchers, practitioners, and policy makers should be directed toward disseminating accurate information and dispelling myths about the likely impact of maternal employment on children's development.

AB In a time of economic recession, identifying how economic stress may be related to parenting stress, to the parenting behaviors used by mothers and fathers, and to young children's behavior problems may provide insight into interventions that may best assist families through their own economic crises. As part of this study, 124 culturally diverse parents with young children who ranged in age from 2- to 6-years rated their own economic, life, and parenting stress; their parenting behaviors; and their young children's behavior problems. Hierarchical regression analyses suggested that negative economic events and parenting stress provide unique incremental variance in predicting young children's internalizing problems, whereas life stress and parenting stress provide unique incremental variance in predicting young children's externalizing problems. With closer examination, parenting stress fully mediated the relationship between parents' financial cutbacks and young children's internalizing problems and the relationship between parents' negative economic events and young children's externalizing problems. These findings suggested that these variables are important to examine collectively.

AB This study investigated the socio-demographic characteristics and emotional and behavioral factors associated with the perceived need and actual use of adolescent mental health services according to genders in Korea. We assessed 1,857 middle school students aged 14-16 years. We administered a self-reported questionnaire including questions on their socio-demographic data, Korean Youth Self Report, and self perceived need and actual use of mental health services. Overall, 11.6 % of the adolescents demonstrated a self perceived need for mental health services regarding their emotional or behavioral problems, while 2.1 % had sought mental health services. There were discrepancies between the perceived need and actual use. Most adolescents (81.6 %) used mental health services without self-perceived need, and only 3.3 % of adolescents with self-perceived need utilized mental health services. The perceived need of mental health services is positively influenced by the adolescent's anxious/depressed problems in both genders. The use of them is negatively influenced by the withdrawn problem in adolescent boys, while positively influenced by the aggressive behavior in adolescent girls. To increase the actual use of mental health services more attention needs to be focused on their internalizing problems, such as anxious/depressed and withdrawn problems, in addition to externalizing problems in both genders.

AB The primary aim was to examine the associations of hypothesized maternal and paternal risk factors with course of depression diagnosis in a community sample from ages 15-20. In addition, we describe longitudinal stability and change in depression diagnosis over this period. In the Youth and Mental Health study 242 adolescents completed questionnaires and the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime interview at ages 15 and 20, and risk factors were measured by parent report including the Adult Self Report. Both groups who remained depressed and who recovered were more likely to have mothers with internalizing problems. Paternal internalizing problems was also significantly associated with course of depression. These findings suggest treatment of depression in adolescents and young adults may benefit from consideration of the parents' internalizing symptoms.

AB Given theoretical and empirical support for the importance of peer play within the preschool classroom to early learning, the present study tested the hypothesis that associations between teacher-reported problem behavior and academic skills were mediated by difficulties in peer play (disruptive and disconnected play), for a representative sample (N = 507 children across 46 classrooms) enrolled in a large urban Head Start program. The study also tested whether mediation was moderated by child sex (e.g., whether the mechanism through which problem behavior was associated with learning differed for boys and girls) controlling for the multilevel nature of these data. Findings from structural equation models provided evidence for partial mediation, whereby associations between internalizing behavior and academic skills were partially explained through their effects on disconnected play; however, mediation was present for girls only. Implications for theory, research, and practice are discussed as they support low-income children's social and academic development through the context of peer play.

AB Studies document that there are efficacious interventions to prevent adolescent depression and internalizing symptoms, including several family-focused interventions. Questions remain about for whom interventions work (moderation) and by what mechanisms they work (mediation) to prevent internalizing symptoms. Unfortunately, single trials are often underpowered to address moderation and mediation, an issue addressed in this paper. This synthesis study combined individual-level, longitudinal data from 721 adolescents across 3 randomized clinical trials of Familias Unidas, a family-focused prevention intervention for Hispanic youth. Using integrative data analysis (IDA) methods applied to trials, the study examined intervention moderation and mediation effects on internalizing symptoms. Baseline internalizing symptoms were a significant moderator of the intervention's effects on internalizing symptoms, while baseline externalizing symptoms did not moderate intervention effects. Baseline parent-adolescent communication, a modifiable risk factor and hypothesized mechanism by which the intervention works, significantly moderated the intervention's effects. Specifically, the intervention was more efficacious in its impact on internalizing symptoms for youth with lower initial levels of parent-adolescent communication compared to those with higher communication levels. Moderated mediation analyses showed that parent-adolescent communication changes mediated the intervention's effects on internalizing symptoms, with stronger effects for those with poorer baseline communication. Results suggest a potential benefit of identifying youth risks prior to interventions, and targeting specific modifiable mediators that lead to reductions of internalizing problems of adolescents. Findings also highlight advantages of utilizing data from combined trials and IDA for examining intervention moderators and mediators.

AB This 5-year follow-up of a randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of a family-focused intervention delivered in middle school to increase school engagement following transition to high school (2 years post-test), and also evaluated mediated effects through school engagement on multiple problem outcomes in late adolescence (5 years post-test). The study sample included 516 Mexican American adolescents who participated in a randomized trial of the Bridges to High School Program (Bridges/Puentes). Path models representing the direct and indirect effects of the program on four outcome variables were evaluated using school engagement measured in the 9th grade as a mediator. The program significantly increased school engagement, with school engagement mediating intervention effects on internalizing symptoms, adolescent substance use, and school dropout in late adolescence when most adolescents were in the 12th grade. Effects on substance use were stronger for youth at higher risk based on pretest report of substance use initiation. There were no direct or indirect intervention effects on externalizing symptoms. Findings support that school engagement is an important prevention target for Mexican American adolescents.

AB Teachers serve as the natural raters of students within the school and classroom contexts. Yet teachers' ratings of their students may vary based on these contextual factors. The current study explored the extent to which teacher perceptions of the school environment predict their longitudinal ratings of student behaviors. Data for this study come from 702 teachers in 42 elementary schools. Teachers self-reported their perceptions of the school context at a single time point, and provided ratings of their students' behavior via the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaption-Checklist (TOCA-C) across three school years. Latent profile analysis identified three latent classes of teachers based on their ratings of school organizational health, burnout, and efficacy. A regression framework demonstrated an association between the baseline profiles in relation to TOCA-C ratings of student b(e)havior across 3 years. Teachers with more favorable perceptions of the environment had lower initial ratings of concentration problems, disruptive behavior, and internalizing symptoms, and higher ratings of prosocial behaviors and family involvement. They also showed slower growth in their ratings of emotion dysregulation and greater increases of their ratings of family involvement over time. This work is particularly important for determining the extent to which teacher ratings may be biased by teacher and contextual factors, and may have implications for the identification of teachers who may rate students poorly over time.

AB Insensitive and unresponsive caregiving during infancy has been linked to externalizing behavior problems during childhood and adolescence. The 7-repeat (7r) allele of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene has meta-analytically been associated with a heightened susceptibility to adverse as well as supportive environments. In the present study, we examined long-term effects of early maternal care, DRD4 genotype and the interaction thereof on externalizing and internalizing psychopathology during adolescence. As part of an ongoing epidemiological cohort study, early maternal care was assessed at child's age 3 months during a nursing and playing situation. In a sample of 296 offspring, externalizing and internalizing symptoms were assessed using a psychiatric interview conducted at age 15 years. Parents additionally filled out a questionnaire on their children's psychopathic behaviors. Results indicated that adolescents with the DRD4 7r allele who experienced less responsive and stimulating early maternal care exhibited more symptoms of ADHD and CD/ODD as well as higher levels of psychopathic behavior. In accordance with the hypothesis of differential susceptibility, 7r allele carriers showed fewer ADHD symptoms and lower levels of psychopathic behavior when exposed to especially beneficial early caregiving. In contrast, individuals without the DRD4 7r allele proved to be insensitive to the effects of early maternal care. This study replicates earlier findings with regard to an interaction between DRD4 genotype and early caregiving on externalizing behavior problems in preschoolers. It is the first one to imply continuity of this effect until adolescence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The factorial structure of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU; Frick 2004) has been inconsistent across previous studies using different rater versions (self-report, parent, teacher) and versions in different languages applied to both clinical and nonreferred samples predominantly of adolescents. The present study examined the factorial structure of the parent-report version of the ICU in a clinical sample of boys aged 6-12 years with Oppositional Defiant Disorder/Conduct Disorder (n = 131) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Results from the CFA supported previous findings, but even the preferred model with three independent factors (Callousness, Uncaring, and Unemotional) showed inadequate model fit. Subsequent EFA revealed a three-factor model consisting of two new subscales (Callousness/Lack of Guilt or Remorse, Unconcerned about Performance) and the original subscale Unemotional. Internal consistencies of the three subscales and total score were satisfactory, and intercorrelations of the subscales were weak, except for a moderate correlation between the subscales Callousness/Lack of Guilt or Remorse and Unconcerned about Performance. The corresponding subscales of the original and new versions were highly correlated. As expected, the ICU subscale Callousness/Lack of Guilt or Remorse showed associations with other measures of aggressive and oppositional behavior. The other two ICU subscales were not associated with aggression or oppositional/antisocial behavior, but Unconcerned about Performance correlated with a measure of attention problems and Unemotional correlated with the internalizing problem withdrawn. The implications of these findings are discussed, especially as a callous unemotional specifier for the diagnosis of Conduct Disorder is included in DSM-5.

AB Children with ADHD often demonstrate sudden and intense shifts in both positive and negative affect. This study examined the role of diagnostic status on emotional impulsivity in children utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Parents of 64 8-12 year old children (15 ADHD-only; 27 ADHD-comorbid; 22 control) completed a diagnostic structured interview and then an EMA protocol, rating the child's affect thrice daily for 28 days. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) suggested that children with ADHD and a comorbid disorder demonstrated significantly more EMA-derived emotional impulsivity than children with ADHD only and control children. No difference was found between children with ADHD only and control children. This study suggested that children with ADHD demonstrate significantly higher levels of emotional impulsivity than control children only in the presence of a comorbid disorder.

AB Data on youth emotional and behavioral problems from societies in Sub-Saharan Africa are lacking. This may be due to the fact that few youth mental health assessments have been tested for construct validity of syndrome structure across multicultural societies that include developing countries, and almost none have been tested in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Youth Self-Report (YSR), for example, has shown great consistency of its syndrome structure across many cultures, yet data from only one developing country in Sub-Saharan Africa have been included. In this study, we test the factor structure of YSR syndromes among Kenyan youth ages 11-18 years from an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya and examine sex-differences in levels of emotional and behavioral problems. We find the eight syndrome structure of the YSR to fit these data well (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.049). While Kenyan girls have significantly higher internalizing (Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, Somatic) problem scores than boys, these differences are of similar magnitude to published multicultural findings. The results support the generalizability of the YSR syndrome structure to Kenyan youth and are in line with multicultural findings supporting the YSR as an assessment of emotional and behavioral problems in diverse societies.

AB Earlier physical maturation may often be preceded by a range of adversities and life stressors. This study investigates childhood maltreatment, internalizing symptoms, and pubertal timing in girls residing in foster care (N=100, M=11.54years old at Time 1). Girls were assessed at two time points 2years apart. There were no direct effects of maltreatment on internalizing symptoms; rather, childhood sexual abuse predicted earlier pubertal development which, in turn, was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms concurrently and longitudinally. This distinctive role for early pubertal timing suggests that the heightened sexual circumstances of puberty may be especially disturbing for girls whose lives have already been disrupted by inappropriate and unwanted sexual experiences.

AB Background. A congenital heart defect (CHD) can increase the risk of mental health problems in affected children and their parents. The extent to which risk factors for these problems are shared in families or are specific to the individual family member is unclear.
   Method. Prospective data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa; n=93 009) were linked with a nationwide CHD registry, and 408 children with CHD were identified. Mothers' reports on child internalizing problems and their own distress were assessed by questionnaires at child ages 6, 18 and 36 months. A structural model was applied to distinguish between familial (shared) factors and individual-specific factors for mental health problems.
   Results. CHD was a substantial risk factor for problems in children and their mothers at all time points. CHD contributed on average 31% and 39% to the variance in children's and mothers' problems respectively. Both shared familial and individual-specific factors unique to CHD families contributed to risk for mental health problems. Whereas individual-specific risk factors contributed to the stability of problems in mothers, the effect of these factors lasted only a short time in children. Mutual influences over time were found between the mother's and the child's mental health at 18 and 36 months.
   Conclusions. The burden of CHD in a child is shared between family members but is also specific to the individual. This study points to a need for both an individual and a family-based approach to provide psychological support to children with CHD and their parents.

AB Emotion regulation (ER) difficulties are a potential common factor underlying the presentation of multiple emotional and behavioral problems in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To provide an overview of how ER has been studied in individuals with ASD, we conducted a systematic review of the past 20 years of ER research in the ASD population, using established keywords from the most comprehensive ER literature review of the typically developing population to date. Out of an initial sampling of 305 studies, 32 were eligible for review. We examined the types of methods (self-report, informant report, naturalistic observation/ behavior coding, physiological, and open-ended) and the ER constructs based on Gross and Thompson's modal model (situation selection, situation modification, attention deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation). Studies most often assessed ER using one type of method and from a unidimensional perspective. Across the 32 studies, we documented the types of measures used and found that 38% of studies used self-report, 44% included an informant report measure, 31% included at least one naturalistic observation/behavior coding measure, 13% included at least one physiological measure, and 13% included at least one open-ended measure. Only 25% of studies used more than one method of measurement. The findings of the current review provide the field with an in-depth analysis of various ER measures and how each measure taps into an ER framework. Future research can use this model to examine ER in a multicomponent way and through multiple methods. (c) 2014 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Although poor parenting is known to be closely linked to self-regulation difficulties in early childhood, comparatively little is understood about the role of other risk factors in the early caregiving environment (such as a parent's own experiences of childhood abuse) in developmental pathways of self-regulation into adolescence. Using a longitudinal design, this study aimed to examine how a mother's history of abuse in childhood relates to her offspring's self-regulation difficulties in preadolescence. Maternal controlling parenting and exposure to intimate partner aggression in the child's first 24-36 months were examined as important early social and environmental influences that may explain the proposed connection between maternal abuse history and preadolescent self-regulation. An ethnically diverse sample of mothers (N=488) who were identified as at-risk for child maltreatment was recruited at the time of their children's birth. Mothers and their children were assessed annually from the child's birth through 36 months, and at age 9-11 years. Structural equation modeling and bootstrap tests of indirect effects were conducted to address the study aims. Findings indicated that maternal abuse history indirectly predicted their children's self-regulation difficulties in preadolescence mainly through maternal controlling parenting in early childhood, but not through maternal exposure to aggression by an intimate partner. Maternal history of childhood abuse and maternal controlling parenting in her child's early life may have long-term developmental implications for child self-regulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Few periods of the life span are as dynamic, tumultuous, and emotionally salient as puberty. The combination of biological and social change during this transition contributes to sweeping shifts in the prevalence and nature of psychopathology. In this article, I highlight the role of puberty in psychological well-being, reviewing both individual and population-wide trends in psychological symptoms and disorders. Emphasis is on three domains associated with maturation: typicality of symptoms, epidemiological shifts, and individual differences.

AB Children with histories of child abuse and neglect, particularly children residing in foster or adoptive homes, are commonly considered by many professionals to need "attachment therapy" in order to address emotional and behavioral needs. However, evidence-based treatments rarely utilize an attachment-based justification outside of the infancy through preschooler age range. In actuality, many evidence-based treatments can be understood through the lens of attachment theory. This paper reviews the tenets of an attachment-based approach to treatment and describes how one evidence-based treatment, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), conforms to all expectations and requirements prescribed by attachment theory and research. Next, pilot data from an open trial of PCIT with a sample of adopted children and their adoptive caregivers (n = 85) are provided. Results demonstrate significant improvements in positive parenting techniques, reductions in parenting stress, and reductions in externalizing and internalizing concerns among the children. These results are discussed in the context of improving the quality of care for children often described as in need of "attachment therapy." (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although efficacious psychological treatments for internalizing disorders are now well established for school-aged children, until recently there have regrettably been limited empirical efforts to clarify indicated psychological intervention methods for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders presenting in early childhood. Young children lack many of the developmental capacities required to effectively participate in established treatments for mood and anxiety problems presenting in older children, making simple downward extensions of these treatments for the management of preschool internalizing problems misguided. In recent years, a number of research groups have successfully adapted and modified parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), originally developed to treat externalizing problems in young children, to treat various early internalizing problems with a set of neighboring protocols. As in traditional PCIT, these extensions target child symptoms by directly reshaping parent-child interaction patterns associated with the maintenance of symptoms. The present review outlines this emerging set of novel PCIT adaptations and modifications for mood and anxiety problems in young children and reviews preliminary evidence supporting their use. Specifically, we cover (a) PCIT for early separation anxiety disorder; (b) the PCIT-CALM (Coaching Approach behavior and Leading by Modeling) Program for the full range of early anxiety disorders; (c) the group Turtle Program for behavioral inhibition; and (d) the PCIT-ED (Emotional Development) Program for preschool depression. In addition, emerging PCIT-related protocols in need of empirical attention-such as the PCIT-SM (selective mutism) Program for young children with SM-are also considered. Implications of these protocols are discussed with regard to their unique potential to address the clinical needs of young children with internalizing problems. Obstacles to broad dissemination are addressed, and we consider potential solutions, including modular treatment formats and innovative applications of technology.

AB Youth with autism spectrum disorder often struggle to cope with co-occurring anxiety, depression, or anger, and having both internalizing and externalizing symptoms is a common clinical presentation. A number of authors have designed cognitive-behavioral interventions to address transdiagnostic factors related to multiple emotional problems, although none have applied this focus to youth with ASD. The current review article describes how a transdiagnostic emotion regulation framework may inform cognitive-behavioral interventions for youth with ASD, which until now have focused almost exclusively on anxiety. Research is needed to empirically test how a transdiagnostic intervention can address the processes of emotion regulation and assist youth with ASD to cope with their emotional disorders.

AB Research on the role of puberty in adolescent psychological development requires attention to the meaning and measurement of pubertal development. Particular questions concern the utility of self-report, the need for complex models to describe pubertal development, the psychological significance of pubertal timing vs. tempo, and sex differences in the nature and psychological significance of pubertal development. We used longitudinal self-report data to model linear and logistic trajectories of pubertal development, and used timing and tempo estimates from these models, and from traditional approaches (age at menarche and time from onset of breast development to menarche), to predict psychological outcomes of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and early sexual activity. Participants (738 girls, 781 boys) reported annually from ages 9 through 15 on their pubertal development, and they and their parents reported on their behavior in mid-to-late adolescence and early adulthood. Self-reports of pubertal development provided meaningful data for both boys and girls, producing good trajectories, and estimates of individuals' pubertal timing and tempo. A logistic model best fit the group data. Pubertal timing was estimated to be earlier in the logistic compared to linear model, but linear, logistic, and traditional estimates of pubertal timing correlated highly with each other and similarly with psychological outcomes. Pubertal tempo was not consistently estimated, and associations of tempo with timing and with behavior were model dependent. Advances in modeling facilitate the study of some questions about pubertal development, but assumptions of the models affect their utility in psychological studies.

AB IntroductionThe role of the serotonin transporter gene polymorphism 5-HTTLPR in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is unclear. Heterogeneity of findings may be explained by gene-environment interactions (GxE), as it has been suggested that S-allele carriers are more reactive to psychosocial stress than L-allele homozygotes. This study aimed to investigate whether 5-HTTLPR genotype moderates the effects of stress on ADHD in a multisite prospective ADHD cohort study.
   Methods5-HTTLPR genotype, as well as the number of stressful life events in the past 5years and ongoing long-term difficulties, was determined in 671 adolescents and young adults with ADHD, their siblings, and healthy controls (57.4% male, average age 17.3years). Linear mixed models, accounting for family relatedness, were applied to investigate the effects of genotype, experienced stress, and their interaction on ADHD severity at time point T2, while controlling for ADHD severity at T1 (mean follow-up time 5.9years) and for comorbid internalizing problems at T2.
   ResultsThe interaction between genotype and stress significantly predicted ADHD severity at T2 (p=.006), which was driven by the effect on hyperactivity-impulsivity (p=.004). Probing of the interaction effect made clear that S-allele carriers had a significantly more positive correlation between stress and ADHD severity than L-allele homozygotes.
   ConclusionThe results show that the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress is a mechanism involved particularly in the hyperactivity/impulsivity dimension of ADHD, and that this is independent of comorbid internalizing problems. Further research into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this interaction effect is warranted.

AB Little is known about what factors affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with sickle cell disease (SCD), and how their HRQoL changes over time. This retrospective study included 87 AYAs attending a SCD Adolescent Clinic who completed a measure of HRQoL at each visit over the course of approximately 1.3 years. Results suggested that the following were associated with poorer physical HRQoL: being female, more healthcare utilization events, and presence of internalizing symptoms. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were the only factors correlated with poorer psychosocial HRQoL. Generalized linear mixed models indicated that physical and psychosocial HRQoL improved among all participants during the assessment period, and those with externalizing behaviors reported faster improvement in physical HRQoL over time. AYAs with SCD may benefit from early mental health screening and intervention to optimize clinical care.

AB Objective: Meta-analytic studies have not confirmed that involving parents in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxious children is therapeutically beneficial. There is also great heterogeneity in the type of parental involvement included. We investigated parental involvement focused on contingency management (CM) and transfer of control (TC) as a potential outcome moderator using a meta-analysis with individual patient data. Method: Investigators of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT for anxious children, identified systematically, were invited to submit their data. Conditions in each RCT were coded based on type of parental involvement in CBT (i.e., low involvement, active involvement without emphasis on CM or TC, active involvement with emphasis on CM or TC). Treatment outcomes were compared using a 1-stage meta-analysis. Results: All cases involved in active treatment (894 of 1,618) were included for subgroup analyses. Across all CBT groups, means of clinical severity, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms significantly decreased posttreatment and were comparable across groups. The group without emphasis on CM or TC showed a higher proportion with posttreatment anxiety diagnoses than the low-involvement group. Between posttreatment and 1-year follow-up, the proportion with anxiety diagnoses significantly decreased in CBT with active parental involvement with emphasis on CM or TC, whereas treatment gains were merely maintained in the other 2 groups. Conclusions: CBT for anxious children is an effective treatment with or without active parental involvement. However, CBT with active parental involvement emphasizing CM or TC may support long-term maintenance of treatment gains. Results should be replicated as additional RCTs are published.

AB A growing literature supports the importance of understanding the link between religiosity and youths' adjustment and development, but in the absence of rigorous, longitudinal designs, questions remain about the direction of effect and the role of family factors. This paper investigates the bidirectional association between adolescents' relationship with God and their internalizing adjustment. Results from 2-wave, SEM cross-lag analyses of data from 667 mother/adolescent dyads in Belfast, Northern Ireland (50% male, M age = 15.75 years old) supports a risk model suggesting that greater internalizing problems predict a weaker relationship with God 1 year later. Significant moderation analyses suggest that a stronger relationship with God predicted fewer depression and anxiety symptoms for youth whose mothers used more religious coping.

AB The study examined the hierarchical structure of child personality and common psychopathology in a community sample of 2-18-year-olds (N = 1926) using parent reported Inventory of Child Individual Differences-Short version and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. A joint higher-order factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution; the hierarchical framework showed that normal personality traits and problem behaviors are integrated within the same structural model from the early years onwards. The three-factor level, with a positive personality factor and two broad psychopathology factors, externalizing and internalizing, resembled the three developmental orientations of moving toward, against or away from the world. The findings suggest that personality and common psychopathology share the same temperamental origins in behavioral inhibition and negative affect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Time and again fatal incidents alert the public to the severe outcomes of physical neglect; however, other forms of neglect (e.g. emotional neglect) also give rise to profound and persistent developmental sequelae ranging from mild developmental delay to severe disorders and psychopathology.
   This article outlines the empirical research on the sequelae of childhood neglect, focusing on psychological development and mental health in particular. In this respect, disturbances of attachment in infancy are especially pertinent given the potential long-lasting implications.
   The review presents the current literature on the outcomes of childhood neglect with respect to developmental deviations in childhood and adolescence as well as later mental disorders.
   Besides delays in physical development, childhood neglect can result in problems in mental and social domains. Insecure and disorganized attachments prevail and attachment disorders may ensue. The lack of care and attention often results in internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression but other mental disorders are also common. Various psychobiological mechanisms might act as intervening processes. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis figure prominently in the literature.
   To minimize negative consequences clinicians should aim to identify childhood neglect at the earliest possible point in order to launch intervention efforts. Besides focusing on the recognition of non-organic failure to thrive, this article seeks to raise pediatrician's awareness of disturbances of the attachment relationship as well as relational disturbances of caregivers.

AB Prenatal exposure to gonadal hormones plays a major role in the normal development of the male and female brain and sexually dimorphic behaviors. Hormone-dependent differences in brain structure and function suggest that exposure to exogenous endocrine disrupting chemicals may be associated with sex-specific alterations in behavior. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental chemical that has been shown to alter estrogen, androgen, and thyroid hormone signaling pathways. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest associations between prenatal exposure to BPA and child behavior, however data are inconsistent, and few studies have examined school age children. We examined BPA concentration in spot urine samples from women at mean 27 weeks of pregnancy in relation to child behavior assessed at age 6-10 years using the parent-completed Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We report associations between maternal BPA urinary concentrations and several CBCL scores in 153 children (77 boys and 76 girls). We observed a significant interaction between maternal urinary BPA and sex for several behaviors (externalizing, aggression, Anxiety Disorder, Oppositional/Defiant Disorder and Conduct Disorder traits), but no significant associations between BPA and scores on any CBCL scales. However in analyses restricted to children of mothers with detectable prenatal urinary BPA (n = 125), BPA was associated with moderately increased internalizing and externalizing behaviors, withdrawn/depressed behavior, somatic problems, and Oppositional/Defiant Disorder traits in boys. In addition we observed a significant interaction between BPA and sex for several behaviors (externalizing, withdrawn/depressed, rule-breaking, Oppositional/Defiant Disorder traits, and Conduct Disorder traits). These results suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may be related to increased behavior problems in school age boys, but not girls. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High levels of waterborne manganese have been associated with problematic behavior in school-aged children, however to date this has not been reported for children exposed to airborne manganese. The objective of the present study was to examine behavioral traits among children with exposure to airborne manganese from a ferro-manganese alloy plant, located in the metropolitan region of Salvador, Brazil. The study included 34 boys and 36 girls, aged 7-12 years, living in two communities within a 3-km radius from the plant. For each child, hair manganese levels (MnH) and blood lead (PbB) levels were analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The Children's Behavior Check List (CBCL) (Portuguese version validated in Brazil) was administered to parents or caregivers, providing scale scores of internalizing (withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed scales), externalizing (disruptive and aggressive) behaviors and a separate scale for attention problems. Median and range for MnH and PbB were 11.48 mu g/g (range: 0.52-55.74); 1.1 mu g/dL (range: 0.5-6.1), respectively. Spearman correlation analyses showed that several behavioral indices were significantly correlated with MnH levels for girls, but not for boys: total externalizing behavior (rho = 0.484 vs rho = 0.041) and attention problem scores (rho = 0.542 vs rho = 0.003) coefficients were significantly at p < 0.001 level, respectively for girls and boys. No significant correlation was observed with any of the internalizing subscales. A linear regression model was fitted with the total externalizing behavior, inattention and total CBCL scores as dependent variables, with log transformed MnH stratified by sex, adjusting for age and maternal IQ. Total externalizing behaviors and attention problem scores were significantly associated with girls' MnH levels but not with boys'. Adjusting for maternal IQ the beta-coefficients for LogMnH associations with total externalizing and attention problems are 8.85 (95%CI 2.44-15.24) and 4.03 (95%CI 1.50-6.56) for girls. For boys, after adjusting for age, the beta-coefficients are 0.08 (95%CI 11.51-11.66) and -0.05 (95%CI 4.34-4.25), respectively. The findings of this study suggest a positive association between elevated Mn exposure and externalizing behavioral problems and inattention, with girls presenting more pronounced effects. Future studies on Mn exposure in children should attempt to further elucidate sex and/or gender differences in Mn exposed populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. The classification of anxiety and depressive disorders has long been debated and has important clinical implications. The present study combined a genetically sensitive design and multiple time points to investigate cognitive content specificity in anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms across anxiety sensitivity dimensions, a cognitive distortion implicated in both disorders.
   Method. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between anxiety sensitivity dimensions, anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms were examined at five waves of data collection within childhood, adolescence and early adulthood in two representative twin studies (n pairs=300 and 1372).
   Results. The physical concerns dimension of anxiety sensitivity (fear of bodily symptoms) was significantly associated with anxiety but not depression at all waves. Genetic influences on physical concerns overlapped substantially more with anxiety than depression. Conversely, mental concerns (worry regarding cognitive control) were phenotypically more strongly associated with depression than anxiety. Social concerns (fear of publicly observable symptoms of anxiety) were associated with both anxiety and depression in adolescence. Genetic influences on mental and social concerns were shared to a similar extent with both anxiety and depression.
   Conclusions. Phenotypic patterns of cognitive specificity and broader genetic associations between anxiety sensitivity dimensions, anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms were similar at all waves. Both disorder-specific and shared cognitive concerns were identified, suggesting it is appropriate to classify anxiety and depression as distinct but related disorders and confirming the clinical perspective that cognitive therapy is most likely to benefit by targeting cognitive concerns relating specifically to the individual's presenting symptoms across development.

AB Background: Studies investigating the association between diurnal cortisol rhythm and behavioural problems in young children have yielded inconsistent results. We tested the hypothesis that variations in diurnal cortisol rhythm in pre-schoolers are already related to problem behaviour early in life with a cross-sectional and longitudinal design.
   Methods: This study was embedded in Generation R, a population-based cohort from foetal life onwards. Parents collected saliva samples from their infant at 5 moments during 1 day. In 322 infants aged 12-20 months, we determined the diurnal cortisol rhythm by calculating the area under the curve (AUC), the cortisol awakening response (CAR), and the diurnal slope. Problem behaviour was assessed at ages 1.5 and 3 years with the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 years.
   Results: No cross-sectional associations between the cortisol composite measures and problem behaviour were found at 1.5 years. However, cortisol predicted change in internalizing problems as assessed from 1.5 to 3 years, but not change in externalizing problems. Children with higher AUC levels, flatter slopes and a more positive CAR at baseline were more likely to score higher on the Internalizing Problems scale (beta per nmol/L AUC: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.00; 0.17, p=0.04; beta per nmol/L/h slope: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.17; 0.98, p=0.006; beta per nmol/L CAR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01; 0.08, p = 0.02) at follow-up.
   Conclusions: Variations in diurnal cortisol rhythm are associated with change in internalizing problems in pre-schoolers. The results suggest that variations in diurnal cortisol patterns early in life precede internalizing problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Internalizing disorders, specifically depression and anxiety, affect up to 14 and 32 % of youth, respectively (Merikangas et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 49:980-989, 2010). In part to overcome barriers to receiving community services, schools have become a major provider of mental health services to children. Schools need effective mechanisms in place to accurately identify students who may need such services. The current study examined the accuracy of one such method, teacher nominations, in identifying elementary school children who self-report elevated levels of depression and/or anxiety. Participants were 238 fourth and fifth-grade students within a large, urban school district in a southeastern state and their 26 classroom teachers. Regarding sensitivity, teachers identified 50 and 40.7 % of students who repeatedly reported at-risk levels of depression and anxiety, respectively. Teachers falsely identified as symptomatic 16.2 and 17.5 % of students with typical levels of depression and anxiety, respectively. These findings suggest teachers can identify approximately half of children who experience at-risk levels of depression and anxiety, but substantial miss rates call into question this method for use as either an alternative to universal screenings or as an initial step (gatekeeper role) in a multi-modal identification process.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for developing depression. The neurobiological substrates that convey this risk remain poorly understood. On the basis of considerable data implicating hippocampal abnormalities in depressive disorders, we aimed to explore the relationship between the hippocampus and levels of depressive symptomatology in ADHD. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the volumes and resting state functional connectivity of the hippocampus in a sample of 32 medication naive children with ADHD (ages 6 - 13) and 33 age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) participants. Compared with the HC participants, the participants with ADHD had (i) reduced volumes of the left hippocampus and (ii) reduced functional connectivity between the left. hippocampus and the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); these hippocampal effects were associated with more severe depressive symptoms, even after controlling for the severity of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms. Altered hippocampal structure and connectivity were no associated with anxiety or more general internalizing symptoms. Though preliminary,these findings suggest that the relationship between hippocampal anomalies and ADHD youth's susceptibility to developing depression and other mood disorders may merit further investigation with follow-up longitudinal research.

AB Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs) are among the most common reasons for youth referrals to mental health clinics. Aim of this study is to compare short and medium term efficacy of a multimodal treatment program (MTP), compared to community care (treatment-as-usual, TAU). The sample included 135 youths with DBDs (113 males, age range 9-15 years, mean age 12 +/- 2.5 years) were assigned either to a MTP (n=64), or addressed to community care for a TAU (n=71). Outcome measures were the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). All subjects were assessed at the baseline (TO), after 1-year treatment (T1) and after a 2-year follow-up (12). Compared with patients receiving TAU, youths in the MTP showed, both at T1 and 12, significantly lower scores on CBCL Externalizing Scale, Internalizing Scale, Anxious/Depressed, Social Problems, and Aggressive Behavior, and higher scores at the C-GAS. Improvement in Internalizing Scales was particularly evident, with a shift from the clinical to the non-clinical range. Rate of use of mental health services and scholastic failure were reduced in the MTP. It is suggested that the improvement of the Internalizing symptoms is a crucial component of the therapeutic process in this MTP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   DISORDER; CHILDHOOD; ADOLESCENCE; INFANTS; MILK
AB Background: Breastfeeding has been associated with a lower risk for behavioral problems in childhood. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are mediated by the mother's or child's IQ. We examined the association between breastfeeding and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioral problems in childhood and assessed the role of the child's IQ and the mother's IQ in generating this association.
   Findings: The current study included 874 children (8-11 years) recruited from schools in five Korean cities. Mothers were asked about nursing, and the prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and behavioral problems were compared between children who were breastfed and those who were not breastfed. After adjusting for age, gender, area of residence, and yearly family income, a lack of breastfeeding was associated with increased internalizing, externalizing, and overall behavioral problems as well as the diagnosis of ADHD. These associations weakened but mostly remained significant after adjusting for child's IQ and maternal IQ. In addition, a lack of breastfeeding was associated with low child's IQ and this association weakened, but remained significant even after adjusting for maternal IQ and the diagnosis of ADHD.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that there is a protective effect of breastfeeding on childhood behavioral outcomes with a partial mediation of this effect by the child's IQ, and there is a positive effect of breastfeeding on childhood intelligence with a partial mediation of this effect by the child's attention problem.

AB Background: We aimed to determine whether early parenting is associated with externalizing and internalizing symptoms in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and whether such an association is affected by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) val66met polymorphism.
   Methods: The participants included 92 patients with ADHD aged 6-15 years. Measures of parenting in early life and externalizing and internalizing symptoms and the genotype of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism were obtained.
   Results: The degree to which the baby's autonomy was allowed was significantly and negatively correlated with the CDI scores in ADHD children (r = -0.38, p = 0.005). After adjusting for the child's gender, the child's age, the family's gross annual income, and the maternal education level, there was a significant interaction for the BDNF genotype and mother's positive feelings about caring in relation to the development of childhood anxiety/depression in ADHD children (F = 2.51, p = 0.011).
   Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of an interaction between the BDNF met allele and early parenting on the development of depression/anxiety symptoms.

AB <bold>Objective:</bold> Childhood adversity has been linked to internalizing and externalizing disorders and personality disorders in adulthood. This study extends that research by examining several personality measures as correlates of childhood adversity.
   <bold>Method:</bold> In a college sample self-reports were collected of childhood adversity, several scales relating to personality, and current depression symptoms as a control variable. The personality-related scales were reduced to four latent variables, which we termed anger/aggression, extrinsic focus, agreeableness, and engagement.
   <bold>Results:</bold> Controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms and gender, higher levels of reported childhood adversity related to lower agreeableness and to higher anger/aggression and extrinsic focus.
   <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Findings suggest that early adversity is linked to personality variables relevant to the building of social connection.

AB Background: The Roma population, one of the largest minority groups in Europe, experience discrimination and stigma associated with marginalized social position. Few studies have examined mental illnesses in the Roma, and none have examined the Roma children. The present study estimates mental health and behavioral disorders among Roma children in comparison to non-Roma children in educational institutions.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Study in Europe (SCHME) study in Romania (Roma children identified by parent report, N = 70; non-Roma, N = 925) and Bulgaria (Roma children identified by exclusively-Roma schools, N = 65; non-Roma, N = 1312). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was given to the parents and teachers to measure child mental health; children reported on their mental health through the Dominique Interactive. Control covariates included child sex and age, and parental characteristics when parent reports were available.
   Results: Based on the child's own report, Roma children had a higher odds of any internalizing disorder (OR = 2.99, 95% C. I. 2.07-4.30), phobias (OR = 4.84, 95% C. I. 3.19-7.35), separation anxiety disorder (OR = 2.54, 95% C. I. 1.72-3.76), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 2.95, 95% C. I. 1.75-4.96), and major depressive disorder (OR = 3.86, 95% C. I. 2.31-6.37). Further Roma children had a higher odds of any externalizing disorder (OR = 2.84, 95% C. I. 1.78-4.54), oppositional defiant disorder (OR = 3.35, 95% C. I. 1.93-5.82), ADHD (OR = 2.37, 95% C. I. 1.26-4.46), and conduct disorder (OR = 3.63, 95% C. I. 2.04-6.46). Based on the report of teachers, Roma children had higher odds of emotional problems (OR = 2.03, 95% C. I. 1.20-3.44), peer-relational problems (OR = 2.76, 95% C. I. 1.73-4.41) and prosocial behavior (OR = 2.75, 95% C. I. 1.75-4.33).
   Conclusion: Roma children experience a higher burden of mental health problems compared with their non-Roma counterparts. Attention to child health and mental health among the Roma is urgently needed, as these children experience a constellation of health problems associated with poverty as well as experiences of stigma and discrimination.

AB Background: Maternal psychological health during pregnancy has been associated with offspring psychopathology. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are mediated by the postpartum depression and related child-rearing factors. Therefore, we examined the associations between prenatal and postnatal factors and internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems in childhood, focusing on maternal psychological health in school-aged children in Korea.
   Findings: The current study included 1,003 children (580 boys, 423 girls, mean age 9.05 +/- 0.70 years, age range 8-11 years) recruited from schools in five Korean cities. Children's internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The parents of the children completed structured questionnaires on perinatal factors. Among 1,003 children, 44 had internalizing problems (IP) and 30 had externalizing problems (EP). When comparing children with IP (n = 44) and without IP (n = 959), severe maternal stress during pregnancy (OR3.36, 95% CI 1.80-6.25) and postpartum depression (OR3.19, 95% CI 1.36-7.53) showed a significant association with the IP. When comparing children with EP (n = 30) and without EP (n = 973), low family income (OR2.19, 95% CI 1.05-4.56), unwanted pregnancy (OR2.76, 95% CI 1.28-5.95) and severe maternal stress during pregnancy (OR2.69, 95% CI 1.29-5.61) with the EP. Only maternal stress during pregnancy was significantly associated with the IP after controlling for postpartum depression and with the EP after controlling for family income and unwanted pregnancy.
   Conclusion: This study suggests the importance of maternal psychological health during perinatal period on children's mental health. Further prospective studies in a larger sample are required to confirm our findings.

AB The current study investigated associations between early mother-child attachment, as well as mother-child and teacher-child relationships, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in middle childhood. Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were used. Findings from a series of individual growth curve analyses revealed that attachment security was negatively related to internalizing and externalizing behaviors, while insecure/other and avoidant attachment were positively related to internalizing behaviors. In addition, longitudinal associations were found between mother-child and teacher-child relationships and internalizing and externalizing behaviors across middle childhood. Implications for attachment theory are discussed.

AB Taking a risk and resilience approach, this study examined (1) whether child age moderates the association between exposure to parent-child physical aggression (PCPA) and initial levels and growth in internalizing and externalizing problems, and (2) whether neighborhood social cohesion is a protective factor for children who experience PCPA. Data came from 2810 caregivers of children aged 3-15 who participated in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Multilevel growth models showed that age moderated PCPA's association with internalizing problems, such that the association was stronger in older children than in younger children. Age also moderated PCPA's association with externalizing problems, such that the association was stronger in younger children than in older children. Neighborhood cohesion partially attenuated the association between PCPA and internalizing but only for older children; living in a neighborhood characterized by high cohesion mitigated levels of internalizing for maltreated children aged 11 years and older.

AB This article reviews current research findings and presents a conceptual framework for better understanding the relationship between bullying victimization (hereafter referred to as victimization) and substance misuse (hereafter referred to as SM) among adolescents. Although victimization and SM may appear to be separate problems, research suggests an intriguing relationship between the 2. We present a brief, empirical overview of the direct association between victimization and adolescent SM, followed by a proposed conceptual framework that includes co-occurring risk factors for victimization and SM within family, peer, and school and community contexts. Next, we discuss potential mediators linking victimization and SM, such as internalizing problems, traumatic stress, low academic performance, and school truancy and absence. We then identify potential moderating influences of age, gender and sex, social supports, and school connectedness that could amplify or abate the association between victimization and SM. Finally, we discuss practice and policy implications.

AB Objective: Innovative public health approaches are required to improve human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) education and prevention among adolescents, one of the most vulnerable groups to HIV/AIDS. Consequently, elearning and classroom instruction was assessed for HIV/AIDS knowledge uptake and internalizing among South African and Irish pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 years.
   Method: An HIV/AIDS intervention was implemented based on a quasi-experimental design using experimental and control groups. Experimental group pupils underwent an elearning programme and the control group used the same material in workbooks in a classroom setting. The McNemar test assessed change in both groups' knowledge levels from baseline to post-intervention. A theoretical framework guided by the conflict theory and health belief model strengthened the learning material. Discussions took place in the classroom and in an eforum; the latter was qualitatively analysed using thematic content analysis.
   Results: A significant increase (P < 0.01) in HIV/AIDS knowledge uptake was experienced by the experimental group compared to a decline of 1.6% in the control group from baseline to post-intervention. Internalization of HIV/AIDS knowledge emerged in the eforum among experimental group pupils, while the classroom discussions faced structural barriers. Learning outcomes were demonstrated by higher marks achieved in the experimental than control group brochures, the outcome of the learning process.
   Conclusion: Elearning proved a superior technique to classroom instruction for HIV/AIDS knowledge uptake and internalizing and should be considered for wider implementation.

AB Violence is a significant public health problem, which has been linked to the primary emotion of anger. While several theoretical models have attempted to understand the relationship between anger and violence, empirical evidence to support these models and the psychological treatments that follow from them have been lacking. A newer model for understanding the relationship between anger and violence emphasizes the dual diatheses of childhood maltreatment and difficulties in emotion regulation as central to understanding the anger-violence relationship. Investigating the relationship between childhood maltreatment and anger experience and expression among 88 violent offenders referred for intimate partner or non-intimate partner violent offenses, results herein confirm that substantial childhood maltreatment is found among violent offenders, with differing patterns of abuse noted across groups. Furthermore, mediational analyses indicate that difficulties in emotion regulation mediate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and various aspects of anger experience and expression among both types of offenders.

AB Temperamental inhibition has been identified as a key risk factor for childhood anxiety and internalizing problems. An efficacious early prevention programme for shy/inhibited children has been developed; however, accurate, efficient and acceptable screening is needed to support wider implementation. We explore community screening options in the context of a trial implementing the Cool Little Kids prevention programme for anxiety disorders. In comparison to the Australian Temperament Project's inhibition scale, we examine the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire's (SDQ) ability to screen for inhibited preschool children. Parents of 6307 children aged 3 to 6years enrolled in preschool programmes from eight socio-economically diverse districts in Melbourne, Australia, first completed the measures of inhibition and SDQ. Parents with inhibited children then enrolled in the Cool Little Kids randomized trial (n=545). Of these, 88% provided feedback about inhibition screening. Parents allocated to the intervention also provided feedback on the Cool Little Kids parenting programme. Results demonstrated that parents of preschool children (i) find inhibition screening acceptable, (ii) take up this parenting programme and (iii) report favourable feedback. The SDQ emotional symptoms subscale demonstrated acceptable sensitivity but insufficient specificity to identify inhibited preschool children. Presenting parents with a brief, validated inhibition scale could be a low-cost option for identifying inhibited preschool children in the community to offer early anxiety prevention.

AB The aim of this study was to examine if family system dynamics (e.g., parent mental health, marriage quality, conflict, and cohesion) that have often been overlooked when studying Latino families play a more important role in predicting adolescent internalizing symptoms than acculturation processes. Data comes from the Latino Acculturation and Health Project, a longitudinal investigation of acculturation in Latino families in North Carolina and Arizona (Smokowski & Bacallao, 2006, 2010). Researchers conducted in-depth, community-based interviews with 258 Latino adolescents and 258 of their parents in metropolitan, small-town, and rural areas. Interviews were conducted at four time points at intervals of approximately 6 months. Parent and adolescent ratings of the adolescent's internalizing symptoms were used as the dependent variable in a longitudinal hierarchical linear model with a rater effects structure. Results showed that parent-adolescent conflict and parent mental health (fear/avoidance of social situations and humiliation sensitivity) were significant predictors of adolescent internalizing symptoms. Acculturation scales were not significant predictors; however, internalizing symptoms decreased with time spent in the United States. Females and adolescents from lower socioeconomic status families reported more internalizing symptoms, while participants who had been in the United States longer reported fewer internalizing symptoms. Implications were discussed.

AB Evidence now implicates inflammatory proteins in the neurobiology of internalizing disorders. Genetic factors may influence individual responses to maltreatment; however, little work has examined inflammatory genetic variants in adults and none in children. The present study examined the role of an interleukin 1B gene (IL1B) variant in preschoolers exposed to maltreatment and other forms of adversity in internalizing symptom development. One hundred ninety-eight families were enrolled, with one child (age 3-5 years) from each family. Adversity measures included child protective service documentation of moderate-severe maltreatment in the last 6 months and interview-assessed contextual stressors. Internalizing symptoms were measured using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment. Maltreated children had higher major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and marginally higher internalizing symptoms on the Child Behavior Checklist. Controlling for age, sex, and race, IL1B genotype was associated with MDD symptoms (p = .002). Contextual stressors were significantly associated with MDD and posttraumatic stress disorder and marginally with internalizing symptoms. The IL1B genotype interacted with contextual stress such that children homozygous for the minor allele had more MDD symptoms (p = .045). These results suggest that genetic variants of IL1B may modulate the development of internalizing symptoms in the face of childhood adversity.

AB Whether internalizing symptoms increase or remain at similar levels throughout childhood is currently not well understood. Moreover, the association between vagal regulation of cardiac activity and internalizing symptoms across childhood needs to be clarified. We used a multilevel conceptual framework to examine how children's vagal regulation of cardiac activity and mothers' internalizing symptoms were jointly associated with children's developmental trajectories of internalizing symptoms from ages 4 to 10 years old. Data came from 384 children who participated in an ongoing longitudinal study. Children and their mothers came to the research laboratory at ages 4, 5, 7, and 10. Mothers reported their children's and their own internalizing symptoms. Children's vagal regulation of cardiac activity was assessed during quiet baseline tasks and during challenge tasks. Multilevel models revealed that child internalizing symptoms increased from ages 4 to 10 years old, but only in females, and especially between ages 7 and 10. More vagal withdrawal in response to challenge was associated with more internalizing symptoms, particularly with more somatic symptoms. Associations between children's physiological regulation and internalizing symptoms differed by children's age, sex, and presence of maternal internalizing symptoms. Understanding associations between vagal regulation of cardiac activity and internalizing symptoms during childhood calls for fine-grained developmental analyses that take into account the heterogeneity of internalizing symptoms, as well as developmental phase, context, and gender.

   REACTIVITY
AB Multilevel models of developmental psychopathology implicate both characteristics of the individual and their rearing environment in the etiology of internalizing problems and disorders. Maladaptive regulation of fear and sadness, the core of anxiety and depression, arises from the conjoint influences of ineffective parasympathetic regulation of emotion and ineffective emotion socialization experiences. In 171 youths (84 female, M = 13.69 years, SD = 1.84), we measured changes of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in response to sadness- and fear-inducing film clips and maternal supportive and punitive responses to youths' internalizing emotions. Youths and mothers reported on youths' internalizing problems and anxiety and depression symptoms concurrently and 2 years later at Time 2. Maternal supportive emotion socialization predicted fewer, and punitive socialization predicted more, mother-reported internalizing problems at Time 2 only for youths who showed RSA suppression to fear-inducing films. More RSA suppression to sadness-inducing films predicted more youth-reported internalizing problems at Time 2 in girls only. In addition, less supportive emotion socialization predicted more youth-reported depression symptoms at Time 2 only for girls who showed more RSA suppression to sadness. RSA suppression to sadness versus fear might reflect different patterns of atypical parasympathetic regulation of emotional arousal, both of which increase the risk for internalizing difficulties in youths, and especially girls, who lack maternal support for regulating emotions.

The present study examines early life stress (ELS) exposure and early-adolescent longitudinal afternoon cortisol level as predictors of the covariation between internalizing symptoms and negative life events across high school. ELS was assessed by maternal report during infancy, and the measure of cortisol was derived from assessments at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Life events and internalizing symptoms were assessed at ages 15, 17, and 18 years. A two-level hierarchical linear model revealed that ELS and cortisol were independent predictors of the covariation of internalizing symptoms and negative life events. Compared to those with lower levels of ELS, ELS-exposed adolescents displayed tighter covariation between internalizing symptoms and negative life events. Adolescents with lower longitudinal afternoon cortisol displayed tighter covariation between negative life events and internalizing symptoms, while those with higher cortisol demonstrated weaker covariation, partially due to increased levels of internalizing symptoms when faced with fewer negative life events.

AB Premorbid risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and predictors of an earlier onset and recurrent course were examined in two studies in a large, community-based sample of parents and offspring, prospectively assessed from late childhood into adulthood. In Study 1 (N = 2,764 offspring and their parents), parental psychiatric status, offspring personality at age 11, and age 11 offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms predicted the subsequent development of MDD, as did poor quality parent-child relationships, poor academic functioning, early pubertal development, and childhood maltreatment by age 11. Parental MDD and adult antisocial behavior, offspring negative emotionality and disconstraint, externalizing symptoms, and childhood maltreatment predicted an earlier onset of MDD, after accounting for course; lower positive emotionality, trait anxiety, and childhood maltreatment predicted recurrent MDD, after accounting for age of onset. In Study 2 (N = 7,146), we examined molecular genetic risk for MDD by extending recent reports of associations with glutamatergic system genes. We failed to confirm associations with MDD using either individual single nucleotide polymorphism based tests or gene-based analyses. Overall, results speak to the pervasiveness of risk for MDD, as well as specific risk for early onset MDD; risk for recurrent MDD appears to be largely a function of its often earlier onset.

AB The current study filled significant gaps in our knowledge of developmental psychopathology by examining the influence of multilevel risk factors and developmental assets on longitudinal trajectories of internalizing symptoms and self-esteem in an exceptionally culturally diverse sample of rural adolescents. Integrating ecological and social capital theories, we explored if positive microsystem transactions are associated with self-esteem while negative microsystem transactions increase the chances of internalizing problems. Data came from the Rural Adaptation Project, a 5-year longitudinal panel study of more than 4,000 middle school students from 28 public schools in two rural, disadvantaged counties in North Carolina. Three-level hierarchical linear modeling models were estimated to predict internalizing symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and self-esteem. Relative to other students, risk for internalizing problems and low self-esteem was elevated for aggressive adolescents, students who were hassled or bullied at school, and those who were rejected by peers or in conflict with their parents. Internalizing problems were also more common among adolescents from socioeconomically disadvantaged families and neighborhoods, among those in schools with more suspensions, in students who reported being pressured by peers, and in youth who required more teacher support. It is likely that these experiences left adolescents disengaged from developing social capital from ecological microsystems (e.g., family, school, peers). On the positive side, support from parents and friends and optimism about the future were key assets associated with lower internalizing symptoms and higher self-esteem. Self-esteem was also positively related to religious orientation, school satisfaction, and future optimism. These variables show active engagement with ecological microsystems. The implications and limitations were discussed.

AB Learning to respond to others' distress with well-regulated empathy is an important developmental task linked to positive health outcomes and moral achievements. However, this important interpersonal skill set may also confer risk for depression and anxiety when present at extreme levels and in combination with certain individual characteristics or within particular contexts. The purpose of this review is to describe an empirically grounded theoretical rationale for the hypothesis that empathic tendencies can be risky strengths. We propose a model in which typical development of affective and cognitive empathy can be influenced by complex interplay among intraindividual and interindividual moderators that increase risk for empathic personal distress and excessive interpersonal guilt. These intermediate states in turn precipitate internalizing problems that map onto empirically derived fear/arousal and anhedonia/misery subfactors of internalizing disorders. The intraindividual moderators include a genetically influenced propensity toward physiological hyperarousal, which is proposed to interact with genetic propensity to empathic sensitivity to contribute to neurobiological processes that underlie personal distress responses to others' pain or unhappiness. This empathic personal distress then increases risk for internalizing problems, particularly fear/arousal symptoms. In a similar fashion, interactions between genetic propensities toward negative thinking processes and empathic sensitivity are hypothesized to contribute to excess interpersonal guilt in response to others' distress. This interpersonal guilt then increases the risk for internalizing problems, especially anhedonia/misery symptoms. Interindividual moderators, such as maladaptive parenting or chronic exposure to parents' negative affect, further interact with these genetic liabilities to amplify risk for personal distress and interpersonal guilt as well as for consequent internalizing problems. Age-related increases in the heritability of depression, anxiety, and empathy-related constructs are consistent with developmental shifts toward greater influence of intraindividual moderators throughout childhood and adolescence, with interindividual moderators exerting their greatest influence during early childhood. Efforts to modulate neurobiological and behavioral expressions of genetic dysregulation liabilities and to promote adaptive empathic skills must thus begin early in development.

AB Exposure to abuse in childhood has been associated with elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), as well as intimate partner (re) victimization in adulthood. Although research has examined these relationships separately, less is known about the underlying mechanisms, such as disruptions to emotion regulatory processes, which may link childhood maltreatment with adult victimization and PTSS. Using an ethnically diverse, high-risk community sample of 99 female survivors of childhood abuse and adulthood intimate partner violence (IPV), the current study used structural equation modeling to examine the direct effects of childhood maltreatment, adult IPV victimization, and emotion regulation difficulties on PTSS. The indirect effect of childhood maltreatment on PTSS symptoms through adult victimization and emotion regulation difficulties was also considered. Results supported the anticipated direct effects of childhood abuse on adult IPV victimization and emotion regulation difficulties. A significant direct effect of emotion regulation difficulties on PTSS was also observed. Whereas significant direct effects of childhood abuse on PTSS in adulthood were not observed, childhood maltreatment indirectly affected PTSS in adulthood through emotion regulation difficulties, as well as through IPV victimization in adulthood. These findings suggest dual pathways through which childhood maltreatment may contribute to PTSS in adulthood. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

AB Children meeting the Child Behavior Checklist Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP) suffer from high levels of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems. Little is known about the cognitive abilities of these children with CBCL-DP. We examined the relationship between CBCL-DP and nonverbal intelligence. Parents of 6,131 children from a population-based birth cohort, aged 5 through 7 years, reported problem behavior on the CBCL/1.5-5. The CBCL-DP was derived using latent profile analysis on the CBCL/1.5-5 syndrome scales. Nonverbal intelligence was assessed using the Snijders Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test 2.5-7-Revised. We examined the relationship between CBCL-DP and nonverbal intelligence using linear regression. Analyses were adjusted for parental intelligence, parental psychiatric symptoms, socio-economic status, and perinatal factors. In a subsample with diagnostic interview data, we tested if the results were independent of the presence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The results showed that children meeting the CBCL-DP (n = 110, 1.8 %) had a 11.0 point lower nonverbal intelligence level than children without problems and 7.2-7.3 points lower nonverbal intelligence level than children meeting other profiles of problem behavior (all p values < 0.001). After adjustment for covariates, children with CBCL-DP scored 8.3 points lower than children without problems (p < 0.001). The presence of ADHD or ASD did not account for the lower nonverbal intelligence in children with CBCL-DP. In conclusion, we found that children with CBCL-DP have a considerable lower nonverbal intelligence score. The CBCL-DP and nonverbal intelligence may share a common neurodevelopmental etiology.

AB To investigate to what extent differences in prevalence and types of mental health problems between ethnic minority and majority youth can be explained by social disadvantage. Mental health problems were assessed in a sample of 1,278 schoolchildren (55 % Dutch, 32 % Moroccan and 13 % Turkish; mean age: 12.9 +/- A 1.8) using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire self-report and teacher report. Measures of family socioeconomic status, neighbourhood deprivation, perceived discrimination, family structure, repeating a school year, housing stability and neighbourhood urbanization were used as indicators of social disadvantage, based on which a cumulative index was created. Ethnic minority youth had more externalizing and fewer internalizing problems than majority youth. Perceived discrimination and living in an unstable social environment were associated with mental health problems, independent of ethnicity. A dose-response relationship was found between social disadvantage and mental health problems. The adjusted odds ratio for mental health problems was 4.16 (95 % CI 2.49-6.94) for more than four compared with zero indicators of social disadvantage. Social disadvantage was more common in ethnic minority than in majority youth, explaining part of the differences in prevalence of mental health problems. Ethnic minority youth in the Netherlands have a different profile of mental health problems than majority youth. In all ethnic groups, the risk of mental health problems increases with the degree of social disadvantage. The higher prevalence of externalizing problems among ethnic minority youth is explained partly by their disadvantaged social position. The findings suggest that social factors associated with ethnicity are likely to explain mental health problems in ethnic groups.

AB Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as child abuse and neglect impact a child's socioemotional development. Drawing from the methods employed in the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE; Felitti et al., 1998) Study, the present study utilized data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being to examine the prevalence of ACEs among children birth to 6 years, and the relationship of ACEs to emotional and behavioral outcomes 59 to 97 months after the close of investigation or assessment. Logistic regression also was used to examine the cumulative impact of ACEs on child behavior outcomes. By the age of 6, approximately 70% of children experienced three or more ACEs, and there were strong relationships between ACEs. Numerous ACEs were associated with long-term behavioral problems, and results supported a dose-response effect. Three or greater ACEs more than quadrupled the risk of experiencing internalizing problems, and almost quadrupled the risk of experiencing either externalizing or total problems at 59 to 97 months' postinvestigation. Based on these findings, it is crucial for both early screening/assessment and increased collaboration between child welfare and early intervention programs.

AB This study examined the effects of a family intervention on victimization and emotional distress of children bullied by peers. The intervention, Resilience Triple P. combined facilitative parenting and teaching children social and emotional skills relevant to developing strong peer relationships and addressing problems with peers. Facilitative parenting is parenting that supports the development of children's peer relationship skills. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 111 families who reported chronic bullying of children aged 6 to 12 years. Families were randomly allocated to either an immediate start to Resilience Triple P (RTP) or an assessment control (AC) condition. Assessments involving children, parents, teachers, and observational measures were conducted at 0 (pre), 3 (post) and 9 months follow-up. RTP families had significantly greater improvements than AC families on measures of victimization, child distress, child peer and family relationships, including teacher reports of overt victimization (d = 0.56), child internalizing feelings (d = 0.59), depressive symptoms (d = 0.56), child overt aggression towards peers (d = 0.51), acceptance by same sex and opposite sex peers (d = 0.46/ 0.60), and child liking school (d = 0.65). Families in both conditions showed significant improvements on most variables over time including child reports of bullying in the last week reducing to a near zero and indistinguishable from the normative sample. The intervention combining facilitative parenting and social and emotional skills training for children produced better results than the comparison assessment control condition. This study demonstrated that family interventions can reduce victimization and distress and strengthen school efforts to address bullying.

AB Objectives: To examine factors associated with ongoing service and out of home placement for adolescents investigated by child welfare services in Canada.
   Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect, 2008 (CIS-2008), specifically examining a weighted sample of 58,641 adolescents (age 1215). Descriptive comparisons between adolescents, school-age children and pre-school age children were conducted. After identifying significant bivariate relationships between ongoing service and out of home placement and youth, household, case, and service characteristics, logistic regressions were used to determine the degree to which these characteristics predicted the investigation being transferred to ongoing child welfare services or out of home placement.
   Results: Internalizing functioning concerns of adolescents in the sample were the most important contributors to decisions to provide ongoing service. Aboriginal status of the child and parent functioning concern were also important contributors to the decision to provide ongoing service to adolescents and their families. Youths' externalizing behaviors were the most important contributors to placing adolescents in out-of-home care.
   Conclusions: The results provide important information for child welfare agencies hoping to better understand decision-making processes and service provision to adolescents.
   Implications: Future research should seek to better understand, why youth behaviors drive ongoing service and placement decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Little is known about why some adolescents with internalizing symptoms engage in sexual behaviors that increase their risk for HIV. This study tested a mediation model of internalizing symptoms and safe sex intentions among adolescents receiving mental health treatment. Self-efficacy for HIV prevention, HIV knowledge, and worry about HIV were hypothesized to mediate associations between internalizing symptoms and safe sex intentions among sexually active and non-active adolescents receiving mental health treatment (N = 893, M age = 14.9). Significant indirect effects from internalizing symptoms to safe sex intentions varied according to sexual experience: for sexually non-active adolescents, HIV worry and knowledge mediated this link, whereas for sexually active adolescents, HIV self-efficacy was the significant mediator. Increasing both HIV knowledge and self-efficacy for HIV prevention are important targets for HIV prevention with adolescents with internalizing symptoms, and careful attention should be paid towards targeting these interventions to sexually experienced and inexperienced youth.

AB This study examined changes in treatment engagement of 437 youths and their caregivers receiving mental health services in the United States. The youth sample had an average age of 12.03 years (SD = 2.98). Nearly two-thirds (64.1%) of the youth sample was male and approximately the same proportion was Caucasian. Youths were diagnosed primarily with externalizing (50.1%) and internalizing (46.0%) disorders. Most youths (86%) received services from intensive settings (i.e., behavioral health rehabilitation, treatment foster care, family-based services) that provide care beyond the scope of services provided to youths receiving services in traditional outpatient settings. Using KIDnet, an electronic outcomes management system, youths and their caregivers reported on three domains of treatment engagement: therapeutic alliance, satisfaction with services, and treatment participation at each 90-day reporting cycle until treatment termination. Youths and caregivers receiving services from high intensity treatment settings reported significantly lower initial engagement compared to youths and caregivers receiving less intensive outpatient services. Regardless of setting, treatment engagement reported by youths and caregivers increased overtime. These promising findings suggest that families receiving intensive treatment develop connections to service providers and hold positive perceptions of services over time. These results provide the foundation for future research to examine the practices that are associated with changes in treatment engagement over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined separate developmental trajectories of anxious and depressive symptoms from childhood to adolescence (9-15 years) in a community-based sample (N = 290). At three measurement points, mothers and fathers reported on their children's anxious and depressive symptoms, and at Time 1 they reported on lower order child personality facets and on their parenting. By means of growth mixture modeling, three developmental trajectories were identified for anxious symptoms: steady low (82%), moderate increasing-decreasing (5.9%), and high declining groups (12.1%). For depressive symptoms, two developmental trajectories were found: steady low (94.1%) and moderate increasing groups (5.9%). Higher shyness, irritability, and altruism predicted membership in more problematic anxious and depressive groups. The personality facets energy, optimism, compliance, and anxiety were unique predictors for class membership for anxious symptoms, and the effects of shyness, irritability, and compliance were moderated by overreactive parenting. Shyness and irritability increased the probability of following the moderate increasing-decreasing anxiety trajectory, but only in the context of high or average levels of overreactive parenting. Compliance increased the probability of following the moderate increasing-decreasing and high decreasing trajectories in the context of high overreactive parenting. Our results indicate that childhood personality facets differentiate trajectories of anxious and depressive symptoms in theoretically compelling ways.

AB The present study compared two theories of the association between romantic involvement and adjustment: a social timetable theory and a developmental task theory. We examined seven waves of longitudinal data on a community based sample of 200 participants (Wave 1 mean age = 15 years, 10 months). In each wave, multiple measures of substance use, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms were gathered, typically from multiple reporters. Multilevel modeling revealed that greater levels of romantic involvement in adolescence were associated with higher levels of substance use and externalizing symptoms but became associated with lower levels in adulthood. Having a romantic partner was associated with greater levels of substance use, externalizing symptoms, and internalizing symptoms in adolescence but was associated with lower levels in young adulthood. The findings were not consistent with a social timetable theory, which predicts that nonnormative involvement is associated with poor adjustment. Instead, the findings are consistent with a developmental task theory, which predicts that precocious romantic involvement undermines development and adaptation, but when romantic involvement becomes a salient developmental task in adulthood, it is associated with positive adjustment. Discussion focuses on the processes that may underlie the changing nature of the association between romantic involvement and adjustment.

AB Violence against women is a global epidemic with potential consequences of injury, illness, and death. Children exposed to the violence may also be impacted with functional impairments. Little is known of the inter-generational impact of violence experienced by the mother from an intimate partner on functioning of her children. No dyad analysis was found in the literature. To examine the inter-generational impact of violence against women on the behavioral functioning of children, 300 mothers reporting intimate partner abuse and one randomly chosen child, age 18 months to 16 years of age; were evaluated for borderline and clinical diagnostic levels of problem behaviors. Linear, Logistic, and Ordinal regression models were applied. Mothers' problem behavior scores were significantly related to children's problem behavior scores (internalizing r = 0.611, externalizing r = 0.494, total problems r = 0.662, all ps < 0.001). Mothers who reported clinical and borderline clinical internalized problems (i.e., depression, anxiety) were 7 times more likely to have children with the same problems and mothers with borderline clinical and clinical external problems (i.e., aggression, hostility) were 4.5 times more likely to have children with the same external problems. These dyadic analyses provide evidence of a direct relationship of maternal functioning on child behavioral functioning. Intervention strategies to decrease internalizing maternal behavioral problems, such as depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder, and/or externalizing problems, such as hostility and aggression, can be expected to have a pass through, secondary impact on the behavioral functioning of children. Awareness of the relationship between intimate partner violence against mothers and child behavioral function can support interventions that decrease the distress experienced by mothers and their children, interrupt intergenerational transmission of abusive behaviors, and promote better maternal child functioning.

AB This study extends past findings of heightened problems among affluent youth by examining adjustment patterns among boys in two academically elite, independent high schools: one for boys only and the other co-educational. Both samples manifested disproportionately high rates of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, but only the co-educational boys showed elevations in substance use. Boys in both schools showed elevations in a new outcome domain examined: exhibitionistic narcissism. Multivariate analyses of predictors showed that parent criticisma defining feature of youths' maladaptive perfectionismand perceived maternal depression emerged as major vulnerability factors for both samples in relation to symptom levels. On other parenting dimensions, boys in the single-sex school seemed to be particularly sensitive to feelings of alienation from their fathers and perceived paternal depression. Envy of peers' attractiveness was associated with adolescent distress in both samples, but appeared to be especially critical for co-educational boys. Results are discussed, focusing on the costs and benefits of boys' attendance at a single-sex versus co-educational school, along with implications for practice and future research.

DE systematic review; military children; school-based interventions
ID PARENTAL DEPLOYMENT; SERVICE MEMBERS; FAMILIES; IMPACT; YOUTH
AB Objective: To examine the effects of school-based interventions on the well-being of military-connected children (i.e., dependents of U.S. military service members, veterans, or reserve component members) who attend public or private elementary or secondary schools with parental deployment, parental reintegration, parental military-related trauma or death, or frequent moves.
   Method: Systematic review methods were employed to search, retrieve, select, and analyze studies that met inclusion criteria.
   Results: Over 1,400 citations were reviewed and 22 full-text reports were screened. One study met criteria for inclusion in this review. Effects on anxiety, self-esteem, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not significant.
   Discussion: The paucity of intervention research in this area is surprising, given the increased awareness and research on the stresses and impacts of military deployment and other unique stressors related to military life on children. The results of this systematic review support the need for further development and testing of school-based interventions that address the needs of military-connected children.

AB The goal of this study was to advance the understanding of separate and joint effects of mothers' and fathers' autonomy-relevant parenting during early and middle adolescence. In a sample of 518 families, adolescents (49 % female; 83 % European American, 16 % African American, 1 % other ethnic groups) reported on their mothers' and fathers' psychological control and knowledge about adolescents' whereabouts, friends, and activities at ages 13 and 16. Mothers and adolescents reported on adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behaviors at ages 12, 14, 15, and 17. Adolescents perceived their mothers as using more psychological control and having more knowledge than their fathers, but there was moderate concordance between adolescents' perceptions of their mothers and fathers. More parental psychological control predicted increases in boys' and girls' internalizing problems and girls' externalizing problems. More parental knowledge predicted decreases in boys' externalizing and internalizing problems. The perceived levels of behavior of mothers and fathers did not interact with one another in predicting adolescent adjustment. The results generalize across early and late adolescence and across mothers' and adolescents' reports of behavior problems. Autonomy-relevant mothering and fathering predict changes in behavior problems during early and late adolescence, but only autonomy-relevant fathering accounts for unique variance in adolescent behavior problems.

   DEPRESSION; INADEQUATE SLEEP
AB Purpose of review
   Extensive scientific efforts have been made in an attempt to identify early markers of behavioral and emotional problems. In this context, sleep has received considerable research attention, as it appears to be closely linked to developmental psychopathology. The present review synthesizes some of the most recent findings regarding the concurrent and longitudinal associations between psychopathology and behavioral manifestations of sleep in childhood and adolescence.
   Recent findings
   Recent evidence suggests that compromised sleep is associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems in childhood and adolescence. Moreover, sleep problems have been shown to predict the development of various emotional and behavioral problems, including depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, risk-taking and aggression. Yet, inconsistencies are apparent, particularly among findings that are based on objective sleep measurement.
   Summary
   Taken together, most recent findings suggest that poor sleep in childhood and adolescence constitutes a risk factor for psychopathological symptoms. Accordingly, the importance of early detection and intervention should be a primary goal in clinical settings. In the research domain, the underlying mechanism of these associations should receive future research attention, in an attempt to broaden the understanding of the relationship between sleep and psychopathology.

AB Despite pervasive evidence of the harmful impact of neglect on children's adjustment, individual differences in adaptation persist. This study examines parental distress as a contextual factor that may moderate the relation between neglect and child adjustment, while considering the specificity of the relation between neglect and internalizing versus externalizing problems. In a sample of 66 children (33 with a documented child protective services history of neglect prior to age six), neglect predicted internalizing, and to a lesser extent externalizing, problems as rated by teachers at age seven. Parental distress moderated the relation between neglect and internalizing, but not externalizing, problems. Specifically, higher levels of neglect predicted more internalizing problems only among children of distressed parents. These findings indicate that parent-level variables are important to consider in evaluating the consequences of neglect, and point to the importance of considering contextual factors when identifying those children most at risk following neglect.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which maternal relationship insecurity and severe depressive symptoms moderate home visiting impacts on developmental and behavioral outcomes in 2-year old children. In an experimental trial of the Healthy Families Alaska home visiting program, families (N = 249) were randomly assigned to home visiting (n = 126) or community services as usual (n = 123). Maternal severe depressive symptoms (CES-D a parts per thousand yen 24) and relationship insecurity were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Attachment Style Questionnaire at baseline. Child cognitive and psychomotor development and behavior problems were measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Child Behavior Checklist at follow-up. The results revealed that home visiting significantly impacted three outcomes-child cognitive development, internalizing behavior, and externalizing behavior. Home visiting impacts were limited to subgroups defined by maternal depressive symptoms and relationship insecurity. Home visiting improved cognitive development (B = 6.02, p < .03), and decreased internalizing behavior (B = -3.83, p = .02) and externalizing behavior problems (B = -3.74, p = .03) in children of mothers with either severe depressive symptoms or high levels of discomfort with trust at baseline, but not both. Family engagement in home visiting seems to play a role in mediating these moderating effects. These findings reflect the importance of screening for maternal relationship insecurity and depressive symptoms to distinguish family subgroups likely to benefit from home visiting from those for whom an enhanced service model might be needed.

AB Maternal expressed emotion (EE), including maternal criticism and emotional over-involvement, is considered an index of family emotional climate that is critical for children's psychological well-being. Limited research investigates how each element of EE differentially contributes to child behavior problems, or explores the mechanisms, such as child emotion dysregulation, through which parental EE influences child psychosocial outcomes. This study examined maternal EE, child emotion dysregulation, and child behavior problems among 60 mother-child dyads from a community sample, utilizing multi-method and multi-reporter assessment. Findings indicated that maternal expressed criticism toward the child was positively associated with child externalizing symptoms through its relation to increased child emotion dysregulation, whereas maternal emotional over-involvement was negatively associated with child externalizing symptoms through its negative relation to child emotion dysregulation. These results provided increased support for a model in which maternal criticism remains negatively associated with child psychosocial outcomes, but the construct of emotional over-involvement is not necessarily associated with youth psychosocial problems. This study also illustrated one pathway through which maternal EE influence child psychosocial functioning, thus placing EE research in the broader context of research on family emotion socialization.

AB When experiencing natural disasters, coping is important. Individuals who have behavior problems may use less effective coping, however. This study sought to better understand the relationship between emerging adults' behavior problems and coping following hurricanes. Using a sample of 193 emerging adults, correlations suggested that emerging adults who reported more behavior problems also endorsed higher levels of avoidant coping. More specifically, multivariate analyses of variance and subsequent post hoc analyses indicated that emerging adults who were experiencing relatively low levels of both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems endorsed avoidant coping significantly less often relative to those emerging adults who were experiencing relatively high levels of internalizing behavior problems only and those who were experiencing relatively high levels of both types of behavior problems. These results suggested that those who experience behavior problems following hurricanes may benefit from interventions that could improve the coping that they utilize.

AB Purpose This study aims to explore the associations between weight status, body image dissatisfaction (BID), and psychosocial adjustment [quality of life (QOL), internalizing and externalizing problems] of normal-weight and obese youth. It aims to explore whether the associations between weight status and psychosocial adjustment are mediated by BID as well as the moderating role of youth's age and gender on these associations.
   Methods The sample comprised 260 children and adolescents aged 8-18 years with normal weight (n = 128) and obesity (n = 132). All of the participants completed self-report instruments, including the KIDSCREEN-10, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and Collins Body Image scale.
   Results Obese youth, regardless of gender, reported poorer QOL, more internalizing/externalizing problems, and higher rates of BID compared with their normal-weight counterparts. BID mediated the relationship between weight status and QOL, but only for youth above 12-year old. The relationship between weight status and internalizing/externalizing problems was direct and independent of youth's age and gender.
   Conclusions Pediatric obesity is associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes, which underlines the need for preventive and early interventions. An important target in psychological interventions seems to be BID, which proved to be an important mechanism linking obesity and decreased QOL among adolescents.
