AB Background Parental incarceration (PI) is associated with adverse developmental outcomes for children affected. However, research in this area often reports conflicting results with few studies following children across time in non-U.S. populations. Additionally, more research is called for using multi-informant perspectives rather than relying on adult reports of child outcomes alone.
   Methods This study used data from the first two waves of a nationally representative cohort study of 8,568 children aged 9 years and followed up at age 13 living in the Republic of Ireland (2007-2012). Propensity score matching was used to match children who had experienced PI by the age of nine to children who had not experienced PI by sociodemographics and experience of other stressful events. Mental health, as measured by self-concept (Piers-Harris II) and externalizing and internalizing difficulties (strength and difficulties questionnaire), was compared across both groups.
   Results Fifty of the 8,568 children (weighted percentage 0.9%) reported experiencing PI by the age of nine. These children came from more socially disadvantaged homes and were more likely to have experienced other potentially stressful life events. In comparison to a matched sample of children not affected by PI, children affected by PI reported higher levels of anxiety at age nine. Longitudinal analysis indicated these children affected by PI also reported lower levels of happiness at age 13 with higher levels of emotional difficulties reported by their primary caregiver.
   Conclusions Children of incarcerated parents face a greater array of life challenges. PI had an association with child-reported levels of anxiety at age nine. PI also had a medium-term association on caregiver assessments of emotional difficulties of children affected as well child-reported levels of happiness over time.

AB Multiple cognitive risk products (dysfunctional attitudes [DA], negative inferential style [NIS], self-criticism, dependency, rumination) predict internalizing disorders; however, an optimal structure to assess these risks is unknown. We evaluated the fit, construct validity, and utility of a bifactor, single, and correlated factor model in a community sample of 382 adolescents (age 11-15 years; 59% female). The bifactor, hierarchical single, and correlated factor models all fit well. The bifactor model included a common factor (c), capturing covariance across all cognitive risk measures, and specific latent factors for DA, NIS, dependency and rumination. Construct validity of these factor structures was evaluated with external validators, including depression and anxious arousal (AA) symptoms, positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), and onset of depression diagnostic onset over 2 years. C was associated with higher depression, NA, and AA; lower PA; and predicted depressive episodes. Hierarchical single and correlated factor models also related to external validators.

AB Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) is the standard of care for early-onset Behavior Disorders (BDs). Preliminary evidence suggests that BPT may also lead to improvement in comorbid symptomatology, particularly internalizing problems, in children with BDs, yet less is currently known about how BPT produces such cascading effects. To begin to address this gap in the literature, trajectory analyses were used to examine the link between treatment components of one mastery-based BPT program, Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC), and child internalizing symptoms over the course of treatment. Findings revealed that parental use of the Attends skill (i.e., parental description of child activity with warmth and enthusiasm) over time was significantly associated with decreases in trajectories of child internalizing symptoms across treatment. Further probing of these effects revealed that parent use of average or above-average levels of Attends across treatment sessions led to significant reductions in child internalizing symptoms by Sessions 7 to 10 of treatment. Consistent with the movement toward a modular approach to the treatment of children, findings highlight the importance of identifying particular BPT skills that can be used in treatment to target multiple comorbid child symptom clusters. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Self-compassion has emerged as an important construct in the mental health literature. Although conceptual links between self-compassion and trauma are apparent, a review has not been completed to examine whether this association is supported by empirical research findings. To systematically summarize knowledge on the association between trauma and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-compassion. Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Ovid Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and PILOTS databases, and papers reporting a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs were identified. The search yielded 35 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Despite considerable heterogeneity in study design, sample, measurement, and trauma type, there was consistent evidence to suggest that increased self-compassion is associated with less PTSD symptomatology and some evidence to suggest that reduced fear of self-compassion is associated with less PTSD symptomatology. There was tentative evidence to suggest that interventions based, in part or whole, on a self-compassion model potentially reduce PTSD symptoms. Although findings are positive for the association between increased self-compassion and reduced PTSD symptoms, the precise mechanism of these protective effects is unknown. Prospective and longitudinal studies would be beneficial in clarifying this. The review also highlighted the variability in what is and should be referred to as trauma exposure, indicating the need for further research to clarify the concept.

AB Many children never receive treatment for their mental health symptoms-and those that do often receive it only after years of delay. Given that relationship and parenting conflict is an identified mechanism of child mental health symptoms, reducing distress in the parents' romantic relationship may help reduce this unmet need. In the current study, 213 couples with 1 or more children between the ages of 3 and 17 (inclusive) were randomized to receive the web-based OurRelationship program or to a 2-month waitlist condition. Intervention couples were also assessed in the year following the program. Couples in the OurRelationship program experienced a significant decrease in coparenting conflict during the intervention (Cohen's d = -0.27) but also a significant increase in coparenting conflict in the following year, reducing the long-term effects of the intervention (within-group d = -0.20 at 1-year follow-up compared with baseline). Additionally, parent-reported children's externalizing (within-group d = -0.40) and internalizing (within-group d = -0.27) symptoms significantly decreased from baseline to the 1-year follow-up. As hypothesized, improvement in relationship satisfaction during the program was significantly associated with a decrease in coparenting conflict which, in turn, was associated with reduction in both externalizing and internalizing symptoms in the children. These results indicate that online relationship-focused interventions offer an important, adjunctive approach to meet society's need for reducing children's mental health symptoms. Furthermore, the improvements in child functioning strengthen the evidence suggesting the cost-effectiveness of these relationship-focused interventions.

AB Difficulties in regulating affect are core characteristics of a wide range of mental health conditions and are associated with deficits in cognitive control, particularly in affective contexts, affective control. The current study explored how affective control relates to mental health over the course of adolescence. We developed an Affective Control Task, which was administered to young adolescents (11-14 years; n = 29); mid-adolescents (15-18 years; n = 31), and adults (22-30 years; n = 31). The task required individuals to sort cards according to continuously changing rules: color, number, or item type. There was a neutral condition in which items were shapes, and an affective condition, in which items were emotional facial expressions. Better affective control was associated with fewer mental health difficulties (p < .001, R-2 = .15). Affective control partially accounted for the association between age group and mental health problems, z = 2.61, p = .009, Akaike information criterion = 484, with the association being strongest in young adolescents, r (27) = -.44, p = .018. Affective control further accounted for variance in the association between self-reported (but not experimental) emotion regulation and mental health (z = -3.44, p < .001, Akaike information criterion = 440). Poor affective control, especially in young adolescents, is associated with more mental health problems and higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties. Improving affective control therefore may constitute a promising target for prevention.

AB Objective: While high betrayal (HB) traumas (i.e., traumas perpetrated by close others) are associated with reduced maternal and child well-being compared to low betrayal (LB) traumas (i.e., traumas that are noninterpersonal or perpetrated by nonclose others), moderators of these relationships have not yet been examined. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between maternal lifetime betrayal trauma and parent and child well-being while also examining attachment style and emotion regulation as potential moderators. Method: Australian mothers (N = 174) of school-age children (5-12 years) completed online self-report measures assessing betrayal trauma, well-being, attachment style, and emotion regulation strategies. Results: HB traumas were significantly associated with greater maternal distress and trauma symptoms. reduced child well-being, greater attachment anxiety. and greater difficulties with emotion regulation but were not significantly different with regard to parenting stress. social support satisfaction, or attachment avoidance when compared with LB traumas. Emotion regulation difficulties moderated the relationship between betrayal trauma history and maternal distress. Conclusions: These results indicate that mothers with HB trauma histories who also have difficulties with emotion regulation may experience greater levels of distress compared to mothers with HB trauma histories who use more adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Accordingly, it may be especially important for victims of HB traumas to address trauma-related misappraisals regarding the self and others while strengthening the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.

AB Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive patterns of behaviors and restricted interests. Current evidence suggested that children with ASD exhibited high level of co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems. Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the utility of the Chinese version of the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5) for assessing and screening ASD at an early age in Taiwan.
   Methods: The CBCL/1.5-5 was completed by the caregivers of 134 clinically referred young children aged 18-47 months, including 66 children with ASD and 68 children with developmental delay (DD).
   Results: The findings of this study showed that young children with ASD scored significantly higher than young children with DD for the following scales: Internalizing, Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, Attention Problems and Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP). The results also showed that the Withdrawn scale yielded the best discrimination between the two groups using a T-score of 66 as cutoff. The area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity were .83, .74, and .77 respectively.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study supported that the CBCL/1.5-5, especially the Withdrawn scale of the syndrome scale, could be used to differentiate young children with ASD from those with DD in Taiwan. Replication with a larger sample size is needed to validate the findings.

AB Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit behavior problems, with more severe ASD symptomatology relating to more severe behavior problems. Behavior problems are correlated with parenting behaviors; however, less research has investigated the relations among specific parenting behaviors and change in child behavior problems, particularly among children with ASD.
   Method: This study examined the interactions among Time 1 ASD symptom severity and parenting behaviors (positive and negative) when predicting Time 2 child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (analyzed separately), when accounting for Time 1 child behavior, caregiver distress, caregiver sex, and child age. The sample included 129 caregivers of a child with ASD (ages 4-10 years) who completed two online questionnaires one year apart, which included measures assessing ASD symptom severity, child behavior problems, parenting behaviors, and caregiver distress.
   Results: Across two hierarchical multiple regression analyses, Time 1 child behavior, caregiver distress, caregiver sex, and negative parenting predicted unique variance in Time 2 child externalizing and internalizing behaviors. The interactions between ASD symptom severity and negative parenting predicting externalizing behaviors and ASD symptom severity and negative parenting predicting internalizing behaviors were significant.
   Conclusions: Examination of plots of the significant interactions suggested higher levels of negative parenting may exacerbate later behavioral problems and lower levels of negative parenting may protect against later behavioral problems for children with less severe ASD symptoms but not for those with more severe ASD symptoms. Results have implications for interventions targeting parenting practices for children with ASD.

AB The current 3-generation (N = 204 families), 3-year longitudinal study examined the intergenerational transmission of cultural socialization among Mexican-origin young mothers and their own mothers (i.e., children's grandmothers) and, in turn, whether young mothers' cultural socialization informed their children's developmental competencies (i.e., interactive play with peers, receptive language, and internalizing and externalizing problem behavior) one year later. Results indicated that mediation was significant, such that grandmother-mother cultural socialization, when children were 3 years old, informed greater mother-child cultural socialization when children were 4 years old, which, in turn, informed children's greater receptive language and interactive play with peers when children were 5 years old. Findings highlight the importance of intergenerational cultural socialization on young children's developmental competencies.

AB Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with social-emotional difficulties, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as early as toddlerhood. The aim of the current study was to understand whether economically disadvantaged children's beliefs about the consequences and correlates of poverty (poverty stereotypes) and their beliefs about their personal economic disadvantage contribute to their social-emotional functioning. Interviews were conducted with 94 socioeconomically diverse 4- to 9-year-old children, whose parents reported on their social-emotional functioning and family socioeconomic disadvantage. As hypothesized, among relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged children, perceived disadvantage was associated with social-emotional functioning. The same relation was not found for relatively socioeconomically advantaged children. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed higher levels of personal disadvantage had more attention problems and more anxious-depressive symptoms than socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed lower levels of personal disadvantage. In addition, only among socioeconomically disadvantaged children (and not among relatively advantaged children) was negative stereotyping associated with attention problems. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed more negative stereotypes had higher levels of attention problems. There was no evidence of an association between negative stereotyping and anxious-depressive symptoms and no moderation of this relation by socioeconomic status. Implications and directions for future research are discussed in light of several relevant theoretical frameworks, including stigma consciousness, status anxiety, and critical consciousness.

AB Unlike individual perceptions of a couple's functioning, couple-level protective factors against poor adjustment to the birth of a child have rarely been studied. This study examined similarity or reciprocal exchanges in dyadic coping (DC) during pregnancy (T1) and at 6 weeks postpartum (T2) and its associations with both partners' adjustment at 6-9 months postpartum (T3). Ninety-two Portuguese couples provided data on DC, internalizing symptoms, dyadic adjustment and parenting stress. An individual's perceived similarity at T1 positively predicted his or her own internalizing symptoms at T3. One partner's perceived similarity at T2 negatively predicted the other partner's internalizing symptoms and parenting stress at T3. These associations controlled for stereotype effects (i.e., similarity due to shared cultural norms and values). Both partners' adjustment seems to benefit from unique similarity within the couple after childbirth, while complementarity in DC during pregnancy appears to be more beneficial in the long term. Our findings suggest important refinements to DC-based interventions already aimed to promote similarity in DC.

AB Objective: We compared clinic-referred youth with ADHD + sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT; n = 34), ADHD Only (n = 108), and SCT Only (n = 22) on demographics, co-occurring symptomatology, comorbid diagnoses, and social functioning. Method: In total, 164 youth (age = 6-17 years, M = 9.97) and their parent(s) presented to an outpatient clinic for a psychoeducational assessment. Between-group analyses and regressions were used to examine study variables. Results: SCT groups were older and exhibited more parent-reported internalizing problems, externalizing problems, sleep problems, and social withdrawal on the Child Behavior Checklist. No significant differences emerged between groups on the Teacher Report Form. Regression analyses involving multiple covariates revealed that SCT symptoms were uniquely related to social withdrawal but not general social problems. Conclusion: Based on parent report, SCT symptoms have a unique relationship with internalizing problems, sleep problems, and social withdrawal. Future research should explore correlates of SCT in youth using multiple informants.

AB Peer victimization is a chronic stressor that occurs within the context of peer interactions and has been robustly associated with numerous negative psychological and social adjustment problems. Although increased frequency of peer victimization has been linked to psychosocial problems, few researchers have studied the role of duration and pervasiveness of victimization (i.e., number of places it occurs). The objective of this study was to examine how frequency, duration, and pervasiveness of peer victimization are associated with youth adjustment. Canadian adolescents (N = 879), ages 12-18 completed an online survey about experiences with peer victimization. Youth also answered questions about internalizing problems, distress, relationship quality with family, friends, and adults in their school and community, as well as academic functioning. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression modeling. Both duration and pervasiveness of peer victimization were predictive of increased internalizing problems, distress, relationship problems, and academic difficulties. Duration and pervasiveness of peer victimization were identified as important factors to consider when predicting youth psychosocial adjustment. By asking questions about these situational factors, parents, teachers, and healthcare providers may more effectively identify youth who are at risk for experiencing mental health problems associated with peer victimization.

AB Background Maternal and paternal depressive symptoms are related to children's emotional problems, but their combined effect remains unclear. Here, we constructed four parental longitudinal depressive symptom trajectory groups and studied their associations with children's emotional problems at the age of 2 and 5 years. Methods We did an assessment of maternal and paternal depressive symptoms (gestational week 32, as well as 3, 8 and 24 months postnatally) and children's emotional problems at ages two (N = 939) and five (N = 700) in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. Three separate maternal and paternal depressive symptom trajectories based on latent profile analysis were combined to form four parental depressive symptom trajectory groups. We compared groups with a general linear model, with children's emotional (total, internalizing and externalizing) - problem scores serving as the dependent variables. Results At both ages, combined parental depressive symptom trajectories were associated with children's emotional problems: effect sizes were medium for total and small for other domains. According to post hoc comparisons, children whose mothers or both parents had persistent depressive symptoms had significantly more total, externalizing and internalizing problems than did children who had neither parent nor only the father showing depressive symptoms. A higher (and persistent) level of maternal depressive symptoms was related to a higher level of these children's emotional problems, a pattern not evident with paternal depressive symptoms. In all analyses, the interaction effect was nonsignificant between parental trajectories and child gender. Conclusions Findings suggest that an absence of depressive symptoms in their fathers cannot compensate for the adverse effects of maternal depressive symptoms upon their children. Moreover, paternal depressive symptoms alone do not lead to increased risk for emotional problems in these 2- and 5-year-old children. In contrast, even subclinical levels of maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy are associated with increased risk for their children's experiencing internalizing and externalizing emotional problems.

AB Retrospective studies using adult self-report data have demonstrated that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase risk of violence perpetration and victimization. However, research examining the associations between adolescent reports of ACE and school violence involvement is sparse. The present study examines the relationship between adolescent reported ACE and multiple types of on-campus violence (bringing a weapon to campus, being threatened with a weapon, bullying, fighting, vandalism) for boys and girls as well as the risk of membership in victim, perpetrator, and victim-perpetrator groups. The analytic sample was comprised of ninth graders who participated in the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (n similar to 37,000). Multinomial logistic regression models calculated the risk of membership for victim only, perpetrator only, and victim-perpetrator subgroups, relative to no violence involvement, for students with ACE as compared with those with no ACE. Separate logistic regression models assessed the association between cumulative ACE and school-based violence, adjusting for age, ethnicity, family structure, poverty status, internalizing symptoms, and school district size. Nearly 30% of students were exposed to at least one ACE. Students with ACE represent 19% of no violence, 38% of victim only, 40% of perpetrator only, and 63% of victim-perpetrator groups. There was a strong, graded relationship between ACE and the probability of school-based victimization: physical bullying for boys but not girls, being threatened with a weapon, and theft or property destruction (ps < .001) and perpetration: bullying and bringing a weapon to campus (ps < .001), with boys especially vulnerable to the negative effects of cumulative ACE. We recommend that schools systematically screen for ACE, particularly among younger adolescents involved in victimization and perpetration, and develop the infrastructure to increase access to trauma-informed intervention services. Future research priorities and implications are discussed.

AB Objective To examine the psychometric properties of a scale of perceived mattering to (step)parents and its links to adolescent mental health. Background Parenting behaviors are important for adolescent development; less is known about the meanings adolescents attach to parents' behaviors. One fundamental meaning adolescents may intuit is that parental behaviors signify how much the adolescent matters to his or her parents. Method Using a cross-sectional community sample of 392 children in seventh grade and their parents, half intact and half stepfather families, adolescents reported on mattering and adolescents, teachers, and parents reported on adolescent mental health. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the structure and psychometric properties of a new mattering scale. Results We found evidence of unidimensionality and discriminant validity for our mattering scale. Mattering correlated negatively with multiple reports of adolescent behavioral problems (internalizing, externalizing) across all parents (i.e., mothers, residential [step]fathers, nonresidential fathers). Within intact families, correlations between mattering and adolescent mental health were stronger for fathers than for mothers. Conclusions These findings provide evidence of the reliability and validity of the mattering measure, suggest that mattering is important for adolescent mental health, and highlight the importance of father-child relationships for adolescents. Implications Our findings highlight the value of targeting fathers, not just mothers, in parenting interventions and of considering mattering in intervention work with families. Furthermore, policies regarding custodial arrangements in divorced, separated, or repartnered families should support father-child relationships when possible.

AB The present study investigated the role of parenting stress in early adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behavior and, particularly, the moderating effect of maternal affection on these associations. The data of 992 early adolescents ((X) over bar (age) = 12.71; 454 girls) and their mothers during the transition from primary school to lower secondary school were analyzed. The results showed that when maternal affection was low, parenting stress was not related to the changes in early adolescents' externalizing or internalizing behavior. In contrast, when maternal affection was high, low parenting stress related to a decrease and high parenting stress to an increase in such behavior. The results were statistically significant and stronger for internalizing behavior; for externalizing behavior, they were marginally significant but showed the same pattern. Overall, the results support the idea that maternal affection provides a context which intensifies (rather than ameliorates) the influence of parenting stress on early adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behavior.

AB Background: Victimized children are at greater risk for psychopathology than non-victimized peers. However, not all victimized children develop psychiatric disorders, and accurately identifying which victimized children are at greatest risk for psychopathology is important to provide targeted interventions. This study sought to develop and internally validate individualized risk prediction models for psychopathology among victimized children.
   Methods: Participants were members of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative British birth cohort of 2,232 twins born in 1994-1995. Victimization exposure was measured prospectively between ages 5 and 12 years, alongside a comprehensive range of individual-, family-, and community-level predictors of psychopathology. Structured psychiatric interviews took place at age-18 assessment. Logistic regression models were estimated with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization to avoid over-fitting to the current sample, and internally validated using 10-fold nested cross-validation.
   Results: 26.5% (n = 591) of E-Risk participants had been exposed to at least one form of severe childhood victimization, and 60.4% (n = 334) of victimized children met diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder at age 18. Separate prediction models for any psychiatric disorder, internalizing disorders, and externalizing disorders selected parsimonious subsets of predictors. The three internally validated models showed adequate discrimination, based on area-under-the-curve estimates (range = = 0.66-0.73), and good calibration.
   Limitations: External validation in wholly-independent data is needed before clinical implementation.
   Conclusions: Findings offer proof-of-principle evidence that prediction modeling can be useful in supporting identification of victimized children at greatest risk for psychopathology. This has the potential to inform targeted interventions and rational resource allocation.

DT Article; Early Access
ID CLASSROOM; TEACHERS; FAMILY; CHILDREN
AB Working on What Works (WOWW) is a manualized, 10-week classroom intervention based on solution-focused brief therapy. This study evaluates WOWW using a randomized experimental, posttest-only design. The study included 30 fourth and fifth grade classrooms, containing 30 teachers and 413 students. Results indicate no significant differences between WOWW and control groups for student internalizing and externalizing behaviors, student-teacher relationships, student academic performance, or teacher sense of efficacy. However, students in the WOWW group had significantly fewer days absent from school compared with the control group. Additionally, teachers' ratings on WOWW classrooms' performance improved significantly more than teachers' ratings on the control classrooms. Results from this study show that WOWW is a feasible intervention for therapists to use in schools and can be implemented across classrooms in both public and private schools. WOWW has potential to improve student attendance and classroom performance, both of which are important areas of concern for schools.

AB Objective The present study examines sibling conflict across two domains and their associations with externalizing behaviors (discussed as problem behavior in this article) 1 year later. Background The close-natured relationship of siblings often leads to sibling conflict. Previous research has found that sibling conflict can be categorized into the following two content domains: invasion of personal (IP) and equality and fairness (EF). These domains of conflict are differential predictors of adolescent adjustment problems, particularly internalizing problems; however, less is known about the link between specific domains of conflict and problem behavior. Method Using Actor Partner Interdependence Modeling, purposive sampling was conducted to recruit a sample of 145 sibling dyads (N = 290) adolescents in 8th, 10th, or 12th grades with a sibling no more than 4 years younger. Adolescents were administered questionnaires assessing the frequency and intensity of sibling conflict and individual problem behavior. Results The results suggest that more intense IP and EF sibling conflicts were more strongly associated with later adjustment problems than frequent IP and EF sibling conflicts. Furthermore, mixed-sex sibling dyads and younger siblings were at greater risk for later problem behavior when engaged in intense IP and EF sibling conflicts. Conclusion The findings of the present study underscore the importance of considering the content of sibling conflict and the contextual factors of siblings as they have differential impacts on adolescent problem behavior.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate whether methotrexate-induced nausea is associated with anxiety or the use of coping strategies in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) treated with methotrexate (MTX). This is an observational study of children diagnosed with JIA (ILAR criteria), treated with MTX and aged 9 years or above. MTX-induced nausea was determined by the children's completion of a nausea diary and the parents' completion of the Methotrexate Intolerance Severity Score (MISS). Anxiety was assessed by the Beck Youth Inventories-Anxiety Inventory (BYI-A) and coping strategies were evaluated by an adapted Nausea Coping Questionnaire. Enrolled were 121 children (82 girls: 39 boys) with a median age (IQR) of 13.3 (11.3-15.1) years. The median MTX-dose (IQR) was 9.7 (9.0-10.9) mg/m(2)/week. The median treatment duration (IQR) was 340 (142-766) days. The MISS was completed for 120 children; 77 children completed the nausea diary for at least 7 days. MTX-induced nausea was present in 61% (73/120) of the children according to the MISS and in 73% (56/77) of the children according to the nausea diary. MTX-induced nausea was associated with a more frequent use of the coping strategy internalizing/catastrophizing (MISS, p = 0.012; diary, p < 0.0001) and higher BYI-A raw scores (diary, p = 0.016). MTX-induced nausea was associated with anxiety and the use of coping strategies in children with JIA. These psychological factors may be part of the mechanism behind the inter-individual variation in the level of nausea to MTX treatment.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are well-documented to experience social-emotional difficulties; however, little is known about their loneliness-an aspect of social-emotional functioning. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined how loneliness relates to comorbid internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, and peer problems in a sample of 213 children with ADHD. Children (66 girls, M-age = 8.58, SDage = 1.55) reported their loneliness. Comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders were assessed via a multi-informant procedure. Proportion of classmates who accepted, rejected, and ignored the child, friendship quantity, and friendship quality were peer problem indicators. Results suggested that children with comorbid internalizing disorders, fewer friendships, or potentially more negative friendship quality, reported more loneliness. Gender appeared to moderate the association between peer rejection and loneliness, such that boys with peer rejection reported more loneliness than girls. Clinical implications include targeting loneliness as a social-emotional problem to assess and treat in children with ADHD.

AB We investigate the impact of maternal ethnic-racial identity on child internalizing trajectories in immigrant and U.S.-born Latinx families. Data from N=1,076 Latinx mothers' reports at child ages 1, 3, 5, and 9 years were used. For children of U.S.-born mothers, but not immigrant mothers, greater levels of maternal ethnic-racial identity were associated with lower levels of internalizing symptoms at age 3, yet attenuated decreases in internalizing symptoms over time. Thus, mother's ethnic-racial identity was a protective factor for children at preschool age but became less protective through school age. Our results suggest that incorporating ethnic-racial identity elements, particularly for U.S.-born mothers of toddlers to preschoolers, may be an important consideration when designing interventions for Latinx families.

AB Although research advocates for comprehensive cross-sector youth violence prevention efforts, mobilizing across sectors to translate scientific recommendations into practice has proven challenging. A unifying framework may provide a foundational step toward building a shared understanding of the risk and protective factors that impact youth violence. We conducted two empirical tests of the nurturing environment framework on youth violence across ethnic and geographically diverse rural and urban adolescent samples. Results show that overall the characteristics of nurturing environments are associated with lower levels of aggression and violence. In addition, minimizing exposure to socially toxic conditions had the strongest associations with lower aggression and violence. Findings were supported across both samples, suggesting that this framework may apply in urban and rural, economically disadvantaged contexts.

AB This study investigates the role of parental and peer relationships' quality on homophobic victimization and possible consequences on mental health during adolescence. Participants were 394 adolescents, (41.6% male and 58.4% female) aged 15-20 years (M = 16.55; SD = 0.85), attending the third and fourth classes of public high schools in Italy. Participants completed the Homophobic Bullying Scale to evaluate homophobic victimization toward gays and lesbians or assumed homosexuals, the Symptom Check-list-90 to evaluate mental health, and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment to investigate the quality of peer and parental relationships (in terms of communication, disaffection, and trust). Results show how the quality of peer relationships is not connected with victimization, but the quality of parental relationships is linked with homophobic victimization. Finally, the victimization is connected with anxiety and somatization problems. Theoretical and educational implications were discussed.

AB School attendance problems are highly prevalent worldwide, leading researchers to investigate many different risk factors for this population. Of considerable controversy is how internalizing behavior problems might help to distinguish different types of youth with school attendance problems. In addition, efforts are ongoing to identify the point at which children and adolescents move from appropriate school attendance to problematic school absenteeism. The present study utilized ensemble and classification and regression tree analysis to identify potential internalizing behavior risk factors among youth at different levels of school absenteeism severity (i.e., 1+%, 3+%, 5+%, 10+%). Higher levels of absenteeism were also examined on an exploratory basis. Participants included 160 youth aged 6-19 years (M = 13.7; SD = 2.9) and their families from an outpatient therapy clinic (39.4%) and community (60.6%) setting, the latter from a family court and truancy diversion program cohort. One particular item relating to lack of enjoyment was most predictive of absenteeism severity at different levels, though not among the highest levels. Other internalizing items were also predictive of various levels of absenteeism severity, but only in a negatively endorsed fashion. Internalizing symptoms of worry and fatigue tended to be endorsed higher across less severe and more severe absenteeism severity levels. A general expectation that predictors would tend to be more homogeneous at higher than lower levels of absenteeism severity was not generally supported. The results help confirm the difficulty of conceptualizing this population based on forms of behavior but may support the need for early warning sign screening for youth at risk for school attendance problems.

AB Background: Bullying and peer victimization among adolescents are growing public health concerns that affect victims' emotional well-being, and their social and academic functioning. Despite concerns about this public health epidemic in low- and middle-income countries, most prevalence, policy and intervention studies have been conducted in developed countries and economies. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2016 and July 2017 at seven public and private schools located in five districts in Pakistan: Lodhran, Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Multan, Thatta, and Nawabshah. A total of 2,315 schoolchildren were surveyed with a specially designed instrument in Urdu with items about demographics and bullying behavior, together with a strengths and difficulties questionnaire. Results: Mean age of the respondents was 14.63 (2.87) years. More than half of the respondents were males (n = 1301, 56.2%), and a majority reported that their mothers were housewives (n = 2,100, 90.7%). A total of 615 (26.6%) respondents reported being bullied at school, and 415 (17.9%) reported being bullied away from school. Perpetration of bullying was reported by 430 (18.6%) participants at school and 376 (16.3%) away from school. Being bullied in the past was strongly associated with becoming a perpetrator of bullying in the future. Internalizing symptoms were significantly associated with male gender, older age, being a victim of bullying, and employment status of the respondent's mother. Externalizing symptoms were significantly associated with male gender, older age, being a victim and perpetrator of bullying, and mother's employment status. Conclusion: Bullying perpetrators have a greater tendency to exhibit externalizing symptoms, whereas victims develop both externalizing and internalizing psychopathologies.

   EXPECTATIONS; METAANALYSIS; ADOLESCENCE
AB Background: Fixed mindsets (beliefs that personal traits are unchangeable) show consistent associations with internalizing symptoms. However, the mindset-internalizing symptom link has previously been studied in isolation of other maladaptive cognitions that relate to internalizing symptoms. Thus, the unique contributions of mindsets to internalizing symptoms remains unclear.
   Method: We used commonality analysis (CA), which yields unique and shared effects of independent variables on an outcome, to assess unique contributions of emotion and anxiety mindsets to anxiety and depression symptoms, relative to the contributions of hopelessness. Participants in two online studies (Ns=200, 430) self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and emotion and anxiety mindsets.
   Results: In Study 1, neither mindset type contributed unique variance to depression or anxiety beyond the contribution of hopelessness. In Study 2, emotion mindsets again explained no unique symptom variance. Anxiety mindsets uniquely contributed 2.0% and 6.5% of depression and anxiety variance, respectively-but far larger proportions of symptom variance (20.0%-60.9%) were contributed by hopelessness alone, variance shared by hopelessness and anxiety mindsets, and variance shared among hopelessness, anxiety mindsets, and emotion mindsets.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design precludes causal conclusions, and the non-referred adult samples may limit generalizability.
   Discussion: Mindsets contributed little unique variance to internalizing symptoms beyond hopelessness. Interventions teaching growth mindsets have been shown to reduce internalizing problem in past studies. However, these interventions might not necessarily operate by shaping mindsets; rather, they may affect symptom change by shaping closely-linked maladaptive cognitions-like hopelessness-with stronger ties to internalizing distress.

AB Background Adoption studies can cast light on environmental influences on development, but heterogeneity in preplacement experiences often complicates interpretation of findings. Methods We studied infant-adopted samples drawn from the 1958 and 1970 British birth cohorts and examined mental health, well-being, physical health and externalizing outcomes at mid-life. Outcomes for adopted cohort members were compared with those of (a) individuals raised in two biological parent families ('general population' comparisons) and (b) birth comparison groups of other nonadopted children from similar circumstances at birth. Results In both cohorts, to-be-adopted children shared early characteristics in common with birth comparison children, but were placed in more socially advantaged adoptive homes. Followed to mid-life, there were few group differences on indicators of physical health or psychological well-being. Levels of psychological distress were comparable in the adopted and general population samples in both cohorts, and more favourable than in the birth comparison groups among women in the 1958 cohort; more beneficial childhood family circumstances contributed to these differences. Rates of adult externalizing outcomes were comparable in the adopted and birth comparison groups in both cohorts, and higher than in the general population samples; indicators of maternal and prenatal exposures contributed to these differences. Conclusions Rearing in adoptive homes may provide protective effects in relation to internalizing problems but may not be as protective in relation to externalizing outcomes.

AB Objective: Because physical exercise improves psychological functioning, it may be beneficial to college students with maltreatment histories. Thus, we tested the hypotheses that cumulative maltreatment would negatively affect psychological functioning, physical exercise would positively affect psychological functioning, and emotion regulation difficulties would negatively contribute to the prediction of psychological functioning. Participants: Participants were 90 undergraduate students (71.1% female, 65.6% white). Methods: Participants completed questionnaires regarding their maltreatment and physical exercise history, emotion regulation difficulties, and psychological functioning. Results: Cumulative maltreatment was negatively correlated with self-esteem and positively correlated with PTSD/depression and frequent exercise was negatively correlated with PTSD/depression. Emotion regulation difficulties impacted the relationships between maltreatment history and psychological functioning, and accounted for much of the variability in psychological functioning. Cumulative maltreatment and exercise impacted different domains of emotion regulation which in turn uniquely affect psychological functioning. Conclusions: Therapeutic interventions should aim to improve these specific emotion regulation abilities.

   CONTEXT
AB Adaptive emotion regulation (ER) in parents has been linked to better parenting quality and social-emotional adjustment in children from middle-income families. In particular, early childhood may represent a sensitive period in which parenting behaviors and functioning have large effects on child social-emotional adjustment. However, little is known about how parent ER and parenting are related to child adjustment in high-risk families. In the context of adversity, parents may struggle to maintain positive parenting behaviors and adaptive self-regulation strategies which could jeopardize their children's adjustment. The current study investigated parents' own cognitive ER strategies and observed parenting quality in relation to young children's internalizing and externalizing problems among families experiencing homelessness. Participants included 108 primary caregivers and their 4-6-year-old children residing in emergency shelters. Using multiple methods, parenting and parent ER were assessed during a shelter stay and teachers subsequently provided ratings of children's internalizing and externalizing difficulties in the classroom. Parenting quality was expected to predict fewer classroom internalizing and externalizing behaviors as well as moderate the association between parent ER strategies and child outcomes. Results suggest that parenting quality buffered the effects of parent maladaptive ER strategies on child internalizing symptoms. The mediating role of parenting quality on that association was also investigated to build on prior empirical work in low-risk samples. Parenting quality did not show expected mediating effects. Findings suggest that parents experiencing homelessness who use fewer maladaptive cognitive ER strategies and more positive parenting behaviors may protect their children against internalizing problems.

AB The purpose of this study is to explore whether talking with parents, siblings, and friends will moderate the association between peer victimization and adverse outcomes (internalizing problems, alcohol/tobacco use, and delinquent friend affiliation). Data were derived from the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children, 2009 to 2010 cohort study in the United States (n = 12,642). Bivariate, logistic regression and ordinal least squares regression analyses were conducted. Peer victimization was found to be associated with all the adverse outcomes. Although ease of talking with parents had a lower likelihood of alcohol/tobacco use, it increased alcohol/tobacco risk when peer victimization increased. Ease of talking with friends showed a higher likelihood of alcohol/tobacco use, but the likelihood was lower when peer victimization increased. Ease of talking with parents and ease of talking with friends both lowered the likelihood of delinquent friend affiliation; however, ease of talking with parents increased the risk of delinquent friend affiliation when peer victimization increased. Moreover, ease of talking with friends decreased the risk of internalizing problems, although it increased the risk of such behaviors when peer victimization increased. Talking with siblings did not buffer the association between peer victimization and adverse outcomes. Implications for practice are also discussed.

AB Background and aims Research on adolescent predictors of later alcohol misuse is typically conducted on samples of singletons, and associations may be confounded by between-family differences. To address potential confounding, we applied a co-twin comparison design to evaluate whether differences between co-twins in a wide array of adolescent risk factors predicted differences in young adult alcohol misuse. Design Longitudinal study in which associations between characteristics of the sample as adolescents were used to predict young adult alcohol misuse in individual-level analyses and co-twin comparisons. Setting Finland. Participants A total of 3402 individuals (1435 complete twin pairs; 36% monozygotic; 57% female) from the FinnTwin12 study. Measurements The young adult alcohol misuse outcome was a composite score of alcohol use and intoxication frequency. Adolescent predictors included factor scores representing academic performance, substance use, externalizing problems, internalizing problems, peer environment, physical health and relationship with parents; and single measures tapping alcohol expectancies, life events and pubertal development. Findings In individual-level analyses, individuals with higher adolescent substance use, externalizing problems, time with friends, peer deviance, sports involvement, sleeping difficulties, parental discipline, positive alcohol expectancies and difficulty of life events reported higher alcohol misuse in young adulthood (Ps < 0.019, R-2 = 0.0003-0.0310%). Conversely, those with higher adolescent internalizing problems, parent-child relationship quality and time with parents reported lower alcohol misuse (Ps < 0021, R-2 = 0.0018-0.0093%). The associations with adolescent substance use and alcohol expectancies remained significant in co-twin comparisons (Ps < 0.049, R-2 = 0.0019-0.0314%). Further, academic performance emerged as a significant predictor, such that individuals with higher grades compared with their co-twin reported higher young adult alcohol misuse (Ps < 0.029, R-2 = 0.0449-0.0533%). Conclusions Adolescent substance use, positive alcohol expectancies and higher academic performance appear to be robust predictors of later alcohol misuse.

AB Background Altered brain activation during response inhibition has been linked to a greater risk for alcohol and other substance use behaviors in late adolescence. However, the ability of neural markers of response inhibition, acquired during adolescence, to temporally predict the transition from less frequent and lower quantity alcohol use to high-risk, frequent (>= weekly) binge drinking behavior remains unclear. Methods Adolescents (N = 29; 9 females) were selected from a larger ongoing longitudinal study to include those who transitioned to at least weekly binge drinking (>= 5/4 alcoholic drinks for males/females per occasion) over a 15-year follow-up period. Prior to the onset of weekly binge drinking (mean age = 18.0), participants underwent a functional MRI including a go/no-go task. Whole-brain activation from the no-go correct rejection versus no-go false alarm contrast was used to predict time to transition to frequent binge drinking. Results Less no-go correct rejection versus no-go false alarm activation in a cluster including the precentral gyri, insula, and inferior frontal gyri predicted a more rapid transition into frequent binge drinking (voxel-wise alpha < 0.001, cluster-wise alpha < 0.05, cluster threshold >= 18 voxels). Conclusions Results from this study are supported by literature suggesting that frontoinsular involvement is important for successful inhibition and cognitive control. Altered brain activation during response inhibition may thus represent neural antecedents of impulse regulation difficulties related to alcohol consumption. The magnitude of this activation provides temporal information that may be used to inform and optimize timing of interventions aimed at preventing the escalation and transition to problematic drinking for youth who have already begun to engage in drinking behaviors.

AB This article synthesizes knowledge on the role of relationships and key macroand micro-contexts - poverty, racism, families, communities, schools, and peers - in supporting and/or undermining the healthy development of children and youth, using a relational developmental systems framework. Relationships with parents, siblings, peers, caregivers, and teachers are explored in the context of early care and childhood settings, schools, classrooms, and school-based interventions. Additional contextual factors include; chronic stress, institutionalized racism, stereotype threat, and racial identity. A companion article focuses on how the human brain develops, and the major constructs that define human development, the constructive nature of development, and the opportunities for resilience. Human development occurs through reciprocal coactions between the individual and their contexts and culture, with relationships as the key drivers. Relationships and contexts, along with how children appraise and interpret them, can be risks and assets for healthy learning and development, and their influence can be seen across generations and can produce intra- as well as intergenerational assets and risks. This knowledge about the individual's responsiveness to context and experience has both positive and negative implications across early childhood, adolescence and into adulthood. Sensitive periods for brain growth and development are considered within the contextual factors that influence development including; parental responsiveness and attunement, intentional skill development, mindfulness, reciprocal interactions, adversity, trauma, and enriching opportunities. The accumulated knowledge on human development and the power of context and culture can inform child-serving systems that support positive adaptations, resilience, learning, health, and well-being.

AB We utilized a life course framework to examine associations between the accumulation, timing, and duration of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) across early childhood (ages 1-5 years) and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 9. The sample included 1,789 children from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a birth cohort study of children born between 1998 and 2000. Primary caregivers reported on seven ACEs at child ages 1, 3, 5, and 9. We created 2 summary measures of early childhood ACEs to capture (a) accumulation and (b) timing and duration. We derived indicators of caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 5 and 9. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between early childhood ACEs and behavior problems at age 9, sequentially adjusting for sociodemographic covariates, age 9 ACEs, and age 5 behavior problems. In fully adjusted models, children exposed to 6 or more ACEs in early childhood faced 3 times the odds of age 9 behavior problems, compared to children exposed to 0-1 ACE. Intermittent adversity was associated with the greatest increase in odds of age 9 behavior problems, relative to other early childhood timing/duration categories. Categories of high early and high late adversity were also associated with age 9 behavior problems. Chronic adversity was not associated with age 9 behaviors in final models that adjusted for age 5 problems. These results demonstrate the importance of a developmental perspective for understanding the role of childhood adversity in the etiology of child psychopathology.

AB Objective: Research suggests that college is a risky period for changes in eating behavior and beliefs. Although social health determinants relate to health behavior changes, research has not explored subjective social status, one's societal standing, in terms of eating expectancies among college students. The present study examined the emotion dysregulation in association between subjective social status and eating expectancies among college students. Participants: Participants were a diverse sample of 1,589 college students (80.4% females; M-age = 22.2 years, SD = 5.27) from an urban university. Results: Results showed a significant indirect association of subjective social status via emotion dysregulation in relation to expectancies of eating to help manage negative affect, to alleviate boredom, and to lead to feeling out of control. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that college students with lower subjective social status may have a higher risk for dysregulated emotions, and consequently, expressing maladaptive eating expectancies.

AB The goal of the current research is to test the 15-items existential annihilation anxieties (EAA) scale cross-nationally. The EAA scale found in a previous study to have four first-order factors: psychic, collective, status and physical identity EAA, and a unitary second-order factor. The study utilized a previously collected data (N = 1566) that included five countries: Egypt (N = 490), Turkey (N = 420), Kuwait (N = 300), UK (N = 177) and Syria (N = 179). Participants included 51.4% of males and 14.6% of adolescents. Age ranges between 14 and 75. Measures included EAA, cumulative stressors and traumas (CST), the "will to exist, live and survive" (WTELS), the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, emotion regulation, identity salience, PTSD, and poor health. We conducted a zero-order correlation between the primary variables, alpha reliability, and confirmatory factor analysis of the factor structure of EAA, found in the previous study. We further tested its invariance across different age, gender, and national groups. Results indicated a high alpha of .92 of the scale. The confirmatory factor analysis found that the previously found structure fit well in the multinational data and was strictly invariant across genders and age group and strongly invariant across the five national groups. EAA highly correlated with PTSD (.52) and correlated with psychopathology, internalizing, externalizing, thought disorder, poor health, and CST. EAA was negatively correlated with WTELS, self-esteem, religiosity and emotion regulation (reappraisal). The EAA scale has robust psychometrics cross-nationally, and its conceptual framework is clinically significant and worth considering as a new focus of the new Transdiagnostic intervention strategy for PTSD.

AB There is a growing need for valid measures that can be administered efficiently in school settings to assess the impact of school-based preventive interventions. The current article aimed to establish a balance among assessment efficiency, reliability, and the measurement properties of an instrument widely used to assess the impact of school-based programs, called the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation-Checklist (TOCA-C). We leveraged item response theory (IRT) analyses to create a shortened, more focused checklist version of the TOCA-C that is both valid and efficient for large-scale use in schools to track students' behavioral, social-emotional, and family factors over the course of elementary school. The sample included 17,456 children in kindergarten through grade 5 (47.7 percent female, 54.2 percent African American). IRT analyses resulted in the retention of 33 of the original 39 items comprising seven subscales: (1) Concentration Problems, (2) Aggressive/Disruptive Behavior, (3) Prosocial Behavior, (4) Emotion Regulation Problems, (5) Internalizing Problems, (6) Family Problems, and (7) Family Involvement. IRT, item difficulty estimates, and confirmatory factor analyses revealed limited evidence of bias based on gender, race, or grade; together, the findings suggested that the 33-item TOCA-C is a highly valid and reliable measure.

AB Introduction: Over the last decades, many Western countries have seen an increase in mental health difficulties in the adolescent population. Among Norwegian adolescents, internalizing symptoms are most prevalent, and 10%-38% of adolescents seek out primary health care services for mental health problems. This study examined whether an idiographic measure designed for adolescents called Assert, which uses variables individually selected by the adolescents, could improve user involvement, locus of control, mental health, and quality of life.
   Methods: This study conducted a randomized controlled effectiveness trial using Assert in primary healthcare. A community sample of 150 Norwegian adolescents aged 12-23 years (M = 16.2; SD = 2.2) were randomized to the Assert or control group. Of the participants 27 (18%) were male. The adolescents and 52 counsellors from primary healthcare services responded to online questionnaires. Of the counselors, 92.8% were female and trained in the use of systematic idiographic assessment.
   Results: Adolescents who used Assert scored significantly lower on external LoC, attributing less of their mental health improvement to chance, fate, or luck. However, the intervention showed no effect on the symptoms of mental health, QoL, or user involvement.
   Conclusions: Using Assert in primary healthcare may enhance adolescents' sense of being able to influence their life circumstances and mental health by allowing them more control of their treatment. However, this approach might not be successful in reducing symptoms.

AB Objectives This study examined whether the relation between peer victimization or rejection and internalizing distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms) was moderated by emotion regulation processes in a sample of elementary schoolers.
   Methods Analyses were based on a sample of 476 third and fourth-grade children (M= 9.16 years). Data were collected in the fall and spring of one academic year. Peer-reported victimization and rejection were assessed through a peer nomination inventory. Child-reported victimization, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and emotion regulation were assessed via self-report measures.
   Results Findings from multiple group path models provided evidence that girls scoring higher on peer rejection and boys scoring higher on peer-reported relational victimization reported fewer depressive symptoms in the spring when scoring lower on expressive suppression (girls: beta = 0.157, SE = 0.067, p = 0.019; boys: beta = 0.239, SE = 0.099, p = 0.016). Alternatively, boys scoring higher on self-reported peer victimization in the fall reported fewer anxiety symptoms in the spring when scoring higher on expressive suppression (beta= -0.260, SE = 0.117, p = 0.027) or lower on cognitive reappraisal (beta = 0.246, SE = 0.097, p = 0.011). Boys' peer-reported victimization emerged as a positive predictor of anxiety in the spring, but only at high levels of cognitive reappraisal (beta = 0.284, SE = 0.128, p = 0.026).
   Conclusions Results suggest that expressing emotion is a useful process for reducing depressive symptoms in rejected girls and relationally victimized boys. For boys, suppressing emotion may reduce the risk for developing anxiety as a consequence of peer victimization. Results suggest cognitive reappraisal is not an effective strategy for reducing anxiety in boys as a consequence of peer victimization. This study helps inform our understanding of the role of emotion regulation in relation between peer relationship difficulties and internalizing distress.

AB Objectives With the rise of internal migration in China, research has shown parental migration is linked to adolescent psychological adjustment, but little is known about the corresponding adjustment among left-behind adolescents in urban areas. More importantly, the protective factors for their adjustment are still sparsely covered in the literature. Guided by a risk and resilience ecological framework, the current study compares internalizing problem behavior (IPB) and externalizing problem behavior (EPB) between urban left-behind adolescents and their non-left-behind counterparts in mainland China. It also examines whether the direct and interactive effects of peer attachment and two facets of grit-perseverance of effort (PE) and consistency of interests (CI)-can mitigate problem behaviors in urban left-behind adolescents.
   Methods A propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the two groups concerning age, gender, socioeconomic status, and family functioning. Finally, 246 left-behind adolescents (53.6% girls) and 492 non-left-behind counterparts (55.1% girls) aged 13-18 years were involved in this study.
   Results Urban left-behind adolescents perceived higher levels of IPB and EPB compared to non-left-behind peers. Moreover, higher levels of PE buffered the association between peer attachment and IPB, whereas lower levels of PE exacerbated the association between peer attachment and EPB for urban left-behind adolescents only. Additionally, higher levels of CI buffered the association between peer attachment and EPB for both groups.
   Conclusions This study concludes that peer attachment and PE have protective roles in mitigating problem behaviors among urban left-behind adolescents.

AB The present meta-analysis integrates results from 310 longitudinal studies on associations of the attainment of 10 developmental tasks with psychological symptoms (e.g., internalizing or externalizing symptoms, anxiety, and depression). Higher initial success with getting access to a peer group, building friendships, preparing for a future career, body acceptance, as well as developing a personal identity, a value system, and socially responsible behavior predicted lower levels of symptoms at follow-up and stronger declines of symptoms over time when controlling for initial symptom levels. Furthermore, higher initial symptom levels predicted lower attainment of these tasks at follow-up as well as lower progress in task attainment. In contrast, more initial romantic/sexual involvement predicted an increase in symptoms over time, while higher initial symptoms were related to an increase in romantic/sexual involvement. Associations with autonomy varied between different forms of autonomy, while acquisition of a gender role was not related with psychological symptoms.

AB This research examined whether heightened neural activation to social cues confers adjustment advantages in supportive social contexts but adjustment disadvantages in stressful social contexts. Forty-five adolescent girls were exposed to social exclusion during an fMRI scan and reported on parent-child relationship quality and depressive symptoms. Stressful parent-child relationships predicted subsequent depressive symptoms in girls with high and moderate but not low dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior insula activation during exclusion. In the context of supportive parent-child relationships, however, neural activation to exclusion predicted particularly low levels of depressive symptoms. This support for a biological sensitivity to context model suggests the possibility of redirecting adolescent girls' neural sensitivity to social cues toward more positive adaptation.

AB Background: Associations between maltreatment experiences and psychopathology symptoms in children and adolescents are well established. However, the role of domain-specific self-representations (SR) in those associations remains unexplored.
   Objective: This multi-informant study aimed to explore the indirect associations between maltreatment experiences and children's and adolescents' psychopathology symptoms (i.e., internalizing and externalizing problems), through domain-specific self-representations, and the moderating role of age in those indirect associations.
   Participants and setting: Participants were 203 children/adolescents (52.7 % boys), aged 8-16 years old (M = 12.64; SD = 2.47), referred to child/youth protection commissions, their parents, and case workers.
   Method: Case workers reported on child/adolescent maltreatment, children/adolescents reported on SR, and parents reported on psychopathology symptoms.
   Results: Controlling for chronicity of maltreatment and child/adolescent sex effects, multiple mediation path analysis revealed that: 1) higher levels of physical and psychological abuse were associated with less externalizing problems through more negative social SR; 2) higher levels of physical neglect were associated with more externalizing problems through more positive opposition SR; 3) higher levels of psychological neglect were associated with less externalizing problems through more negative physical appearance SR, and 4) associated with more externalizing problems through more negative opposition SR. Moreover, the indirect effects of physical and psychological abuse on internalizing and externalizing problems through instrumental SR were conditional on child/adolescent age.
   Conclusion: Findings signal the relevance of preventing child/adolescent maltreatment and promoting the construction of positive and, foremost, realistic and adaptive self-representations as protection against maladjustment.

AB Background: Many children who are removed from a dangerous or neglectful home and placed in state custody subsequently experience additional disruptions while in custody, which can compound the effects of ongoing stress and instability. As such, placement stability has been identified as a critical objective and a key indicator of success for children residing in substitutive care.
   Objective: To examine the utility of child protective services data in identifying predictors of placement disruption.
   Participants and setting: The current study examined data from youth in Tennessee state custody who had been assessed using the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) assessment within 30-days of their first, out-of-home placement. The sample included 8,853 youth ages 5-19 years old (M = 13.1; SD = 4.0; 44.8 % female).
   Methods: Demographics, placement information, and the CANS assessment were collected by the Tennessee Department of Children's Services for all child welfare episodes for children as part of the system's usual standard of care. Bivariate correlation and linear regression models were conducted.
   Results: Multiple risk indices from the CANS appeared to significantly increase risk of placement disruption, including child internalizing and externalizing symptoms, school difficulties, youth affect dysregulation, and child age.
   Conclusions: The current findings suggest that data collected as part of standard practice by child welfare workers such as the CANS is both feasible and has utility for identifying sources of risk for placement disruptions and to inform possible targets of intervention to enhance placement stability.

AB Background: Associations between parenting attitudes and behavior and children's adjustment are well-established, including links between negative parenting beliefs and increased risk for child maltreatment and poorer child functioning. Considerably less is known regarding what factors may correspond with parenting attitudes, particularly among at-risk samples. In line with theoretical models of the determinants of parenting, the aim of the study was to investigate correlates of parenting attitudes among child, caregiver, family, and neighborhood factors.
   Participants and settings/methods: The study included 1071 4-year-old children (48.8 % female; 55.7 % Black) and their caregivers from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) study.
   Results: Numerous factors were consistently related to more positive parenting attitudes (i.e., more appropriate parenting expectations, greater empathy, and valuing non-physical punishment), including greater educational attainment, caregiver history of child sexual and physical abuse, lower levels of children's internalizing symptoms, greater family income, and lower levels of psychological aggression. Lower levels of caregiver depressive symptoms, greater number of maltreatment allegations, use of nonviolent discipline, and less severity of stressful life events were tied to more adaptive parenting attitudes in one or two domains.
   Conclusions: Caregiver, child, familial, and environmental factors, as well as child maltreatment, may be important in determining parenting attitudes. Identification of the drivers of parenting attitudes may aid identification and intervention efforts with high-risk samples of caregivers to help improve parenting outcomes.

AB An inability to successfully regulate anger has been linked to adverse outcomes for students, including psychological problems and special education placement due to significant emotional and behavioral difficulties. Early identification, therefore, is critical to provide timely intervention for students before anger-related problems escalate. The Anger Expression Scale for Children was developed to address some of the limitations of previous measurement tools designed to assess anger expression with children and adolescents. Yet validation is needed with upper elementary school populations-a key identification and prevention period. Thus, we examined the factor structure of the scale with 2,020 fourth and fifth graders. Results revealed support for a modified two-factor model, with a general Anger Expression factor and Anger Control factor. Criterion-related validity analyses indicated that Anger Expression was positively associated with aggression and externalizing problems, whereas Anger Control was related to emotion control and less internalizing behaviors. We discuss implications of findings for both informed school use and future research.

AB Despite increasing empirical research documenting the association between parental ethnicracial socialization and youth of color's psychosocial well-being, evidence on the extent to which ethnic-racial socialization practices are linked to youth outcomes and potential variation in these relations remains equivocal. In the current study, a meta-analysis of 102 studies with 803 effect sizes and 27,221 participants reveals that overall ethnic-racial socialization was positively, albeit modestly, associated with self-perceptions, interpersonal relationship quality, and internalizing behavior. Ethnic-racial socialization's overall association with externalizing behavior was nonsignificant. Moreover, ethnic-racial socialization's connection to psychosocial outcomes varied by the subtype that parents used, the developmental stage and race/ethnicity of the target child, and the reporter of ethnic-racial socialization. In particular, cultural socialization was positively associated with self-perceptions and interpersonal relationship quality and negatively associated with externalizing behaviors. In addition, ethnic-racial socialization's positive association with self-perceptions was strongest in early adolescence and among African American youth. These findings underscore the complexity of parental ethnic-racial socialization practices and the need for a nuanced perspective on it. Implications for parenting practices and future research are discussed.

AB Social self-perception contributes to the development of social adjustment. Perception accuracy is associated with acceptance by peers, whereas inaccurate social perception has been linked to poor peer relationships, loneliness, and internalizing problems. The aim of this study was to analyze bias and both generalized and dyadic accuracy in adolescents' perceptions of acceptance and rejection, and to examine the association with age, gender, and sociometric status. Participants were 206 adolescents (50.49% girls) aged between 12 and 19 years (M = 14.39, SD = 1.64). A sociometric test was administered. Results show that generalized perception accuracy was influenced by age, with older adolescents being more accurate. Gender differences were observed in generalized perceptions of rejection, with girls being less accurate. Regarding sociometric status, popular and rejected adolescents tended to underestimate the extent to which they were accepted and rejected, respectively. It is concluded that adolescents' social self-perception vary according to age, gender, and sociometric status.

AB Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is considered an important public health concern that can derail the developmental course of children. Given that children rely upon their attachment figures when they experience upsetting events, attachment organization may play a critical role in predicting victims' adaptation to CSA. To date, no studies have delineated the unique and interactive contributions of these two risk factors in the prediction of psychopathology. The aims of this study were to examine attachment in CSA victims and a comparison group and to assess the contributions of each risk factor to child psychological difficulties. Participants included 111 children aged 7-13, of whom 43 were CSA victims. Children completed an attachment interview and reported on their depressive symptoms. Their mothers reported on children's externalizing symptoms, internalizing symptoms, dissociation, and sexualized behavior. Our key findings showed that child victims of CSA were more likely to be classified as having insecure and disorganized attachment. Further, insecure attachment was the primary factor associated with higher self-reported depressive symptoms in all children and that CSA was associated with more parent-reported child externalizing problems, sexualizing problems, and dissociation.

AB The increased scope and percentage of children being homeschooled raise questions about the impact of this framework on the child's world. One of the issues that has not been adequately studied with regard to homeschooling is whether the emotional and personal problems of parents have greater impact on children who are homeschooled. The present research, conducted in Israel, examined this question from the perspective of attachment theory, which focuses on how people relate to intimate relationships. Previous research has shown an association between the attachment of parents and emotional and behavioral characteristics of their children. Against this background, the present research compared a group of homeschooling mothers and children with a group of mothers who sent their children to school (a total of 101 children; mean age, 9.2 years). These groups did not differ in age and socioeconomic status. The comparison focused on variables beyond these and also considered the degree of structure of the homeschooling practiced. The findings indicated a correlation between mother's attachment anxiety and internalizing and externalizing problems of the child. However, no correlation was found between attachment avoidance and these problems, and no difference was found between the two groups in terms of these correlations. The results contribute, among other things, to understanding the association between homeschooling and behavioral and emotional problems.

AB This study examined disruptions in caregiving, as well as the association of these disruptions, with cognitive, behavioral, and social outcomes at age 12 in a sample of 136 Romanian children who were abandoned to institutions as infants and who experienced a range of subsequent types of care. Children were found to experience significantly more caregiving disruptions (CGD) earlier in life than later in childhood. More frequent CGD predicted increases in externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at age 12. Results are discussed in terms of the association between CGD and the long-term development of children who have experienced institutional rearing.

AB Seventy-nine 3-year olds and their mothers participated in a laboratory-based task to assess maternal hostility. Mothers also reported their behavioral regulation of their child. Seven years later, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired while viewing emotional faces and completing a reward processing task. Maternal hostility predicted more negative amygdala connectivity during exposure to sad relative to neutral faces with frontal and parietal regions as well as more negative left ventral striatal connectivity during monetary gain relative to loss feedback with the right posterior orbital frontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus. In contrast, maternal regulation predicted enhanced cingulo-frontal connectivity during monetary gain relative to loss feedback. Results suggest parenting is associated with alterations in emotion and reward processing circuitry 7-8 years later.

DT Article
DE Civilizing discourse; Educational Press; Childhood
AB The present article aims to analyze the permanences and discontinuities of the civilizatory discourses propagated in educational forms that sought to regulate aspects of physical and moral health in the second half of the twentieth century. With this intent, on examine the Pedrinho Graduate Reading Series, by Lourenco Filho, which circulated in the primary public school throughout Brazil in the 1950s and 1960s, and the monthly magazine Pais & Filhos, specifically a sample of editions from the 1960s to the 1980s. Based on the discussions about the civilization process undertaken by Norbert Elias, it was found that the period after World War II was marked by the reinvention of forms of coexistence, of belonging and social distinction. In this context, the production and circulation of printed matter that disseminated civilizing contents, in the most varied material and textual supports, constituted "discursive and institutional devices that, in a given society, aim at disciplining the body and practices and model behaviors and the thoughts" (CHARTIER, 2003, p.155). The publications examined were circulated both in the school institution and from outside, between parents. In addition, they contributed to internalizing habits, behaviors, values that were the producers of rules on health practices and guidelines for a perfect personal, moral and social conduct.

AB Background and Aims Alcohol use and marijuana use tend to be social activities among adolescents. Some youth use alcohol or marijuana while alone. This article provides a framework for examining the risk factors for and consequences of solitary alcohol and marijuana use, grounded in a motivational model that emphasizes coping with negative emotions, and provides the first systematic review of research on solitary alcohol and marijuana use among middle school- and high school-aged adolescents in the United States. Methods PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched. Articles were included if they mention solitary alcohol or marijuana (or illicit drug) use among adolescents aged 12-18 years. Studies on non-human animals, college students, non-English language publications and articles exclusively about solitary tobacco or inhalant use were excluded. Overall, 22 articles were selected. Results Prevalence of adolescent solitary alcohol and marijuana use was relatively high (e.g. 14% life-time solitary drinking in the general adolescent population), particularly in high-risk subgroups (e.g. 38.8% life-time solitary drinking in a sample of youth recruited from clinical and community settings). Risk factors for solitary alcohol and marijuana use include earlier onset and heavier use, coping motives, negative emotions and positive expectancies about use. Solitary alcohol and marijuana use are prospectively associated with later substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms, diminished academic performance and perceived health. Conclusions Approximately 1 in 7 adolescents in the US appear to have engaged in solitary alcohol and marijuana use at some point. It is positively associated with extent of drinking and marijuana use, cop;ing motives, negative emotions, and positive expectancies, as well as subsequent SUD symptoms and poor academic and health-related outcomes.

AB Child depression has been inconsistency linked to cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) reactivity. This study assessed three factors that contribute to inconsistencies: 1) the differential effectiveness of laboratory challenges to elicit cortisol and sAA; 2) the impact of cortisol-sAA coordination; and 3) variation in parent versus child ratings of depression. A community sample of 52 children participated in the Trier Social Stress Test-Child Version (TSST-C) and a competition challenge. Saliva was collected and assayed for cortisol and sAA. Analyses were conducted using multilevel modeling. Child-reported depressive symptoms were associated with a declining cortisol trajectory in the TSST-C. Mother-reported depressive symptoms were associated with higher baseline sAA in the TSST-C and the competition challenge. Further, child-reported depressive symptoms were associated with cortisol-sAA coordination in the competition challenge. Findings underscore the nature of the challenge and the behavioral informant as impacting associations between child depressive symptoms and cortisol and sAA secretion.

AB The developmental psychobiology of self-regulation in childhood has received increasing attention in recent years. As a next step in advancing research and theorizing about the processes by which early biological correlates of self-regulation are forged, a more nuanced consideration of the contexts in which these phenomena are embedded is needed. This review synthesizes insights from distinct but complementary approaches to studying the developmental psychobiology of early self-regulation, focusing on the idea of context at different time scales. Three types of context that differ in temporal resolution are considered: (a) The temporally immediate contexts occurring within a structured challenge, including the baseline-to-task context of reactive psychobiology, the within-task context of dynamic change, and the post-task context of recovery from challenge. (b) The temporally moderate contexts of task type, including variants like the specific emotion that is under study and whether the task involves (or allows for) self-regulatory behaviors. (c) The temporally chronic contexts of important social relationships within which children are embedded and developing. Future research efforts that incorporate a more nuanced appreciation for the temporal resolution of contexts in developmental psychobiology will allow for novel tests and refinement of theories of self-regulation, as well as other domains of child development.

AB Purpose: The purpose of the study was to identify proximal links between electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use and numerous indicators of adjustment, delinquency, and other substance use in adolescence, beyond prior levels and confounders.
   Methods: The ongoing Millennium Cohort Study is a nationally representative, intergenerational, longitudinal study of children born 2000-2001 in the United Kingdom followed from birth to age 14 years (n = 11,564 adolescents and their parents). A series of ordinary least squares and logistic regressions compared 14-year-old e-cigarette only users to never users and to combustible/dual users on 10 measures of adjustment (school engagement, well-being, and self-esteem), delinquency (theft, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and graffitiing), and other substance use (frequent alcohol use, heavy drinking, and marijuana use). Controls included each outcome variable measured at age 11 years and prospectively assessed parent and child confounders (e.g., parent education, child externalizing and internalizing behaviors, cognitive test scores, gender, and race/ethnicity).
   Results: At age 14 years, e-cigarette only users (approximately 7% of youth) had a higher risk of adolescent adjustment problems, delinquent behavior, and substance use relative to nonusers (75% of youth), but lower risk relative to combustible cigarette/dual users (18% of youth), even after controlling for a host of childhood confounders.
   Conclusions: Positive links shown here between e-cigarette use and poor adjustment, delinquency, and other substance use in adolescence, coupled with accumulating evidence that e-cigarettes substantially increase youths' likelihood of combustible smoking, indicate that e-cigarettes are part of an emerging pattern of health-risk behaviors and poor adjustment for some youth.

AB Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal stress does not solely undermine child functioning but increases developmental plasticity to both negative and positive postnatal experiences. Here we test this proposition using the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study while implementing an extreme-group (i.e., high vs. low prenatal stress) design (n = 27,889 children for internalizing and n = 27,892 for externalizing problems). To measure prenatal stress, mothers reported on depressive and anxiety symptoms at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and of stressful life events at gestational week 30. We then evaluated whether, collectively, such prenatal stress amplified the effect of mothers' postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms on children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 5 years. Results showed prenatal stress amplified effects of postnatal maternal depression/anxiety on child internalizing but not externalizing behavior, with some indication that this Prenatal-Stress-X-Postnatal-Maternal-Depression interaction proved more consistent with differential susceptibility than diathesis stress thinking: Children exposed to prenatal stress evinced greater internalizing problems if exposed to more postnatal maternal depressive/anxiety symptoms and, somewhat less strongly, displayed less internalizing problems if they experienced lower postnatal maternal depressive/anxiety symptoms. However, analyses using the whole sample instead of extreme groups yielded opposing results with children exposed to the least prenatal stress evincing greater sensitivity to postnatal maternal depressive/anxiety symptoms with regards to externalizing and internalizing behavior. Taken together, it appears that prenatal stress may have differing effects on plasticity depending on prenatal stress severity.

AB Background: One in four children 5-16 years (y) of age shows signs of mental health problems in the United Kingdom; risk is higher in economically disadvantaged groups. Greater physical activity is associated with lower risk of internalizing problems such as depression and anxiety. We simulated the potential impact of population-wide physical activity interventions on overall prevalence of internalizing problems, and by family income. Interventions were based on the World Health Organization (WHO) children's target of 60 minutes (min) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day and trial evidence. Methods: Data were from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a population-representative cohort of children born in 2000-2002. Household income (5 y) was the exposure; internalizing problems (outcome) were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (11 y). Of 18,296 singletons, 6,497 had accelerometer physical activity data (mediator, manipulated to simulate interventions) at 7 y. We predicted probabilities of outcome according to exposure in marginal structural models, weighted for attrition and confounding, and adjusted for observed mediator. We then re-estimated probabilities in different physical activity intervention scenarios, assessing income inequalities in internalizing problems with risk ratios (RRs) and differences (RDs) according to income quintile. Results: Simulating universal achievement of the WHO target led to little change in prevalence (10% [95% CI = 8%, 12%]) and socioeconomic inequalities in internalizing problems; RR: 2.2 (1.1, 3.4); RD: 8% [5%,13%]). More modest increases in physical activity achieved weaker results. Conclusions: Our simulations suggest that large increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in the United Kingdom would have little effect on prevalence and inequalities in child mental health problems.

AB Drawing from dispositional mindfulness research and stress and coping theories, we tested whether adolescents' dispositional mindfulness was associated with perceptions of peer victimization and exclusion and internalizing symptoms. We further explored the role of dispositional mindfulness as a protective factor buffering the impact of peer victimization and exclusion (PVE) on internalizing symptoms. Participants were 361 (40% boys) adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.4) who completed a questionnaire to assess dispositional mindfulness, perceptions of PVE, social anxiety and depressive symptoms, and loneliness. As expected, more frequent experience of PVE was associated with reporting more symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Further, adolescents who reported higher dispositional mindfulness also reported fewer symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness, even after controlling for gender and experiences of PVE. Dispositional mindfulness was not protective against (i.e., did not buffer) the effects of PVE on internalizing symptoms. Instead, we found that PVE had a stronger association with symptoms of social anxiety, depression, and loneliness when mindfulness was high relative to when it was medium or low. Yet, victimization was associated with greater social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness at all levels of mindfulness.

AB This study examines the effect of inconsistent Medicaid coverage on parenting stress, maternal depression, and child behavior in a sample of teen mothers and their children. The majority (54%) of mothers experienced inconsistent coverage. After 24 months, mothers experiencing inconsistent coverage had significantly higher parenting stress and depressive symptoms, and their children had more internalizing behaviors than families with consistent Medicaid. These differences existed despite no initial differences and controlling for numerous covariates. Policies and practices that stabilize Medicaid coverage for teen parent families may reduce unnecessary stress, depressive symptoms, and early childhood behavior problems.

AB Black South Africans are disproportionately affected by HIV compared with White counterparts. In their unique social context, South African families affected by HIV are vulnerable to adverse psychosocial effects. U.S.-based and emerging South African research suggests mothers living with HIV may experience compromised parenting. In the United States, mother-child relationship quality has been associated with internalizing (anxiety, depression) and externalizing (delinquency, acting out) child behaviors. This study adds to South African research with emphasis on the role of the mother-child relationship among HIV-affected South Africans from multiple communities. Structural equation modeling examined relationships between maternal health and child adjustment, operating through mother-child relationship. The best-fitting model suggested maternal health influences youth externalizing behaviors through the mother-child relationship, but that maternal health is directly related to child internalizing problems. Findings support and extend previous results. Further research would benefit from investigating ways the unique South African context influences these variables and their interactions.

AB Objective: To examine the perspectives of ethnically diverse, low-income parents of young children regarding sleep, sleep habits, and preferences for sleep promotion for themselves and their children.
   Method: We recruited a sample of mothers who had a 15- to 60-month-old child enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants and Children in a Northeastern U.S. city. We used a convergent mixed-methods design to conduct semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to measure parent sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), sleep apnea (Berlin Apnea Questionnaire), mood (Centers for Epidemiological Studies of Depression), children's sleep (Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire), and behavior (Child Behavior Checklist).
   Results: Thirty-two mothers (M age = 30.97 [SD 6.34] years; n = 21 [65%] African American) and children (N = 14 [44% female]; M age =38 [SD 12.63] months) participated. Children's average sleep duration was 10 hr, which is below the recommendation for this age group; overall sleep difficulty was high despite most mothers reporting that their children had normal sleep. Five children had abnormal Child Behavior Checklist scores, suggesting internalizing and externalizing behaviors. More than half of the mothers had poor sleep quality and 24 (75%) were at high risk for sleep apnea. Mothers viewed sleep as important for themselves and their children and identified both effective and ineffective practices to promote sleep, including practices learned from their own families.
   Conclusions: Ethnically diverse mothers who are living with economic adversity value sleep for themselves and their children. The high value placed on sleep, despite misconceptions about normal sleep, suggest opportunities to promote sleep interventions. The content and delivery methods should be tailored to their knowledge, preferences, and cultural practices.

AB Objective: A new cancer diagnosis leads to many daily changes in the lives of youth. We aimed to determine how short-term emotion dynamics relate to psychosocial adjustment over time in youth with newly diagnosed cancer and healthy peers. Methods: Youth with newly diagnosed cancer (n = 71, weeks since diagnosis: M = 6.56, SD = 1.94) and age-matched controls (n = 63), aged 8-17 years, reported on their daily mood across the week (T1). Two to 4 months later (T2), youth reported on perceived parental care and overprotection, anxiety, and quality of life. Primary caregivers reported on youth's externalizing and internalizing problems and on parental distress. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted to identify individual daily mood profiles at T1. These profiles were used to predict adjustment at T2, controlling for sociodemographic factors and looking at differences between cancer patients and comparisons. Results: LPA revealed 4 daily mood profiles: stable positive mood (SPM, 61.6%), stable negative mood (SNM, 4.8%), intermediate mood (27.6%), and fluctuating negative mood (FNM, 6%). No sociodemographic or cancer/comparison differences were found across mood profiles. Results showed several relations between mood profiles across the week and adjustment outcomes at T2. Overall, a SPM related to favorable adjustment outcomes, whereas a SNM related to less favorable adjustment. Compared to an FNM, SNM demonstrated less youth-reported perceived parental care (p = .02) and higher youth-reported anxiety (p = .05). Conclusions: Most children show healthy emotions during treatment for cancer. Close monitoring of mood during treatment is important to identify youth at risk for adverse psychosocial adjustment outcomes over time.

AB Former studies demonstrated that antisocial youth with callous-unemotional (CU) traits are impaired in the processing of negative emotional stimuli. The aim of the current study was to explore the moderating role of different behavioural (i.e. conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention) and emotional problems (i.e. internalizing symptoms) in the relationship between CU traits and attentional bias towards emotional stimuli. Besides using self-report measures, attentional bias was tested by an affective dot-probe task in a high-risk sample of 102 adolescent boys (M age = 16.34 years; SD = 1.32). CU traits were related to reduced attention to emotionally distressing pictures. Furthermore, conduct problems significantly moderated the relationship between CU traits and attention to distress cues. These findings highlight the importance of considering potential moderators to the well-established link between CU traits and deficits in response to negative emotional cues.

AB Parenting by lying refers to the parenting practice of deception to try to control children's behavioral and affective states. Although the practice is widely observed across cultures, few studies have examined its associations with psychological outcomes in adulthood. The current research fills this gap by sampling 379 young Singaporean adults who reported on their childhood exposure to parenting by lying, their current deceptive behaviors toward parents, and their psychosocial adjustment. Results revealed that the adults who remembered being exposed to higher levels of parenting by lying in childhood showed higher levels of deception toward their parents and higher levels of psychosocial maladjustment. Our findings suggest that parenting by lying may have negative implications for children's psychosocial functioning later in life. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between three types of child maltreatment, including physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect, and childhood behavior problems in Mainland China, has not been systematically examined. This meta-analysis reviewed findings from 42 studies conducted in 98,749 children in Mainland China and analyzed the pooled effect sizes of the associations between child maltreatment and childhood behavior problems, heterogeneity in study findings, and publication bias. In addition, this study explored cross-study similarities/differences by comparing the pooled estimates with findings from five existing meta-analyses. Equivalent small-to-moderate effect sizes emerged in the relationships between the three types of maltreatment and child externalizing and internalizing behaviors, except that emotional abuse related more to internalizing than externalizing behaviors. Considerable heterogeneity exists among the 42 studies. Weak evidence suggests that child gender and reporter of emotional abuse may moderate the strengths of the relationships between child maltreatment and behavior problems. No indication of publication bias emerged. Cross-study comparisons show that the pooled effect sizes in this meta-analysis are about equal to those reported in the five meta-analyses conducted in child and adult populations across the world. Findings urge relevant agencies in Mainland China to build an effective child protection system to prevent child maltreatment.

AB Introduction: Parenting and parental-child relationship may lead children to develop behavior disorders that can affect many aspects of their later life. This study aimed to examine the impact of parent-child relationship and sex on the development of internalizing symptoms in children.
   Methods: Childhood and Adolescent Behaviors in Long-term Evolution (CABLE) is a longitudinal healthy-lifestyle research for which 18 elementary schools were randomly selected respectively in Taipei and Hsinchu in Taiwan. Data on sex, parent-child relations, and internalizing symptoms from four waves of follow-up were analyzed: 2003 (9 year olds), 2006 (12 year olds), 2009 (15 year olds) and 2012 (18 year olds). A latent growth model was used to examine the impact of parental-child relationship and sex on the trajectory of children's internalizing symptoms.
   Results: Results show that internalizing symptoms is more severe (beta = 0.21, p < 0.01) and their growth rate faster (beta = 0.15, p < 0.01) in girls than in boys. Results from latent growth model show that parent-child relationship is negatively related to the internalizing symptoms intercept (beta = -0.59, p < 0.01) and is positively related to the internalizing symptoms slope (beta = 0.18, p < 0.01). Limitations: Self-reported measures were used. Parent-child relationship was only provided at 2003.
   Conclusion: The findings suggest that girls are more susceptible to internalizing symptoms in puberty, and better parent-child relationship can have a protective influence although the protective impact reduced through time. Health professionals should be sensitive to sex, family functioning and provide positive parenting programs for children at risk for internalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Dependent (self-generated) stress is a strong risk factor for depression and anxiety, but perceptions of stress can alter its impact. Appraisals of dependent stress controllability and severity additionally relate to depression and anxiety over and above stress exposure. Due to the high comorbidity of depression and anxiety, it is unclear whether dependent stress frequency and appraisals relate specifically to depression or anxiety or are transdiagnostically associated shared aspects of internalizing disorders. Consistent with the tripartite model, the current study represented internalizing symptoms with three latent factors - depression-specific, anxiety-specific, and common internalizing - and tested how dependent stress frequency and appraisals of controllability and severity were associated with these factors.
   Methods: Bifactor modeling was used to create the latent internalizing factors in a treatment-seeking sample of emerging adults (n = 356). Structural equation models tested dependent stress frequency and appraisals of controllability and severity as predictors of these latent factors.
   Results: Dependent stress frequency was associated with common internalizing while perceived controllability was associated uniquely with depression-specific variance. Continuous stress severity was not associated with latent factors, but high-severity stressors were associated with anxiety-specific variance.
   Limitations: Without longitudinal data conclusions regarding temporal directionality cannot be made. Participants' appraisals of stressors could not be compared to expert ratings.
   Conclusions: Dependent stress frequency, controllability appraisals, and high-severity stressful events have distinct links with different dimensions of internalizing psychopathology. This suggests there may be several distinct mediating mechanisms between stress constructs and psychopathology, which have potential to serve as targets for intervention.

AB Previous studies have found discrepancies between parent and child reports of parental favoritism. Some studies have also found that these discrepancies have unique effects on children's psychosocial adjustment. Nonetheless, much is still unknown about discrepancies between parent-reports and child-reports of parental favoritism and how they are associated with children's development. The current study examines discrepancies in multi-informant reports on parental favoritism in relation to children's internalizing and externalizing problems. The sample consisted of 556 mother-child dyads and 554 father-child dyads (46% boys, M-age = 12.52 years, SDage = 1.18). Polynomial regression analyses and response surface analyses were used to disentangle the effects of parent-child discrepancies in perceived parental favoritism. The results indicate that children reported higher parental favoritism than their parents. And the highest internalizing and externalizing problems occurred when both the mother and the child reported high maternal favoritism, and when both the father and the child report high paternal favoritism. Therefore, these findings partly support the assumptions based on the operations triad model. The findings also highlight the importance of the discrepancy between child- and parent-reports on parental favoritism in the development of children's internalizing and externalizing problems.

AB Child welfare recipients face unique obstacles for accurate mental health screening and assessment. This study examined the concordance between youth and caregiver respondents on mental health problems. Agreement between youths and caregivers about traumatic event exposure was mostly Moderate or Substantial, but greater discrepancy was associated with greater child psychopathology. Both caregivers and children endorsed PTSD symptoms more often than internalizing, externalizing, and ADHD problems. Single respondents - whether child, foster parent, or biological parent - significantly underestimated severity compared to multiple respondents. Repeat screenings showed that concordance between youth and caregiver endorsements did not improve after six months of entering care.

AB The value of ability grouping is often debated despite being adopted in primary and secondary schools across the UK for the past 80 years. Setting is one form of ability grouping which is widely implemented in English schools; it involves dividing pupils from the same cohort into classes according to ability in a specific subject. While the existing evidence identifies a negative effect on cognitive outcomes, especially for low-ability pupils, little research has been undertaken to understand the impact of setting on non-cognitive outcomes. This paper provides the first evidence of the effect of setting on non-cognitive outcomes when utilizing a nationally representative sample of primary-aged pupils and adopting fixed effects and instrumental variable methodologies. For boys, setting in maths negatively impacts non-cognitive outcomes, driven by a worsening of internalizing behaviours. No evidence of a significant impact of lowest set placement on non-cognitive outcomes is identified.

AB Extensive research has consistently shown an association between relational victimization and internalizing problems among adolescents. However, limited information is available about the underlying peer status related factors that may mediate or moderate this association. Using a short-term longitudinal design with a six-month interval between the two waves, this study examined whether popularity status insecurity mediated the associations between relational victimization and internalizing problems and whether this mediational process was moderated by popularity status among 447 (250 girls) Chinese 7th and 8th graders. The findings of this study show that popularity status insecurity mediated the longitudinal associations between relational victimization and the two internalizing problems, depressive symptoms and anxiety, but only for adolescents with relatively low popularity. This study reveals the moderated mediation processes explaining the impact of relational victimization on adolescents' mental health.

AB Background Eczema phenotypes and emotional and behavioural problems are highly prevalent in childhood, but their mutual relationship is not fully clear. Objectives To examine the associations of eczema phenotypes with school-age emotional and behavioural problems, and the bidirectional associations of eczema and emotional and behavioural problems from birth until 10 years. Methods This study among 5265 individuals was embedded in a prospective population-based cohort study. Never, early transient, mid-transient, late transient and persistent eczema phenotypes were identified based on parent-reported, physician-diagnosed eczema from age 6 months until 10 years. Emotional (internalizing) and behavioural (externalizing) problems were measured repeatedly using the Child Behavior Checklist from age 1 center dot 5 to 10 years. Cross-lagged models were applied for bidirectional analyses. Results All eczema phenotypes were associated with more internalizing problems and attention problems at age 10 years, compared with never having eczema: range of Z-score differences 0 center dot 14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0 center dot 01-0 center dot 27] to 0 center dot 39 (95% CI 0 center dot 18-0 center dot 60). Children with early transient eczema had more aggressive behaviour symptoms at age 10 years (Z = 0 center dot 16, 95% CI 0 center dot 05-0 center dot 27). Bidirectional analysis showed that eczema at 0-2 years was associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 3-6 and 10 years, while, inversely, only internalizing problems at 0-2 years were associated with an increased risk of eczema at age 10 years. Conclusions Eczema phenotypes are very modestly associated with more somatic symptoms and attention problems at school age. Early transient eczema is associated with more aggressive behaviour symptoms. Directional effects seem to occur from early-life eczema to later-life internalizing and externalizing problems, rather than the reverse.

AB A growing body of research evidence suggests universal (Tier 1) Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) interventions in early childhood education and care settings can improve children's social and emotional development. Less is known however about the effectiveness of targeted (Tier 2) programmes for preschoolers experiencing social, emotional or behavioural challenges. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the outcomes associated with targeted (Tier 2) SEL interventions; 19 studies were captured in the review. Findings revealed that while evidence for targeted SEL programming is still emerging, it may offer a promising early intervention approach to strengthen aspects of children's social and behavioural functioning. Based on the evidence reviewed, the impact of targeted SEL intervention on emotional competencies could not be established. Programmes were predominately directed to preschoolers with externalizing problems and there appears to be a dearth of approaches focused on internalizing behaviour. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB Schools can play a significant role in promoting timely access to mental health services by utilizing proactive approaches to identifying and supporting students' social, emotional, and behavioral needs. However, recent data suggest that few schools in the USA are taking such proactive approaches. Given that implementation of school-based programs is determined by a complex interplay of influences at multiple levels (i.e., individual, innovation, environment), more research is needed to understand the perceptions of stakeholders representing each of these unique levels. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare stakeholders' knowledge, beliefs, and opinions regarding school-based approaches to identifying and supporting students at risk of SEB challenges. Survey responses were obtained from district administrators, school building administrators, school support staff, teachers, and parents within 1330 school districts across the USA. Although some differences across groups were noted, patterns generally supported that stakeholders (a) reported being knowledgeable about social, emotional, and behavioral problems and the school-based approaches to identifying and assessing them, (b) believed that student social, emotional, and behavioral problems should be a prioritized concern and identified using screening procedures, and (c) perceived moderate amounts of pressure to change social, emotional, and behavioral screening practices from different sources in their communities. In addition, respondents across stakeholder groups reported consistently strong agreement that screening should be used to proactively identify not only which students are exhibiting internalizing/externalizing problems, but also which students possess various risk and resilience factors.

AB A strong relationship exists between maternal depression and externalizing and internalizing problems in children, and caregiving burden might mediate this relationship. Yet, caregiving burden has rarely been tested as a mechanism underlying the relationship between maternal depression and child emotional and behavioral outcomes. Caregiving burden might be especially high in ethnic and racial minority mother-child dyads in low-income settings where there are more stressors in the environment and rates of maternal depression are elevated. A path analysis with 132 low-income urban mothers who mostly identified as racial and ethnic minorities confirmed our hypothesis that maternal depression has a direct effect on child externalizing and internalizing problems, and also an indirect effect through caregiving burden. We discuss implications of the findings with respect to research, practice, and policy with low-income, ethnic and racial minority families whose mothers have depression and care for children who exhibit externalizing and internalizing problems.

AB This study uses linear probability models with student and teacher fixed effects to assess whether the racial match between teachers and students affects "at-risk" ratings on a teacher-completed universal screener of student internalizing and externalizing behavior. The data are from a large, urban California school district. I find that Asian and Black teachers are more likely to rate their same-race students "at-risk" for internalizing behavior compared with how the same Asian and Black students would be rated by White teachers. These findings have implications for policy and practice aimed at enhancing universal screening for externalizing and internalizing behavior.

AB Studies on the effectiveness of child and adolescent psychotherapy treatments provided by the Italian National Health Service lag behind, while the scientific community has rather focused on the value of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapeutic approaches. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a one year psychodynamically-oriented intervention with children and adolescents-aged between 6 and 18 years (M = 12.08, SD = 3.7)-and their parents, carried out in a Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Service (SCIAF), part of the Italian National Health System. Following a psychodiagnostic assessment, two types of therapeutic intervention were offered: children and adolescents allocated to Group 1 (N = 26) were offered individual psychodynamic psychotherapy alone, whilst youths in Group 2 (N = 31) were offered individual psychotherapy, accompanied by parental support. This study examines the effects of this time-limited (12 month) psychodynamically-oriented psychotherapy in terms of improvements in patients' symptoms (measured on the Achenbach's questionnaires: Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report 11-18). This study also examines the effects of treatment on parents' perception of their family empowerment. This domain is measured on the Family Empowerment Scale (FES). Our findings seem to be partly in line with published studies according to which poor parenting (i.e., characterized by lack of warmth, a rigid and/or negative parenting style, poor monitoring of the children, etc.) would be positively associated with Externalizing problems in childhood. Our preliminary findings suggest that brief psychodynamic therapy seemed to show positive outcomes in both "Internalizing" and "Externalizing" difficulties, accounting for age-related differences, ICD-10 (1) diagnoses, and the types of treatment offered. However, no statistically significant changes were detected in the parents' perceptions of empowerment at 12 months.

   VALIDATION
AB The current study examined the psychopathy-aggression relationship by considering different forms of aggression, including aggressive motivation. Emotions were explored as useful in understanding any emerging relationship, notably those consistent with detachment and sensitivity/poor regulation. In three studies, involving non-offending samples (Study one: n = 150, 47 men, 103 women; Study two: n = 442, 314 men, 123 women, five not disclosed; Study three: n = 200, 100 men and 100 women), it was predicted that higher levels of psychopathy would be associated with reports of higher overall, proactive and reactive aggression, and that the association would be moderated by emotion. Specifically, it was predicted that emotion regulation difficulties would associate with higher levels of reactive but not proactive aggression, and that proactive aggression would involve a lack of emotion. Findings generally supported the predictions. The role of emotion-regulation difficulties as a mediator between psychopathy and reactive aggression, and greater emotional detachment as a mediator between psychopathy and proactive aggression was demonstrated. The results demonstrate importance for the components of psychopathy and different aspects of emotion for the psychopathy-aggression link. Directions for future research and some implications for practice are outlined.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine power assertive parental discipline and child difficult temperament as predictors of children's behaviour problems (internalizing, externalizing, and total behaviour problems) as well as mediating role of difficult temperament between power assertive parental discipline and children's behaviour problems. Participants were 118 children (53 boys) and their parents for the current study. Children's age ranged from 16 months to 36 months (M = 27.91, SD = 5.67). Mothers reported on their power assertive parental discipline, child temperament, and behaviour problems of children. Results from regression analysis showed that: (1) there was a positive association between parents' power assertive discipline and child behaviour problems. (2) Child difficult temperament was positively associated with children's internalizing, externalizing and total behaviour problems. (3) Children's difficult temperament mediated the association between power assertive discipline and child behaviour problems. Limitations and future directions of the current study are discussed.

AB Background We examined whether childhood conduct problems predicted a wide range of adverse outcomes in emerging adulthood and whether the association with internalizing problems remained after adjusting for general comorbidity and externalizing problems. Methods Participants were 18,649 twins from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. At age 9/12, parents rated their children on eight conduct problems. Adverse outcomes were retrieved from national registers in emerging adulthood (median follow-up time = 9.2 years), including diagnoses of six psychiatric disorders, prescriptions of antidepressants, suicide attempts, criminality, high school ineligibility, and social welfare recipiency. We estimated risk for the separate outcomes and examined if conduct problems predicted an internalizing factor above and beyond a general comorbidity and an externalizing factor. We used twin analyses to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to these associations. Results On the average, each additional conduct symptom in childhood was associated with a 32% increased risk of the adverse outcomes in emerging adulthood (mean hazard ratio = 1.32; range = 1.16, 1.56). A latent childhood conduct problems factor predicted the internalizing factor in emerging adulthood (beta(boys) = .24, standard error, SE = 0.03; beta(girls) = .17, SE = 0.03), above and beyond its association with the externalizing (beta(boys) = 0.21, SE = 0.04; beta(girls) = 0.17, SE = 0.05) and general factors (beta(boys) = 0.45, SE = 0.03; beta(girls) = 0.34, SE = 0.04). These associations were differentially influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Conclusions It is important to monitor boys and girls with conduct problems not only for future externalizing problems, but also for future internalizing problems. Prevention of specific outcomes, however, might require interventions at different levels.

AB The Clinical Assessment of Prosocial Emotions: Version 1.1 (CAPE 1.1) uses structured clinical judgments to diagnose the "with limited prosocial emotions" specifier for Conduct Disorder. This study examined (a) the internal consistency and interrater agreement, and (b) the convergent and divergent validity of the CAPE 1.1 in 72 young males who were incarcerated in two Spanish juvenile detention centers (age range = 14-22 years). The CAPE 1.1 showed good interrater agreement for making the diagnosis of the specifier and adequate internal consistency. The CAPE 1.1 was associated with other measures of callous-unemotional traits, but less consistently associated with other dimensions of psychopathy. Youth who met diagnostic criteria for the specifier scored higher on externalizing problems, but did not differ from other youth who were incarcerated on internalizing problems. These results provide preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the CAPE 1.1 for the clinical assessment of the specifier.

AB The majority of research on African American adolescents raised in single-mother homes has focused on externalizing problems, with less attention to other facets of socio-emotional functioning. Using a compensatory resilience approach, the current study examined risk and protective factors at the family (maternal warmth, monitoring, psychological control) and youth (ethnic identity and religiosity) levels as predictors of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and self-esteem among African American adolescents from single-mother homes (n = 193). Lower levels of psychological control, higher levels of monitoring, and higher levels of youth ethnic identity were associated with at least one of the outcomes, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and self-esteem. In addition, self-esteem, but not hopelessness, mediated the associations between the family- and youth-level factors and youth depressive symptoms. The importance of targeting maternal psychological control and youth ethnic identity, as well as self-esteem, in intervention programs for African American youth from single-mother families is discussed.

AB We investigated individual differences in self-reported emotional experience and peer-perceived expressivity among children in mid- to late-elementary school years. Specifically, we examined the constructs' correspondence and temporal stability and also compared the degree to which each predicts change in classroom social behavior over 2 years. Participants were 199 children (Mage = 10 years, Time 1) and their classroom teachers who have participated in two times of assessment. We used self-report of emotional experience and peer nominations of expressivity regarding happiness, anger, and sadness. Teachers rated children's social skills, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems. The correspondence was generally small in magnitude between self-reported experience and peer nominations of expressivity. The stability of peer nominations of emotional expressivity was medium and comparable to that of self-reported experience with the exception of happiness. The predictability of change in social behavior was more robust for peer nominations of expressivity than for self-reported experience. We discussed the relevance of different dimensions of emotionality as well as informants in understanding the predictability of social behavior from emotionality. We also discussed the role of sociodemographic variables in emotional experience and expressivity and offered practical implications of peer nominations in the assessment of children's emotionality.

AB A growing number of studies support the internal and external validity of youth self-reported sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms. However, no study has examined SCT in adolescents without ADHD, examined whether adolescent self-reported SCT is distinct from adolescent self-reported ADHD inattention (ADHD-IN), or evaluated whether links between SCT and internalizing problems differ for adolescents with or without ADHD. The present study is the first to (1) determine the convergent and discriminant validity of self-reported SCT and ADHD-IN symptoms in both adolescents with and without ADHD, (2) test the invariance of SCT and ADHD-IN symptoms across ADHD and comparison groups, (3) examine SCT as uniquely related to a range of internalizing-relevant domains, and (4) evaluate if the association between SCT with internalizing correlates differs for adolescents with or without ADHD. Participants were adolescents (M-age = 13 years) with (n = 162) and without (n = 140) ADHD. Adolescents and parents completed measures of internalizing symptoms and emotion dysregulation; adolescents completed measures of rumination and suicidal ideation. Analyses indicated that 13 of the 15 SCT items demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity from ADHD-IN, and SCT and ADHD-IN demonstrated invariance across the ADHD and comparison groups and across sex. SCT, but not ADHD-IN, was uniquely associated with greater adolescent-reported internalizing symptoms and suicidal ideation. Both SCT and ADHD-IN were uniquely associated with adolescent-reported emotion dysregulation and parent-reported internalizing symptoms. Only ADHD-IN was uniquely associated with parent-reported emotion dysregulation. Findings support the differentiation of adolescent-reported SCT and ADHD-IN and demonstrate associations between SCT and increased internalizing problems in adolescents with and without ADHD.

AB Purpose This study examined whether social and physical peer victimization in adolescence led to changes in psychological and physical health outcomes. Methods One hundred and twenty adolescents (boys = 54) and a parent completed measures of peer victimization and health approximately 2 years apart. Results Results indicated that both social and physical victimization were related to increases in the frequency and severity of health problems over the assessment period. Conclusions Increases in social, but not physical victimization, were related to more internalizing problems as well as greater frequency and severity of health problems at the second assessment. Anxious depression and severity of health problems at the first assessment were related to increases in social, but not physical forms of victimization over the 2-year period. These results continue to shed light on the notion that being peer victimized is not a normal part of life and is not necessarily something that adolescents will reconcile with time.

TI Emotional and behavioral problems, quality of life and metabolic control

AB Background: Treatment with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC) and dietary phenylalanine and tyrosine restriction improves physical health and life expectancy in Tyrosinemia type 1 (TT1). However, neurocognitive outcome is suboptimal. This study aimed to investigate behavior problems and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in NTBC-dietary-treated TT1 and to relate this to phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations.
   Results: Thirty-one TT1 patients (19 males; mean age 13.9 +/- 5.3 years) were included in this study. Emotional and behavioral problems, as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, were present in almost all domains. Attention and thought problems were particularly evident. HR-QoL was assessed by the TNO AZL Children's and Adults QoL questionnaires. Poorer HR-QoL as compared to reference populations was observed for the domains: independent daily functioning, cognitive functioning and school performance, social contacts, motor functioning, and vitality. Both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were associated with low phenylalanine (and associated lower tyrosine) concentrations during the first year of life. In contrast, high tyrosine (and associated higher phenylalanine) concentrations during life and specifically the last year before testing were associated with more internalizing behavior and/or HR-QoL problems.
   Conclusions: TT1 patients showed several behavior problems and a lower HR-QoL. Associations with metabolic control differed for different age periods. This suggests the need for continuous fine-tuning and monitoring of dietary treatment to keep phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations within target ranges in NTBC-treated TT1 patients.

TI ADHD symptoms in relation to internalizing and externalizing symptoms in

AB Objective: Although internalizing and externalizing disorders have received considerable attention among young population, the mechanisms that explain the relationships of internalization and externalization symptoms with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents are not well understood. Since sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms had significant associations with ADHD, and internalization/externalization disorders, we examined whether SCT may mediate between ADHD symptoms and internalizing/externalizing problems during childhood. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart-review of 95 children and adolescents (76 boys and 19 girls, aged 6-16) with ADHD. The severity of ADHD was evaluated by Turgay DSM-IV-Based Disruptive Behavioral Disorders Screening and Rating Scale (T-DSMIV-S) completed by teachers. Measures of SCT, internalisation and externalisation symptoms, social, thought, and attentional problems were based on the Teacher Report Form (TRF) that was completed by subjects' primary teachers. Results: The withdrawn scores were significantly correlated with SCT scores, social problems, and ADHD-inattention. There was an inverse correlation between withdrawn and ADHD-hyperactivity/impulsivity scores. The mediation test using bootstrapping method showed that the indirect coefficient for SCT was significant, after controlling of ADHD-inattention and social problems covariates, consistent with partial mediation. Conclusion: Our results may demonstrate that while externalization symptoms were associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms of ADHD, the internalization symptoms were significantly related to SCT in youngs with ADHD. Specifically, although social withdrawal was significantly related to ADHD-inattention, this relationship was mediated by the severity of SCT.

AB Premonitory urges are uncomfortable physical sensations preceding tics that occur in most individuals with a chronic tic disorder. The Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS) is the most frequently used self-report measure to assess the severity of premonitory urges. We aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PUTS in the largest sample size to date (n = 656), in children aged 3-16 years, from the baseline measurement of the longitudinal European Multicenter Tics in Children Study (EMTICS). Our psychometric evaluation was done in three age-groups: children aged 3-7 years (n = 103), children between 8 and 10 years (n = 253), and children aged 11-16 years (n = 300). The PUTS exhibited good internal reliability in children and adolescents, also under the age of 10, which is younger than previously thought. We observed significant but small correlations between the severity of urges and severity of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and between severity of urges and ratings of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, however, only in children of 8-10 years. Consistent with previous results, the 10th item of the PUTS correlated less with the rest of the scale compared to the other items and, therefore, should not be used as part of the questionnaire. We found a two-factor structure of the PUTS in children of 11 years and older, distinguishing between sensory phenomena related to tics, and mental phenomena as often found in obsessive-compulsive disorder. The age-related differences observed in this study may indicate the need for the development of an age-specific questionnaire to assess premonitory urges.

AB Research has shown that experiencing a hurricane can lead to internalizing, externalizing, and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in children. However, the effects of experiencing two hurricanes within a short time frame have not been examined. Moreover, there is limited research examining how children's coping is linked to their psychological functioning and no research using the empirically supported conceptualization of coping that includes primary control coping (i.e., attempts to control the stressor) and secondary control coping (i.e., attempts to adapt to the stressor). This study examined the psychological functioning of 108 children and adolescents (69.7% Black, Non-Hispanic; 56.5% female; M age = 11.59 years, SD = 2.43) in Grades 3-12 as measured 3 months after experiencing Hurricanes Irma and Maria on the island of St. Thomas. Participants completed electronic questionnaires about their demographic characteristics, hurricane exposure (i.e., perceived life-threat, life-threatening events, loss/disruption after hurricanes), coping strategies utilized, and their psychological functioning (i.e., PTS, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms). A principal component analysis of the coping items determined four coping factors: primary control, secondary control, disengagement, and negative coping. Linear regressions, including children's age and aspects of hurricane exposure, found primary control coping was positively associated with PTS symptoms, beta = .18, whereas secondary control coping was negatively associated with PTS and externalizing symptoms, beta s = -.17 and -.19, respectively. Negative coping, but not disengagement coping, was positively associated with all three outcomes, beta s = .31-.42. These findings suggest positive ways children can cope after experiencing a hurricane, informing possible early intervention efforts.

AB Purpose Digitally delivered, parent-focused interventions (DD-PFIs) are viewed as an important method for supporting child well-being. Few DD-PFIs include health-promotion and general-parenting content, and only some are intended for a universal audience. The purpose of this paper is to focus on a preliminary evaluation of Grow Online, which was designed to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods design, including pretests and posttests and semi-structured interviews, was employed to evaluate program feasibility and demonstrate proof of concept. Findings Feasibility findings were favorable, which indicates participants were satisfied with the program, liked the main program features, found the content helpful and had a positive experience using the website. Initial recruitment was strong, and engagement with the sessions was high; however, retention was poor with a 73.5 percent attrition rate. Significant pre- to post-changes were found on measures of over-reactive discipline, parenting efficacy, emotion coaching, coping socialization, child physical activity support, rewarding eating and child externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Research limitations/implications - Study design and high attrition limit the ability to infer causality and generalize beyond the sample. Practical implications - Providing support to parents through a universal health-promoting DD-PFI is viable, though issues involving retention need to be given full consideration. Originality/value Parents use of technology to access child care information is increasing, but most information online is not evidence-informed. Grow Online fills an important gap in the research and practice of DD-PFIs, and this study's findings suggest a more rigorous evaluation is merited.

AB Background/Objective Lingering morbidities including physical, cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial sequelae, termed the Post-Intensive Care Syndrome, persist years after pediatric neurocritical care (PNCC) hospitalization. Sleep disturbances impact other Post-Intensive Care Syndrome domains and are under-evaluated to date due to a lack of appropriate measurement tools. The present study evaluated the validity of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) to address the growing need for assessing sleep problems after PNCC. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study of youth aged 3-17 years with acquired brain injury (N = 69) receiving care through longitudinal PNCC programs at two tertiary academic medical centers. Parents completed the SDSC and provided proxy reports of internalizing symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), fatigue, pain behavior, and cognitive function within 3 months of hospital discharge. Evidence for the validity of the SDSC was established by utilizing the full sample for psychosocial measure comparisons and by comparing SDSC outcomes by severity (Low Risk, Mild-Moderate Risk, and High Risk defined by reported standardized T-scores). Results Internal consistency of the SDSC was good (alpha = .81). Within the full sample, increased sleep disturbances on the SDSC were significantly correlated with Post-Intensive Care Syndrome measures, including worse physical (r = .65), psychological (r = .62), and cognitive (r = - .74) sequelae. Youth in the High Risk group evidenced greater dysfunction in mental acuity, pain behavior, internalizing symptoms, and social engagement. Findings revealed both statistically and clinically significant impacts of sleep disturbances as measured by the SDSC on HRQOL. Conclusions The SDSC is a valid and reliable measure for assessing sleep disturbances in children after PNCC. Results support the use of the SDSC to measure sleep disturbances after PNCC. Targeted interventions for sleep disturbances may be key to overall patient recovery.

AB Aim To determine neurocognitive performance and behavioural problems in children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome. Method All 18 children (10 females, 8 males; mean age 4y 7mo; SD 1y 10mo) diagnosed with Panayiotopoulos syndrome at the Kempenhaeghe Epilepsy Center in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2017 were analysed retrospectively. All underwent a neuropsychological/behavioural assessment, an academic assessment, and a 24-hour electroencephalogram. Results Mean full-scale IQ (93.5; range 76-123; p=0.04) and performance IQ (93.2; range 76-126; p=0.04) were within the normal range, although significantly lower compared to the normative mean. Verbal IQ (96.3; range 76-118) and processing speed (96.1; range 74-114) were not significantly lower. Simple auditory/visual reaction times, visual attention, visual-motor integration, and verbal memory were significantly lower compared to normative values. On average, patients with Panayiotopoulos syndrome were 8 months behind in arithmetic speed and 11 months behind in reading speed for the number of months in school. Behavioural questionnaires revealed significantly higher scores on reported internalizing behavioural problems. Interpretation Children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome demonstrated diffuse cognitive dysfunction in full-scale IQ, performance IQ, visual attention, visual-motor integration, and verbal memory. A high incidence of internalizing behavioural problems was reported. This strongly suggests neuropsychological and behavioural comorbidity in children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome. What this paper adds
   Children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome are at risk for cognitive deficits in various cognitive domains. Children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome are also prone to internalizing behavioural problems. Mild-to-severe academic underachievement was present in more than half of the children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome.

AB The mental health of birth parents has gained attention due to the serious negative consequences for personal, family, and child outcomes, but depression and anxiety in adoptive parents remains under-recognized. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, we investigated anxiety and depression symptoms in 96 British adoptive parents over four time points in the first four years of an adoptive placement. Depression and anxiety symptom scores were relatively stable across time. Growth curve analysis showed that higher child internalizing scores and lower parental sense of competency at five months post-placement were associated with higher initial levels of parental depressive symptoms. Lower parental sense of competency was also associated with higher initial levels of parental anxiety symptoms. Parents of older children and those with higher levels of parental anxiety and sense of competency at five months post-placement had a steeper decrease in depressive symptoms over time. Support for adoptive families primarily focuses on child adjustment. Our findings suggest that professional awareness of parental mental health post-placement may be necessary, and interventions aimed at improving parents' sense of competency may be beneficial.

AB The Social Emotional Health Survey-Secondary (SEHS-S), which is a measure of core psychological assets based on a higher-order model of Covitality, is comprised of 36 items and four latent traits (with three measured subscales): belief in self (self-efficacy, self-awareness, and persistence), belief in others (school support, family coherence, and peer support), emotional competence (emotional regulation, behavioral self-control, and empathy), and engaged living (gratitude, zest, and optimism). Previous international studies have supported the psychometric properties of the SEHS-S. The present study extended this research by examining the psychometric properties of a Spanish-language adaptation with a sample of 1042 Spanish adolescents (M-age = 14.49, SD = 1.65.). Confirmatory factor analyses replicated the original factorial structure, with hierarchical omega between 0.66-0.93, with 0.94 for the total score. Factorial invariance across genders revealed small latent mean differences. A path model evaluated concurrent validity, which revealed a significant association between Covitality and bidimensional mental health (psychological distress and well-being). Specifically, correlational analyses showed a negative association with internalizing/externalizing symptoms, and positive associations with subjective well-being, health-related quality of life, and prosocial behaviors. This study provides an example of a culturally relevant adaptation of an international tool to measure student strengths, which is critical to planning school programming and policy.

AB The present follow-up study examined the contribution of early temperament to mental health in preschool and school years. Participants represent a community sample of 96 children (54% female) from urban and rural areas of Russia. Temperament was measured by the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised and the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire; mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Effortful control and negative affectivity accounted for 17% of the variance in internalizing problems and 6% in externalizing problems, and results also highlighted the contribution of lower-order traits. Our findings emphasize the importance of broadband and fine-grained early temperamental traits for later mental health in the Russian context and support the predominant role of effortful control and negative affectivity.

AB Objective To assess the efficacy and safety of prenatal dexamethasone treatment in offspring at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the clinicaltrials.gov website databases were systematically searched from inception through March 2019. WMD and SMD with 95%CIs were calculated using random or fixed effects models. Results There was a significant reduction in virilization in the DEX-treated group (WMD: -2.39, 95%CI: -3.31,-1.47). No significant differences were found in newborn physical outcomes for birth weight (WMD: 0.09, 95%CI: -0.09, 0.27) and birth length (WMD = 0.27, 95%CI: -0.68, 1.21). Concerning cognitive functions, no significant differences in the domains of psychometric intelligence (SMD: 0.05, 95%CI: -0.74, 0.83), verbal memory (SMD: -0.17, 95%CI: -0.58, 0.23), visual memory (SMD: 0.10, 95%CI: -0.14, 0.34), learning (SMD: -0.02, 95%CI: -0.27, 0.22) and verbal processing (SMD: -0.38, 95%CI: -0.93, 0.17). Regarding behavioural problems, no significant differences in the domains of internalizing problems (SMD: 0.16, 95%CI: -0.49, 0.81), externalizing problems (SMD: 0.07, 95%CI: -0.30, 0.43) and total problems (SMD: 0.14, 95%CI: -0.23, 0.51). With respect to temperament, no significant differences in the domains of emotionality (SMD: 0.13, 95%CI: -0.79, 1.05), activity (SMD: 0.04, 95%CI: -0.32, 0.39), shyness (SMD: 0.25, 95%CI: -0.70, 1.20) and sociability (SMD: -0.23, 95%CI: -0.90, 0.44). Conclusions Prenatal DEX treatment reduced virilization with no significant differences in newborn physical outcomes, cognitive functions, behavioural problems and temperament. The results need to be interpreted cautiously due to the existence of limitations.

AB Objective: To investigate whether religiosity influences exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) and whether religiosity moderates the effects of SLEs, resulting in fewer problem behaviors.
   Method: The self-reported mental health problems of a community-based longitudinal sample of pre-adolescents (n = 2230) in the three northern provinces of the Netherlands were assessed in early adolescence (12-15 years, Youth Self-Report, YSR) and in adolescence (18-21 years, Adult Self Report ASR). The sum scores for SLEs in early adolescence were based on the previous two years. The variable parental religiosity was based on information obtained in pre-adolescence (10-12 years). Associations between religiosity and SLEs and whether parental religiosity is a moderator between SLEs and problem behaviors were studied, using repeated measures ANOVAs.
   Results: Having actively religious parents was associated with fewer SLEs. Parental religiosity did not moderate the association between SLEs and problem behavior.
   Conclusions: The children of actively religious parents experienced fewer SLEs in pre-adolescence than did the children of non-religious parents or the children of parents with incompatible religious beliefs, but parental religiosity did not moderate the effects of SLEs on problem behaviors. Reasons for the absence of a religious coping effect are discussed.(1)

AB Objective: Youth with poorer inhibitory control are more likely to experience internalizing and externalizing problems, placing them at risk for poorer psychological, academic, and social functioning. Modifying inhibitory control is challenging; therefore, research is needed to identify alternative targets to reduce internalizing and externalizing problems in youth. Sleep/wake patterns may serve as alternative targets, given their relationships with poorer inhibitory control and greater internalizing and externalizing problems. This study examines the mediating role of sleep/wake patterns in the relationships between youth inhibitory control and internalizing and externalizing problems. Method: One hundred fifty-five adolescent (ages 12-15 years) and parent dyads completed the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Pediatric Symptom Checklist, and Adolescent Sleep-Wake Scale, short version. Bootstrapped mediations examined indirect relationships between inhibitory control and internalizing and externalizing through sleep/wake patterns. Results: Analyses revealed that problematic sleep/wake patterns partially mediated the relationship between poorer inhibitory control and greater internalizing, explaining 19% of the variance in internalizing problems. In addition, problematic sleep/wake patterns partially mediated the relationship between poorer inhibitory control and greater externalizing, explaining 58% of the variance in externalizing problems. Conclusion: The results suggest that sleep/wake patterns may be a mechanism through which deficits in inhibitory control increase youth risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. Because sleep/ wake patterns are frequently modified through adoption of health behaviors conducive to good sleep, assessing for problematic patterns in adolescents who present with internalizing and externalizing problems may offer providers a relatively modifiable target to reduce the emotional and behavioral problems of youth with poorer inhibitory control abilities.

AB Objective: Maternal anxiety is a well-known risk factor for early childhood behavior problems. In this study, we explore (1) whether parenting stress mediates this relation and also (2) whether child factors, namely self-regulation, modify the influence of maternal well-being on child externalizing and internalizing problems at 4 years of age. Method: Mothers taking part in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes cohort completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory when their children were 24 months of age. At 42 months of age, children performed a self-regulation task (n = 391), and mothers completed the Parenting Stress Index. When children were 48 months old, both parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: As predicted, parenting stress mediated the relation between maternal trait anxiety and child externalizing and internalizing problems. This mediating effect was further moderated by child self-regulation. The indirect effect of maternal trait anxiety through parenting stress on child externalizing problems was stronger among children with low self-regulation. Conclusion: Parenting stress is an additional pathway connecting maternal trait anxiety and children's externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. The risk for child externalizing problems conveyed by elevated maternal trait anxiety and parenting stress may be buffered by better self-regulation in 4-year-olds. These results suggest that interventions that include decreasing parenting stress and enhancing child self-regulation may be important to limiting the transgenerational impact of maternal trait anxiety.

AB There is growing evidence that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty-acids (PUFAs) are important for the brain development in childhood and are necessary for an optimal health in adults. However, there have been no studies examining how the n-3 PUFA composition of human milk influences infant behavior or temperament. To fill this knowledge gap, 52 breastfeeding mothers provided milk samples at 3 months postpartum and completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ-R), a widely used parent-report measure of infant temperament. Milk was assessed for n-3 PUFAs and omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs using gas-liquid chromatography. The total fat and the ratio of n-6/n-3 fatty acids in milk were also examined. Linear regression models revealed that infants whose mothers' milk was richer in n-3 PUFAs had lower scores on the negative affectivity domain of the IBQ-R, a component of temperament associated with a risk for internalizing disorders later in life. These associations remained statistically significant after considering covariates, including maternal age, marital status, and infant birth weight. The n-6 PUFAs, n-6/n-3 ratio, and total fat of milk were not associated with infant temperament. These results suggest that mothers may have the ability to shape the behavior of their offspring by adjusting the n-3 PUFA composition of their milk.

AB Extant research indicates that peer victimization is an important factor in the development of internalizing symptoms for youth. However, few studies have examined contextual factors that may impact how peer victimization contributes to these symptoms in middle childhood, especially in the form of victimization. The current study evaluated associations between relational and physical victimization and symptoms of depression and anxiety in a sample of third through fifth graders. In addition, the influence of perceived school safety as a moderator of these associations was examined. Findings indicated that relational victimization was more strongly associated with symptoms of both depression and anxiety than physical victimization. Further, low levels of perceived school safety contributed to symptoms of depression and anxiety and exacerbated the associations between relational victimization and these symptoms, particularly for anxiety. Implications for findings are discussed.

AB This study used growth curve modeling to map risk by gender across the middle school transition. Participants included 609 (49.5% female) students in grades 4-8 in an urban school serving primarily African American youth from low-income communities. Results indicated that overall risk increased over time and was consistent over the middle school transition. Further analysis indicated risk change was domain and gender specific. For example, across the inattention-hyperactivity and externalizing domains both male and female students showed increased risk; however, risk increased at a faster rate for girls. Despite patterns of increase in risk, boys and girls showed stability in their reports of personal adjustment, a domain associated with resiliency. These results highlight the importance of screening to capture student need over time and the inclusion of strengths-based domains in screening tools.

AB IMPORTANCE Social media use may be a risk factor for mental health problems in adolescents. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated this association, and none have quantified the proportion of mental health problems among adolescents attributable to social media use.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether time spent using social media per day is prospectively associated with internalizing and externalizing problems among adolescents.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study of 6595 participants from waves 1 (September 12, 2013, to December 14, 2014), 2 (October 23, 2014, to October 30, 2015), and 3 (October 18, 2015, to October 23, 2016) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study, a nationally representative cohort study of US adolescents, assessed US adolescents via household interviews using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Data analysis was performed from January 14, 2019, to May 22, 2019.
   EXPOSURES Self-reported time spent on social media during a typical day (none, <= 30 minutes, >30 minutes to <= 3 hours, >3 hours to <= 6 hours, and >6 hours) during wave 2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE Self-reported past-year internalizing problems alone, externalizing problems alone, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems during wave 3 using the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Short Screener.
   RESULTS A total of 6595 adolescents (aged 12-15 years during wave 1; 3400 [51.3%] male) were studied. In unadjusted analyses, spending more than 30 minutes of time on social media, compared with no use, was associated with increased risk of internalizing problems alone (<= 30 minutes: relative risk ratio [RRR], 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94-1.78; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.36-2.64; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.74-3.49; >6 hours: RRR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.88-4.26) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (<= 30 minutes: RRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.82; >30 minutes to <= 3 hours: RRR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.83-3.00; >3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.43-4.09; >6 hours: RRR, 4.29; 95% CI, 3.22-5.73); associations with externalizing problems were inconsistent. In adjusted analyses, use of social media for more than 3 hours per day compared with no use remained significantly associated with internalizing problems alone (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.11-2.31; >6 hours: RRR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.77) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems (>3 to <= 6 hours: RRR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.51-2.66; >6 hours: RRR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.73-3.43) but not externalizing problems alone.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents who spend more than 3 hours per day using social media may be at heightened risk for mental health problems, particularly internalizing problems. Future research should determine whether setting limits on daily social media use, increasing media literacy, and redesigning social media platforms are effective means of reducing the burden of mental health problems in this population.

AB Purpose: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a non-psychotic depressive disorder that begins within 4 weeks of childbirth. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PPD by screening mothers with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), to assess the behavioural outcome of children born to mothers with and without epilepsy and to investigate the relationship between PPD and children's behavioural problems.
   Method: We enrolled 80 pregnancies of women with epilepsy, who filled in EPDS after birth, and afterward we asked them to complete the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
   Results: 23.8% of patients presented PPD. Children, when the CBCL were completed, had a mean age of 6.05 +/- 3.07 years. The CBCL results indicate the occurrence of at least one behavioural issue in 25.0% (20/80) of children.
   CBCL scores revealed a higher prevalence of behavioural disturbances with regards to the CBCL Total (P = 0.016), internalizing (P = 0.014) and somatic problems (P = 0.048) in patients with PPD vs. patients without PPD.
   We found an association between mothers' EPDS total score and children's CBCL global score (P = 0.034), internalizing score (P = 0.021), anxiety problems (P = 0.05), affective problems (P = 0.027) and withdrawn/depressed (P = 0.05).
   We recorded a statistically higher malformation rate in patients with PPD (P = 0.005) compared to the general population.
   Conclusions: Children born from mothers with epilepsy have an increased risk for emotional disorders. These findings highlight the importance of screening for emotional distress and providing adequate interventions to children born to women with epilepsy.

AB The aim of this study is to ascertain whether there are any differences in the parenting practices experienced by two groups of children with, respectively, low-risk and high-risk scores for anxiety. A second objective is to determine which parenting variables are linked with the presence or absence of this kind of internalizing problem. From a sample of 550 subjects, we selected 180 children between 3 and 12 years of age who met a set of specific criteria as having either high risk scores (90 children) or low risk scores (90 children) for anxiety, according to the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). After applying the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory (PCRI-M) to both parents, we carried out a binomial logistic regression analysis which resulted in a prediction model for 83.9% of the sample. The model was based on the following parenting variables: paternal involvement and support for autonomy, and maternal parental support, satisfaction with parenting, involvement, limit setting and role orientation. The paper also discusses the usefulness of our results for the planning of family intervention strategies. The information obtained has broad applications for interventions with families with anxious children, since parents' responses to the instruments used revealed patterns of behaviour that can be modified in both parents and children.

AB Rumination has been conceptualized as a stable, trait-level response style involving repetitive and passive focus on the symptoms of distress and the possible causes and consequences of those symptoms. This theoretical review examines developmental risk factors of ruminative response style, incorporating a developmental psychopathology perspective. A model integrating these developmental factors within a conceptual framework is proposed, wherein risk factors for distress (i.e., temperamental negative affectivity, stressful environments, parenting, and genetic vulnerability) lead to engagement in rumination. We propose that when rumination is well-practiced, it will consolidate into a trait-like response style, especially among adolescents who experience cognitive control deficits. Reciprocal relationships and moderators that may contribute to the formation of a ruminative response style are also included. To understand how these factors converge and influence the formation of ruminative response styles, we review patterns of stability and change in physical and cognitive development to demonstrate that individual differences in rumination may emerge and consolidate into enduring, trait-level response styles during early adolescence.

AB OBJECTIVES: Given earlier effects found in randomized clinical trials of the Nurse-Family Partnership, we examined whether this program would improve 18-year-old first-born youths' cognition, academic achievement, and behavior and whether effects on cognitive-related outcomes would be greater for youth born to mothers with limited psychological resources (LPR) and on arrests and convictions among females.
   METHODS: We enrolled 742 pregnant, low-income women with no previous live births and randomly assigned them to receive either free transportation for prenatal care plus child development screening and referral (control; n = 514) or prenatal and infant home nurse visit (NV) plus transportation and screening (n = 228). Assessments were completed on 629 18-year-old first-born offspring to evaluate these primary outcomes: (1) cognitive-related abilities (nonverbal intelligence, receptive language, and math achievement) and (2) behavioral health (internalizing behavioral problems, substance use and abuse, sexually transmitted infections, HIV risk, arrests, convictions, and gang membership).
   RESULTS: Compared with control-group counterparts, NV youth born to mothers with LPR had better receptive language (effect size = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.00 to 0.47; P = .05), math achievement (effect size = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.61; P = .002), and a number of secondary cognitive-related outcomes. NV females, as a trend, had fewer convictions (incidence ratio = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.20 to 1.11; P = .08). There were no intervention effects on other behaviors.
   CONCLUSIONS: The program improved the cognitive-related skills of 18-year-olds born to mothers with LPR and, as a trend, reduced female convictions but produced no other effects on youth behavioral health.

AB Background: It is estimated that more than half of children living in households where intimate partner violence (IPV) occurs are also exposed to animal cruelty (AC). Although prior research links bonds with pets with higher levels of socioemotional competence among school-age children, exposure to AC may negate the protective effects of pet ownership and/or exacerbate the potentially deleterious effect of IPV on children's mental health.
   Objective: The current study evaluates whether and to what extent the associations between exposure to IPV and several indicators of children's mental health vary as a function of children's positive engagement with pets and exposure to AC.
   Participants and Setting: Participants included 204 children (aged 7-12 years; 47% female; 57% Latinx) and their maternal caregiver who were recruited from domestic violence agencies in a western U.S. state.
   Method: Multiple moderation analysis evaluated whether the association between children's exposure to IPV and internalizing and posttraumatic stress symptoms vary as a function of children's positive engagement with pets and exposure to AC.
   Results: Analyses revealed several moderation effects for positive engagement with pets (e.g., internalizing problems: [b = -.15, t(195) = -2.66, p = .008]; posttraumatic stress symptoms: [b = -.13, t(195) = -2.24, p = .0261), whereas exposure to AC only moderated the association between IPV and anxious/depressed symptoms (b = .32, t(195) = -2.41, p = .017).
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential protective effects of positive engagement with pets and importance of screening for exposure to AC when engaging in trauma-informed work with children exposed to IPV.

AB Background: Early adversity and negative experiences in the adoptive family can put adopted children at risk for emotional and behavior problems.
   Objective: This study analyzes the influence of children's preadoptive history and adoptive parents' characteristics on the psychosocial adjustment of nationally and internationally adopted children in Germany.
   Participants and setting: The survey included 172 adopted children aged between 24 and 145 months and their adoptive parents.
   Methods: Parents provided information about preadoptive history. Information about emotional and behavior problems was obtained from the parental version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parental well-being was obtained through a composite score of three standardized measures (self-efficacy questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale PSS-4, Brief Symptom Inventory BSI); parenting behavior was assessed with the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (DEAPQ).
   Results: 12.5% of the adopted children scored in the clinical range of the SDQ. In a multiple regression analysis, the experience of maltreatment and neglect was the most important predictor of emotional and behavior problems at time of assessment, followed by pre- and perinatal risk and parental stress regulation difficulties, R-2 = .423, F(4, 128) = 28.539. Increases in the number of risk factors present were associated with a greater odd of children scoring in the clinical range of the SDQ.
   Conclusions: Most of the nationally and internationally adopted children in this sample were well-adjusted. Prenatal and preadoptive risk as well as stress regulation capacities of the main caregiver contributed to the child's development. An accumulation of risks increased the likelihood of adjustment problems in adopted children.

AB Objectives: Childhood maltreatment (CM) and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERSs) may be important in alcohol craving and dependence in alcohol-dependent individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate direct effects of CM on the subscales of alcohol craving and alcohol dependence and its indirect effects via CERSs in individuals with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 329 alcohol-dependent males completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short version (CERQ-Short), the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS), the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).
   Results: Participants with alcohol dependence had early age of onset of alcohol use (mean = 20.78 years), relatively long duration of alcohol use (mean = 11.14 years), and low education (mean = 9.55 years). Indirect effects were observed from CM to the subscales of alcohol craving and dependence only through maladaptive CERSs after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors. No direct effect was observed through CM on the subscales of alcohol craving and dependence.
   Conclusions: Although drawing causal conclusions from the current research is impossible, the findings suggest that maladaptive CERSs may be a possible mechanism relating CM to alcohol craving and dependence in treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals, while adaptive CERSs may be less important regarding this relation. However, the findings of the current study need longitudinal research.

AB Background. Some children may encounter difficulties in processing sensory stimuli, which may affect their ability to participate in activities of daily living. Self-regulation abilities may also affect children on how to process different sensory experiences. The Sensory Processing and Self-Regulation Checklist (SPSRC) was developed as a single, parent-reported instrument for the examination of sensory processing and self-regulation difficulties in children. Aims. This study is aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of the SPSRC and examine the patterns of self-regulation and sensory processing in children with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods and Procedures. The contents of the SPSRC were validated by a group of experts, and a field test was subsequently conducted to examine the reliability and validity of this instrument in a sample of 997 typically developing children and 78 children with ASD. Outcomes and Results. The results of the validation and field test analyses suggest that the SPSRC exhibits high internal consistency, good intrarater reliability, and a valid ability to measure and discriminate sensory processing and self-regulation in children aged 3-8 years with and without ASD. Conclusions and Implications. The current results supported the reliability and validity of SPSRC to assess a child's sensory processing and self-regulation performance in activities of daily living. The study findings warrant further investigation to compare the performance of the SPSRC with laboratory-based tests, as this would better elucidate sensory responsivity in children with sensory modulation disorders from both clinical and research perspectives.

AB School truancy among adolescents can negatively impact academic achievements.
   The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and sociodemographic, externalizing, internalizing and protective factors associated with school truancy in a national sample of school-going adolescents in Laos. The sample included 3683 adolescents (median age 16 years, interquartile range = 2) who responded to the cross-sectional "Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS)" in Laos in 2015. Overall, 40.7% of the middle-school students reported truancy in the past 30 days. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, five externalizing behaviours (current alcohol use, lifetime amphetamine use, having been in a physical fight, was bullied and having been physically attacked) were associated with school truancy. High internalizing behaviour increased the odds for school truancy. Regarding protective factors, peer support and high parental or guardian supervision decreased the odds for school truancy. The study found a very high proportion of school truancy in Laos, calling for urgent interventions incorporating identified risk factors.

AB Internalizing and externalizing problems have been related to negative emotionality, and affect regulation deficits in several studies. Certain psychodynamic models of treatment use children's symbolic play activity as a medium to mentalize negative emotions in order to develop children's affect regulation. However, the complex associations among these constructs and their associations with outcome have not been examined. This study aimed to investigate, first. whether average mentalization practices in treatment, as well as session-to-session expression of negative emotions and symbolic play predict gains in affect regulation and. second, whether changes in these variables are associated with clinically significant change in symptoms and global function. The sample included 40 outpatient children, who underwent long-term psychodynamic treatment. Nine hundred seventy-five sessions were coded for children's symbolic play, affect expression (anger and dysphoric affect). and affect regulation characteristics, and each treatment was scored for average adherence to mentalizing principles. Time Series Panel Analyses (TSPA) indicated session-to session use of symbolic play predicted gains in affect regulation. A significant 2-way interaction indicated that dysphoric affect expression in high mentalization adherent treatments was associated with higher affect regulation than in low adherent treatments. Partial correlation analyses indicated that mentalization adherence in treatment was associated with symptomatic improvement at trend level of significance, and changes in affect regulation and symbolic play were significantly associated with gains in global function. Findings point to the importance of use of symbolic play, and dysphoric affect expression in the context of mentalization practices for gains in affect regulation and outcome.

   OUTCOMES
AB This multimethod study examined associations between observed and parent- and child-reported intrusive parenting, parent and child cultural orientations, and children's adjustment in a socioeconomically diverse sample of Chinese American immigrant families. Participants were 239 Chinese American school-age children (M-age = 9.19 years and range = 7.49-10.96 years) and their parents from first- and second-generation immigrant families. Parents and children reported on parents' intrusive parenting and their own cultural orientations, and parents and teachers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Observed intrusive parenting behaviors were coded from videotaped parent-child conflict discussions. Findings from path analysis indicated that there was a unique positive association between child Chinese orientation and child-reported intrusive parenting. a unique negative association between parents' American orientation and child-reported intrusive parenting, and a unique positive association between child American orientation and observed intrusive parenting. Intrusive parenting was negatively associated with child adjustment, but associations varied depending on measurement. Findings suggest that different measures of intrusive parenting are differentially associated with children's adjustment in Chinese American immigrant families.

AB Aim To evaluate neuropsychiatric comorbidities in children and adolescents with hypothalamic hamartoma. Method We retrospectively analysed case notes for all individuals with hypothalamic hamartoma referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between 2000 and 2016. In addition, a systematic review aiming to identify all previous paediatric case series was performed. Psychiatric symptoms, demographics, physical comorbidities, and cognitive functioning were recorded for all cases where possible. Analyses were performed to determine which factors were associated with psychopathology and potential mechanisms investigated. Results Forty-six cases were included in the case series (28 males, 18 females; mean age at assessment 11y 8mo [1y 11mo-16y 11mo, SD 4y 0mo]). Twenty-nine papers representing data from 264 cases met inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Overall, at least 50% of cases presented with psychopathology. Epilepsy, intellectual disability, and male sex were associated with externalizing disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct and oppositional defiance disorders, and rage attacks). Intellectual disability mediated the effects of epilepsy on externalizing psychopathology. No factors were associated with internalizing disorders (anxiety and depressive disorders), although these were not well reported. Interpretation Psychiatric comorbidities are highly prevalent in the presentation of paediatric hypothalamic hamartoma. The aetiology of psychopathology comprises a range of interacting biological and psychosocial factors with particular influence from epilepsy. Further research is required to achieve an evidence base for treatment. What this paper adds
   Over half of children with hypothalamic hamartoma present with psychiatric comorbidity. Externalizing and internalizing disorders are present in approximately 60% and 30% of children with hypothalamic hamartomas respectively. Epilepsy and male sex are associated with externalizing psychopathology. Intellectual disability mediates the association between epilepsy and externalizing symptoms. No clear associations are evident for internalizing disorders or precocious puberty.

AB Objective: To develop a Therapist-assisted Online Parenting Strategies (TOPS) program that is acceptable to parents whose adolescents have anxiety and/or depressive disorders, using a consumer consultation approach.
   Methods: The TOPS intervention was developed via three linked studies. Study 1 involved content analysis of feedback from participants (N = 56) who received a web-based preventive parenting intervention called Partners in Parenting (PiP), as part of a randomised controlled trial. Study 2 involved stakeholder consultations with: (i) parents of adolescents aged 12-17 years (N = 6), and (ii) mental health professionals (N = 28), to identify adaptations to PiP that are required to make it appropriate for parents of adolescents with anxiety and depressive disorders. Study 3 was a pilot of the resulting TOPS program with professionals (N = 10) and a small sample of parents (N = 3) to assess the acceptability of the program content and format that involved online modules and videoconferencing coaching.
   Results: Study 1 indicated a need for an enhanced program for parents whose adolescents are experiencing anxiety and depressive disorders, while findings from Study 2 informed the content of the new TOPS program. In Study 3, mental health professionals endorsed the structure and content, while parents affirmed the acceptability of the TOPS program. Feedback from Studies 2 and 3 indicated that the therapist-coach was a valuable resource to (i) provide parents with strategies that are associated with the alleviation of adolescent anxiety and depression, (ii) discuss difficulties in implementing these strategies, (iii) assist parents with overcoming these difficulties; and (iv) support the development of a relapse prevention plan. Professionals felt that the TOPS program would broaden parental knowledge about how to recognise and respond to symptoms of clinical anxiety and depression in their adolescent.
   Conclusions: This study provided preliminary support for the feasibility, acceptability and perceived usefulness of the TOPS program.

AB Parental depression (Goodman et al., 2011) and low socioeconomic status (SES) are important risk factors for child maladjustment. Further, depression and low SES are linked; low SES adults are more likely to experience depression. Whereas studies commonly covary out noise associated with SES variability, research on the association of SES with child outcomes after controlling for parental depression is limited. This study aimed to extend the literature by observing parent depressive affect and evaluating the relationship between cumulative SES risk and child problems as well as whether child gender moderates this association using multigroup nested model comparisons. Findings suggested that cumulative SES risk status explained significant variance in child- and parent-reported internalizing problems and parent-reported externalizing problems after accounting for observed parent depressive affect. Of importance, child gender moderated 2 of these significant findings (i.e., child-reported internalizing and parent-reported externalizing behaviors), such that girls, but not boys, were at higher risk of problems in the context of high cumulative SES risk.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate longitudinal associations between seeking social support and cyberbullying victimization and between seeking social support and internalizing problems. A two-wave panel study was conducted among 2,128 adolescents aged 10-17. Across-lagged panel analysis among those adolescents who indicated being a victim at Time 1 (N = 234) demonstrates that seeking support is associated with lower cyberbullying victimization six months later. However, this seems only true for seeking support from friends and not from parents or teachers. Furthermore, the model shows that adolescents who fear being negatively evaluated by peers are less inclined to seek support from friends, whereas adolescents with high self-esteem are less likely to seek support from parents and teachers. Implications and limitations are discussed. (C) 2018 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction. The present study examined the ecological-transactional model delineated by Cicchetti and Lynch (1993) and the nature of the association between adolescents' parental maltreatment and victimization and bullying at school.
   Method. Multivariate multilevel regression analyses were conducted on a sample of 2.852 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 from 25 secondary schools. Data was nested across 133 classrooms. Classrooms level variables and individual variables in relationship to parental maltreatment, behavioural disorders, sex, and bullying and victimization were included in the analysis.
   Results. Results indicated that adolescents who reported suffering violence at home, showed more vulnerability to becoming victims of bullying at school, with the relationship being moderated by the level of bullying in the classroom. It was also examined the role of behavioural disorders and a relation between these factors was found amongst the bullies but not the victims.
   Discussion and Conclusion. This study uses the systemic perspective of ecological-transactional model on child maltreatment to show the importance between the school and home microsystems in the perpetuation of victimization. The results imply that what children experience at home might cause emotional and behavioural differences in varying classroom climates at school. Therefore, understanding the interactions between systems' transaction of socialisation mechanisms might contribute for effective anti-bullying programs.

AB Objective: It has been suggested that children with higher degree of hearing loss may show more severe externalizing (e.g., aggression) and internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) behavioral problems compared to that of their normally hearing peers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of sound amplification through cochlear implants (CIs) on aggressive behaviors in Persian children.
   Methods: During a prospective study design, 72 children (40 girls, 32 boys) who underwent unilateral implantation and 72 (40 girls, 32 boys) age-matched normally hearing children (control group) participated. All CI children had age of < 4 years at the time of implantation. The Aggression Scale for Preschoolers (ASFP) was utilized to measure various types of aggression including verbal aggression, physical aggression, relational aggression, and impulsive anger. The speech performance of children was also evaluated using Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR). The ASFP and SIR measurements were conducted at the pre-implantation phase and at 6, 12, and 18 months post-implantation period.
   Results: A repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant reduction in ASFP scores from "pre-operation" to "post-operative" conditions in CI group. However, aggression level in CI recipients were significantly higher than children in control group. In the analyses of ASFP subscales, we found a reduction and a consequent improvement in verbal aggression, physical aggression and impulsive anger. However, no significant difference was found in relational aggression across various time intervals. Furthermore, children who received CI before 2 years old exhibited better aggression level than children who received their devices at later ages. The significantly negative correlation (r = -0.76, p < 0.001) was found between the SIR and ASFP scores, so that lower speech intelligibity ability scores were associated with more aggressive behavior problems.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that young children with noticeable degree of hearing loss may experience higher level of aggression compared to normally hearing peers. However, when they undergo early implantation and attend at regular post-operative rehabilitation programs, their aggression status will improve seriously.

AB Objective: Low activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) resulting from genetic and early environmental factors has been thought to indicate risk for the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and externalizing disorders. However, longitudinal research on this issue is scarce. We analyzed whether hair cortisol concentration (HCC), i.e. accumulated long-term HPAA activity, predicts the development of ADHD between preschool and school age.
   Methods: A community-based sample of 126 children was assessed at the ages of 4, 5 and 8 years. ADHD and symptoms of oppositional defiant and conduct disorder (ODD/CD), callous unemotional (CU) traits, and internalizing symptoms were measured by clinical parent interviews and parent and teacher questionnaires. HCC was analyzed in the most proximal 3-cm scalp hair segment using luminescence immunoassay.
   Results: Low HCC at preschool age predicted an increase in ADHD symptoms between preschool and school age while adjusting for gender of child, maternal education level, and internalizing symptoms (F-(1,F-119) = 6.5; p = .012). The prediction held after additionally adjusting for ODD/CD symptoms and CU traits (F-(1,F-116) = 4.1; p = .045). The same was true for the prediction of the ADHD diagnosis at the age of 8 years (Chi((1))(2) = 7.3; p = .007). The prediction of ADHD was mainly based on the presentation of inattention symptoms (F-(1,F-119) = 7.4, p = .008).
   Conclusion: Low HCC in preschool children indicates an increased risk of developing ADHD at school age. In future research, it would be of theoretical and clinical importance to further circumscribe this HCC-related developmental pathway and track its further course of development.

AB In clinical child and retrospective adult samples, childhood gender variance (GV; i.e., cross-gender behaviour) has been associated with separation anxiety (SA; i.e., distress related to separation from attachment figures) in males. This study examined GV and SA in a nonclinical sample of 892 boys and 933 girls aged 6-12 years via parent-reports. Parental factors (i.e., parenting style, parent-child relationship, willingness to serve as an attachment figure, attitudes towards gender stereotypes in children) were examined as potential moderators. GV predicted SA in boys, even when statistically controlling for general psychopathology and demographic variables. Authoritative parenting, closeness in the parent-child relationship, willingness to serve as an attachment figure, and liberal attitudes towards gender stereotypes in children moderated the association between GV and SA in both boys and girls. Thus, SA may be a unique internalizing problem related to GV in boys in nonclinical samples and influenced by a variety of parental factors.

AB The current cross-sectional study examined the relationship between affiliate stigma and externalizing and internalizing problems by investigating the role of family cohesion among adolescents having a parent with serious mental illness (SMI). One hundred sixty-four adolescents were recruited from two community mental health centers. Family cohesion, affiliate stigma, and adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed. A significant relationship was found between adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems and family cohesion (r = -0.462, p < 0.01 and r = - 0.534, p < 0.001, respectively) and affiliate stigma (r = 0.512, p < 0.01 and r = 0.656, p < 0.001, respectively). Family cohesion partially mediated the relation between affiliate stigma and externalizing problems (Z = -4.97, p < 0.001) and fully mediated the relation between affiliate stigma and internalizing problems (Z = -5.18, p < 0.001). The current study highlights the need for effective interventions aimed at families to support parents with SMI in their parenting role and enhance family cohesion.

AB Background and aims Children with special educational needs (SEN) are generally less accepted by peers in school and have fewer friendships than those without SEN. However, little research has examined peer relations across multiple dimensions, relative to severity of need and in relation to classroom experiences and individual behavioural characteristics. This unique study aimed to extend understanding of the peer relations of pupils with differing levels of SEN support relative to children of differing attainment levels without a formally recognized SEN and in relation to levels of social contact in class and teacher ratings of behaviour. Sample Three hundred and seventy-five 9- to 11-year-old children recruited from 13 classes in four mainstream primary schools in the south of England. Fifty-nine pupils had been identified as having a SEN, of which 17 had a statement of SEN. Method Pupil sociometric questionnaires provided a range of peer relations measures and the extent of meaningful contact with peers. Pupil behaviour was rated by teachers using the Pupil Behaviour Rating scales. Analyses examined differences in peer relations measures, pupil behaviour, and meaningful contact across different levels of educational need. Results Compared to pupils without SEN, pupils with a statement of SEN had lower levels of peer acceptance, fewer reciprocated friendships, and were less integrated into peer groups. While internalizing behaviours, such as social anxiousness and anxiety, and externalizing behaviours, such as aggression and hyperactivity, were related to peer relations measures, frequency of meaningful contact with peers was more predictive of peer relations measures than either SEN status or behaviour. Conclusion Findings point to the crucial role of meaningful social contact in the classroom for children's relationships with peers. The study advances understanding by highlighting that greater opportunity for meaningful social contact may improve social involvement of, as well as enhance academic outcomes for, pupils with SEN educated in mainstream schools.

AB This study examined the concurrent associations linking youths' parasympathetic nervous system activity, specifically baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSAR; vagal withdrawal), with youth depression risk in a community sample of young adolescents. Youth gender was examined as a moderator of associations. Participants included 100 youth (53% boys; M age = 11.05 years, SD = 0.33; 43% ethnic minorities), along with their mothers and teachers. Youth and mothers participated in a laboratory protocol involving a peer problem-solving conversation, during which youths' physiological activity was measured. Youth reported on their depressive symptoms. Teachers reported on youth depression risk via internalizing symptoms and emotion regulation (e.g., emotion lability/negativity). Results from regression analyses revealed that youths' vagal withdrawal during the mother-youth peer problem conversation was associated with lower youth-reported depressive symptoms. Further, gender moderated the associations linking youth baseline RSA and RSAR with youth depression risk. Specifically, among girls but not boys, higher baseline RSA was associated with lower depressive symptoms and emotion lability/negativity, and higher RSAR (i.e., vagal withdrawal) was linked with lower internalizing symptoms. Findings contribute to the relatively small literature linking youth parasympathetic functioning with depression risk, and point to specific implications for girls.

AB Adolescence is a critical period for the development of physiological emotion regulatory systems. While stressful life experiences are known to inhibit adaptive regulation, less is known about how parental socialization of emotion regulation may affect this relation. We examined the effect of stressful life experiences on changes in the resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) levels of 107 (M-age = 12.84, SD = 0.85) young adolescents over a year, moderated by supportive parental responses to negative emotions. The significant interaction (B = 0.02, p = 0.04) indicated that young adolescents who experienced low levels of supportive parenting in the context of high levels of stressful life experiences showed significant decreases in resting RSA over the year, while adolescents who experienced high levels of supportive parenting showed minimal decreases in RSA. Thus, more supportive parenting significantly compensated for the effect of greater stressful life experiences on changes in resting RSA over time.

AB This longitudinal study examined coparenting and child adjustment during early and middle childhood (Ms = 3 and 8 years, respectively) among 106 lesbian, gay, and heterosexual parent adoptive families. When children were in middle childhood, no differences emerged as a function of parental sexual orientation in observations or self-reports of coparenting; in addition, parents and teachers described children as well-adjusted overall. After controlling covariates, including couple relationship adjustment, more supportive coparenting in early childhood predicted fewer parent-reported child internalizing and externalizing problems in middle childhood. Within middle childhood, stronger parenting alliance was associated with fewer parent-reported child externalizing problems. These findings indicate the value of considering family processes among diverse families in contributing to child outcomes over time.

AB Although abundant research has demonstrated associations between psychologically controlling parenting and adolescent problem behavior, little is known about the moderating role of adolescent personality herein. This study examined whether adolescent personality moderates the associations between parental psychological control and internalizing and externalizing problems at the level of within-person change. A 3-wave longitudinal design (N = 198 families, Mage adolescent = 14.89 years, Mage mother = 45.14 years, Mage father = 46.79 years), with 1-year intervals between waves, and using multi-informant assessment was conducted. Multilevel analyses demonstrated that changes in parental psychological control related positively to changes in multi-informant scores of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Evidence for the moderating role of personality was found for only 1 out of 25 interactions in a variable-centered approach and for 2 out of 8 interactions in a person-centered approach. The interactions obtained indicated that a mature personality (i.e., higher scores on emotional stability or membership in a resilient profile in comparison to an overcontrolled profile) buffered against the detrimental effects of psychologically controlling parenting on problem behaviors. Overall, the number of interactions was limited, suggesting only a modest moderating effect of adolescent personality.

AB Growing use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in an elevated twin birth rate, and a burgeoning population of IVF twins who are now aging into adolescence and beyond. This study tests a model examining whether parental conformity expectations have differential effects on twins' versus singletons' parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction, and if this effect is indirectly associated with relative changes in twins' and singletons' internalizing and externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Using a sample of 278 IVF twins and singletons, path models demonstrate that twin status and conformity expectations interact to influence parent-adolescent relationships. Although there was an association between twin status and mother-adolescent relationship satisfaction among parents with high conformity expectations (r = .25, p < .01), this relationship was nonsignificant among parents with low conformity expectations (r = .05, p = .85). The differential effect of conformity expectations on parent-adolescent relationship satisfaction for twins and singletons was indirectly associated with relative changes in twins' and singletons' externalizing behavior from middle childhood to adolescence. Results demonstrate that higher levels of parental conformity expectations may not have the same effect on adolescent twins and singletons.

AB This study examined the degree to which internalizing symptoms predict adolescent friendship instability. A total of 397 adolescents identified 499 same-sex reciprocated friendships that originated in the seventh grade (M = 13.18 years). Discrete-time survival analyses were conducted with Grade 7 peer, teacher, and self-reports of internalizing symptoms as predictors of friendship dissolution across Grades 8-12. Differences between friends in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and (for boys only) submissiveness predicted subsequent friendship dissolution. Individual levels of these variables did not predict friendship dissolution, even at extreme or clinical levels. The findings suggest that friendship instability arising from internalizing problems stems from dissimilarity between friends rather than the presence of psychopathological symptoms on the part of one friend.

AB Adaptive mother-adolescent conflict interactions are characterized by the ability to move from negative to positive emotions. The current micro-observational study investigated how mothers and adolescents make transitions between positive, neutral and negative emotions and whether these transitions depend on maternal internalizing problems. We used three annual waves of conflict interaction observations among 102 mother-adolescent dyads. Mothers were more likely than adolescents to initiate positivity after negativity whereas adolescents were more likely than mothers to reciprocate negativity. Mothers high and low in internalizing problems were equally likely to drive transitions toward positivity. Our study indicates that an active role of mothers in regulating negativity toward positivity is desirable because adolescents are likely to maintain dysfunctional interaction patterns of rigid negativity.

AB Objective Youth mental health problems have been identified as a major public health concern. However, there are a number of parent populations that remain under-engaged with face-to-face parenting programs, which include fathers, and parents of lower socioeconomic position and rural location. This review aimed to evaluate the evidence for technology-assisted parenting programs for youth mental health and parenting outcomes; as well as the extent to which they engage underserved parent populations and how they can be better tailored for these groups in an Australian context. Methods Employing the PRISMA method, we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of technology-assisted parenting programs for youth mental health problems. Results We identified 47 articles that met inclusion criteria, consisting of 25 randomised controlled trials along with 8 and 14 articles describing intervention development and follow-up, respectively. Some evidence was found to support the use of technology-assisted parenting programs, particularly to improve externalising problems and parenting skills. Additionally, program development and recruitment strategies to engage underserved parents were under-utilised among studies reviewed. Conclusions Findings from this review indicate that technology-assisted parenting programs may present an effective alternative to traditional face-to-face programs. However, more comprehensive and evidence-based strategies are required for program development and recruitment to capitalise on the advantages of technology-assisted programs to enhance engagement with underserved parent populations. Further research should investigate program attributes and engagement strategies for diverse parent populations.

AB In this article, we examined predictive validity of Student Risk Screening Scale-Internalizing and Externalizing (SRSS-IE) scores for use with elementary-age students (N = 4,465) from 14 elementary schools. Results indicated elementary school students with high levels of risk according to fall SRSS-IE scores-especially those with externalizing behaviors-were more likely to have lower oral reading fluency scores, lower Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) reading scores, more nurse visits, and more days spent in in-school suspension compared with students at low risk for externalizing or internalizing behaviors. Educational implications, limitations, and future directions are presented.

AB According to Blatt's theory on personality development, adolescents with high levels of self-criticism and dependency are more vulnerable to diverse types of psychopathology. However, relatively little is known about intervening processes involved in this personality-based vulnerability. The goal of this study is to examine, on the basis of Self-Determination Theory, the explanatory role of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in associations between self-criticism and dependency on the one hand and adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems on the other hand. In this cross-sectional and multi-informant study, 284 adolescents (58,5% female; mean age = 14.15; SD = .93) and their parents reported about the adolescent's internalizing and externalizing problems. Adolescents also completed measures assessing self-criticism, dependency, and psychological needs experiences. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Self-criticism and dependency were significantly related to higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing problems, with psychological need frustration fully mediating these associations. This study suggests that psychological need frustration is an important explanatory mechanism in personality-related vulnerability for adolescent psychopathology. More generally, it provides further evidence for the integration between two major theoretical approaches in the domain of adolescent development and psychopathology.

AB In this study, our aim was to evaluate the internal and external validity of Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) and to determine if it is an independent factor from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in Turkish children, like in other cultures. Two hundred sixty-one children (6-12 years of age) who applied to Ankara University Child and Adolescent Psychiatry outpatient clinics and diagnosed with ADHD recruited the study. All children were evaluated with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime Version which is a semi-structured diagnostic interview (K-SADS-PL) for ADHD diagnosis. Child Behavior Checklist for ages 6-18, The Barkley's Child SCT Ratings Scale, SNAP-IV Parent and Teacher Scale, and Sociodemographic Information Form were enrolled by the parents and teachers of the children. Our results demonstrated that SCT symptoms formed two distinct but interrelated factors (Sluggish and Daydreaming) separate from those for ADHD. Due to regression analyses, higher levels of SCT predicted higher levels of ADHD-IN (Inattentive) and internalizing symptoms including anxiety-depression, social problems, and social withdrawal. These findings distinguished SCT cases from ADHD-IN in Turkish children. Results also indicated that ADHD- IN symptoms are risk factors for lower academic achievement while SCT symptoms haven't such an effect. Our study is the first which demonstrates SCT's construct validity relative to ADHD-IN by parental and teacher ratings in Turkey. Similar findings with Turkish children to the findings with children from other cultures would increase our confidence in the transcultural generalizability of SCT's internal-external validity.

AB Among individuals experiencing internalizing psychopathology, high levels of emotion reactivity-the degree to which they experience emotions strongly or intensely, over extended periods of time, and as elicited by a variety of stimuli-increase risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Researchers developed the Emotion Reactivity Scale (ERS) to assess emotion reactivity, with psychometric support for the measure largely restricted to at-risk clinical populations. We know little of the psychometric properties of the ERS when administered as a screening measure in community assessments. In a study of the psychometric properties of the ERS in a non-clinical assessment of adults, we recruited 105 participants (M-age=44.6; 82.9% female) as part of a larger study of adolescent social anxiety and family relationships. Participants completed the ERS, self-report measures of various psychosocial domains, and an impromptu speech task, before and during which they self-reported their arousal. Scores taken from the ERS demonstrated strong internal consistency and demonstrated facets of validity: (a) positive relations with measures of internalizing psychopathology and parent-adolescent conflict, and negative relations with a measure of quality of life (convergent validity); (b) relations with self-reported anxiety and safety-seeking behaviors, over-and-above self-reported depressive symptoms (incremental validity); and (c) relation with self-reported state arousal during the impromptu speech task, over-and-above self-reported arousal at baseline (criterion-related validity). These findings support the psychometric properties of the ERS when administered in non-clinic assessments of adults. As such, they have important implications for screening assessments designed to identify adults who display the potential for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors.

AB This study examined whether teachers perceived difference between youth with divergent self- and peer-reports of victimization who exhibit varying patterns of adjustment. Using an ethnically diverse sample of 1360 students from 5th grade classrooms (M-age=12.01) in rural schools across the USA, we examined teachers' perceptions of four different victim groups identified using latent profile analysis: convergent victims (high self- and peer-reports of victimization), self-identified victims (high self-, low peer-reports), peer-identified victims (high peer-, low self-reports), and nonvictims (low self- and peer-reports). We found that teachers perceived meaningful differences between victim groups on academic (e.g., problems paying attention), social (e.g., popularity, liked by peers), behavioral (e.g., aggression), and psychological (i.e., internalizing) indices as well as students' involvement in bullying. Key findings include that convergent victims had more problems academically (i.e., paying attention in class) and were more frequently bullied compared to all other victim groups according to teachers. Teachers also viewed self-identified victims as having more psychological problems and as being more frequently bullied than nonvictims, although they perceived no differences between self-identified victims and nonvictims on indices of social functioning such as popularity, whether they were liked by peers, or whether they were a class leader. Implications for our understanding of different types of victims and suggestions for how teachers and school personnel may support them are discussed.

AB Purpose Children and adolescents living in youth welfare institutions often have a below average quality of life (QoL), for reasons that include developmental difficulties, history of traumatic experiences, and mental disorders. Youth welfare measures are needed that would have a positive impact, but there is a lack of longitudinal research on which measures are most effective. This study investigated what factors are associated with an improvement in QoL during residential stay. Methods Residents of youth care facilities in Switzerland and their professional caregivers completed questionnaires that addressed QoL, psychopathology, and experience of traumatic events at two time points. In addition, information regarding mental disorders was obtained through structured clinical interviews. Analyses were conducted on the data obtained from 204 respondents aged 11-18 years. Comparisons with a school sample were conducted. Results Compared to a school sample, a majority of participants rated their QoL equal, whereas their caregivers rated it as lower. Factors predictive of a poorer QoL were high levels of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, presence of co-morbidities, and female gender. At the second assessment, the caregivers reported a small improvement, which was associated with reductions in both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Conclusions The finding that a reduction in severity of psychopathology may result in an improvement in QoL underlines the importance of providing professional support for mentally ill residents of youth welfare institutions. Further research is needed to determine the causality of this association.

AB ObjectivesWe aimed to explore profiles of mothers with respect to two key risk factors, SES and parenting stress, and then examine the role of maternal perceived social support and negative intentionality in toddlers' internalizing and externalizing behaviors in these mother profiles.MethodA sample of 463 mothers with 1-3 years old non-clinical toddlers completed scales. First, in Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), we identified two distinct mother profiles, as high SES-low stress (low-risk) and low SES-high stress (high-risk) groups. Then, we tested the pattern of associations among maternal perceived social support, negative intentionality, and child internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors in a multi-group SEM analysis based on these two profiles.ResultsThere was a strong negative association between social support and both internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the low-risk profile mothers, but not in the high-risk profile mothers. Regardless of mothers' profiles, the perceived negative intentionality in toddlers' behaviors positively predicted both internalizing and externalizing behaviors. However, the perceived negative intentionality did not mediate the negative association between perceived social support and toddlers' problem behaviors.ConclusionOur findings suggest that mothers' negative attributions about child's behaviors can play a critical role at the early stages of problem behaviors and social support can be an important factor to decrease the child's externalizing problem behaviors especially for the low-risk group of mothers. Intervention programs should be designed with the differential contribution of social support and negative intentionality in the onset of toddlers' problem behaviors.

AB ObjectivesRecent evidence suggests that parents' negative experiences of combining work and family roles can have harmful effects on children, but little is known about the mechanisms that explain the crossover from the work-family interface to children's mental health over time. This study tested whether inter-parental conflict mediated the relation between maternal work-family factors (conflict or enrichment) and subsequent child mental health problems across childhood (4-5 to 8-9 years) and adolescence (10-11 to 14-15 years).MethodsData were six waves from the kindergarten cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, including mother-report of work-family conflict/enrichment and inter-parental conflict, mother- and adolescent-report of internalizing and externalizing problems, and adolescent-report of disordered eating. The final sample consisted of 2158 children and 2181 adolescents.ResultsResults from structural equation modeling indicated that during childhood, inter-parental conflict partially mediated the relation between maternal work-family conflict and child internalizing problems, but not externalizing problems. During adolescence, there was no evidence for mediation, although work-family conflict was associated with higher adolescent-reported externalizing problems; and inter-parental conflict was also associated with elevated mother-reported internalizing and externalizing problems. Both work-family conflict and enrichment were associated with elevated inter-parental conflict during childhood, but not adolescence. There was no evidence for associations between work-family factors and adolescents' disordered eating, and work-family enrichment was not associated with child or adolescent mental health.ConclusionsIntervention programs aimed at reducing both work-family conflict and inter-parental conflict over early childhood are likely to benefit children and families most.

AB ObjectivesTwo processes that have been largely studied in relation to psychological wellbeing during adolescence are mindfulness and psychological flexibility. Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM) and Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth (AFQ-Y) are specifically developed for children and adolescents and their items are built to assess specific processes. This study aims to identify cut-offs detecting adolescents with internalizing disorders, and describing specific behavioral repertoires within participants with high Psychological Inflexibility and poor Mindfulness Skills.MethodParticipants (N=1336), aged between 11 and 18, were recruited. Participants completed the Italian versions of CAMM, AFQ-Y, and Youth Self-Report (YSR). To determine the cut-offs for CAMM and AFQ-Y discriminating participants with internalizing disorders two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. Furthermore, to identify homogeneous groups with specific behavioral repertoires two Classification Tree Analyses (CTA) were performed.ResultsThe cut-offs identified are 24 for the CAMM, and 11 for the AFQ-Y. The CTA showed that low Mindfulness Skills and Psychological Inflexibility share a specific feature: namely, depressive symptoms. However, social withdrawal seems to be associated only with low Mindfulness Skills, while somatic symptoms seems to be associated only with Psychological Inflexibility.ConclusionsThe potential uses of the CAMM and AFQ-Y in research and clinical practice are drawn. CAMM and AFQ-Y are short and simple measures that make them accessible in a school-based primary prevention setting.

AB Bullying and peer victimization are stressful experiences for youth, and are associated with increased risk for psychopathology. Physiological differences in the body's stress response system may help us to understand vulnerability for depressive symptoms among youth involved with bullying. The current study examined both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity using skin conductance (SCL) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at a neutral baseline and during Cyberball, a stressful social exclusion paradigm. Participants consisted of 175 youth in grades 6-11 (mean age 13.6 years, 51% girls). Multilevel modeling was used to examine changes in both positive and negative affect, and physiological stress reactivity over time. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between bullying, victimization, and RSA on depressive symptoms. Peer victimization was negatively associated with resting RSA. Bullying others was negatively associated with SCL during Cyberball. Additionally, RSA reactivity during acute stress moderated the link between victimization and depressive symptoms. Victimization was more strongly associated with depressive symptoms when youth also demonstrated blunted RSA reactivity. These results suggest that both victimized youth and those who bully others have differences in their autonomic responses to acute stress. Individual differences in stress physiology may help us to understand vulnerability and resilience to depressive symptoms in the context of bullying and victimization.

AB This study aimed to explore the relationships among early adolescents' perceived parental psychological control/autonomy support, self-trouble, and internalizing problems as well as the potential gender differences in these relationships. Multiple-group path analysis was performed on the data collected from 1,089 adolescents in Beijing junior high schools. Results revealed that parental psychological control (autonomy support) was associated with adolescents' more (fewer) internalizing problems, and self-trouble acted as a mediator in these two relationships. Moreover, only the indirect relationship between parental autonomy support and internalizing problems via self-trouble was moderated by gender, with girls showing a little stronger indirect effect than boys, and specifically, it was the relationship between autonomy support and self-trouble that existed gender differences, with girls showing higher coefficient than boys. The relationship between parental psychological control/autonomy support and early adolescents' internalizing problems was discussed with regard to self-trouble and gender differences.

AB Atypical vagal reactivity has been linked to internalizing psychopathology and less adaptive emotion regulation, but reactive cardiac entropy is largely unexplored. Therefore, this study investigated reactive vagally-mediated heart-rate variability (vmHRV) and cardiac entropy in relation to emotion regulation. Electrocardiograms of 32 children (9-13 years) with internalizing difficulties and 25 healthy controls were recorded during a baseline and a sad film. Reactivity-measures were calculated from the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and sample entropy (SampEn). Emotion regulation was assessed using the emotion regulation checklist (ERC). Determinants of reactive SampEn and RMSSD were analyzed with marginal and generalized linear models. The study also modeled the relationship between cardiac reactivity and emotion regulation while controlling for psychopathology. The two groups differed significantly in vmHRV-reactivity, with seemingly higher vagal-withdrawal in the control group. SampEn increased significantly during the film, but less in subjects with higher psychopathology. Higher reactive entropy was a significant predictor of better emotion regulation as measured by the ERC. Internalizing subjects and controls showed significantly different vmHRV-reactivity. Higher reactive cardiac entropy was associated with lower internalizing psychopathology and better emotion regulation and may reflect on organizational features of the neurovisceral system relevant for adaptive emotion regulation.

AB Background: Being bullied has detrimental effects on mental health functioning. Individuals who are highly reactive to unpredictable threats (U-threat) may be particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of being bullied. For them, persistent, unpredictable bullying likely elicits chronic anticipatory anxiety and depression. The aim of the present study was to examine the main and interactive effects of aversive reactivity to U-threat and past-year bullying victimization on current anxiety and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: Seventy-one young adults (ages 17-19) completed a well-validated threat-of-shock task used to probe reactivity to both U-threat and predictable threat (P-threat). Startle eyeblink potentiation was recorded to index aversive responding.
   Results: We found a main effect of bullying, such that individuals with more bullying experience exhibited greater anxiety and depressive symptoms than individuals with less bullying experience. There was also a bullying by U-threat reactivity interaction such that among individuals with high reactivity to U -threat, more bullying experience was associated with more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Among individuals with low U-threat reactivity, there was no association between bullying and internalizing symptoms. There were no main or interactive effects involving reactivity to P-threat.
   Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that among individuals who are bullied, those who are sensitive to U-threat are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety in young adulthood. These individuals may represent a high-risk group for the development of internalizing psychopathology.

ID ATTENTION-DEFICIT DISORDER; HYPERACTIVITY; SYMPTOMS
AB Emerging research has identified sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) as a construct separate from ADHD predominately inattentive presentation. The present study explores the longitudinal stability of SCT over a period of 7 years, specifically the independent effects of SCT on behavioural and academic outcomes concurrently over a 3-year period. A sample of 639 twins, aged 6-12 years, participating in the Western Reserve Reading and Math Project (WRRMP) were assessed at seven annual home visits. The WRRMP sample is an unselected sample of twins representative of the general population of typically developing school-age children. The current investigation will focus on parent and teacher reports which assess attention deficit hyperactive/impulsive disorder (ADHD) and standardized achievement measures which assess academic outcomes. Over periods longer than 1 or 2 years, SCT does not display good longitudinal stability (r < .60). SCT also does not have consistent significant independent effects on academic outcomes once the effects of ADHD were controlled for. Over a 7-year period, SCT does not demonstrate consistent longitudinal stability. SCT significantly predicts social problems, internalizing behaviours, and anxious/depressive behaviours after the effects of ADHD are controlled for. SCT has no significant independent effects on cognitive or educational outcomes after the effects of inattentive ADHD are controlled for.

AB Following recent literature, which stresses the importance of broadening the conceptualization of mental functioning in youth, this paper investigated the relations between indicators of attachment styles, internalizing symptoms, and separation anxiety in 379 non-referred Italian university students, as captured by the relationship questionnaire, the experiences in close relationships-revised, the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), and the adult separation anxiety-27. Psychometric properties of all measures were scrutinized and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to support the soundness of a one-factor model representing indicators of all PAI internalizing symptoms: Anxiety, Anxiety-related disorders, Depression, Somatization, and Suicidal ideation. Then, a multivariate analysis was performed in order to test a model of relation linking attachment styles, internalizing symptoms, and separation anxiety scores. Results supported the mediation role of Internalizing symptoms in the association between preoccupied attachment and separation anxiety scores. Preoccupied attachment towards the romantic partner, as compared to attachment towards family and friends, played a more relevant role in predicting internalizing symptoms and separation anxiety scores. Findings corroborate the combined use of the over-mentioned indicators as a screening battery for the dimensional assessment of the interplay among these variables in young adults. Implications and limitations of the study are presented and discussed.

AB The current cross-sectional study examined whether internalizing (i.e. anxiety and depressive) symptoms and/or emotion dysregulation moderated the association between witnessed community violence and aggressive behavior. Participants were 180 predominantly African American adolescents (62% girls; M age = 15.87 years, SD = 1.19 years) from a high school located in an urban community in the United States. Approximately 95% of adolescents reported having witnessed at least one violent act during their lifetimes, with many endorsing repeated exposure to severe acts of community violence. Results indicated that emotion dysregulation exacerbated the association between witnessed community violence and aggression. A quadratic effect of anxiety symptoms also moderated this association, such that witnessed community violence was linked to aggression at low and high, but not moderate, levels of anxiety symptoms. In contrast, a quadratic effect of depressive symptoms was uniquely related to aggression, regardless of witnessed community violence. Directions for future research and implications for practice are reviewed.

AB Recent research demands a multi-informant and multi-factorial assessment of preschool-age psychopathology. Based on a tripartite model, we tested the relationship between emotional and social competence and their contribution to externalizing and internalizing symptoms in a preschool-age community sample (N = 117, M = 4.67 years, SD = 2.75 months). We assessed teachers' (N = 109) and parents' (N = 77) perspective using the Strengths-and-Difficulties-Questionnaire and children's perspective using the Berkeley-Puppet-Interview and a standardized emotional-competence-test (MeKKi). We found externalizing symptoms being negatively related to prosocial behavior in teachers' and parents' reports and positively related to social initiative in teachers' reports. In teachers' reports only, a mediation effect of emotional competence via social competence on externalizing symptoms was shown. Children, but not caregivers, reported internalizing symptoms being positively related to prosocial behavior. These results highlight the importance of multiple informants and especially of children's self-perception in preschool-age psychopathology.

AB The high levels of comorbidity between oppositional/conduct problems and hyperactivity/attention problems underscore the need for assessing how vulnerability for peer victimization is shaped by overlap among these behavior problems. Children (mean age 8.39, SD = 0.93) participating in a longitudinal study of the development of conduct problems (N = 744; 348 girls) in Quebec, Canada, were evaluated by their teachers regarding experiences of peer verbal and physical victimization every year for 6 years. Parent and teacher ratings of clinically significant oppositional/conduct problems, and hyperactivity/attention problems, as well as cormorbid opposition defiant/conduct problems and hyperactivity/attention problems were regressed onto trajectories of verbal and physical victimization. While behavior problems (both alone and together) were associated with higher levels of verbal and physical victimization, some variation was observed across rater and type of victimization. Ultimately, these findings suggest the importance of adapting programming for reducing victimization to children with oppositional and conduct problems.

AB Background Children who are not accepted in their peer group are at risk of developing internalizing problem behaviors. It is possible, however, that supportive parenting can provide a buffer against the detrimental effects of low peer acceptance. Objective This study examined maternal and paternal affection and psychological control as moderators of the association between children's peer acceptance during the critical transition to primary school and level and subsequent development of internalizing problem behaviors from first to sixth grade. Method A total of 608 children (264 girls, 344 boys) were rated by their teachers on their internalizing problems in grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Children's peer acceptance was measured in the first grade using a sociometric nomination procedure. At the same time point, mothers (n = 432) and fathers (n = 281) completed questionnaires measuring their levels of affection and psychological control. Results The results of latent growth curve modelling showed, first, that on average children's internalizing problems decreased over the school years. Second, peer acceptance was associated with the development of internalizing problems: the higher the peer acceptance, the bigger the decrease-and the lower the peer acceptance, the smaller the decrease-in the level of internalizing problems across time. However, high maternal affection provided a buffer against this impact of low peer acceptance. Among boys, low levels of maternal psychological control also provided a buffer against the effects of low peer acceptance. No significant results were found on the moderating role of fathers' parenting styles. Conclusion Overall, the results suggested that mothers' emotionally sensitive and supporting caregiving may protect children from the harmful long-term effects of low peer acceptance.

AB Social constructivist theory suggests that social support affects internalizing and externalizing problems by improving self-esteem. The differential impact of these variables has not been fully explored between male and female genders. The current study examined how different sources of received or perceived social support from mother, father, or a close friend affect internalizing and externalizing problems as explained by self-esteem in emerging adulthood. Emerging adults attending college (N = 854, ages 18-25 years) were recruited to complete survey measures. For both genders, the perception of friend support was indirectly related to internalizing and externalizing problems through self-esteem. Received social support from fathers indirectly effected internalizing and externalizing problems in females through self-esteem but not males. Interventions during emerging adulthood aimed at increasing perception of support from friends may directly and indirectly benefit females in college. Further results, implications, and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB This brief report presents preliminary psychometrics of responses to the Youth Externalizing Problems Screener (YEPS), which is a 10-item self-report rating scale intended for use as a screening instrument. The YEPS was designed to function as a companion measure to the Youth Internalizing Problems Screener (YIPS), facilitating the screening of broad mental health problems among students in secondary school settings. Analyses presented herein were conducted with the same small, preliminary samples of urban high-school students as those reported on for the initial development and validation of the YIPS (Sample 1: n = 177, Sample 2: n = 219). Results suggest that responses to the YEPS showed a sound, unidimensional factor structure that is internally consistent, providing initial evidence for the purported internal structure of the measure. Findings also showed that YEPS scores had meaningful associations with other self-reported, theoretically relevant mental health variables, providing initial convergent evidence in favor of construct interpretation. Taken together, preliminary psychometrics support the validation argument for the interpretation and use of YEPS scores as a brief measure of adolescents' general externalizing problems. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

AB This study presents findings from three separate meta-analyses investigating differences between children placed in residential care and in family foster care with regard to three outcomes: internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, and perception of care. Based on publications from the last 20 years, a total of 23 studies were included. The total sample consisted of 13,630 children in care, with 7,469 from foster care and 6,161 from residential care. The results from this study indicated that children in foster care had consistently better experiences and less problems across the three outcomes as compared to children in residential care. Analyses did not reveal evidence of publication bias, and sensitivity analyses also suggested that results were not influenced by individual studies. Additionally, moderation analyses revealed that the differences between foster and residential care could vary depending on certain factors such as the publication year, the gross domestic product of the country, and the length of care. The implications of differences in outcomes between the two placements are discussed.

AB Objectives Children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI) often experience negative feelings, such as guilt and shame. These feelings may put them at risk of developing internalizing or externalizing problems. In the Netherlands, preventive peer support groups exist which aim at preventing experiencing negative feelings such as guilt and shame. However, current questionnaires which assess feelings of guilt and shame have limitations and therefore cannot be used to measure these feelings in adolescent COPMI. Moreover, it cannot be measured if these peer support groups succeed in preventing experiencing negative feelings, such as guilt and shame. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the 'Guilt and Shame Questionnaire-for Adolescents of Parents with a Mental Illness (GSQ-APMI)', which is specifically designed for adolescent COPMI aged 12-21 years. Methods The study consisted of three phases: phase 1, 'Operationalization and Item Development'; phase 2, 'Pilot Testing'; and phase 3, 'Psychometric Properties'. Phase 2 included 79 adolescent COPMI; phase 3 included 47 adolescent COPMI. Results Results revealed that the GSQ-APMI is a reliable and valid questionnaire to measure feelings of guilt and shame in adolescent COPMI. Conclusions The GSQ-APMI is a short (10 items) and feasible instrument, ready to use in both research and clinical practice to establish feelings of guilt and shame in adolescent COPMI. The questionnaire results in two scale scores: one scale score reflecting feelings of guilt and one scale score reflecting feelings of shame.

AB Cortisol reactivity is a frequently studied biomarker of substance use, though infrequently examined in adolescence. However, past research provides evidence that multiple developmental influences, including genetics and both prenatal and postnatal environmental influences, contribute both to cortisol reactivity and adolescent substance use. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these earlier developmental influences on cortisol reactivity to a social stress challenge and adolescent substance use (smoking, alcohol, and marijuana use frequency assessed at age 16 years), using data from the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS; N= 2230 adolescents, 51% female). Developmental pathways included polygenic risk, prenatal stress, warm parenting (age 11), and internalizing and externalizing problems (intercepts and change from 11-16 years). Cortisol reactivity was associated with smoking but not alcohol or marijuana use. Externalizing problems were the stronger predictor of adolescent substance use, but internalizing problems also had an important role. Prenatal stress and middle childhood parenting operated via middle childhood externalizing problems, and parenting also operated via trajectories of growth of externalizing problems in predicting adolescent substance use outcomes. Further, there were protective effects of internalizing problems for alcohol and marijuana use in the context of a more comprehensive model. These developmental influences did not attenuate the association of cortisol reactivity and smoking. These findings suggest a need to understand the broader developmental context regarding the impact of internalizing pathways to substance use, and that it is unlikely that cortisol reactivity and smoking are associated solely because of common developmental influences.

AB Background and Objectives Previous research has yielded equivocal findings regarding whether internalizing symptoms are risk factors for adolescent hazardous alcohol use (AU), specifically in the presence of externalizing symptoms. This may be due to the type of internalizing symptoms examined (ie, distress vs fear), and the use of primarily normative rather than clinical samples. Thus, we tested internalizing and externalizing symptom interactions as they relate to adolescent hazardous AU in a high-risk, clinical sample of adolescents. Methods Adolescents (N = 101; 66% female; M-age = 15) were recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit and assessed for current symptoms. Hypotheses were tested by running a series of moderation models regressing hazardous AU on a set of internalizing symptoms (ie, depression, generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], social anxiety, separation anxiety, school avoidance, and panic), each interacting with externalizing symptoms. Results We observed significant interactions between several internalizing symptoms (depression, GAD, and panic symptoms) and externalizing symptoms predicting hazardous AU. These internalizing symptoms were unrelated to AU at low and average levels of externalizing symptoms, but were positively related to AU at high levels of externalizing symptoms. Discussion and Conclusions In this clinical sample, distress-related internalizing symptomatology was associated with risk for, and not protection against, hazardous AU, but only when accompanied by high externalizing symptoms. Scientific Significance Findings suggest that whether or not internalizing symptoms operate synergistically with externalizing symptoms to predict hazardous AU depends on the subdomain of internalizing symptoms (distress vs fear) and perhaps the type of sample (ie, clinical vs community).

AB Sexual abuse and peer victimization often co-occur and generate similar repercussions. The current study aimed to determine the extent to which child sexual abuse is associated to peer victimization. The unique contribution of these two distinct forms of victimization to the prediction of behavior problems was also investigated in a sample of 532 school-aged victims of sexual abuse and non-victims. Child sexual abuse was associated with a two-fold increased risk of peer victimization, as evaluated by the parent and the teacher. Results revealed that parent and teacher reports of peer victimization, but not the child's, were associated with higher levels of internalized and externalized behavior problems, beyond the effect of child sexual abuse. The results suggest that child sexual abuse and peer victimization have unique and cumulative effects on behavior problems in children.

AB This study investigated the equivalence of different types of informants, such as children (or early adolescents) and parents, in evaluating child externalizing and internalizing problems. We applied a polytomous item response theory (IRT) model for the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). We obtained responses to three subscales-Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity/Inattention, and Emotional Symptoms-from 541 elementary school students aged 10-12 years, fathers for 233 students, mothers for 275 students, and the homeroom teachers for 524 students. Expected values on the individual item calculated by the discrimination and threshold parameters were compared among students, fathers, and mothers as an investigation of differential item functioning (DIF) or differential informant functioning. Assessing either externalizing or internalizing problems were mostly equivalent between fathers and mothers, and most items for externalizing problems functioned equally between students and parents, whereas items for internalizing problems showed DIF between them. IRT also yielded that the intervals of response categories varied across items, particularly for the conduct problems items "fight" and "steal," and positively worded items showed an extremely low threshold.

AB This systematic review examines studies conducted since the year 2000 on the adjustment of children (0-18 years) in joint custody (30/70%) and on the associated family factors (i.e., parenting and interparental conflict). Studies were extracted following PRISMA. Sixteen quantitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen assessed internalizing adjustment and 10 examined externalizing adjustment. Only 2 were rated as having high quality. Limitations included cross-sectional design, reliance in single informant, failure to adjust for important characteristics and no theoretical approach. The results show that the adjustment level of children in joint custody is as good, if not better, than that of those in sole custody. It also shows however that interparental conflict, parental practices, and the parents' mental health generally play a more influential role. In regard to conflictual contexts, studies are beginning to identify, particularly in joint custody, risk factors such as strict arrangements and concerns about the children's safety.

AB Objective: Long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy for children aims not only at improving symptoms but also at changing the quality of life. To our knowledge, no studies exist to date that focused on both aspects. In this paper, we investigated changes in problem behavior and health-related quality of life based on long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy with children suffering from emotional and behavioral disorders. Method: We investigated 76 children in the treatment group and analyzed pre- and post-treatment symptoms. Furthermore, we compared the outcome data with a control group of 27 children of similar age and diagnoses who received no psychotherapy, both under routine care conditions. The children included in the study were treated on average for 66 sessions. Parent and adolescent ratings on the Achenbach Scales and the Quality of Life Inventory for Adolescents were compared before and after treatment. Results: We found a highly significant improvement of internalizing symptomatology based on parent ratings with a large effect. Different from prior investigations based on short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy we found changes in quality of life with large effects. Conclusion: These findings indicate that long-term psychodynamic treatment can improve life quality in children beyond symptom change.

AB Exposure to childhood victimization and adversity (CVA) is pervasive for child welfare (CW) involved youth. However, most research with CW samples has focused on types of maltreatment and fails to recognize the additive influence of exposure to CVA beyond maltreatment. A subsample aged 8 to 17 (n = 1,887) was drawn from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) II. CVA included six domains. Behavioral health was assessed using the Child Depression Inventory, Trauma Symptom Checklist, and the internalizing and externalizing subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist. Logistic regression was used to explore the association between the number of CVA reported and the risk of clinical-range behavioral health symptoms. Analyses were adjusted for the cluster-based sampling design and sampling weights were applied to provide nationally representative estimates. More than 60% of the sample experienced three or more CVA domains. The number of CVAs reported was associated with all four behavioral health outcomes (p < .001). Children exposed to five or more domains were more likely to report high depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0), high trauma symptoms (OR = 7.0), and to have internalizing or externalizing symptoms reported by caregivers (OR = 18.0), as compared with children reporting one or less CVAs. Youth involved with CW are exposed to staggeringly high rates of CVA beyond maltreatment. For children who are already at great risk for behavioral health challenges, research to understand screening and interventions for CVA is needed to inform policy and practice initiatives to prevent and mitigate harm.

AB A history of childhood trauma has been found to have a robust influence on juvenile delinquency, and evidence suggests that childhood sexual abuse is particularly common among female youth involved in the juvenile justice system. The current study sought to investigate impulsivity as a potential mediator of the relationship between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and juvenile incarceration amongst a community sample of low-income, urban, African American adult women. Although impulsivity has been studied among justice-involved youth, few studies have examined the influence of impulsivity within the relationship between CSA and juvenile incarceration and no known studies have explored their relationship in community populations of African American women with histories of juvenile incarceration. Results revealed that impulsivity mediated the relationship between CSA and previous juvenile incarceration. As an exploratory analysis, overall emotion dysregulation as well as other facets of emotion dysregulation did not serve as significant mediators in this relationship. These findings suggest that difficulties in impulse control may be one mechanism through which childhood sexual abuse increases risk for juvenile justice system involvement among African American women.

AB Background Children in foster care tend to exhibit adverse psychosocial functioning, and foster parents tend to experience high levels of stress related to their role as carers. Methods The study included 60 foster children and 42 children living in biological families as a comparison group. Caregiver stress was measured using the Parenting Stress Index, while child problem behavior was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Children and their primary carer were assessed when the children were 2, 3, and 8 years, respectively. Results The results showed higher stress scores for foster parents at all time points, with the difference being most pronounced in stress related to the child. Problem behavior was also higher for foster children at age 8 years. Foster parent stress increased in all domains during the course of the study. Child domain stress was the only significant predictor of child problem behavior. Conclusion Foster parents are overall more stressed than biological parents, with stress levels increasing over time. Foster children have more behavior problems, and these problems are closely related to their carers' child-related stress. Further implications for the reduction of parenting stress are discussed.

A sample of 302 adolescents (60.10% girls, M-age = 17.35) completed scales measuring the depressive symptoms and perception of their teachers' support/equity and peers' cooperation/cohesiveness behaviors at Time 1. The adolescents' average grades were also collected. The adolescents' depressive symptoms and average grades were measured again at Time 2. The results showed that depressive symptoms measured at Time 1 were negatively associated with academic achievement measured at Time 2. The adolescents' perception of their peers' cooperation/cohesiveness moderated the relation between depressive symptoms and academic achievement. The results' implications for educational practice are discussed.

AB Eating disorder symptomatology is highly prevalent in adolescence and is regarded one of the most important precursors of clinical eating disorders. The present longitudinal study examined the development of eating disorder symptomatology in adolescents over two years. At Time 1,528 high school students filled out self-report questionnaires (50.5% female; M-age = 15 years). Multivariate latent growth curve modeling and latent class growth analyses were performed to model latent trajectories and to identify latent trajectory classes. Stable trajectories of drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction were found, whereas bulimia and BMI increased over time. Important gender differences pointed to girls experiencing more eating disorder symptoms at each time point. Additionally, more diverse trajectory classes were found in girls than in boys. Finally, classes with the most eating disorder symptoms also experienced the most problems in identity development, internalizing symptoms, and the least effortful control. The present study underscores the importance of identifying vulnerable adolescents that experience greater eating disorder symptomatology, as they also seem to experience the worst psychosocial development.

AB Background: Justice-involved youth are at risk to become cigarette smokers as they age, leading to a variety of poor health outcomes. However, little is known about cigarette use among justice-involved youth, especially youth supervised in the community where there is ample opportunity to smoke. Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the associations between cigarette smoking, emotional and behavioral functioning, and other substance use among a sample of first-time offending court-involved, non-incarcerated (FTO-CINI) youth. Methods: Youth were recruited from a family court in the Northeast (N = 423). Substance use was self-reported using the Adolescent Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA). Emotional and behavioral functioning was measured using the Behavior Assessment Schedule for Children-Second Edition (BASC-2), the Affect Dysregulation Scale (ADS), National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scale (NSESSS), and the National Survey of Self-Reported Delinquency (NYS-SRD). Results: About 9.9% of FTO-CINI youth had smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. Compared with FTO-CINI youth who had not smoked recently, recent smokers endorsed more emotional and behavioral symptoms, such as school problems (p < .001), internalizing problems (p = .012), inattention/hyperactivity (p = .020), affect dysregulation (p = .044), PTSD symptoms (p = .006), and delinquent behavior (p < .001). Recent smokers were also more likely to use alcohol (OR = 5.61, p < .001), marijuana (OR = 11.27, p < .001), and other drugs (OR = 5.00, p < .001). Conclusions: Recent smoking was higher among FTO-CINI youth than youth in the general population. Findings underscore the need to incorporate nicotine into existing substance use prevention interventions for this population, who are at high risk to initiate cigarette use as they age.

AB Child maltreatment is associated with negative mental health outcomes including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. Maltreatment experiences can result in negative beliefs about safety and wellbeing, which may maintain negative mental health symptoms. Household dysfunction (eg, impaired caregiver) is considered less severe than maltreatment but more problematic than well-functioning family environments. Objective: This study investigates the incremental value household dysfunction contributes, above effects of maltreatment, to the prediction of internalizing symptoms (PTSD, depression, anxiety), and the extent to which negative beliefs might maintain these symptoms. Participants/methods: Female college students (N = 252; M-age = 19.2) electronically reported childhood exposure to maltreatment and household dysfunction, current maladaptive beliefs and internalizing symptoms. Results: Structural equation modeling showed household dysfunction significantly predicted internalizing symptoms after controlling for maltreatment experiences; this association was mediated through negative beliefs. Conclusions: Results suggest the additional importance of considering elements of household dysfunction when exploring traumatic histories.

AB The aim of the study was to examine whether the impact of interpersonal traumas on internalizing problems in antisocial adolescents treated in a community based forensic setting was moderated by gender. Data were collected in the Netherlands from a random sample of the available treatment files of 397 adolescents (200 males and 197 females) aged 12-18 years. Adolescent females more often experienced physical and sexual abuse, and internalizing symptoms and disorders than their male counterparts. Multiple regression analysis revealed that physical abuse, gender and ethnicity significantly predicted internalizing symptoms. A gender-physical abuse interaction effect was also found. In contrast to the hypothesis, physically abused males had a higher chance of developing internalizing symptoms than physically abused females. Sexual abuse was associated with internalizing disorders (mainly dysthymia and PTSD) for both males and females. Although the literature suggests that the link between traumatic experiences and mental health problems is stronger for females than for males, we did not find evidence for this in our forensic outpatient sample of antisocial adolescents.

AB Background: An increased prevalence of psychological and behavioral conditions has been observed in youth and adolescents with DCD. The majority of research examining the relationship between motor skill proficiency and psychological problems has focused on older children and adolescents. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between motor skill proficiency and emotional and behavioral problems among pre-school age children with DCD to help determine how young children are when more severe problems begin to emerge (i.e., symptoms meet clinical thresholds) and the prevalence of comorbidity. Methods: Children 4 to 5 years of age (n = 589) from the Coordination and Activity Tracking in CHildren (CATCH) study were divided into two groups: at risk for DCD (rDCD; n = 288) and typically developing (TD; n = 301). Inclusion in the rDCD group required a score <= 16th percentile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2. Emotional and behavioral problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5 to 5 year parent-report questionnaire. CBCL data were scored using the CBCL syndrome scales as well as the DSM V revised scale scoring. Results: Seven children had missing or incomplete data on the CBCL and were excluded from the present analysis, leaving 582 participants. The mean age was 5.0 (SD 0.6) years and 57% of children were male (TD: 48% male, rDCD group: 67% male). After adjusting for sex, rDCD children scored significantly higher on all CBCL syndrome scales, all DSM-V scales, and all three summative scales. They were also significantly more likely to score at or above the syndrome scale clinical threshold on anxiety, withdrawn, emotionally reactive, aggression, ADHD, internalizing, externalizing, and total problems; and above the DSM-V thresholds on depression and autism. In addition, rDCD status was associated with a higher probability of meeting criteria for one, two, or more disorders in an ordinal logistic regression model. Conclusion: Preschool-age children with rDCD have more parent-reported psychological problems, and are more likely to be above the clinical threshold for many psychological problems and meet criteria for multiple conditions.

AB Objective: This review evaluates literature on how parenting behaviors are passed from one generation to the next in families by providing a new definitional framework to organize existing work, utilizing this framework to review literature on intergenerational continuity in parenting behaviors, and proposing a new developmental framework for understanding the etiology of intergenerational continuity in parenting behaviors. Design: The present review examines 31 studies of intergenerational continuity in parenting, summarizes the findings offered by these studies, and integrates this existing literature in a theoretical framework for considering the etiology of intergenerational continuity in parenting behaviors. Results: Results indicate that parental warmth, hostility, and behavioral control each demonstrate intergenerational continuity, and that internalizing and externalizing behavior serve as potential mediators of intergenerational continuity across all three types of parenting behaviors. Conclusions: Parenting behaviors falling in the warmth, hostility, and behavioral control domains each demonstrate modest continuity across generations. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors developed by children in response to parenting in their family of origin may persist and cause similar patterns of parenting when these children grow up and start their own families. Partner psychopathology and parenting styles may moderate these externalizing and internalizing pathways to intergenerational continuity in parenting.

AB Background Prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms are common in expectant and new mothers and fathers. This study examined the association between four patterns of probable perinatal depression (mother depressed, father depressed, both depressed, neither depressed) in co-parenting mothers and fathers and their children's internalizing and externalizing behaviours at 24 and 36 months of age. The influence of sociodemographic, risk and protective factors was also examined. Methods Depressive symptoms were measured during pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum and children's behaviour was assessed at 24 and 36 months of age. Families (n = 634) provided data on their children's internalizing (i.e. emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn and total) and externalizing (i.e. attention problems, aggression and total) behaviour. Marginal models were employed to determine the relationship between children's behaviour over the two time points and the four patterns of probable parental depression. Sociodemographic variables as well as risk (stress) and protective (social support) factors were included in these models. Results In the perinatal period 19.40% (n = 123) of mothers scored as probably depressed and 10.57% (n = 67) of fathers. In 6.31% (n = 40) of the participating families, both parents scored as probably depressed and in 63.72% (n = 404) neither parent scored as depressed. For children's emotionally reactive, withdrawn and total internalizing behaviours, both mothers' probable depression and mothers and fathers' co-occurring probable depression predicted higher scores, while for children's aggressive behaviour, attention problems, and total externalizing behaviours, only mothers' probable depression predicted higher scores, controlling for sociodemographic, risk and protective factors. Conclusions While probable perinatal depression in mothers predicted 2 and 3 year-old children's behavioural problems, co-occurrence of depression in mothers and fathers had an increased association with internalizing behavioural problems, after considering sociodemographic, risk and protective factors. Health care providers are encouraged to consider the whole family in preventing and treating perinatal depression.

AB Objectives There are few methods to assess attachment representations during adolescence, all showing strengths and limits. The Friends and Family Interview (FFI) is the only narrative interview considering a wide range of relevant domains in adolescents' life, including peer and sibling relationships, as well as self-esteem, relations with parents and reflective functioning. However, the FFI has been used sparingly with community samples, never with adolescents older than 14-years, and few studies have investigated its psychometric characteristics. This study aimed at investigating the content and discriminant validity of the FFI, comparing the distribution of FFI classifications with the distribution observed in adults in response to the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI), based on national and international meta-analytic reports. This paper also aimed to consider FFI classifications and rating scales with respondents' gender, age, verbal intelligence and internalizing-externalizing problems. Methods Participants were 110 adolescents aged 11-17 years (M = 14.22, 50% boys), recruited from schools in North-west Italy, coming from low risk families. Measures administered were the FFI, the Verbal Comprehension Index of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (ICV-WISC-IV) for verbal skills, the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 years (CBCL) for internalizing-externalizing problems. Results The distribution of FFI classifications overlapped with the AAI distribution seen in a national meta-analysis, while less insecure dismissing and disorganized FFI responses were found compared to the AAI distribution in the international meta-analytic report; girls were more secure and less dismissing than boys, while FFI classifications were unrelated to adolescents' age, verbal skills, or internalizing-externalizing problems, although relevant correlations were found with some of the FFI rating scales. Conclusions Within a culturally-oriented perspective, the FFI appears to be a reliable and valid method to investigate adolescent IWMs in both research and clinical settings.

AB Objectives An orientation to child rearing, ambiguously labeled "positive parenting," has proliferated in the popular literature. It differs in philosophy from mainstream child-rearing practices and most contemporary parent education programs by espousing a relationship-oriented, child-centered, and punishment-free approach. However, the approach lacks empirical evidence. In this study, we investigated one prominent positive parenting program, named Attachment Parenting International (API). Three claims the program makes were examined concerning parental warmth, disciplinary practices, and child adjustment. Along those lines, we predicted API parents would report engaging in warmer parent-child interactions, use more non-coercive discipline, and use less coercive discipline with their children than other parents. We also expected that API parents would report fewer child adjustment problems than comparison mothers. Methods A total of 593 mothers of 3- to 10-year-old children participated in the online study about their parenting practices and their children's behavior. Three hundred and sixty participants self-identified as being API mothers; 233 mothers were recruited from Mechanical Turk. Results As expected, the API mothers reported significantly warmer mother-child relationships and engaging in more non-coercive discipline but less coercive discipline than the matched comparison mothers. However, there were no significant group differences on children's adjustment problems. Nevertheless, API membership moderated two of the six regression analyses. API mothers' use of warmth was associated with fewer internalizing symptoms than the comparison mothers. Additionally, API mothers' use of non-coercive discipline was linked to fewer child externalizing symptoms than the comparison group. Conclusions Mothers affiliated with API indicated they engaged in childrearing behavior that was inline with the teachings of the program. An addition, API involvement moderated two of the relations be parenting and child behavior problems. Consequently, this study provides some of the first empirical evidence about how affiliation with a positive parenting organization is related to childrearing behavior as well as child behavior. Observational and prospective studies are needed to more thoroughly examine the relations between positive parenting programs, child-rearing behavior, and child adjustment.

AB Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) appears to be distinct from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and unique patterns of association between SCT and comorbid symptoms have been reported in the literature. The current study examined the relation between environmental supports and comorbid concerns among children with high SCT. Parents of children (ages 6-12) with a diagnosis of ADHD and clinically elevated SCT (N = 126) completed measures of emotional/behavioral functioning, child routines, and parental adjustment. Regression analyses revealed that after controlling for child age and parental adjustment, Household and Daily Living routines were associated with lower levels of externalizing symptoms while Discipline routines were associated with higher levels of these symptoms, accounting for nearly 20% of the variance in the equation. The findings suggest that for children with ADHD and high SCT routines may play an important role as an environmental support for externalizing symptoms.

AB Background: Many risk factors for tobacco use among the general young adult population, such as tobacco advertising receptivity, have gone unexamined among those with internalizing problems, despite disproportionately high rates of tobacco use. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the interrelationship of internalizing problems, tobacco advertising receptivity, and tobacco use among young adults using data from Wave 1 of the Population Assessment for Tobacco and Health Study. Methods: The sample included 9,110 young adults (ages 18-24). Multivariable logistic regression models examined the association between internalizing problems and advertising receptivity and tobacco use. Separate models were run for cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and any tobacco use. An interaction term (receptivity x internalizing problems) was added to each model. Results: Except for smokeless tobacco, individuals with high internalizing problems reported greater odds of product use compared to those with low internalizing problems. There was no association between internalizing problems and use of smokeless tobacco. For all products, receptivity was positively associated with tobacco use. A borderline significant interaction was detected between cigarette advertising receptivity and internalizing problems, such that the magnitude of the relationship between receptivity to cigarette advertising and cigarette use was stronger for those with high internalizing problems compared those with low internalizing problems. Conclusions/Importance: The relationship between cigarette advertising receptivity and cigarette use may differ for those with and without internalizing problems. Disproportionate receptivity to risk-promoting messages among young adults with internalizing problems could exacerbate disparities in cigarette use.

AB Although symptoms of anxiety often coexist with symptoms of depression, little is known on how such coexistence affects youth's school experiences. Objectives: We tested how the two types of behaviors, when coexisting, were associated with youth's negative attitude toward teachers, school, and poor peer relations. Method: Data were collected from 203 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse youth (male: 24.6%; mean = 15.8 years, standard deviation = 2.4) with the 3rd edition of the Behavioral Assessment for Children: Self-Report of Personality. Results: Scores for symptoms of depression alone explained negative attitude toward teachers (beta = .28; R-2 = 17.88%), negative attitude toward school (beta = .27; R-2 = 14.74%), and poor peer relations (beta = .42; R-2 = 44.60%) as effectively as scores for both types of behaviors did. Conclusion: The coexistence of symptoms of anxiety and depression did not appear to impair youth's attitude toward teachers, school and peer relations more than symptoms of depression did alone.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate associations between internalizing and externalizing symptoms and deficits in executive functions (EF) as well as to examine the overall heterogeneity of EFs in a sample of preschool children attending a psychiatric clinic (n = 171). First, based on cut-off points signifying clinical levels of impairment on the parent-completed Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), children were assigned into groups of internalizing, externalizing, combined or mild symptoms and compared to a reference group (n = 667) with regard to day care teacher ratings of EFs on the Attention and Executive Function Rating Inventory-Preschool (ATTEX-P). Second, latent profile analysis (LPA) was employed to identify distinct subgroups of children representing different EF profiles with unique strengths and weaknesses in EFs. The first set of analyses indicated that all symptom groups had more difficulties in EFs than the reference group did, and the internalizing group had less inhibition-related problems than the other symptom groups did. Using LPA, five EF profiles were identified: average, weak average, attentional problems, inhibitory problems, and overall problems. The EF profiles were significantly associated with gender, maternal education level, and psychiatric symptom type. Overall, the findings suggest that the comparison of means of internalizing and externalizing groups mainly captures the fairly obvious differences in inhibition-related domains among young psychiatric outpatient children, whereas the person-oriented approach, based on individual differences, identifies heterogeneity related to attentional functions, planning, and initiating one's action. The variability in EF difficulties suggests that a comprehensive evaluation of a child's EF profile is important regardless of the type of psychiatric symptoms the child presents with.

AB Background Borderline personality disorder (BPD) typically onsets in adolescence and predicts later functional disability in adulthood. Highly structured evidence-based psychotherapeutic programs, including mentalization-based treatment (MBT), are first choice treatment. The efficacy of MBT for BPD has mainly been tested with adults, and no RCT has examined the effectiveness of MBT in groups (MBT-G) for adolescent BPD. Method A total of 112 adolescents (111 females) with BPD (106) or BPD symptoms >= 4 DSM-5 criteria (5) referred to child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics were randomized to a 1-year MBT-G, consisting of three introductory, psychoeducative sessions, 37 weekly group sessions, five individual case formulation sessions, and six group sessions for caregivers, or treatment as usual (TAU) with at least 12 monthly individual sessions. The primary outcome was the score on the borderline personality features scale for children (BPFS-C); secondary outcomes included self-harm, depression, externalizing and internalizing symptoms (all self-report), caregiver reports, social functioning, and borderline symptoms rated by blinded clinicians. Outcome assessments were made at baseline, after 10, 20, and 30 weeks, and at end of treatment (EOT). The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT02068326. Results At EOT, the primary outcome was 71.3 (SD = 15.0) in the MBT-G group and 71.3 (SD = 15.2) in the TAU group (adjusted mean difference 0.4 BPFS-C units in favor of MBT-G, 95% confidence interval -6.3 to 7.1, p = .91). No significant group differences were found in the secondary outcomes. 29% in both groups remitted. 29% of the MBT group completed less than half of the sessions compared with 7% of the control group. Conclusions There is no indication for superiority of either therapy method. The low remission rate points to the importance of continued research into early intervention. Specifically, retention problems need to be addressed.

AB The present study investigated the bidirectional effects between callous-unemotional (i.e., CU) traits, student-teacher relationship quality, and bonds with school. A sample of 301 middle school students (156 girls; M age = 12.96 years, SD = 0.94) completed the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits and the Student-Teacher Relationship Questionnaire, along with measures of both externalizing and internalizing problems, both in the first and second part of the school year (i.e., a time frame of 6 months). They also completed a peer-nominated measure of social preference within their peer group at the beginning of the school year. Results from a cross-lagged panel model suggested that, controlling for measures of both externalizing and internalizing problems, levels of affiliation with teachers were negatively related to levels of CU traits in students with low levels of social preference among peers. Moreover, a synergistic effect of high levels of both bonds with school and social preference emerged in predicting lower levels of CU traits. Similar results emerged with regard to externalizing problems, over and above the role of CU traits and internalizing problems. No effects of CU traits predicting student-teacher relationship quality emerged. Overall, the findings highlighted the teachers' role as emotion socializers and role models for the students who can promote students' emotional and relational prosperity over the development of maladaptive outcomes, including CU traits. They also stressed the importance of considering multiple environmental determinants in examining the pathways to CU traits, suggesting the need to integrate and expand previous research on parenting.

AB Mental health problems often emerge in adolescence and are associated with reduced gray matter thickness or volume in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic system and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) of white matter linking these regions. However, few studies have investigated whether internalizing and externalizing behavior are associated with brain structure in children and adolescents without mental health disorders, which is important for understanding the progression of symptoms. 67 T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging datasets were obtained from 48 typically developing participants aged 6-16 years (37M/30F; 19 participants had two visits). Volume was calculated in the prefrontal and limbic structures, and diffusion parameters were assessed in limbic white matter. Linear mixed effects models were used to compute associations between brain structure and internalizing and externalizing behavior, assessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) Parent Rating Scale. Internalizing behavior was positively associated with MD of the bilateral cingulum. Gender interactions were found in the cingulum, with stronger positive relationships between MD and internalizing behavior in females. Externalizing behavior was negatively associated with FA of the left cingulum, and the left uncinate fasciculus showed an age-behavior interaction. No relationships between behavior and brain volumes survived multiple comparison correction. These results show altered limbic white matter FA and MD related to sub-clinical internalizing and externalizing behavior and further our understanding of neurological markers that may underlie risk for future mental health disorders.

AB BackgroundThe latest version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposes a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis reduced to its core symptoms within the symptom clusters re-experiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal. Since children and adolescents often show a variety of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the aftermath of traumatic events, the question arises whether such a conceptualization of the PTSD diagnosis is supported in children and adolescents. Furthermore, although dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) appear to play an important role in the development and persistence of PTSD in children and adolescents, their function within diagnostic frameworks requires clarification.
   MethodsWe compiled a large international data set of 2,313 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years exposed to trauma and calculated a network model including dysfunctional PTCs, PTSD core symptoms and depression symptoms. Central items and relations between constructs were investigated.
   ResultsThe PTSD re-experiencing symptoms strong or overwhelming emotions and strong physical sensations and the depression symptom difficulty concentrating emerged as most central. Items from the same construct were more strongly connected with each other than with items from the other constructs. Dysfunctional PTCs were not more strongly connected to core PTSD symptoms than to depression symptoms.
   ConclusionsOur findings provide support that a PTSD diagnosis reduced to its core symptoms could help to disentangle PTSD, depression and dysfunctional PTCs. Using longitudinal data and complementing between-subject with within-subject analyses might provide further insight into the relationship between dysfunctional PTCs, PTSD and depression.

AB This study investigated the role of behavioral norms on concurrent links between problem behaviors (externalizing problems, internalizing problems, attention-hyperactivity problems) and social status (acceptance, rejection) in special education classrooms at four time points within and across school years. Two opposing models were considered, the "person-group similarity model," suggesting moderation of behavioral norms, and the "social skill model," suggesting no moderation. The sample included a total of 580 pupils (88% boys, M-age Time1 = 10.82 years, SD = .86) attending 37 classrooms from 13 Dutch schools for special education. Multilevel analyses revealed that the data generally supported a "social skill model," meaning that higher individual levels of attention-hyperactivity problems and externalizing problems were related to lower acceptance and higher rejection, independent of behavioral norms. Support for behavioral norms as moderators of the link between individual behaviors and social status was limited to pupils with attention-hyperactivity problems being less rejected in classrooms in which this behavior was normative. In sum, these results provide an initial exploration of the role of behavioral norms in special education. Various explanations for the results, including special education characteristics and the value of behavioral norms, are discussed.

AB Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an Omega-3/Omega-6 fatty acid supplement in preschool children at risk for ADHD. Method: Forty preschool children with elevated levels of ADHD symptoms were randomly assigned to either a verum or a placebo group. Children in the verum group received a 4-month treatment with Omega-3/Omega-6 fatty acids. Outcome measures comprised parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms, which were the primary outcome variables, internalizing and externalizing problems, and intellectual abilities. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance, controlling for age and baseline data, revealed effects on parent- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (primary outcomes; parent ratings: F = 4.51, df = 1, p = .04, d = 0.63; teacher ratings: F = 4.67, df = 1, p = .04, d = 0.70), parent-rated internalizing symptoms (F = 8.47, df = 1, p < .01, d = 0.63), and parent- and teacher-rated externalizing symptoms (parent ratings: F = 4.58, df = 1, p = .04, d = 0.54; teacher ratings: F = 5.99, df = 1, p = .02, d = 0.79). Analyses involving only cases with available data yielded significant moderate effects on teacher-rated inattention symptoms (F = 4.60, df = 1, p = .04, d = 0.79) and parent-rated internalizing problems (F = 6.04, df = 1, p = .02, d = 0.57). Conclusion: The intention-to-treat analyses provide some evidence for positive effects of Omega-3/Omega-6 fatty acids. However, the results require replication in larger samples to allow for firm conclusions for practice.

AB Children with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) are at increased risk for developing severe negative emotional outcomes later in life. However, positive emotional outcomes are less studied. In the current study, we examine the longitudinal effects of ODD symptoms on both children's feelings of happiness and depression from the dual-factor perspective of mental health. According to interpersonal perspectives of psychological symptoms, poor interpersonal relationships often play a critical role in the process of how children's behavioral problems develop into severe emotional outcomes. Thus, Children's relationships with parents, teachers, and peers were tested as mediators in these effects. Participants included 256 children with ODD were recruited in North, Middle, and South of Mainland China, along with their parents and teachers, and were assessed at three time points roughly two years apart. Results revealed that more severe ODD symptoms at Time 1 were related to more subsequent depressive symptoms and less happiness at Time 3. Moreover, father-child attachment, mother-child attachment, and peer relationships mediated the link between ODD symptoms and feelings of happiness while father-child attachment mediated the link between ODD symptoms and depressive symptoms. These findings reveal the importance of focusing on ODD-children's feelings of happiness as well as depression and highlight the critical role of improving interpersonal functioning for children with ODD in protecting children from developing emotional impairments. Moreover, among all interpersonal relationships, high quality of father-child relationship needs to be mostly valued for Chinese families of children with ODD.

AB Whether or not importance should be placed on an all-encompassing general factor of psychopathology (or p factor) in classifying, researching, diagnosing, and treating psychiatric disorders depends (among other issues) on the extent to which comorbidity is symptom-general rather than staying largely within the confines of narrower transdiagnostic factors such as internalizing and externalizing. In this study, we compared three methods of estimating p factor strength. We compared omega hierarchical and explained common variance calculated from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) bifactor models with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, from exploratory structural equation modeling/exploratory factor analysis models with a bifactor rotation, and from Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) bifactor models. Our simulation results suggested that BSEM with small variance priors on secondary loadings might be the preferred option. However, CFA with ML also performed well provided secondary loadings were modeled. We provide two empirical examples of applying the three methodologies using a normative sample of youth (z-proso, n = 1,286) and a university counseling sample (n = 359).

AB Background: Large numbers of perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) children are aging into adolescence. We examined cognitive and behavioral outcomes in a longitudinal cohort of Asian youth.
   Methods: We followed up 231 PHIV, 125 perinatally HIVexposed, uninfected (HEU), and 138 HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) adolescents (aged 10 years and older), matched by age/sex, in Thailand and Cambodia for 3 years. Executive function was assessed with Children's Color Trails Tests 1 and 2 (CCTT-1 and -2), the design fluency test, and the verbal fluency test. Working memory (Freedom from Distractibility Index) and processing speed index were assessed using WISC-III. Visual memory was assessed by design memory and design recognition subtests of the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML-2) and behavioral problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Generalized estimating equations examined adjusted odds ratios of cognitive impairment (Z-scores >= 2 SD below age-adjusted means of the HUU group) and CBCL T-scores in the borderline-clinical range (T-Scores >= 60) in PHIV and HEU versus HUU youth, adjusting for ethnicity, household income, and caregiver characteristics.
   Results: The median age at enrollment was 13.8 years, with 58% women and 63% Thai participants. PHIV youth had >86% virological suppression and significantly higher impairment rates on CCTT-1 and -2 tests, design fluency test, verbal fluency tests, design memory, and CBCL internalizing and externalizing problems. Results were mostly similar between HEU and HUU groups, apart from higher impairment rates on CCTT-1 and internalizing problems in HEU.
   Conclusion: Asian adolescents with PHIV remain at risk of cognitive and mental health problems despite HIV treatment. Selective risks are observed among HEU youth.

AB Purpose of review Childhood maltreatment is associated with all types of eating disorders. We provide a systematic review of the recent literature on comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with eating disorders, and focus on prevalence, relationship with symptom severity, operating mechanisms and treatment. Recent findings The prevalence of comorbid PTSD in patients with eating disorders ranges from 9 to 24%, with research suggesting that comorbid PTSD is associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms. Maladaptive emotional regulation strategies may mediate the relationship between PTSD and eating disorders. Two pilot studies provide preliminary evidence that concurrent cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for PTSD and eating disorders may be beneficial and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could be helpful in the treatment of PTSD in some eating disorder patients. PTSD is a common comorbidity in patients with eating disorders and impacts the severity of their eating disorder symptoms. However, there is little research into concurrent treatments for PTSD and eating disorders. Difficulties in emotional regulation may be a common mechanism in both disorders.

AB Navigating academic demands in middle and high school may be particularly challenging for youth experiencing emotional and behavioral difficulties, and screening practices are a necessary first step in identifying youth in need of services. The goal of this study was to inform efficient universal screening practices in secondary schools by comparing 3 common methods of screening, including self- and teacher report on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and grade point average (GPA) to indicate moderate and high levels of risk. Participants were 2,350 secondary students (47% female; 94% non-Hispanic White) and their teachers in 1 socioeconomically diverse school district. Using the moderate-risk criteria, there was low agreement among methods, and almost half the sample (46%) was identified as at risk by at least 1 of the 3 methods, indicating that responding to the needs of students who cross this liberal cutoff may not be feasible given school resources. Using the high-risk criteria reduced the agreement among screening measures. Self-report identified the most students as high risk and was more sensitive to teacher-rated concerns than the converse. If students were uniquely identified by teacher report, teachers rated them at high levels of risk, and predominant concerns were related to conduct problems. GPA captured few students with self- or teacher-rated internalizing or externalizing difficulties. Implications for universal screening within secondary schools are discussed.

AB Asthma is the most common childhood chronic condition and a major contributor to school absences and lost instructional time. Children with asthma have a higher risk of internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, which can further complicate asthma management. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a manualized, cognitive-behavioral skills-building intervention for children with asthma and anxiety. The design for this study was a one-group, pre/posttest preexperimental with a 6-week follow-up. This article presents the immediate posttest follow-up results. Children between 8 and 12 years of age and their caregivers were recruited from three elementary schools in a large public school district in Ohio. Thirty-two children with asthma and symptoms of anxiety completed the Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE) for Asthma program. Caregivers completed surveys, but they did not participate in the intervention. Results indicated that the program was feasible to implement in small groups during the school day. Self-reported findings indicated a significant reduction in separation anxiety and increased personal beliefs, child-management self-efficacy, and asthma illness representations. Parents and caregivers reported symptom reduction in their children on the Pediatric Symptom Checklist. The subgroup of children scoring high on anxiety at baseline showed reductions with the intervention, having large positive effect sizes for separation and social anxiety as well as medium and large positive effect sizes on the personal beliefs and asthma illness representations, respectively.

AB Parental threatening behaviors have emerged as a subset of negative parental behaviors strongly related to internalizing symptoms among youth, yet the underlying mechanisms in this association have remained unexplored. The current investigation examined the role of difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior while emotionally distressed in the association between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and internalizing symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient psychiatric youth. Participants (N = 50; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [0.51] years; age range, 12-17 years) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, exposure to maternal threatening behaviors, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, as well as trauma-related functional impairment. Results revealed that inability to engage in goal-directed behavior while distressed significantly explained associations between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and each of the three symptom classes, but not the association between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and trauma-related functional impairment. These novel findings underscore the need for interventions that target the capacity for goal-directed behavior in the context of emotional distress, especially among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threatening behaviors.

AB Background: Temperament in children and adolescents acts as a trait marker which can predict behavioral abnormalities. There was no systemic study in India which has compared the temperamental, behavioral and cognitive changes associated with this hemoglobinopathy among thalassemia major (TM) group.
   Materials and Methods: The specific objectives of this study were to find the clinicodemographic profile of individuals and parents, the behavioral, temperamental profile of children of beta TM and correlation of temperamental profile with number of blood transfusions, cognitive profile of children having beta TM, minor and age-matched control children and adolescents.
   Results: Child and adolescents having TM have more temperamental and behavioral problems (P < 0.001) and have more psychopathology in comparison to Tm group. Descriptive statistics of the groups and group comparison (ANOVA) shows statistically significant difference in Temperament Measurement Schedule (TMS) total, CPMS total, TMT A, TMT B, and Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) scales (P = 0.000). Descriptive statistics and group comparison (Chi-square test) show significance in number of blood transfusions not with other parameters (P < 0.001). Comparison between TM (Case) and Tm (Control) (t-test) shows significance with only TMS total and CPMS scales, not in other scales. The correlation matrix showed significant correlation in-between all the parameters (blood transfusion, TMS, CPMS, TMT A, TMT B, and CDRS).
   Discussion: Those who have been diagnosed as TM have more behavioral and cognitive problems than their comparators. Youngsters receiving more blood transfusions due to their ailments scored higher in childhood depression rating scale.
   Conclusion: The temperamental, behavioural and cognitive profile are key determinants of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms and management plan can be guided accordingly as reflected in this study.

AB In the literature, little attention has been paid to the specific impact of child-related versus adult-related inter-parental conflicts on children's intrapersonal processes and adjustment. Aimed to advance knowledge on this topic, the cross-sectional study explores: 1) the predictive effects of the two forms of inter-parental conflicts on: a) children's internalizing/externalizing behaviors and b) children's cognitive appraisals, emotional distress, and triangulation; 2) the mediating role of children's cognitive appraisals, emotional distress, and triangulation, in the association between adult-related vs child-related conflict and children's adjustment. Seventy-five school-aged children and their parents completed measures of inter-parental conflict, cognitive, emotional and behavioral processes and child adjustment. The results indicated that: 1) higher levels of adult-related inter-parental conflict promoted children's internalizing behaviors, through the mediation of perceived threat; 2) higher levels of child-related inter-parental discord promoted both children's internalizing/externalzing behaviors, through the mediation of perceived threat and self-blame.

AB Objectives The use of mindfulness-based programs (MBP) with children is rapidly growing, but calls for well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of existing programs. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) has preliminary evidence for targeting internalizing symptoms in children. Within MBCT-C (and MBPs more broadly), attention is thought to be a key component of change, but mediation has been relatively unexplored. The overall aimof this small RCTwas to compare MBCT-C to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), as a preventive program for children experiencing internalizing difficulties. Methods A mixed factorial design was used, with 2 (program group) by 2 (pre- and post-intervention) conditions. Children from 3 primary schools were randomized to MBCT-C (n = 45) or CBT (n = 44) using random permuted blocks, with stratification by school, gender, and age. Main analyses were multi-level mixed models. Results Contrary to the hypotheses, only limited differences were found between programs. Both programs had small effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life, attention control, and parent- and teacher-SDQ Total Difficulties, as well as moderate-large effects on shifting attention. There were no statistically significant changes in mindfulness or sustained attention. Conclusions This RCT provides a robust test of MBCT-C in a "real life" setting, demonstrating that it may be used as a clinically oriented preventive program in schools to reduce internalizing symptoms. The results challenge whether attention (as measured in this study) is a unique component of change for MBCT-C.

AB This article aims to verify the effect of systemic family therapy on the symptomatology of internalizing and externalizing factors in adolescents. The sample was of 109 adolescents, of which 56% were men and 54% women, with a mean age of 15.1 years. Systemic family therapy, under the conditions in which it has been applied, has had a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect. The success rate attributable to treatment was 46% in the Internalizing factor, 43% in Outsourcer, 60% in Somatic Complaints, 43% in Anxiety/Depression and 55% in Aggressive Behavior. These results contribute to the need to align this type of health intervention with the school environment in adolescents.

AB Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) is a monogenic tumor-predisposition syndrome creating a wide variety of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, such as decrease in cognitive functioning, deficits in visuospatial processing, attention, and social functioning. NF1 patients are at risk to develop neurofibromas and other tumors, such as optic pathway gliomas and other tumors of the central nervous system. Few studies have investigated the impact of an additional diagnosis of brain tumor on the cognitive outcome of children with NF1, showing unclear results and without controlling by the effect of surgery, radio- or chemotherapy. In the present mono-institutional study, we compared the behavioral and cognitive outcomes of 26 children with neurofibromatosis alone (NF1) with two age-matched groups of 26 children diagnosed with NF1 and untreated optic pathway glioma (NF1 + OPG) and 19 children with NF1 and untreated other central nervous system tumors (NF1 + CT). NF1 + CT and NF1 + OPG showed significantly impaired cognitive abilities compared to NF1 group, with weaknesses in visuo-spatial abilities, visual scanning and verbal working memory, while general verbal abilities are preserved. Moreover, NF1 + OPG patients present more frequent internalizing problems and increased oppositional-deviant behaviors. These results suggest that the co-diagnosis of a brain tumor in NF1 children may partially worsen the cognitive and emotional outcome.

AB Introduction: Epigenetic changes in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, including prenatal and early life exposures, are becoming as appealing as hereditary genes. This study aimed to investigate possible pre-pubertal environmental and developmental risk factors for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Specific Learning Disorder (SLD).
   Methods: The study included 98 children (24 ADHD, 24 SLD, 26 ASD, 20 controls) aged 7-12 years. The diagnostic evaluation was based on the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-age Children-present version. Parents completed socio-demographic data form for clinical evaluation, and The Wechsler Children's Intelligence scale was used to assess cognitive skills.
   Results: In our study, low parental education level, parental unemployment, low-income, and history of psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives were associated with SLD risk, prematurity, and early self-regulation difficulties were associated with ASD risk, and history of allergy was associated with ADHD risk.
   Conclusion: In this study, the presence of many different risk factors that play a possible role in neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that further epigenetic studies arc needed.

   BEHAVIORS; ADVERSITY; SYMPTOMS
AB Background: Compared to typically developing individuals, individuals with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are on average more often exposed to stressful conditions (e.g., school failure, family conflicts, financial problems). We hypothesized that high exposure to stress relates to a more persistent and complex (i.e., multi-problem) form of ADHD, while low-stress exposure relates to remitting ADHD over the course of adolescence. Method: Longitudinal data (ages 11, 13, 16, and 19) came from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Life Survey (TRAILS). We selected children diagnosed with ADHD (n = 244; 167 males; 77 females) from the TRAILS clinical cohort and children who screened positive (n = 365; 250 males; 115 females) and negative (gender-matched: n = 1222; 831 males; 391 females) for ADHD from the TRAILS general population sample cohort (total n = 1587). Multivariate latent class growth analysis was applied to parent- and self-ratings of stress exposure, core ADHD problems (attention problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity), effortful control, emotion dysregulation (irritability, extreme reactivity, frustration), and internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, somatic complaints). Results: Seven distinct developmental courses in stress exposure and psychopathology were discerned, of which four related to ADHD. Two persistent ADHD courses of severely affected adolescents were associated with very high curvilinear stress exposure peaking in mid-adolescence: (1) Severe combined type with ongoing, severe emotional dysregulation, and (2) combined type with a high and increasing internalization of problems and elevated irritability; two partly remitting ADHD courses had low and declining stress exposure: (3) inattentive type, and (4) moderate combined type, both mostly without comorbid problems. Conclusions: High-stress exposure between childhood and young adulthood is strongly intertwined with a persistent course of ADHD and with comorbid problems taking the form of either severe and persistent emotion dysregulation (irritability, extreme reactivity, frustration) or elevated and increasing irritability, anxiety, and depression. Conversely, low and declining stress exposure is associated with remitting ADHD and decreasing internalizing and externalizing problems. Stress exposure is likely to be a facilitating and sustaining factor in these two persistent trajectories of ADHD with comorbid problems into young adulthood. Our findings suggest that a bidirectional, continuing, cycle of stressors leads to enhanced symptoms, in turn leading to more stressors, and so forth. Consideration of stressful conditions should, therefore, be an inherent part of the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, to potentiate prevention and interruption of adverse trajectories.

AB Parents play a critical role in shaping social-emotional development, particularly in early childhood; however, children's influence on their own development is equally important. Parent-child interactions, fundamental to secure attachment and social schemes, represent a critical area of social-emotional development subject to child effects associated with temperament. The present study explores these effects through a cross-cultural lens via comparisons of dyads from the United States (US) and Germany. Specifically, cross-cultural differences in toddler temperament were evaluated via the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ; Putnam et al., 2006), with cross-cultural variability in parent-child interactions examined as well, along with differences in child temperament effects on the quality of these interactions. Ratings of temperament were generally similar between the two cultures; however, US toddlers were rated higher in attention shifting, whereas German children were rated higher on soothability and perceptual sensitivity. Additionally, dyadic interactions in the US were rated as more stimulating and demonstrating greater partner engagement than those in Germany. Differential contributions of temperament to interaction quality and complexity were also observed. Higher ratings of toddler discomfort and perceptual sensitivity predicted more stimulating interactions overall in the US but not Germany. In contrast, higher ratings of toddler low-intensity pleasure predicted more stimulating interactions in Germany but not the US. Overall, the present study identifies many similarities between US and German toddlers and supports theories describing children as active agents in shaping their own development, in what appears to be a different manner across cultures.

AB This study examined the interaction effects of infant temperament (negative affect, orienting/regulatory capacity, surgency) on the relationship between maternal and paternal parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) and externalizing and internalizing behaviors simultaneously. A diverse sample of mothers (N = 186) and fathers (N = 142) reported on infant temperament of their 6-month-olds and their children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors one year later. Significant interactions revealed: (a) surgency moderated maternal authoritative and paternal permissive parenting style and externalizing behaviors; and (b) surgency moderated maternal authoritarian and paternal authoritative parenting style and internalizing behaviors. No significant interactions were found between maternal and paternal parenting styles and their report of their infants' orienting/regulatory capacity and negative affect. Findings suggest interaction effects may appear beginning in infancy.

AB Guided by theory stressing person-environment interactions, we tested whether parenting correlates of peer victimization would be stronger for adolescents with internalizing difficulties than those without. Participants (N = 362, 56.4% girls, M age = 16.11, 56% Latino) in the 9th to 11th grades responded to questionnaires about their parents' behavior and nominated their peers on items tapping internalizing behaviors and victimization experiences. Both positive (i.e., warmth) and negative dimensions of parenting (overprotectiveness, threat of rejection, coercion) were more strongly associated with victimization at high levels of internalizing and minimized at low levels of internalizing. Girls and older adolescents with internalizing were particularly sensitive to overprotectiveness. Adolescents became increasingly sensitive to coercion as they got older. Discussion addresses individuals' differential susceptibility which may elucidate why some adolescents might be more affected than others by what parents do.

AB Adolescence is a critical developmental stage to develop coping behaviors. However, little is known about the longitudinal relations between coping behaviors and subjective well-being factors in adolescents. Situated within a positive psychology framework and supported by well-being theories, this study aims to investigate if life satisfaction is an antecedent to predict four specific types of coping behaviors (two approach coping: social support seeking and problem solving; and two avoidant coping: internalizing and externalizing coping behaviors) in early adolescents? A cross-lagged panel design was applied with three-wave data with six months apart between each wave. At the baseline, a total of 897 adolescents participated (52.1% female) in the study with 451 students in the 7th grade and 446 students in the 8th grade. The majority of the student body were European American (58.5%), followed by African American (29.4%) and a small percentage of other minority groups (2.9% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.4% Hispanic, 1.1% Native American, and 6.3% other racial groups). Results showed that life satisfaction predicted all coping behaviors in the expected directions across at least one 6-month period between three waves. Reciprocal relations were found between life satisfaction and social support seeking and also between life satisfaction and internalizing coping behaviors from Time 1 to Time 2. Overall the results support that life satisfaction can be an antecedent to coping behaviors. Gender differences were further tested through multi-group comparison and the major findings include: (1) life satisfaction predicted all coping behaviors for females but only two approach coping behaviors for males from Time 1 to Time 2; (2) life satisfaction predicted two coping behaviors (social support seeking, externalizing coping behaviors) across Time 2 and Time 3 for females only. Taken together, life satisfaction appeared to be a more robust predictor of coping behaviors in female adolescents. Research implications are discussed.

AB Purpose: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning has been widely studied in relation to antisocial behavior, such as Conduct Disorder (CD). However, research in females is scarce and findings are inconsistent. This study investigated baseline ANS activity in CD children and adolescents and tested for sex differences. Furthermore, subgroups of CD were investigated: +/- Limited Prosocial Emotions (LPE), +/- comorbid internalizing disorders (INT).
   Methods: Baseline ANS activity was measured by Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV; parasympathetic activity), Pre-Ejection Period (PEP; sympathetic activity), and Respiration Rate (RR). 659 females (296 CD, 363 controls) and 351 males (187 CD, 164 controls), aged 9-18 years participated.
   Results: Baseline HR, HRV and PEP did not differ between CD subjects and controls in both sexes. RR was higher in CD participants than controls amongst females, but not males. LPE was unrelated to ANS activity, whereas females with CD + INT presented lower HRV.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that baseline ANS activity is not a robust indicator for CD. However, deviant ANS activity - especially parasympathetic activity - was observed in CD females with internalizing comorbidity. The psychophysiological abnormalities observed in this subgroup are indicative of emotion regulation problems. Accordingly, this subgroup may require specific interventions.

AB Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder that impacts communication. Children with SM present concerns to parents and teachers as they consistently do not speak in situations where there is an expectation to speak, such as at school, but speak in other settings where they feel more comfortable, such as at home. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between parents' and teachers' perceptions of children with SM on behavioral rating scales and language measures. Forty-two children (22 boys and 20 girls, ranging from 2.4 to 13.8 years, with a mean age of 7.1 years) took part in this study. Parents and teachers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-3) measuring internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, adaptive skills, and behavioral symptoms. Frequency of speaking and language abilities were also measured. Parents and teachers both identified withdrawal as the most prominent feature of SM but parents saw children as significantly more withdrawn than did their teachers. Both rated children similarly at-risk on scales of functional communication and social skills. Higher adaptive skills (including functional communication and social skills) were positively correlated with vocabulary, narrative language, and auditory serial memory according to teachers. Parent and teacher rating scales provide valuable information for diagnosis and progress monitoring. Children with SM can benefit from mental health practitioners who can identify and enhance their emotional well-being.

AB Gender-based violence is one of the most serious social and health problems faced by women around the world. Importantly, it has a negative impact not only on the woman's physical and mental health, but also on all members of the family system in which it takes place. The aims of this study were to implement Leaving a Mark, an animal-assisted intervention (AAI) programme for children who have been exposed to gender-based violence, and to examine its effect on their associated clinical symptoms. The participants were 19 children (13 boys and 6 girls; M-age = 8.89, SD = 2.23) who had been exposed to domestic violence perpetrated either by their father or their mother's intimate partner. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). After taking part in the AAI programme, the children showed a reduction in internalizing symptoms and in symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. However, no significant changes were observed in externalizing symptoms or in affective and behavioural dysregulation (CBCL-Dysregulation Profile). These results provide preliminary support for the use of the Leaving a Mark programme with children who have been exposed to domestic violence. However, further studies with a larger sample and more rigorous design are required.

AB There is mixed evidence for whether or not co-occurring anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which may be partly due to studies typically using a global measure of anxiety and failing to consider possible sex differences. The present study examined child-reported social anxiety in relation to peer functioning and whether this association differs by sex in 93 children (66% male; ages 8-12) with ADHD. Children, parents, and teachers completed a measure of social acceptance, and teachers also completed measures of asociality, peer exclusion, peer dislike, and peer ignoring. Regression analyses examined the interaction between social anxiety and sex in relation to the peer functioning variables, with age, race, ADHD subtype, and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms included as covariates. Social anxiety was associated with lower parent-reported social acceptance, with no sex differences in the association. However, significant interaction effects were found for child- and teacher-rated social acceptance, as well as peer exclusion and peer ignoring such that social anxiety was associated with less competence, more exclusion, and greater ignoring for girls but not boys. Findings indicate that social anxiety is associated with poorer peer functioning for girls more so than boys with ADHD.

AB Objective: Identifying factors associated with early treatment response is important, because it can help allocate limited resources in psychiatric care more appropriately. This study examined baseline characteristics of participants with early response to exposure-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
   Method: 269 participants with OCD, aged 7-17 years, were enrolled in a 14-weeks CBT program. We identified participants with early response to treatment, (CY-BOCS total score of <= 15), by the seventh session. Results: At week 7, 248 (92.2%) participants were assessed, 38.3% (95% CI 32.4-44.5%, n = 95) were identified as treatment responders. Univariate analyses showed that six baseline characteristics were significantly associated with early treatment response: young age, lower levels of symptom severity, functional impairment, internalizing- and externalizing problems, depressive symptoms, and family accommodation.
   Conclusions: These results suggested that treatment plans for younger children with moderate OCD symptoms and no major comorbid disorder should include briefer and less resource demanding treatment formats than the commonly recommended and applied standard doses of 15 CBT sessions.

AB Childhood anxiety and depression often go undiagnosed. If left untreated these conditions, collectively known as internalizing disorders, are associated with long-term negative outcomes including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This paper presents a new approach for identifying young children with internalizing disorders using a 3-min speech task. We show that machine learning analysis of audio data from the task can be used to identify children with an internalizing disorder with 80 accuracy (54 sensitivity, 93 specificity). The speech features most discriminative of internalizing disorder are analyzed in detail, showing that affected children exhibit especially low-pitch voices, with repeatable speech inflections and content, and high-pitched response to surprising stimuli relative to controls. This new tool is shown to outperform clinical thresholds on parent-reported child symptoms, which identify children with an internalizing disorder with lower accuracy (67-77 versus 80), and similar specificity (85-100 versus 93), and sensitivity (0-58 versus 54) in this sample. These results point toward the future use of this approach for screening children for internalizing disorders so that interventions can be deployed when they have the highest chance for long-term success.

AB Background: There has been mounting Interest in the pathophysiological relation between inflammation and psychopathology. In this paper, we examined associations between internalizing and externalizing psychopathology and inflammation in adolescents with a history of severe psychosocial deprivation and children reared in typical family contexts.
   Method: The Bucharest Early Intervention Project is a longitudinal randomized trial of high-quality foster care as an alternative to institutional care. This report is based on 56 institutionalized children randomized to care as usual, 59 institutionalized children randomized to foster care, and 101 never institutionalized children who were recruited as an in-country comparison sample. Externalizing and internalizing behaviors were reported by parents and teachers at ages 8, 12, and 16. At age 16, C-reactive protein (CRP) was derived from blood spots in a subset of participants (n = 127). Multiple-group latent growth curve models were used to examine externalizing and internalizing trajectories and their associations with CRP.
   Results: Among children assigned to care as usual, higher levels of externalizing behaviors at age 8, as well as smaller decreases in these behaviors from 8 to 16 years predicted higher levels of CRP at age 16. In the same group of children, higher internalizing behaviors at age 8, but not the rate of change in these behaviors, also predicted higher levels of CRP. In contrast, these relations were not observed in the children assigned to foster care and never institutionalized controls.
   Conclusions: Early institutional rearing is associated with a coupling of psychopathology and inflammation, whereas early placement into foster care buffers against these risks. These findings have implications for promoting healthy mental and physical development amongst institutionalized children.

AB Insecure attachment to parents consistently correlates with adolescent depression. However, the order of cause and effect, the impact of confounding, and gender disparities in this relationship remain unresolved. The present study therefore examined the prospective associations between attachment relationships to mothers and fathers and depressive symptoms in a community sample of Spanish children (n=904; 49.4% females) assessed biennially from age 10-16 years, net of all unmeasured time-invariant confounding. Insecure relationships predicted depressive symptoms, and more so among girls, but depressive symptoms also forecasted worsened attachment relationships. At ages 12-14, mother-child attachment proved to be more important for the development of depressive symptoms than father-child attachment. These findings reveal a pattern of reciprocal influence between attachment relationships and depressive symptoms that appears to vary as a function of the parental and child's gender and developmental period. Thus, efforts aimed at strengthening the parent-child attachment relationship-across the transition from middle childhood to adolescence-may prevent or reduce depressive symptoms, especially by targeting mothers and female adolescents.

Using teacher reported EXT, INT, and AC, partial support for the differential perspective was found in that only hot self-regulation was significantly related to EXT, whereas both hot and cool self-regulation was significantly related to AC. Moreover, hot self-regulation indirectly predicted second-grade AC through first-grade EXT, lending some support for the mediating perspective also. The findings contribute to an understanding of how self-regulation is related to academic and behavioral school adjustment.

AB This study examined the impact of residential instability and family structure transitions on the development of internalizing and externalizing problems from age 2 through 10.5. Child's race was examined as a moderator. Caregiver reports of internalizing and externalizing behaviors were obtained on 665 children at ages 5 and 10.5. Early-childhood residential and family structure transitions predicted elevated internalizing and externalizing problems at ages 5 and 10.5, but only for Caucasian children. These findings suggest that residential and family structure instability during early childhood independently contribute to children's later emotional and behavioral development, but vary as a function of the child's race. Community organizations (e.g., Women, Infant, and Children) can connect turbulent families with resources to attenuate effects of residential and family structure instability.

AB Adolescents with gender dysphoria (GD) often face various associated social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties. In such a marginalized group, it is crucial to identify factors that may impact psychological functioning to better accommodate their needs. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of two specific risk factors, poor peer relations and general family functioning, on the development of psychological problems in adolescents with GD, and their possible interaction effect. The Youth Self-Report, a Peer Relations Scale, and a General Family Functioning scale were assessed in a sample of n = 180 clinically referred adolescents (mean age 15.5; 146 transgender boys with a female birth-assigned sex, and 34 transgender girls with a male birth-assigned sex) with a complete GD diagnosis (fulfillment of the DSM 5 criteria A and B) at their initial admission to the Hamburg Gender Identity Service. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between peer relations, family functioning, and psychological functioning outcomes. Adolescents with GD presented significantly higher Internalizing and Total Problem scores compared to the German reference norm. Externalizing problems were above the norm for transgender boys, but within the normal range for transgender girls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, overall, adolescents with an advanced age, a female birth-assigned sex, poorer peer relations, and poorer family functioning showed more behavioral and emotional problems. Consequently, incorporating both the family and social environment in transgender care is of high importance to adequately tend to the needs of adolescents with GD.

AB Background: Early alcohol use is associated with an increased risk for later alcohol dependence, as well as social and mental health problems. In this study, we investigate the risk factors (internalizing and externalizing behaviors) associated with early alcohol consumption over a period of 1 year, and examine whether the association is sex-specific. Methods: U.S. inner-city adolescents (N = 1785, Mean age = 12.11) were assessed and reassessed in the sixth and seventh grades (Mean age = 13.10). Self-reported information was obtained on the lifetime level of alcohol consumption, internalizing (depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress [PTS]), and externalizing behaviors (sensation seeking, conduct problems and affiliation with delinquent peers). Associations between the variables were examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: In an adjusted SEM analysis drinking by the sixth grade was primarily associated with externalizing behaviors, whereas PTS was linked to lower levels of alcohol consumption. In addition, alcohol consumption and greater externalizing behaviors by the sixth grade predicted higher alcohol consumption by the seventh grade, whereas anxiety and African American ethnicity were associated with less alcohol consumption. No sex differences were found in the association between internalizing and externalizing behaviors and drinking. However, in the adjusted SEM analysis female sex predicted higher lifetime consumption by the seventh grade. Conclusion: Sensation seeking behavior, conduct problems and affiliation with delinquent peers should be regarded as risk factors and taken into consideration when planning prevention efforts in order to decrease alcohol use in early adolescence.

AB The study aimed to assess the relationship between bullying victimization and adverse health or psychosocial problems among in-school adolescents from five Southeast Asian countries. The sample consisted of 33,184 school-going children, mean age 14.6 years (SD = 1.7), from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the cross-sectional "Global School-based Student Health Survey" (GSHS) in 2015. Results indicate 18.6% of the students reported infrequent (1-2 days/month) and 12.0% frequent (3-30 days/month) past-month bullying victimization. Among different types of bullying victimization, the most prevalent was psychological (13.5%), followed by other (5.6%), physical (3.6%) and social (1.3%). In adjusted Poisson regression analysis, bullying victimization is associated with tobacco, alcohol and drug use, physically attacked, in physical fight, injury, truancy and poor hand hygiene behaviour, anxiety, loneliness, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, no close friends, sedentary behaviour, underweight and overweight or obesity. This study extends previous findings from mainly high-income countries on the relationship between bullying victimization and a large number of adverse outcomes in adolescents in Southeast Asia.

AB Understanding co-activation patterns of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) during early adolescence may illuminate risk for development of internalizing and externalizing problems. The present study advances empirical work on the topic by examining SAM-HPA co-activation during both the reactivity and recovery phases of the stress response following acute stress exposure. Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls (N = 149) provided cortisol and alpha-amylase via saliva at seven times throughout a 95-min assessment in which they were administered the modified Trier Social Stress Test. Parents reported on adolescents' life stress, pubertal development, medication use, and externalizing problems. Adolescents reported their own internalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regressions tested both direct and interactive effects of SAM and HPA reactivity and recovery on internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from these analyses showed that whereas SAM and HPA reactivity interacted to predict internalizing symptoms, it was their interaction during the recovery phase that predicted externalizing. Concurrent high SAM and HPA reactivity scores predicted high levels of internalizing and concurrently low SAM and HPA recovery scores predicted high levels of externalizing. Implications of the findings for further study and clinical application are discussed.

AB Objective: Parenting and parent-child relationships change dramatically during development. One unique feature of developmental changes in parenting-lability-is associated with adolescent problem behaviors, above and beyond the general level and developmental trends of parenting. This study investigated lability in parental warmth in childhood, its associations with early adolescent adjustment, as well as antecedents in kindergarten: socioeconomic status (SES), parental depressive symptoms, and child problem behaviors. Method: Using longitudinal data from a large and racially diverse sample (N = 710, 46% urban Black, 58% male), parents reported their warmth annually from kindergarten to grade 5, as well as child externalizing and internalizing problems in grade 7. Teachers rated child social competence in grade 6. Results: Lability accounted for the majority of the variance in the year-to-year changes in parental warmth. Greater lability was associated with more internalizing problems and lower social competence. There was little evidence of the influence of child problem behaviors and parental depressive symptoms on lability. However, parents from lower-SES families showed greater lability in their warmth. Furthermore, lability partly explained the effects of SES on social competence in boys but not in girls, whereas the indirect effects of SES on internalizing problems through lability were significant in girls but not in boys. Conclusions: The findings highlight lability in parental warmth as a unique feature of the developmental changes in parenting in childhood, with linkages to adjustment in early adolescence. Family-based interventions should emphasize consistent parenting and provide stress management and coping skills for parents in order to reduce lability.

AB The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) bridges a significant gap in psychiatric nosology by providing trait-based characterizations of psychopathy along with antisocial personality disorder within the Section III alternative model for personality disorders (AMPD). However, the representation of psychopathy in the AMPD has met with some criticisms (Crego & Widiger, 2014; Few, Lynam, Maples, MacKillop, & Miller, 2015). The current study was undertaken to establish an improved means for characterizing psychopathy in DSM-5 Section III terms, by creating scale measures of triarchic psychopathy dimensions using items from the best-established assessment instrument for the AMPD, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5). Using data from a sample of community adults (N = 210), we employed a construct rating and psychometric refinement approach to develop item-based PID-5 Triarchic scales for measuring psychopathy dimensions of boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. The validity of the PID-5 Triarchic scales was then evaluated in relation to criteria including other scale measures of the triarchic constructs and psychopathy, self-reported antisocial behavior and substance use, empathy, internalizing and other clinical problems, and personality within the development sample and a separate independent sample of adults (N = 240) recruited to have elevated psychopathic traits. Results of this work provide a foundation for improved characterization of psychopathy in terms of the AMPD trait system and provide a mechanism for future research oriented toward clarifying the developmental interface between childhood conduct disorder and psychopathy, as well as identifying neurobiological correlates of dimensions of psychopathy.

AB This study reaffirms our previous work documenting a higher number of Emergency Department (ED) visits by adolescent females with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as compared to adolescent males with ASD, as well as significantly more ED visits by older adolescents than younger adolescents with ASD. Combined externalizing and internalizing psychiatric co-morbidities as well as internalizing conditions alone predict a higher number of ED visits in this study. Illness severity as demonstrated by patterns of visits to primary care physicians and psychiatric referrals prior to ED visits and the prescription of two or more classes of psychotropic medications also predict higher number of ED visits. Finally, as expected, previous ED visits predict future ED visits. The identification of these factors may prove helpful in determining adequacy of current supports and resources for teens with ASD navigating the challenges of adolescence.

AB This report examines the relationship between treatment response in children with ASD and parents' affective symptomatology. This study examined 29 children with ASD in a manualized group psychotherapy program, Resilience Builder Program (R) (RBP), where emotional and social functioning of parent and child were measured through pre- and post-treatment questionnaires. Greater parental symptomatology was associated with children's reduced response to RBP in resilience-based emotion regulation skills. Greater parental interpersonal sensitivity (beta = - .27, p = .024) predicted worse post-treatment scores in child communication skills, greater parental anxious symptoms (beta = - .45, p = .005) predicted worse post-treatment scores in child emotional control, and greater parental depressive (beta = .27, p = .041) and anxious symptoms (beta = .36, p = .004) predicted worse post-treatment scores in child internalizing problems.

AB Adverse childhood experiences have been associated with more negative coupling between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala, a brain network involved in emotion regulation in both children and adults. This pattern may be particularly likely to emerge in individuals exposed to threatening experiences during childhood (e.g., exposure to child abuse), although this has not been examined in prior research. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data on 57 adolescents during an emotion regulation task. Greater negative functional connectivity between vmPFC and amygdala occurred during viewing of negative compared to neutral images. This vmPFC-amygdala task-related functional connectivity was more negative in adolescents exposed to physical, sexual, or emotional abuse than those without a history of maltreatment and was associated with abuse severity. This pattern of more negative functional connectivity was associated with higher levels of externalizing psychopathology concurrently and 2 years later. Greater negative connectivity in the vmPFC-amygdala network during passive viewing of negative images may reflect disengagement of regulatory responses from vmPFC in situations eliciting strong amygdala reactivity, potentially due to stronger appraisals of threat in children exposed to early threatening environments. This pattern may be adaptive in the short term but place adolescents at higher risk of psychopathology later in life.

AB The quality of early caregiving may partially shape brain structure and circuits involved in regulating emotions, including the frontal cortex, affecting vulnerability to the development of psychopathology and maladaptation. Given the profound impact of child maltreatment (CM) on psychological and neural development, we tested whether CM alters the pathways linking mother-adolescent relationship, frontal cortex, and adult outcomes. We used structural equation modeling to investigate whether CM history affected the association between mother-child relationship quality during early adolescence, frontal lobe volume in adulthood, and adult internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and competence. Participants from a longitudinal high-risk, low-income sample included 48 adults with a history of CM and 40 adults without such history (M = 30.0 years). Results showed that greater frontal lobe volume predicted higher levels of adult adaptive functioning and fewer adult internalizing symptoms but showed no relation to adult externalizing symptoms. Frontal lobe volume significantly mediated the effect of adolescent maternal relationship quality on both adult internalizing symptoms and adult adaptive functioning, but only for individuals with no maltreatment history. Given the observed relationship between frontal lobe volume and healthy adult functioning across the full sample, it will be important to identify protective factors in maltreated individuals that foster frontal lobe development.

AB Children's peer beliefs have been shown to mediate the link between stress experienced within the peer group and later internalizing symptoms. This study extends this research by examining bidirectional associations between children's peer beliefs, friendlessness, and perceived friendship quality (i.e., receiving provision, negative treatment) and identifying indirect pathways to internalizing symptoms. Participants (N = 366; M-age = 9.34 years, SD = .07; 196 girls) reported on their peer beliefs, classroom friendships, friendship quality, and internalizing symptoms at 3 time points across 1 calendar year. Receiving provision from friends predicted less negative peer beliefs. Negative peer beliefs predicted less received provisions from friends and higher levels of negative treatment, and, in turn, negative treatment from friends predicted higher levels of internalizing symptoms. These findings provide novel insights into how perceptions of the peer group relate to dyad-level relationship processes, including the potential contribution of peer beliefs to children's peer adjustment.

AB Categorizing and quantifying exposure to trauma and childhood adversities (CAs) presents a significant measurement and analytic challenge. The current study examined the co-occurrence of trauma and CA types using network analyses, an alternative to traditional measurement models. The Trauma History Profile, assessing lifetime exposure to 20 different trauma and CA types, was administered to 618 treatment-seeking children and youth ages 4 to 18 years (52.8% female). The generalized similarity model (Kovacs. 2010) was used to construct a network of trauma/CA types to visualize relationships and detect cohesive groups. Four clusters of trauma/CA types emerged: overt forms occurring at the individual level (e.g., physical, sexual, and psychological maltreatment), environmental forms at the family level (e.g., neglect, impaired caregiving), environmental forms occurring at the community level (e.g., community and school violence), and acute forms (e.g., loss, medical trauma). Age of onset data indicated that neglect and psychological maltreatment were mast predictive of later occurrences of other trauma and CAs. Structural equation modeling indicated that trauma/CA clusters displayed specific associations with posttraumatic stress, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Results demonstrate the potential utility of network analysis to understand the co-occurrence and temporal ordering of multiple types of trauma and CAs.

AB The present study investigated bidirectional relations between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms, with a focus on three forms of victimization (physical, verbal, relational) and two types of internalizing symptoms (depressive, anxious). In the fall and spring, children (N = 1,264-1,402 fourth and fifth graders depending on time point and data source) reported on their victimization, and teachers reported on children's depressive and anxious symptoms. In a model including the broad constructs of victimization and internalizing symptoms, bidirectional relations emerged, with earlier victimization predicting increases in later internalizing symptoms and earlier internalizing symptoms predicting increases in later victimization. These bidirectional relations did not hold in two additional models, the first of which included the three forms of victimization and internalizing symptoms and the second of which included victimization and the two types of internalizing symptoms. Rather, results of the first model suggested that earlier internalizing symptoms predicted later physical, verbal, and relational (marginal) victimization, and the second model did not fit the data well. Findings are discussed in terms of implications of bidirectional relations between victimization and internalizing symptoms.

AB Previous studies of the relationship between temperament and psychopathology have been limited by focusing on main effects of temperament on psychopathology, reliance solely on maternal reports of child temperament, and predominately using cross-sectional designs. This study extended this work by focusing on interactions between reactive (positive emotionality/PE; negative emotionality/NE) and regulatory (effortful control) dimensions of temperament, using laboratory observations of temperament, and focusing on longitudinal prediction of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. 536 children (46.1% Female, 92.4% White) were followed in a prospective, longitudinal study of the relationship between temperament and psychopathology. Temperament was assessed using laboratory observations when children were at age 3. Mothers and fathers reported on internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their children at ages 3, 6, and 9. Multilevel modeling analyses examined associations between the interaction of temperament traits and patterns of change in internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Interactions between reactive PE traits (Sociability, Exuberance), but not NE traits (Dysphoria, Fear), and regulatory temperament (Disinhibition) were associated with the slope of maternal-reported internalizing and paternal-reported externalizing symptoms such that youth low in PE traits and high in effortful control experienced a greater decline in symptoms over time. In conclusion, among children with lower levels of PE traits, strong regulatory abilities are associated with greater reductions in internalizing and externalizing symptoms over time. These models highlight the complex interaction between reactive and regulatory temperament and expand current understanding of temperamental risk for psychopathology.

AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), or self-harming behavior without intent to die (Nock Current Directions in Psychological Science, 18, 78-83, 2009), is associated with distress and impairment across domains, including increased risk for suicidality (Kiekens et al. Journal of Affective Disorders, 239, 171-179, 2018). In adolescence, prevalence of NSSI is high (Swannell et al. Suicide and Life-threatening Behavior, 44, 273-303, 2014), and peer influence regarding NSSI is thought to be strong (Brechwald and Prinstein Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21, 166-79, 2011). Although concern regarding "clusters" of NSSI has long been documented, peer socialization of NSSI in adolescence is understudied. This paper tests peer influence on NSSI frequency within adolescent friendship dyads. Emotion regulation difficulties and friendship quality were evaluated as factors that may influence susceptibility to peer influence effects. Adolescents (N = 196, M age = 15.68, 69.9% female, 87.6% White) nested within 93 friendship dyads reported on their own NSSI frequency, difficulties in emotion regulation, and friendship quality at three time points spaced 3 months apart. Cross-lagged Actor-Partner Interdependence Models examined peer influence effects over time. Friends' Time 1 frequency of NSSI uniquely predicted adolescents' own NSSI frequency over 3 and 6 months, controlling for initial similarity among friends as well as individual risk factors for NSSI. Peer influence effects were strongest in adolescents with higher levels of emotion regulation difficulty but did not vary as a function of friendship quality. Friends' NSSI frequency is a significant and unique predictor of increases in adolescents' own NSSI frequency over time. Implications for interventions that leverage the important developmental context of peer relationships are discussed.

AB Psychiatric comorbidities are prevalent in youth eating disorders. In a sample of 1,906 youth from the United States (49.2% female), followed from elementary school into high school, we found support for a model to help explain this comorbidity. Endorsement of binge eating in fifth grade (elementary school) predicted increases in negative urgency, negative affect, and lack of planning in seventh grade (middle school). In turn, seventh grade negative urgency predicted increases in 10th grade (high school) externalizing dysfunction (binge eating, alcohol use problems, and smoking) and internalizing dysfunction (depressive symptoms). Seventh grade negative affect predicted increases in 10th grade binge eating and depressive symptoms. Seventh grade lack of planning predicted increases only in 10th grade externalizing behaviours. Early engagement in binge eating may elevate risk for multiple forms of dysfunction, at least in part due to its prediction of high-risk personality change in middle school.

ID PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT; STRESS GENERATION; ADOLESCENCE; DEPRESSION; TIME;

AB Purpose: Earlier ages at menarche are associated with elevations in internalizing and externalizing that persist into adulthood. The present study examines whether early pubertal timing precipitates experiences during adolescence that account for long-term elevations in depressive symptoms and antisocial behavior among early maturing girls.
   Methods: Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health (Add Health), the study examines significant postmenarcheal life events that might mediate associations of age at menarche with depressive symptoms and antisocial behavior in adulthood: teenage criminal arrest, teenage pregnancy and childbearing, high school dropout, and different forms of postpubertal physical and sexual traumatic assault.
   Results: Results indicate that earlier menarche was associated with greater likelihood of postmenarcheal discontinued education, physical and sexual assault, and teenage pregnancy and childbearing. Discontinued education, physical assault, and sexual assault mediated associations of pubertal timing with adult depressive symptoms; sexual assault mediated associations of pubertal timing with adult antisocial behavior.
   Conclusions: Earlier menarche seems to precipitate postpubertal stressful events that, in turn, account for higher rates of psychological problems in adulthood. These results suggest that the adolescent experiences of early maturing girls channel them into life paths where stress, adversity, and other risks to psychological well-being are more likely to be a continuing facet of daily life.

AB Despite school-based services, adolescents with maladaptive behavior experience negative outcomes, highlighting the need for insight into factors that contribute to and escalate behavior problems during middle school-a high-risk period. We examined how perceived school stress, stress regulation (engagement/disengagement coping, involuntary responses), and executive function of 79 middle schoolers with and without significant behavior problems were related to internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Results showed students with significant behavior problems (a) had lower executive function abilities and higher peer stress, (b) used less engagement coping, and (c) reported more maladaptive behaviors than typical peers. For all students, school-based stress positively predicted behavior problems and use of stress regulation techniques, with group moderating effects. Involuntary responses to stress positively predicted maladaptive behaviors, whereas engagement/disengagement coping predicted internalizing behaviors only. As a mediator, engagement coping decreased the relationship between perceived stress and behavior problems. Based on these findings, we highlight important prevention and intervention areas.

AB We investigated, using a cross-lagged design, the longitudinal association of bullying involvement and peer problems with affective decision-making in adolescence (ages 11 and 14 years) in 13,888 participants of the Millennium Cohort Study. Affective decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the Cambridge Gambling Task, bullying involvement (bully, bully-victim, victim, or 'neutral' status) with self-report measures, and peer problems with the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. In general, peer problems were associated with decision-making in the unadjusted model but not after controlling for confounding. However, bullying involvement was related to decision-making even after adjustment. Compared to 'neutral' males, bullies and bully-victims improved over time in risk adjustment, and bully-victims in deliberation time, too. In both sexes, bullies showed more risk-taking compared to their 'neutral' counterparts. It seems that bullies are more sensitive to reward (or less sensitive to punishment) than those not involved in bullying. The finding that male bullies show improvement in decision-making warrants further research. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject?
   In adults, decision-making deficits and social exclusion or rejection are linked In youth, only two studies have explored this link with gambling tasks measuring real-world difficulties in decision-making. Both studies were cross-sectional and small-scale. What does this study add?
   We explore this link in adolescence, using a large, general population longitudinal sample and the Cambridge Gambling Task. Bullies were more sensitive to reward (or less sensitive to punishment) than those not involved in bullying. Male bullies improved over time in risk adjustment, a finding that warrants further research.

AB Objectives Sensitive parenting requires modulation of emotions in order to effectively organize and orient behavioral responses. There is considerable evidence that psychological distress can impair sensitive parenting practices, and also that psychological distress is associated with deficits in emotion regulation capacities. The negative effect that psychological distress has on parents' emotion regulation capacities may be a mechanistic pathway through which psychological distress impacts parenting, as dysregulated emotions may be more proximal to parenting behaviors than distress itself; however, this specific link between psychological distress, emotion regulation, and parenting is not often examined in parenting models. Methods The current study tested these relations in a high sociodemographic risk community-sample, oversampled for violence exposure, of caregivers of preschoolers. Caregivers self-reported on their psychological distress and emotion regulation difficulties. Parent sensitivity was assessed via observations of parent-child interactions. Results Results indicated that difficulties in emotion regulation were a mediator for the relation between parents' psychological distress and sensitive parenting behaviors. Difficulties in emotion regulation predicted decreased sensitivity above and beyond the effect of psychological distress. Conclusions These findings emphasize the importance of regulation of emotional reactions in order to orient and engage in sensitive parenting behaviors. Additionally, they suggest clinically that supporting parents' emotion regulation capacities specifically may promote more sensitive parenting in contexts of parental psychological distress.

   CHILDREN; SYMPTOMS; DIMENSIONS
AB Objectives The associations between coping, emotion regulation, and child psychopathology have been the subject of extensive research. Many studies have focused on voluntary processes of emotion regulation. In addition to controlled regulatory processes, children's involuntary, automatic processes based in individual differences in temperament may also impact emotion regulation and children's psychological adjustment. The current study examined the relations of emotion regulation and temperament to children's symptoms of anxiety and depression in middle childhood. Methods Study participants included 126 children (50% Male, 68.0% Caucasian; M = 9.60 years, SD = 0.52) recruited from a suburban school district. Participants completed self-report measures of emotion regulation, trait affect, and anxiety and depression severity. Results Results showed that children reported using active self-regulatory strategies more than any other form of emotion regulation in response to anger, worry, fear, and sadness. Significant relationships were found between negative affect and poor emotion regulation or "dysregulation" (r = 0.25, p < 0.01) as well as positive affect and dysregulation (r = -0.22, p < 0.05). Furthermore, emotion dysregulation moderated the relation between trait negative affect and depression ( increment R-2 = 0.01, F(1117) = 4.78, p < 0.05). Conclusions This study provides further support for the well-established relations between temperament and internalizing disorders in children. It suggests that children in this age group tend to use active strategies to regulate to negative emotions. Additionally, it shows that children high in trait negative affect and emotion dysregulation may be at increased the risk for depression.

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to examine if the longitudinal associations between father-adolescent conflict and both externalizing and internalizing symptoms in youth were moderated by fathers' residential status (i.e., whether or not he lived in the home) and type of residential father (i.e., biological or step). Methods Adolescents (N = 146) completed a measure about conflict with their father or stepfather in 8th and 9th grade. At the same time points, mothers completed measures about the youths' externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Results The association between 8th grade conflict and 9th grade externalizing symptoms was moderated by fathers' residential status. Conflict with fathers in 8th grade was positively associated with 9th grade externalizing symptoms when youths resided with their father (biological and stepfathers were included); in contrast, higher levels of father-adolescent conflict were associated with lower levels of subsequent externalizing symptoms when fathers did not live with the youth. Externalizing symptoms in 8th grade did not significantly predict father-adolescent conflict in grade 9. Regarding internalizing symptoms, the association between father-adolescent conflict in 8th grade and internalizing symptoms in 9th grade was moderated by father's residential status; conflict predicted higher levels of internalizing symptoms when the biological father lived elsewhere. Higher levels of 8th grade internalizing symptoms also significantly predicted greater conflict between adolescents and their fathers in 9th grade for residential fathers only. Conclusions The associations among adolescent emotional and behavioral outcomes and paternal-child relationship qualities vary with symptom type and family structures and, thus, warrant further comprehensive study.

AB This quasi-experimental study compared children who were (or were not) exposed to a 28-week program designed to prevent aggressive behavior by teaching pro-social skills and social knowledge. Children in the experimental group increased significantly in teacher-ratings of cooperation, assertion, self-control, and total social skills, as well as in social knowledge as measured through an interview procedure. Children in the comparison group showed no significant improvements. Neither group showed changes in teacher ratings of externalizing or internalizing problem behaviors. Preliminary analyses suggest that the experimental group also showed reduction in observed aggressive behavior, while the comparison group did not. Changes within the experimental group differed according to whether the teacher had initially identified a child as high or as low in social competence. High competence children showed significant increase in cooperation and in total social skills, while low competence children showed significant increase in cooperation, assertion, total social skills, and social knowledge. The sample size for this study was small (37 subjects), and should be replicated with a larger sample. Results do, however add quasi-experimental support for the effectiveness of the program, and suggest that changes are due to the program, rather than to maturation.

AB Objective: We evaluated whether initiating the Family Check-Up (FCU) during early childhood prevented a severe form of psychopathology in adolescence-co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems-and whether effects operated indirectly through early childhood maternal depression and parents' positive behavior support. Method: Participants were drawn from a randomized controlled trial of the FCU (50.2% FCU; 49.5% girls; 46.6% Caucasian, and 27.6% Black; 13.4% Hispanic/Latino). At Ages 2 and 3, mothers self-reported depression, and primary caregivers' (PCs') positive behavior support was coded by trained observers. PCs, alternate caregivers (ACs), and teachers reported on 14-year-olds' problem behaviors. Latent profile analyses (LPAs) identified problem behavior groups for each reporter. which were outcomes in multinomial logistic regressions (PC, n = 672; AC, n = 652; teacher, n = 667). Results: LPAs identified a low-problem, internalizing-only, externalizing-only, and co-occurringproblem group for each reporter. For PC- and AC-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, externalizingonly (p < .05), and internalizing-only (p < .05 for PC, p < 0.10 for AC) groups; these effects operated through maternal depression (p < .05). For teacher-reported outcomes, the FCU predicted a lower likelihood that adolescents belonged to the co-occurring group relative to the low-problem, internalizingonly, and externalizing-only (p < 0.05) groups; effects operated through positive behavior support (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Early delivery of the FCU indirectly prevented adolescents' co-occurring internalizing/externalizing problems in both home and school contexts by improving the quality of the early home environment.

AB Victimization in early adolescence can have severe negative consequences later in life. Friendships are especially important in this time period. The present study investigated friendship selection and influence (contagion) processes with regard to victimization, as well as prosocial and aggressive characteristics of victims' friends. Using social network analyses (RSiena), we longitudinally analyzed data of five fourth-grade classrooms, including 185 students (56.8% girls; X over bar age at Time 1 = 10 years old). Results showed that early adolescents who experience peer victimization were not likely to select peers with similar levels of victimization as friends but selected prosocial peers as friends. Moreover, friends did not become more similar over time in their victimization levels. Prosocial students selected similar peers as friends. The discussion highlights the relevance of fostering positive peer relations for targeting victimization and discusses the defending role of friends in victimization situations.

AB Emotion dysregulation is considered as one of the factors related to suicide in individuals with childhood trauma (CT). However, no research has been performed on the role of emotion dysregulation in the relationship between perception of CT and suicidal ideation in individuals who use heroin. This study aimed to evaluate direct and indirect relationships between perception of CT and suicidal ideation through emotion regulation difficulties (ERD) and cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERSs) in males with a DSM diagnosis of heroin dependence. In a cross-sectional design, 310 males with a DSM diagnosis of heroin dependence completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short version (CERQ-Short), the Obsessive-Compulsive Drug Use Scale-Form Heroin (OCDUS-Form Heroin), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). The results revealed that perception of CT had no direct relation to suicidal ideation. Perception of CT was indirectly associated with suicidal ideation through some ERD dimensions [e.g., non-acceptance of emotional responses (Non-acceptance), limited access to emotion regulation strategies (Strategies), lack of emotional awareness (Awareness)] and the CERS of positive reappraisal. The findings suggest that high suicidal ideation may stem from a perception of CT and subsequently emotion dysregulation in individuals who use heroin. Also, the findings of this research may have implications for the prevention and treatment of suicidal ideation in individuals using heroin with a perception of CT. The results of the present study require further examination through longitudinal studies.

AB Background: The severity and treatment of depression/anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum has important implications for maternal and child well-being. Yet, little is known about prenatal SSRI use and early child socioemotional development. This study explores effects of prenatal SSRI exposure, and pre- and postnatal internalizing symptoms on trajectories of infant temperament, identifying potential differences for boys and girls.
   Methods: Using latent growth models, sex differences in infant temperament trajectories from 3- to 10-months were examined in relation to prenatal and postpartum internalizing symptoms and prenatal SSRI exposure among 185 mother-infant dyads.
   Results: For girls, prenatal internalizing symptoms were associated with greater initial distress to limitations, and lower duration of orienting, smiling/laughter, and soothability. Postnatal symptoms predicted slower decreases in girls' duration of orienting. SSRI exposure predicted decreases in distress to limitations and slower increases in smiling and laughter. For boys, maternal internalizing symptoms did not generally affect temperament profiles. SSRI exposure was associated with higher initial activity level and slower declines in distress to limitations.
   Limitations: Only parent-report indicators of infant temperament across 10 months of infancy were provided. Maternal internalizing symptoms were measured at discrete times during pregnancy and postpartum, with no analysis of changes in symptoms across time.
   Conclusions: Prenatal SSRI treatment, and both prenatal and postpartum internalizing symptoms, exert unique effects on infant temperament. Overall, the present study suggests sex-dependent fetal programming effects that should be further evaluated in future research. Results have implications for perinatal mental health treatment and perceived impacts on child socioemotional development.

AB Shame plays a central role in social and self-development, particularly throughout childhood and adolescence. Nonetheless, shame can also be harmful if it involves unbearable and persistent feelings of being inferior, inadequate, and worthless. Gender differences in endorsing either internalizing/externalizing symptoms may reflect different ways of coping with shame rather than differences in the experience of shame per se. Using a community adolescent sample (n = 368; 65.8% female), this study investigated the role of external shame and shame coping strategies in the endorsement of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, looking at the moderator role of gender. Although gender differences were found in the endorsement of shame coping strategies and psychological symptoms, results indicated that gender had no impact on the pathways linking external shame and shame coping strategies to psychological symptoms. By clarifying the routes linking external shame to psychological symptoms, current findings may contribute to better define appropriate interventions for adolescents.

AB Guided by the social-ecological diathesis-stress model, this longitudinal study examined the roles of self-esteem, parental attachment, and gender on the association between peer victimization and problem behaviors among Chinese early adolescents. A total of 466 Chinese middle school students (M-age = 12.8 years) completed measures of peer victimization, self-esteem, and paternal and maternal attachment twice (T1 and T2; 6-month interval). Their guardians also completed ratings on adolescents' problem behaviors at both T1 and T2. Results indicated that self-esteem mediated the association between peer victimization and problem behaviors. Paternal attachment, but not maternal attachment, moderated the mediating effect of self-esteem. Moreover, the moderating effect of maternal attachment on the association between peer victimization and self-esteem varied depending on adolescents' gender.

AB Over the last few years, the protective role of parental monitoring on adolescent adjustment (i.e., active parental efforts aimed at setting limits and tracking adolescents' activities and whereabouts) has been challenged. Recent research has shifted attention to the conditions under which monitoring may be more or less effective. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, this study investigated the role of parents' autonomy-supportive and psychologically controlling parenting in effects of parental monitoring on adolescents' adjustment. It also considered the role of adolescents' clinical status (i.e., clinically referred vs non-referred). Adopting a person-centered approach, we aimed to identify naturally occurring profiles of monitoring, autonomy-support, and psychological control and to examine differences between these profiles in terms of life satisfaction, positive affect, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants included 218 referred (M-age = 14.44, 56% girls) and 218 matched adolescents from a larger sample of 1056 community (Mage = 14.83, 52.9% girls). Multigroup Latent Profile Analyses revealed five parenting profiles which were structurally equivalent in both samples: high monitoring with either high autonomy support or high psychological control, low monitoring with either high autonomy-support or high psychological control, and an average profile. Referred youth were significantly more present in the average profile and in the profiles characterized by high levels of psychological control. As hypothesized, profiles showed a differential association with adolescents' self-reported adjustment, with the high monitoring-high autonomy support profile yielding the most optimal and the low monitoring-high psychological control profile yielding the worst outcomes. Associations between profiles and outcomes were similar for referred and non-referred adolescents. These findings highlight the importance of considering the parenting climate (i.e., autonomy-supportive versus psychologically controlling) to understand effects of parental monitoring during adolescence.

AB Purpose: Psychosocial syndemic indicators (e.g., internalizing symptoms, alcohol/substance use, and violence exposure) have been associated with increased risk for HIV among older adolescent sexual minority males and adult sexual minority men. No studies have examined these concerns among early adolescents (<16 years old). The purpose of this study was to examine syndemic indicators among early adolescent sexual minority males and their associations with sexual behavior. Methods: Sexual minority males (N = 207; ages 14-17; drawn from 40 U.S. states) completed a cross-sectional online survey. Descriptive statistics were used to document profiles of syndemic indicators. Firth logistic regressions tested the associations between count of syndemic indicators and sexual behavior with male and female partners. Results: Psychosocial syndemic indicators were highly prevalent and co-occurring, with diverse psychosocial profiles. After controlling for age, race, and ethnicity, having more syndemic indicators was significantly positively associated with condomless anal sex with male partners (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.84) and vaginal and/or anal sex with females (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.47). Conclusions: This study documents the psychosocial profiles of syndemic indicators with a sample of early adolescent sexual minority males and the association of syndemic indicators with sexual behavior. Among early adolescent sexual minority males, psychosocial concerns were prevalent, similar to rates seen among adult sexual minority males, and conferred vulnerability to HIV transmission. Behavioral and psychosocial interventions must reach sexual minority males in early adolescence to address mental health and substance use concerns and to help reduce the risk of HIV acquisition.

AB Objectives Depression and anxiety are leading causes of youth disability worldwide, yet our understanding of these conditions in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) youths is limited. Research has been sparse in SSA, and prevalence rates and correlates of these conditions remain scarcely investigated. To help address these gaps, this cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence of adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms in a community sample of high school students in Kenya. We also examined associations between those symptoms and psychosocial and sociodemographic factors. Methods We administered self-report measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, social support, gratitude, growth mindsets, and life satisfaction to 658 students (51.37% female) aged 13-19. Results Only the measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screen-7), and social support (Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support Scale) showed adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha > 0.70) in the study sample. Findings with these measures among Kenyan youths showed high levels of depression symptoms (45.90% above clinical cutoff) and anxiety symptoms (37.99% above clinical cutoff). Older adolescents reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as lower social support than younger adolescents. Females reported more anxiety than males, and members of minority tribes reported more anxiety than members of majority tribes. Conclusions This study highlights the high prevalence of adolescent internalizing symptoms in Kenyan high school students, identifies important correlates of these symptoms, and illustrates the need for culturally appropriate assessment tools.

AB Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by disruptions in sleep and changes in circadian preferences. Although adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at even higher risk of sleep disruption than their peers, no study has examined whether circadian preference is associated with sleep problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents with ADHD. This study provides an initial test of the hypothesis that greater evening preference would be associated with more sleep problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. Participants were 80 adolescents (69% male), aged 13-17 years, with ADHD. Adolescents completed measures assessing circadian preference, pubertal development, anxiety/depressive symptoms and weeknight sleep duration. Both adolescents and parents completed measures of sleep problems and daytime sleepiness. In regression analyses controlling for a number of other variables (i.e., age, sex, pubertal development, ADHD medication use, and ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder and internalizing symptom severity), greater evening preference was associated with both adolescent- and parent-reported sleep problems and daytime sleepiness. Greater evening preference remained significantly associated with each of these sleep problems and daytime sleepiness when also controlling for weeknight sleep duration. This is the first study to demonstrate that evening circadian preference is associated with both sleep problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents with ADHD. The results indicate that it is important to consider circadian function as research examining sleep in adolescents with ADHD continues to advance.

AB Objectives Dropout from children's mental health services has negative impacts on children, families and mental health agencies. Correctly defining individuals as treatment dropouts may help efforts to reduce dropout. The development of a novel definition of dropout is described, which suggested the optimal number of sessions required should vary based on a client's need at intake. Dropout was defined as receiving lower than the optimal number of sessions. The novel definition was compared to existing definitions in a secondary data analysis of individual's first and second episodes of care. Methods The sample contained children (N = 650; 61% male) aged 5-13 who attended one of five studied mental health agencies in Ontario, CA. Discriminant function analysis was used to predict individuals who met: (a) all current dropout definitions and the need-based definition, (b) any one or two definitions of dropout, or (c) no definitions of dropout. Results In the first and second episodes of care respectively, the prevalence of dropout was 63.5 and 69.7% using the need-based definition, 93.5 and 76.5% using the dose definition, and 53.3 and 84.4% using the clinician judgment definition. In the first episode of care, higher child internalizing and externalizing problems and greater caregiver needs differentiated dropouts from treatment completers using the need-based definition. Further, families with higher child problem severity and higher caregiver needs were more likely to be categorized as a dropout by all definitions. Conclusions A need-based definition is a valuable method for categorizing treatment dropouts and mitigates disadvantages of existing definitions of dropout.

AB Although behavioral problems have been observed in children and adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV infection (PHIV), behavioral information regarding younger PHIV children are scarce. This study aims to identify behavioral problems in PHIV and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children and to evaluate factors associated with such problems. A prospective study of PHIV and HEU young children was conducted. Behavioral problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at baseline and 12 months later among children aged 18?60 months old. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Parenting Styles & Dimensions Questionnaire identified primary caregivers? symptoms of depression and parenting styles, respectively, at both visits. Chi-squared analyses were used to compare the prevalence of behavioral problems between groups. Factors associated with behavioral problems were analyzed by logistic regression. From 2016 to 2017, 121 children (41 PHIV and 80 HEU) were assessed with no significant differences in prevalence of Total, Internalizing, Externalizing, and Syndrome scales problems between PHIV and HEU at both visits (p?>?0.5). Primary caregivers? depression and lower education in addition to authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were significantly related to child behavioral problems. Family-centered care for families affected by HIV, including positive parenting promotion, mental health care, and education are warranted.

AB Background Epidemiological studies, describing both community and clinical samples of youth in need for psychiatric help, are rare in the middle east. To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims to investigate the demographic and clinical characteristics of a sample of children suffering from emotional and behavioral problems seeking psychiatric services in the Nile Delta region and the largest clinical sample to date in Egypt. Methods The files of all new cases who presented for care in the outpatient service for children and adolescents between August 2016 and July 2018 were reviewed. Ninety-six files were excluded due to missing data while another 18 files were found to be for adults (ages > 18 years old), so the sample included 886 cases. Results The ages of our sample (n = 886) ranged from 18 months to 18 years with an average of 7.5 (+/- 3.8) years. Most of our cases were male, school aged children, living within low-income households and predominantly coming from rural areas. The most common diagnoses were attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (22.6%), intellectual disability (ID) (13.7%), depressive disorders (13.3%), and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) (12.3%). Strong protective effects were found for family integrity and stability. Corporal punishment and physical and sexual abuse were noted to be significant risk factors for internalizing and externalizing disorders in children and adolescents. Conclusions Except for males being a majority in our sample of children seeking psychiatric consultation, demographic patterns and prevalence of psychiatric disorders are comparable to other tertiary clinical samples in other parts of the world.

AB Distress tolerance (DT) is an individual's ability to handle uncomfortable emotion states or sensations (Simons and Gaher in Motiv Emot 29(2): 83-102, 2005). DT is associated with heightened risk for psychopathology, including internalizing symptoms. However, little research has examined the feasibility of assessing DT via youth self-report. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the psychometric properties of the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) (Simons and Gaher in Motiv Emot 29(2): 83-102, 2005) in community (n = 117; ages 10-19; 56.4% female) and clinical samples (n = 165; ages 10-18, 52.7% female) of youth. Predictors of DT and its association with internalizing symptoms were investigated. The majority of fit indices confirmed a four-factor hierarchical structure for the clinical sample data. Females reported lower DT than males and DT was associated with internalizing symptoms. Validation of the factor structure of the DTS allows for investigation of child and adolescent-reported perceptions of DT as a risk factor for psychopathology in youth.

AB Objectives Children and adolescents, and their parents, often provide divergent assessments with regard to children's and adolescents' mental health. This paper addresses influential factors regarding discrepancies between mothers' and children's/adolescents' reports on externalizing and internalizing problem behavior. The focus is on maternal characteristics (maternal depression, maternal parenting stress, and maternal perception of the relationship to their child) that may contribute to the emergence of discrepancies. Methods An empirical study with 1601 children and adolescents between the ages of 10 to 16 years, and 1119 mothers, was conducted addressing temporal relationships between maternal characteristics and informant discrepancies, with repeated assessments after 6 months. Results Based on polynomial regression, maternal parenting stress and negatively evaluated mother-child relationships proved to be the most important influential variables on the emergence of informant discrepancies. In addition, the results provided evidence for bidirectional influences between informant discrepancies and maternal characteristics (especially maternal depression and negative evaluations of the mother-child relationship). All significant relationships to maternal characteristics were restricted to externalizing behavior. Conclusions Findings suggest that specific maternal characteristics, which might influence maternal interpretations, explain the occurrence of informant discrepancies regarding externalizing problems. Conversely, informant discrepancies regarding externalizing problems predicted maternal characteristics. Accordingly, a reciprocal relationship between informant discrepancies and maternal characteristics seems likely and should be the subject to future research.

AB The meta-analysis presented in this paper was conducted with the aim of clarifying the differences in the research on the relationship between father involvement and problem behaviour among preschool children, and also to analyze the reasons behind these research differences. By applying a literature retrieval and screening strategy, 41 studies were sourced, with a total of 269 independent samples and 22635 participants. The meta-analysis found a low negative correlation between positive father involvement and the externalizing problem behaviour of preschool children, and the same correlation between such involvement and internalizing problem behaviour. Negative father involvement was found to be moderately positively correlated with the latter behaviour. The moderating effects of each variable emerged as different, complex, and interactive. The implications of these findings are that families, kindergartens, communities and the government should work together to guarantee father involvement and improve the quality of the latter.

AB Juvenile onset of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with increased likelihood of recurrent episodes of depression and more detrimental clinical trajectories. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of juvenile onset of MDD on emotion regulation as measured by self-report and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Furthermore, we wanted to assess whether juvenile onset impacted the association between rumination and depressive symptoms. Sixty-four individuals with at least three prior episodes of MDD were recruited and filled out self-report questionnaires measuring rumination and emotion regulation abilities. In addition, electrocardiographic assessments were used to calculate HRV. Based on self-reported age of MDD onset, individuals were divided in two groups: Juvenile onset of MDD (first MDD episode before the age of 18, n = 30) and adult onset of MDD (first MDD episode after the age of 18, n = 34). Results showed that individuals whose first depressive episode occurred in childhood and adolescence reported more rumination and less emotional clarity compared to individuals who had their first episode of MDD in adulthood. Moreover, the tendency to ruminate was strongly associated with depressive symptoms in the juvenile onset of MDD group, whereas no such association was found in the adult onset group. There was no significant group difference for HRV. The findings are discussed in light of existing literature, in addition to suggesting how our findings may inform clinical practice and future research. We conclude that juvenile onset of MDD may lead to difficulties in emotion regulation and that these difficulties may increase depressive symptoms and vulnerability for relapse in this particular subgroup.

AB The current study examined unfolding relations among mothers' mindful parenting, parent-adolescent recurrent conflict, and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems. In a community sample of 117 families (31% black, Asian, American Indian, or Latino), parents and adolescents (52% female; average age = 12.13 years) were followed over 15 months. Parents answered questions about mindful parenting and recurrent conflict, and adolescents reported on their own externalizing and internalizing problems. Path analyses indicated that higher levels of mindful parenting were significantly related to lower levels of recurrent conflict 2-3 months later, controlling for previous levels of recurrent conflict. Moreover, lower levels of recurrent conflict were significantly related to lower levels of externalizing problems and internalizing problems 1 year later, controlling for previous levels of those problems. Subgroup analyses indicated that relations were comparable across subgroups defined by adolescent gender, race, parent marital status, and family financial strain. The effects of mindful parenting were robust even after accounting for other indicators of positive and supportive parenting, namely inductive reasoning and warmth in the parent-adolescent relationship. These findings highlight the potential of mindful parenting to improve family interactions and adolescent adjustment.

AB Several reviews have been conducted on children's outcomes following exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), but there remain inconsistent findings. We conducted a meta-analysis on child emotional and behavioral outcomes of IPV exposure interventions, based on published reviews that included a child component. We also explored relative effect sizes by examining moderators of the effect sizes across studies. This meta-analysis included 21 evaluation studies across 12 published reviews, which were located using a multiple database systematic search of English publications between 2000 and 2019. Studies were required to evaluate IPV interventions that included children, to gather quantitative pre- and post-intervention data on child outcomes, to use standardized instruments, and to present data in a format that could be used in a meta-analysis. Results indicated an overall pre- to post-intervention medium effect size (d = 0.49), with effect sizes ranging from small to large depending on the specific outcome. Improvements at follow-up were maintained for internalizing behaviors but decreased for trauma-related symptoms and social, externalizing, and total behaviors. However, externalizing and total behavior outcomes still had significant effect sizes in the small-to-medium range (d = 0.36 and 0.44). There were greater intervention effects when treatment was not exclusively trauma-specific. It appears that IPV exposure interventions are generally effective for improving children's emotional and behavioral well-being, although interventions would benefit from greater tailoring to children's specific needs. Interventions may also benefit from incorporating various content areas (both trauma-specific and non-trauma-specific) and from greater focus on ensuring the maintenance of treatment gains.

AB Hierarchical dimensional systems of psychopathology promise more informative descriptions for understanding risk and predicting outcome than traditional diagnostic systems, but it is unclear how many major dimensions they should include. We delineated the hierarchy of childhood and adult psychopathology and validated it against clinically relevant measures. Participants were 9987 9- and 10-year-old children and their parents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Factor analyses of items from the Child Behavior Checklist and Adult Self-Report were run to delineate hierarchies of dimensions. We examined the familial aggregation of the psychopathology dimensions, and the ability of different factor solutions to account for risk factors, real-world functioning, cognitive functioning, and physical and mental health service utilization. A hierarchical structure with a general psychopathology ('p') factor at the apex and five specific factors (internalizing, somatoform, detachment, neurodevelopmental, and externalizing) emerged in children. Five similar dimensions emerged also in the parents. Child and parent p-factors correlated highly (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), and smaller but significant correlations emerged for convergent dimensions between parents and children after controlling for p-factors (r = 0.09-0.21, p < 0.001). A model with child p-factor alone explained mental health service utilization (R-2 = 0.23, p < 0.001), but up to five dimensions provided incremental validity to account for developmental risk and current functioning in children (R-2 = 0.03-0.19, p < 0.001). In this first investigation comprehensively mapping the psychopathology hierarchy in children and adults, we delineated a hierarchy of higher-order dimensions associated with a range of clinically relevant validators. These findings hold important implications for psychiatric nosology and future research in this sample.

AB Objective Achieving a clear self-view is a lifelong task that is particularly salient during adolescence. Theory and research suggest that close others' perceptions of individuals' personality may influence the formation and maintenance of coherent self-views. The degree to which adolescents develop a stable and coherent self-view, in turn, may have perennial influences on their mental health and well-being. This 1-year longitudinal study investigated the associations between the agreement of self- and other-rated Big Five personality traits and internalizing problems in adolescence. Method Participants were 570 Dutch adolescents (51% girls), their mothers, friends, and siblings. We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-other personality agreement and internalizing problems using polynomial regression analyses and response surface analyses. Results Results indicated strong main effects of self- and other-rated personality traits on internalizing problems but provided little evidence for longitudinal associations between self-other personality agreement and internalizing problems. Conclusion Our results cast doubt on the generalizability of the beneficial effects of self-other agreement documented in the adult literature to adolescents but highlight the importance of self- and other-rated personality in youth's mental health development. Discussion focuses on the theoretical implications and recommendations for future investigations of self-other agreement.

AB Despite the availability of effective early interventions, few toddlers with emotional and behavioral issues receive these services. This situation exists partly due to challenges in the identification of mental health issues in young children. We developed the Brief Child and Family Intake and Outcomes System for toddlers, which is a 36-item standardized online parent questionnaire including two externalizing scales (Cooperating; Regulating Attention, Impulsivity, and Activity), two internalizing scales (Expressing Emotion; Responding to Change), and two regulatory scales (Eating; Sleeping). We conducted a normative study of 500 Canadian children 18-36 months old, stratified by sex, age, geographic region, and parents' marital status, income, and education. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated good model fit, and the relationship between items and scales did not vary significantly between boys and girls or between younger and older toddlers. Reliability estimates indicated high internal consistency. Providing preliminary evidence of validity, scale scores had positive relations with measures of family distress, caregiver mood, and demographic risk variables. Analyses of latent variables revealed good evidence of discriminant validity of the scales. We extend earlier work by including scales particularly relevant to toddler emotional and behavioral regulation while at the same time minimizing respondent burden and providing norms for Canadian toddlers. The questionnaire could be used in children's mental health settings, primary care, child welfare, and daycare facilities, for intake, triage, and describing toddlers.

AB Objective Although clinical studies suggest that bulimia symptoms are common in youth, research on the prevalence of such symptoms and of their association with comorbid internalizing problems in the general population has been limited. This study aimed to evaluate the gender-specific prevalence of bulimia symptoms in Czech youth and explored the association between a clinical level of self-reported bulimia symptoms (CLBS) and internalizing problems by gender, controlling for age, socio-economic status and puberty status. Method The study was conducted on a representative national sample of Czech youth (N = 4430, 57.0% female) using self-report scales. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to examine the associations. Results The 3-month CLBS prevalence was higher in girls (11.4%) than in boys (3.8%) and in both genders a CLBS was associated with higher levels of comorbid internalizing problems. Discussion Timely recognition of bulimia symptoms and associated risk factors is important for early prevention and intervention strategies.

A sample of Chinese parents (N?=?285) of children aged 30?83 (M?=?57.52, SD?=?13.47) months completed questionnaires to report their own parenting and their children?s behaviors. Parents? child-based worth was related to children?s internalizing rather than externalizing problems. Parental psychological control and parent?child relationship mediated the association between parents? child-based worth and children?s internalizing problems in a serial multiple mediator model. The study provided preliminary evidence showing the mechanism by which parents? child-based worth influence young children?s behavioral outcomes. The results have practical implications for parenting in the Chinese context and beyond.

AB Background: In 2018, >75,000 children were newly affected by the diagnosis of advanced cancer in a parent. Unfortunately, few programs exist to help parents and their children manage the impact of advanced disease together as a family. The Enhancing Connections-Palliative Care (EC-PC) parenting program was developed in response to this gap. Objective: (1) Assess the feasibility of the EC-PC parenting program (recruitment, enrollment, and retention); (2) test the short-term impact of the program on changes in parent and child outcomes; and (3) explore the relationship between parents' physical and psychological symptoms with program outcomes. Design: Quasi-experimental two-group design employing both within- and between-subjects analyses to examine change over time and change relative to historical controls. Parents participated in five telephone-delivered and fully manualized behavioral intervention sessions at two-week intervals, delivered by trained nurses. Behavioral assessments were obtained at baseline and at three months on parents' depressed mood, anxiety, parenting skills, parenting self-efficacy, and symptom distress as well as children's behavioral-emotional adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, and anxiety/depression). Subjects: Parents diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer and receiving noncurative treatment were eligible for the trial provided they had one or more children aged 5-17 living at home, were able to read, write, and speak English, and were not enrolled in a hospice program. Results: Of those enrolled, 62% completed all intervention sessions and post-intervention assessments. Within-group analyses showed significant improvements in parents' self-efficacy in helping their children manage pressures from the parent's cancer; parents' skills to elicit children's cancer-related concerns; and parents' skills to help their children cope with the cancer. Between-group analyses revealed comparable improvements with historical controls on parents' anxiety, depressed mood, self-efficacy, parenting skills, and children's behavioral-emotional adjustment. Conclusion: The EC-PC parenting program shows promise in significantly improving parents' skills and confidence in supporting their child about the cancer. Further testing of the program is warranted.

AB ObjectivesThe Syrian Civil War forced millions into asylum in neighbouring countries. Refugees/asylum seekers have elevated risk for psychopathology with the most important being post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Subjective experiences and symptoms of the hosting populations which have also experienced similar traumas have received relatively little attention up to now. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Syrian Civil War in terms of psychopathology, traumatic experiences and PTSD on Turkish primary school students living in Suru? which is on the border with Syria and hosts a large population of asylum seekers.MethodsTwo randomly selected schools operating in the district were included in the study. Sociodemographic Data forms, Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), Children?s Post-traumatic Reaction Index (CPRI) were used for evaluations. Data were analysed with SPSS 23.0. P was set at 0.05 (two-tailed).ResultsMost common traumatic experiences via parental report were witnessing explosions (26.9%), witnessing injuries of extended family/relatives (21.8%) and witnessing deaths of acquaintances (17.9%). Lifetime traumatic events and lifetime self-injurious behaviour in children via parental report were 26.9% and 19.9%; respectively. Of 156 students (53.2% male) with a mean age of 8.8 years (S.D.?=?1.3), 13.5% obtained externalizing scores, 11.0% obtained internalizing scores and 13.5% obtained total scores in the clinical range of CBCL. 98.7% reported PTSD symptoms in moderate and above severity in CPRI. Most common traumatic experiences reported by children included hearing explosions/gunshots (17.3%), damage to residences (17.3%), and witnessing deaths of extended family/ acquaintances (12.8%). Female gender (p?=?.00), witnessing loss of family members/acquaintances in Syrian Civil War (p?=?.01) and clinically significant PTSD symptoms in CPRI.ConclusionChildren in communities hosting Syrian refugees/asylum seekers may also have elevated symptoms of PTSD and female gender may be a risk factor for those symptoms.

AB Background Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins. In North America, over 90% of the population has detectable levels of urinary BPA. Human epidemiological studies have reported adverse behavioral outcomes with BPA exposure in children, however, corresponding effects on children's brain structure have not yet been investigated. The current study examined the association between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA exposure and white matter microstructure in children aged 2 to 5 years, and investigated whether brain structure mediated the association between BPA exposure and child behavior. Methods Participants were 98 mother-child pairs who were recruited between January 2009 and December 2012. Total BPA concentrations in spot urine samples obtained from mothers in the second trimester of pregnancy and from children at 3-4 years of age were analyzed. Children participated in a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at age 2-5 years (3.7 +/- 0.8 years). Associations between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA and children's fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of 10 isolated white matter tracts were investigated, controlling for urinary creatinine, child sex, and age at the time of MRI. Post-hoc analyses examined if alterations in white matter mediated the relationship of BPA and children's scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results Prenatal maternal urinary BPA was significantly associated with child mean diffusivity in the splenium and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Splenium diffusivity mediated the relationship between maternal prenatal BPA levels and children's internalizing behavior (indirect effect: beta = 0.213, CI [0.0167, 0.564]). No significant associations were found between childhood BPA and white matter microstructure. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence for the neural correlates of BPA exposure in humans. Our findings suggest that prenatal maternal exposure to BPA may lead to alterations in white matter microstructure in preschool aged children, and that such alterations mediate the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and internalizing problems.

AB Background A growing body of research has documented the effects of prenatal risk factors on a wide spectrum of adverse offspring health outcomes. Childhood behavior problems, such as externalizing and internalizing problems, are no exception. This comprehensive literature review aims to summarize and synthesize current research about commonly experienced prenatal risk factors associated with internalizing and externalizing problems, with a focus on their impact during childhood and adolescence. Potential mechanisms as well as implications are also outlined. Data sources The EBSCO, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were searched for studies examining the association between prenatal risk factors and offspring internalizing/externalizing problems, using keywords "prenatal" or "perinatal" or "birth complications" in combination with "internalizing" or "externalizing". Relevant articles, including experimental research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies, and theoretical literature, were reviewed and synthesized to form the basis of this integrative review. Results Prenatal risk factors that have been widely investigated with regards to offspring internalizing and externalizing problems encompass health-related risk factors, including maternal overweight/obesity, substance use/abuse, environmental toxicant exposure, maternal infection/inflammation, as well as psychosocial risk factors, including intimate partner violence, and anxiety/depression. Collectively, both epidemiological and experimental studies support the adverse associations between these prenatal factors and increased risk of emotional/behavioral problem development during childhood and beyond. Potential mechanisms of action underlying these associations include hormonal and immune system alterations. Implications include prenatal education, screening, and intervention strategies. Conclusions Prenatal risk factors are associated with a constellation of offspring internalizing and externalizing problems. Identifying these risk factors and understanding potential mechanisms will help to develop effective, evidence-based prevention, and intervention strategies.

AB This study examined the relevance of infant temperament, parent personality and parenting stress for children's socio-emotional development, looking in addition for any differences between mothers and fathers. Participants, from a community sample, were 410 mothers and fathers reporting their personality (NEO Personality Inventory), child temperament in the first (Infant Characteristics Questionnaire) and second (Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire) years, parenting stress to 36 months (Parenting Stress Index Short Form) and child behaviour at 51 months (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Difficult toddler temperament was associated with more externalizing and internalizing problems. Higher paternal extraversion was associated with more prosocial behaviour whereas lower maternal extraversion was associated with more internalizing problems. For both parents, describing a dysfunctional parent-child relationship was related to more externalizing problems and to less prosocial behaviour, for fathers also to more internalizing problems, which associated for mothers with more parental distress.

AB Problematic family functioning places young adolescents at risk for internalizing behaviors. However, not all adolescents who experience family risk develop internalizing behaviors during early adolescence. Informed by a cumulative risk perspective, the current study examined whether associations between cumulative family risk, as well as particular family risk domains, and youth internalizing behaviors are moderated by youth parasympathetic reactivity. Participants include 68 young adolescents in 6th grade. Youth were 56% female, 41% African American, and 54% European American. For young adolescents who experienced higher change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia during a challenge/stressor task, greater cumulative family risk, exposure to more family risk domains, and several particular risk factors (maternal psychological well-being, marital/family system risk), were associated with higher levels of internalizing behaviors. The findings from this study demonstrate that the extent to which both particular family risk factors and cumulative family risk place youth at increased risk for internalizing behaviors depends on youth's parasympathetic functioning.

AB Stress has pronounced effects on the brain, and thus behavioral outputs. This is particularly true when the stress occurs during vulnerable points in development. A review of the clinical literature regarding the moderating effects of sex on psychopathology in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment (CM) is complicated by a host of variables that are difficult to quantify and control in clinical settings. As a result, the precise role of sex in moderating the consequences of CM remains elusive. In this review, we explore the rationale for studying this important question and their implications for treatment. We examine this issue using the threat/deprivation conceptual framework and highlight a growing body of work demonstrating important sex differences in human studies and in animal models of early life stress (ELS). The challenges and obstacles for effectively studying this question are reviewed and are followed by recommendations on how to move forward at the clinical and preclinical settings. We hope that this review will help inspire additional studies on this important topic.

AB Purpose: The increasing need for school-based mental health services has altered teachers' involvement in mental health services. Methods: This study presents a meta-analysis from a previous systematic review to identify which study characteristics result in effective treatment outcomes. Specific treatment characteristics analyzed in this study include type of intervention, treatment modality, length of treatment, and type of measurement. Effect sizes were coded by internalizing and externalizing disorders, depending on the symptoms the corresponding treatments were intended to address. A final sample size included 9 independent effect sizes of internalizing behaviors and 21 effect sizes of externalizing behaviors. Results: Internalizing disorders, social skill interventions, classroom modalities, and medium treatment length were moderating treatment characteristics. No significant effects were found for externalizing disorders. Conclusions: These results further add to the research on teacher's role in school-based mental health services and provide important information for social workers who work in schools.

AB In this study, I investigated the maltreatment profiles of child welfare-involved children in special education and examined how those profiles influenced their internalizing and externalizing behaviors. I analyzed data on a sample of 290 children (63% male, 37% female, M-age = 11 years) from the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being II. When weighted, this sample represented approximately 233,000 children involved in the child welfare system and in special education. Results from latent class analyses revealed four maltreatment classes, listed by predominance: supervisory neglect, physical abuse, other forms of maltreatment, and sexual abuse. Relative to children in the sexual abuse class, children had higher teacher-reported internalizing problem behaviors if their predominate maltreatment class was either supervisory neglect or physical abuse. Understanding maltreatment and its consequences for child welfare-involved children in special education can help better inform ways to promote their educational success.

AB Background: Both depression and anxiety (two of the most common internalizing psychopathologies among youths) are associated with difficulties in emotion regulation (ER). Little is known about whether anxiety as a comorbid condition has an effect on the habitual use of different ER strategies in youngsters with depression histories. We aimed 1) to compare ER in adolescents with histories of childhood onset major depressive disorder (MDD) with and without comorbid anxiety and 2) to examine whether certain ER response clusters (Cognitive, Social, and Behavioral/Physical) characterize comorbid children and adolescents.
   Methods: We analyzed data on 217 youth (11-18 years old) with depression history: 85 subjects with lifetime anxiety comorbidity (comorbid group) and 132 without lifetime anxiety (non-comorbid group). Psychiatric diagnosis was established by a comprehensive Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV-based diagnostic procedure. ER strategies were examined via the self-rated "Feelings and Me" Child version questionnaire (FAM-C).
   Results: The comorbid group used maladaptive ER strategies significantly more frequently than the non-comorbid youngsters. The Behavioral/Physical and Social ER skills, especially those reflecting social withdrawal and self-harm, were responsible for the higher maladaptive scores.
   Limitations: Because our study is a cross-sectional analysis, we have no information about the development or the onset of maladaptive ER strategies. Therefore, we were unable to examine whether maladaptive ER was a risk factor or a consequence of the internalizing psychopathology and comorbidity.
   Conclusions: Comorbid anxiety worsens the impaired use of ER strategies in depression-prone youths. Further longitudinal research is needed to explore the causal role of dysfunctional ER in the development of internalizing psychopathology.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine associations of disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) with body image problems, parents' eating disorder symptoms, and emotional and behavioral problems among adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 200 adolescents (M age = 15.24 +/- 1.45 years) with T1D completed a self-report measure of DEBs and body ideal internalization, and their parents completed self-report measures of parents' eating problems and child's psychological symptoms. Seventy-three (36.5%) adolescents were DEPS-r-positive (scores >= 20), with higher rates among girls (chi(2) = 9.034, p = .003). Adolescents with T1D and DEBs reported lower SES, worse metabolic control, higher zBMI (p < .001), more eating disorder symptoms, more body image problems, and more emotional and behavioral problems than adolescents with T1D but no DEBs (all p < .05). Parents of adolescents with DEBs showed higher levels of bulimia (p = .028) than parents of adolescents without DEBs. In both genders, pressure to conform to societal norms about body image (p < .01) and externalization symptoms (p < .05) emerged as significant predictors of DEBs. Findings suggest that adolescents with T1D and DEBs showed an alarming psychological condition, with higher level of body image and more emotional and behavioral problems.

AB Past research raises concerns about whether the presence of self-perceptual biases among children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) interferes with accurate assessment and/or diminishes treatment response. Yet, it remains unclear whether self-perceptual bias is a construct that can be modified. The current study examines individual differences in how children with ADHD (n = 178) display and modify their self-perceptions of competence in the presence of an external motivator for self-perceptual accuracy. Participants were grouped based on the presence and modifiability of their self-perceptual biases across three experimental conditions. Results demonstrate that the presence and modifiability of participants' self-perceptual biases across conditions was associated with adjustment (i.e., externalizing and internalizing problems) and cognitive functioning. Findings suggest multiple factors may be associated with self-perceptual bias (e.g., self-protection and cognitive impairment), and that these factors may differ across children. Implications for intervention, including whether assessment and treatment can be improved, are discussed.

AB This study examined how colored educational tools improve children's numerosity ("number sense") and/or mathematics. We tested children 6-10 years (n = 3,236) who had been exposed to colored numbers from the educational tools Numicon (Oxford University Press, 2018) or Numberjacks (Ellis, 2006), which map colors to magnitudes or Arabic numerals, respectively. In a free association task pairing numbers with colors, a subset of children spontaneously provided colors matching one of these schemas. These children, who had internalized Numicon (colored magnitude), showed significantly better numerosity but not mathematics compared to peers. There was no similar benefit from internalizing Numberjacks (colored numerals). These data support a model in which colored number tools provide benefits at different levels of numerical cognition, according to their different levels of cross-modal mappings.

AB OBJECTIVE: High rates of psychiatric disorders and comorbidities have been reported in the juvenile justice system, and both phenomena are thought to contribute to repetitive offending. Although extensive research on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in juvenile offenders has been conducted in European countries and the USA, epidemiological research concerning this issue is limited in Turkish population. The aim of the present study is to examine psychiatric diagnoses, comorbidity patterns, psychometric properties, and the factors related to recidivism defined as reconvictions, in juveniles under probation in Turkey.
   METHODS: We conducted face-to-face interviews with volunteers. This study sample consisted of 55 individuals (Female/Male = 4/51) who were in the Istanbul Anatolian Probation Department. The participants' age ranged from 14 to 18 years (mean age = 17.220.62). Diagnoses were established based on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children Present and Lifetime Version. A detailed sociodemographic form, Wechsler Intelligence Scale, Child Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were used for assessment. The subjects were divided into two groups based on the number of conviction: Group 1 consisted of 65% of the sample (n = 36) with one conviction and Group 2 consisted of 35% of the sample (n = 19) with more than one conviction. We examined the psychometric properties that might predict recidivism through the logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS: We ascertained that 67.3% of the juveniles had at least one psychiatric disorder, and 45.5% had two or more comorbid psychiatric disorders. The most common diagnosis was attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (43.6%), and followed by depressive mood disorders (34.5%). Juveniles in Group 2 were less educated, had low levels of verbal, performance and total intelligence quotient (IQ) score, had more numbers of psychiatric diagnoses, particularly depressive mood disorders and history of substance use disorders (p<.05). Having a higher number of psychiatric diagnoses and having comorbidity of both externalizing (i.e. ADHD, conduct disorder) and internalizing disorders (i.e. depressive mood disorders, anxiety disorders) were significantly higher in Group 2 (p<.05). Total duration of education (OR = 0.470, 95% CI = 0.257-0.861, p<.05) and having at least one psychiatric disorder (OR = 10.64, 95% CI = 1.642-68.954, p<.05) were found to predict multiple convictions.
   CONCLUSION: Juveniles in the justice system are faced with multiple psychiatric disorders, along with social/environmental adversities. There is a need of a holistic approach addressing multiple areas to prevent repetitive offending behaviour. Accordingly, in addition to legal sanctions, evaluation and interventions regarding mental health will contribute to improve for both psychosocial well-being of delinquent juveniles and prevention strategies for recidivism.

AB BACKGROUND: Cyberbullying, has concerned professionals due to increased use of media over time and as predicted, this type of bullying is fairly common among adolescents. We aimed to define the prevalence of cyberbullying and cyber victimization, examine relationships between problematic smartphone (SP) use (PSU), psychiatric symptoms and emotion regulation difficulties in a clinical adolescent sample. Also, we aimed to predict risk factors of being an E-Victim and E-Bully.
   METHODS: One hundred and fifty adolescents have recruited the study. Demographic Information Form, Problematic Mobile Phone Usage Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, E-Victimization-E-Bullying Scale were filled out by adolescents.
   RESULTS: Our results indicated that the prevalence of cybervictimization and cyberbullying were 62.6% and 53.3%, respectively. BEVEB (Both E-Victim and E-Bully) group adolescents were older than NVB (Non-Victim/Bully) groups. Access internet via own SP, PSU, problems in strategies and impulse control and were significantly higher and "lack of awareness" scores were significantly lower in BEVEB group than others. In addition, when compared with OEV (only E-Victims) group, BEVEB group had also higher hostility scores. Logistic regression analysis revealed that high scores of "lack of awareness" and higher E-bullying scores increase the risk of being an E-Victim; and higher scores of hostility and E-victimization and lower scores of "lack of awareness" (in other words being more aware of feelings) increase the risk of being an E-bully.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to analyses, contrary to our expectations, PSU was important but not an independent predictor of being an E-Victim/E-Bully. Our results also demonstrated an interesting finding: lack of awareness is a risk factor for being an E-victim. We interpreted this result as could not be aware of feelings increase the victimization risk. On the other hand, E-Bullies have higher hostility and victimization while having lower "lack of awareness" scores. It could be speculated that, re-victimization and being aware of hostility feelings could increase the cyberbullying among adolescents. In addition being an E-Bully could be a consequence of being an E-victim and increasing hostility and awareness over time. These results should be re-examined in larger clinical samples.

AB SYNOPSIS Objective: This study evaluated the role of parent-child interactive groups in a group-based parent training program for children with externalizing and/or internalizing behavior problems; Design: A cluster-randomized trial design compared two versions of delivery of the Exploring Together program, with (Exploring Together; ET) and without (Exploring Together-Adapted; ET-Adapted) the parent-child interactive component. Participants were 136 parents and their children (aged 5?10?years) with identified externalizing and/or internalizing problems, recruited from primary schools. Outcome measures were parent- and teacher-reported child externalizing and internalizing problems, assessed at post intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups; Results: Significant reductions in parent- and teacher-reported child externalizing and internalizing problems were evident across both treatment groups (ET and ET-Adapted) at post intervention. At the 6- and 12-month follow-ups significant reductions were maintained across both groups on parent-reported child externalizing and internalizing problems only. No differences were found between the two treatment groups on any of the child outcome variables at any time point; Conclusions: Inclusion of parent-child interactive groups was not associated with greater improvement in child behavior outcomes. This finding suggests service providers would need to consider potential resource (i.e., staffing allocation) and clinical benefit (i.e., coaching parents through behavior management issues in vivo) associated with the two versions of the program.

AB Early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) is a framework that continues to expand as students? social-emotional needs emerge at younger ages. The present systematic review examines the extant literature surrounding the use of ECMHC and behavioral consultation in addressing mental health concerns and challenging behaviors in preschool students. Findings associated with this systematic review suggest that ECMHC could be a promising practice for targeting internalizing and externalizing behavioral concerns in prekindergarten students across a variety of settings. However, more research is needed in the areas of mental health/behavioral consultation and disciplinary disproportionality, as well as on the impact of such practices on preschool children of color. Implications for school psychologists are discussed, as are disciplinary practices when providing ECMHC and behavioral consultation services with students of diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.

AB Objective: Research suggests that adolescents seeking gender-affirming hormone therapy experience elevated rates of depression, anxiety, and difficulties with peer relationships. Less is known regarding more specific aspects of mental health and psychosocial functioning. Furthermore, few studies have explored variations in mental health and psychosocial functioning by age, gender, degree of physical dysphoria, and informant type (adolescent, mother, and father). Method: Participants are adolescents (n = 149) and parents/guardians (n = 247) who presented to a multidisciplinary gender clinic in Dallas, TX for an initial assessment before initiation of gender-affirming hormone therapy. Adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and the Body Image Scale (a measure of physical dysphoria), and parents/guardians completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: Approximately half of participants reported clinically significant difficulties with internalizing symptoms and psychosocial functioning (particularly engagement in activities), with approximately one-third indicating significant difficulties with depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Parents reported fewer symptoms than adolescents across several subscales, but differences were generally small. By contrast, gender differences were found across all internalizing subscales and were generally large. Age and body dissatisfaction were not independently associated with broadband measures but, in combination with gender, were strongly associated with variance in YSR and CBCL reports of internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: Elevated rates of depression, anxiety, and competency difficulties were broadly consistent with the previous literature and demonstrate the need for investment in the clinical training and infrastructure to provide comprehensive care to this population. Differences in mental health and psychosocial functioning by gender and clinic location appear to be less straightforward.

ID ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; ABUSE; ATTACHMENT; ADULTS; HEALTH
AB Purpose of review To highlight the impact of intimate partner violence (IPV), also known as domestic violence, on children and families and to provide a framework for pediatricians in managing IPV-affected families. Recent findings Children living with a victim of IPV are at a much higher risk of being physically abused themselves. Exposure to IPV places children at high risk for multiple adverse childhood experiences, long-term health morbidity, and increased chance of intergenerational transmission of child abuse and future IPV. Exposure to a violent home environment alone is considered a form of child maltreatment. Furthermore, recent studies have proposed that maternal posttraumatic stress disorder and ineffective parenting styles by a victim of IPV mediate children's negative developmental outcomes, such as aggressive or internalizing behavior, mental health issues, and developmental delays. Trauma-informed care and a better understanding of the child abuse reporting process allow pediatricians to address specific needs of children and families exposed to IPV, to serve as mandated reporters with sensitivity and empathy, and to promote resiliency in families. IPV is a public health issue that affects children in a variety of ways. Pediatricians can better manage this very serious and personal issue in their offices through an understanding of the unique healthcare needs of children and families impacted by IPV.

AB ObjectiveTo examine potential links between facets of impulsivity and emotion dysregulation to components of the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability) among U.S. military personnel.
   MethodThe current study performed secondary data analysis from a randomized control trial testing the efficacy of a cognitive therapy for 134 service members (71.64% male, 68.66% Caucasian; mean age: 30.14) admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit for a suicide-related crisis. We utilized the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, the Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale, and the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire.
   ResultsAll emotion dysregulation dimensions and one impulsivity facet (attentional) were positively correlated with perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Lack of emotional awareness was positively associated with acquired capability. After controlling for depression, hopelessness, and demographic covariates, lack of emotional awareness was significantly associated with both thwarted belongingness and acquired capability, but not perceived burdensomeness, and impulsivity dimensions did not link to any variable of interest.
   ConclusionsFindings imply that individuals with reduced emotional awareness may have difficulty cultivating interpersonal bonds and be more vulnerable to elevated acquired capability. Lack of emotional awareness may be a potential contributor to both suicidal desire and capability.

AB Purpose Emotional functions may play an important role in anorexia nervosa (AN). The onset of the disorder generally occurs during adolescence, which is a critical period of emotional development. However, most studies that evaluated emotional functions in AN were conducted in adult patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate emotion regulation, emotion recognition, and empathy skills in adolescent girls with AN by controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms, childhood traumatic experiences, and attachment security on emotional functions.
   Methods Thirty-two adolescent girls with AN and 32 healthy counterparts completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and the Child and Adolescent KA-SI Empathic Tendency Scale-Adolescent Form.
   Results The results revealed that adolescents with AN were found to have more difficulties in emotion regulation, higher alexithymic tendencies, and lower empathy skills compared with the control group. However, emotion recognition was not found to be significantly different between the two groups. These results were the same when controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety symptoms, childhood traumatic experiences, and attachment security except for empathy skills. Alexithymia and depressive symptoms were significantly related to emotion regulation difficulties in adolescents with AN.
   Conclusions Considering the results, it seems that emotion regulation and alexithymia may play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of AN. Accordingly, it is necessary to focus on the improvement of these skills during the treatment of AN. Furthermore, interventions promoting these skills during adolescence may be preventive.

AB Background: Neurotoxic effects of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) at low levels have not been well studied in human population, and whether the associations can be explained by thyroid hormones (THs) remains unclear.
   Objectives: We examined the associations of prenatal PBDE exposures with THs in cord plasma and neurobehavior of children at 2 and 4 years among general population in China.
   Methods: Participants were mother-child pairs in the Shanghai-Minhang Birth Cohort Study. Nine PBDE congeners and THs (thyroid stimulating hormone, total thyroxine, free thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine) were determined in cord plasma. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/1.5-5) were completed by caregivers to assess children's neurobehavioral development at 2 and 4 years. In the final analyses, 199 and 307 mother-child pairs at 2 and 4 years were included to examine associations of PBDEs with CBCL scores using Pearson-scale-adjusted Poisson regressions, and 339 subjects were included in linear regression models to investigate the associations between PBDEs and THs.
   Results: BDE-47 had the highest detection rate of 83.82% with the median concentration of 0.19 ng/g lipid, followed by BDE-28, -99, -100 and -153 with detection rates nearly 50%. We found positive associations between prenatal PBDE concentrations and children's neurobehavior, including Somatic Complaints, Withdrawn, Sleep Problems and Internalizing Problems in girls, and Somatic Complaints and Attention Problems in boys. We also observed inverse associations of the sum of BDE-47, - 28, - 99, -100 and -153 with THs. However, by adding THs to the models examining associations between PBDEs and CBCL, the main results didn't measurably change.
   Conclusions: This study adds new knowledge that prenatal PBDEs at low levels may be related to long-lasting behavioral abnormalities in children and reduced THs in cord plasma. However, the hypothesis that the neurotoxic impact of PBDEs may be explained by alterations in cord THs was not supported.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that prenatal exposure to phthalates, ubiquitous synthetic chemicals, may adversely affect neurodevelopment. However, data are limited on how phthalates affect cognition, executive function, and behavioral function into adolescence.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate associations of prenatal phthalate exposure with neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study.
   METHODS: We examined associations between maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations measured twice during pregnancy and a range neurodevelopmental outcomes from ages 7 through 16 y in the CHAMACOS birth cohort (n = 334). We used age-specific linear regression models and generalized estimating equation models to assess longitudinal effects and examined differences by sex.
   RESULTS: Phthalate metabolites were detected in 88%-100% of samples, depending on the metabolite. Associations of phthalates with neurodevelopmental outcomes were largely null with some noteworthy patterns. Higher prenatal concentrations of metabolites of low-molecular weight phthalates (Sigma LMW) were associated with more self-reported hyperactivity [beta = 0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1, 1.4 per 2-fold increase in Sigma LMW phthalates], attention problems (beta = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.7, 2.2), and anxiety (beta = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.0, 1.8) at age 16. We observed sex-specific differences for the sums of high-molecular-weight and di(2-ethythexyl) metabolites and cognitive outcomes (e.g., beta for Full-Scale IQ for boys = - 1.9, 95% CI: -4.1, 0.3 and -1.7, 95% CI: -3.8, 0.3, respectively; beta for girls = 1.8, 95% CI: 0.1, 3.4 and 1.6, 95% CI: 0.0, 3.2, respectively; p-int =0.01 for both).
   CONCLUSION: We found predominantly null associations of prenatal phthalates with neurodevelopment in CHAMACOS, and weak associations of Sigma LMW phthalates with internalizing and externalizing behaviors in adolescence. No previous studies have examined associations of prenatal phthalate exposure with neurodevelopment into adolescence, an important time for manifestations of effects.

AB Objective This study utilized a developmental cascade approach to test alternative theories about the underlying mechanisms behind the association of maternal prenatal stress and child psychopathology. The fetal programming hypothesis suggests that prenatal stress affects fetal structural and physiological systems responsible for individual differences in child temperament, which further increases risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. Interpersonal models of stress transmission suggest that maternal stress influences child mental health via early parenting behaviors. We also examined a continuation of stress hypothesis, in which prenatal stress predicts child mental health via the continuation of maternal stress in the postpartum period. Methods Participants were 1,992 mother-child pairs drawn from a prospective pregnancy cohort. Mothers reported on their perceived stress, anxiety, and depression during pregnancy and at 4-month postpartum. Birthweight was assessed via medical records of birthweight. At 4-month postpartum, hostile-reactive parenting behaviors were assessed. Child temperamental negative affect was measured at age 3. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at age 5. Results Prenatal stress was associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems via postnatal stress and child temperament. Prenatal stress was also associated with externalizing behaviors via increased hostile-reactive parenting. After accounting for postnatal factors, prenatal stress continued to have a direct effect on child internalizing, but not externalizing, symptoms. Conclusion Results provide support for the fetal programming, interpersonal stress transmission, and continuation of stress models. Findings highlight the need for prenatal preventative programs that continue into the early postnatal period, targeting maternal stress and parenting behaviors.

AB Objective This study examined associations between chronic physical health conditions (identified from hospital records) that are subject to school health care plans, and children's emotional, behavioral, and social functioning during early (similar to 5 years of age) and middle childhood (similar to 11 years). Methods Participants were 21,304 Australian children from a representative longitudinal population cohort derived by multi-agency record linkage. Hospital presentations (admitted patients and emergency department) identified children with asthma (n = 1,573), allergies and anaphylaxis (n = 738), type 1 diabetes (n = 59), epilepsy (n = 87), and any of these conditions (n = 2,275), relative to 19,029 children without these presentations. Logistic regression analyses determined associations between these exposures and (i) emotional, behavioral, social, and overall vulnerabilities reported by teachers (early childhood) and children (middle childhood), and (ii) self-reported lack of sources of support (middle childhood). Results Prevalence of any condition in hospital records was 7.5% by early childhood, and 10.7% by middle childhood. Relative to peers without these presentations, small increases in risk of overall problems, and selected emotional, behavioral, and social problems, were apparent for children with any condition, and asthma specifically, in early and middle childhood. Large and pervasive effects were apparent for epilepsy, limited small effects in middle childhood only for allergies and anaphylaxis, and no increases in risk associated with type 1 diabetes examined in middle childhood. No condition was associated with increased risk of lacking supports. Conclusions Children with hospital records of chronic conditions, particularly epilepsy and asthma, might benefit from school-based care plans that integrate their physical and mental health support needs.

AB Objective To examine the association of psychological factors and pediatric health care utilization. Method Ovid Medline and PsychInfo were searched and archival and forward searchers were conducted of relevant articles. Studies of the association between psychological risk factors and pediatric health care utilization of outpatient services, emergency department, inpatient length of stay, and costs were identified. Effect sizes were expressed in the form of the standardized mean difference. From 4,546 studies identified in the search, 69 studies met inclusion criteria. Results There were significant low-moderate associations between higher outpatient visits and general child mental health (MH) problems (mean ES [mES] = 0.35), overall psychopathology (mES = 0.44), and internalizing symptoms (mES = 0.16). Results were significant for any parent MH problem (mES = 0.18). For emergency department (ED) visits, there were significant association between more ED visits and any child MH problems (mES = 0.25), internalizing symptoms (mES = 0.24), externalizing symptoms (mES = 0.16), and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (mES = 0.14), as well as parent MH (mES = 0.24) and maternal depression (mES = 0.21). Increased hospitalizations were associated with any child MH problem (mES = 0.3), overall child psychopathology (mES = 0.49), child depression (ES = 0.41), and any parent MH problem (mES = 0.54). For costs, results were significant for any child MH problem (mES = 0.38). Conclusions Child and parent MH problems are significantly associated with increased HCU.

AB Dual identity (e.g., strong ethnic and national identity) is a psychological resource for minority groups, but how it develops during adolescence is less clear. In this 3-wave longitudinal study, a person-oriented approach was used to examine dual identity development in a sample of 2145 Muslim adolescents (M-T1 = 15 years, 51% female) in four Western European countries. The results of a growth-mixture model pointed toward four distinct developmental Classes: (1) "Dual identity", (2) "Separation to dual identity", (3) "Assimilation to dual identity", and (4) "Separation". Multiple group comparisons further showed that adolescents in Class 1 were well adjusted, but well-being (e.g., internalizing problems, life satisfaction) and health were even higher among adolescents in Class 2. Adolescents in Class 3 had consistently lower levels of well-being, and adolescents in Class 4 had lower levels of socio-cultural adjustment (e.g., problem behaviour at school, delinquent behaviour, and lack of intergroup contact). The findings underscore that most Muslim minority adolescents in Western Europe develop a dual identity, and that the developmental process, not simply the outcome, matters for adjustment.

AB Purpose The aim of the present study was to contribute to the inconsistent literature on the comorbid relationship of alcohol problems and depressive symptoms from late adolescent to emerging adulthood by accounting for their trajectories and their conjoint relationship while controlling for the influence of externalising symptoms.
   Methods We utilised data, from a longitudinal school cohort from Northern Ireland (Belfast Youth Developmental Study), over three time points where the participants were 16, 17 and 21 years of age. A total of 3118 participants were included, 1713 females and 1405 males. Second-order latent growth models were applied to examine growth trajectories. Parallel process growth models were used to assess whether growth trajectories of the symptoms were associated. Externalising symptoms were subsequently added as a covariate.
   Results Alcohol problems among males significantly increased over time but decreased in females. Depressive symptoms initially increased then decreased in both genders. Results indicated associations of the alcohol problems and depression, both initially and with time. Accounting for externalising symptoms only somewhat diminished this effect in males but not in females. An increase of initial levels of depression was associated with a decrease in alcohol problems over time. This association was only true among females. After controlling for externalising symptoms, the relationship was no longer observed.
   Conclusions The present study provides further evidence of a significant relationship of alcohol problems and depression in adolescents and further supports a small literature indicating that depression may have protective effects of alcohol problems. Finally, the study shows the importance of accounting for externalising symptoms.

AB Background: Sexual minority youth (SMY) had more risk behaviors and mental health problems than heterosexual youth. Relatively little research has differentiated among lesbian/gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ) youth.
   Objective: To examine the differences in emotional and behavioral problems between LGBQ youth in the city of Northern Thailand.
   Methods: Data were from a school-based, cross-sectional study of grade 7-12 students in secondary and vocational schools. Five hundred and forty-three students who identified themselves as LGBQ and 3829 heterosexual peers completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR).
   Results: Of 12.4% of LGBQ participants, 4.1% identified themselves as lesbian/gay, 4.8% as bisexual, and 3.5% were unsure. SMY had significantly higher scores in internalizing problems (16.84 VS 13.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94-3.77, P < 0.001), externalizing problems (15.23 VS 13.51, 95% CI 0.97-2.45, P < 0.001), and total behavioral scores (55.26 VS 47.16, 95% CI 5.55-10.63, P < 0.001) than their heterosexual peers. In sexual minority subgroup analyses, all syndrome subscales were highest in the bisexual group followed by the lesbian/gay group, and the questioning group, respectively.
   Conclusion: LGBQ high school students had greater psychosocial problems than their heterosexual counterparts. Bisexual students were at the greatest risks of emotional and behavioral problems. Pediatricians and school mental health providers should be aware of emotional and behavioral problems among LGBQ students.

AB Background: Previous studies suggest an overall increase of adolescent mental health symptoms globally since the 1980s until today, especially an increase of internalizing symptoms in girls. Due to methodological limitations of these studies, further studies are warranted to obtain a more solid knowledgebase. Methods: This study was cross-sectional and compared two separate but geographically identical groups of adolescents in a middle-sized industrial municipality in Northern Sweden at two time-points [(i) 1981, n = 1083, (505 girls, 577 boys), response rate 99.7%; (ii) 2014, n = 682, (338 girls, 344 boys), response rate 98.3%]. All students in their last year of compulsory school were included. The same self-report questionnaire, consisting of four sub-scales (functional somatic-, anxiety-, depressive symptoms and conduct problems), was used at both occasions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, two-way ANOVA and general linear model. Results: Symptoms of anxiety and depression and functional somatic symptoms, increased among both boys and girls from 1981 until 2014 (P < 0.001 for all subscales), and the increase of these symptoms was higher in girls. Conduct problems were significantly higher in boys in 1981 and decreased over time so that in 2014 there was no longer a significant difference between boys and girls regarding conduct problems (P = 0.286). Conclusion: In this population-based study spanning over 30 years, both girls and boys showed increasing internalizing problems, while conduct problems decreased. To halt this trend, we need a deeper understanding of the impact of the major societal changes that have occurred during the last three decades.

AB There is a high prevalence of mental health concerns among youth in the United States. School-based mental health counselling interventions maybe one way of addressing the mental health concerns of youth. This study investigated changes in students' behavioural and emotional problems scores and discipline referrals for those who participated in a 5-week school-based mental health counselling intervention (SBMHCI) at three Title I elementary schools, located in Southeastern United States. The participants (N = 35) to participate had an active Individual Education Program (IEP). They then received the SBMHCI grounded in a Humanistic counselling approach. A single-group, pre-test-post-test design was used to examine change in participants' scores (internalizing and externalizing). There was no control group in place for this study therefore there was no comparisons made between participants and non-participants' outcomes. The researchers identified significant improvement over time on the parents' ratings of the students' internalizing problem scores and the teachers' ratings of the students' externalizing problem scores, and total problems scores per both parents and teachers' report. Furthermore, the number of office discipline referrals decreased significantly over time.

AB Background: Traumatic events experienced in childhood, particularly those that are perpetrated by someone whom the child trusts or depends upon (i.e., high betrayal traumas [HBTs], such as abuse by a parent) can lead to long-term negative consequences, including a tendency to see oneself in a negative light, low self-compassion, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Although negative psychological consequences of HBTs are well-documented in the literature, little is known surrounding the protective factors that may reduce the effects of HBTs on individuals' functioning. The present study focused on one potential protective factor, dialectical self-beliefs, that may moderate the negative effects of HBTs experienced in childhood on self-compassion, and hence reduce posttraumatic stress (PTS).
   Objective: The present study is aimed at determining whether dialectical self-beliefs moderate the indirect effect of HBTs on PTS via self-compassion.
   Participants and setting: Data of the present study were collected from 747 college students attending a university in the Northeast region of the United States.
   Method: Using a correlational study design, the data of this study were collected from college students through an online survey.
   Results: The results of a moderated mediation analysis indicated that the hypothesized model explained 25% of the variance in PTS. After controlling for low betrayal traumas, the indirect effect of HBTs on PTS through self-compassion was moderated by dialectical self-beliefs. These findings provide support for our hypotheses and suggest that having a dialectical self-view may enhance the adjustment of individuals with a history of HBTs by reducing the negative effect of HBTs on self-compassion.

AB Background: Maltreated youth are at an elevated risk for the development of problem behaviors. Coping with the death of a family member or close friend during adolescence, referred to as bereavement, is a stressful event that could potentiate risk linked to maltreatment. However, developmental research suggests that youth adjustment is a product of multiple risk and protective factors. Although maltreated youth who experience loss may be particularly vulnerable to behavior problems, personal and contextual factors may attenuate or exacerbate youths' risk for internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.
   Objective: The overarching goal of this study is to examine individual, family, and community-level protective factors for maltreated youth who experience bereavement. Specifically, we aim to examine the effect of age 12 bereavement on age 16 internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, and to investigate the moderating role of multi-level protective factors at ages 14 and 16.
   Methods: The study consisted of a sample of 800 youth (52.4% female, 45.1% African-American) drawn from the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN), collected from 1998 to 2011.
   Results: Maltreated youth who experienced significant loss were at increased risk for externalizing symptoms, compared to non-bereaved maltreated youth (beta = 0.085, p < .05). Individual future orientation beta = 0.103, p < .05) family future orientation (beta = -0.120, p < .05), parental monitoring (beta = -0.123, p < .01), and neighborhood collective efficacy (beta = -0.126, p < .01) each significantly moderated the association between bereavement and externalizing symptoms.
   Conclusions: These results have implications for future interventions aimed towards reducing problem behaviors in adolescents with a history of child maltreatment and who experience bereavement.

AB Lower levels of self-regulation have been implicated in multiple psychological disorders. Despite conceptual overlap (broadly reflecting self-regulatory functions), executive functions (EF) and effortful control (EC) are rarely jointly studied in relation to broadband psychopathology. The present study investigated associations of correlated factors (internalizing-externalizing) and bifactor psychopathology models with EF and EC in a large (N = 895) childhood community sample (M-age = 11.54, SDage = 2.25). Associations between both self-regulation constructs (EF and EC) with psychopathology were largely accounted for via a general psychopathology factor. However, EC evidenced stronger associations, questioning the utility of task-based EF measures to inform self-regulatory psychopathology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To study the prevalence of subthreshold oppositional defiant disorder (ST ODD)-less than 4 symptoms, but nonetheless an impairing form of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)-its coexistence with other homotypic externalizing and heterotypical internalizing problems in children and associated impairment, as well as the long-term effect of this condition. A population-based sample of 622 preschoolers (5.0% boys) was followed up from preschool to preadolescence. Parents were interviewed when the children were 3, 6 and 9 years old with the Diagnostic Interview for Preschoolers/Children and Adolescents versions following DSM-5 and the children's functioning was assessed by trained clinicians. ST ODD diagnosis is highly prevalent (19.4-25.5%), highly comorbid [homo- (1.9-18.4%) and heterotypical (5.8-23.7%)], resulting in functional impairment across child development in a similar way for both genders. ST is also a risk factor condition that predicts the presence of psychological problems and impairment in childhood and preadolescence from preschool age. A broader clinical assessment and intervention similar to that provided full syndrome cases is needed for children presenting subthreshold forms of ODD.

AB Background Adolescence is characterized by an increased vulnerability for internalizing psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety. A positive association between anxiety and depression has consistently been found in research. However, the specific direction of this association is less clear. In this study, we investigated the temporal associations between (social) anxiety and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the role of dependent interpersonal stress as a potential mediating factor in these temporal associations was examined. Methods Data were part of a larger longitudinal study on the emotional development of adolescents, which was initiated in February 2013. The total sample consisted of 2011 adolescents between the ages of 11 and 19. Data were analyzed using cross-lagged models. Results Bidirectional positive associations were found between social anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. However, dependent interpersonal stress was not a mediator in the link between social anxiety and depression. Our results indicate that dependent interpersonal stress seems to be particularly related to depressive symptoms and not to social anxiety symptoms. Conclusions Findings suggest that bidirectional associations between social anxiety and depressive symptoms exist. This implies that clinicians should be specifically vigilant for the development of depressive symptoms in socially anxious adolescents and the development of social anxiety symptoms in depressed adolescents. Our findings further highlight the importance of targeting dependent interpersonal stress in the context of depression.

AB Objectives: We conducted joint analyses from five randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of online family problem-solving therapy (OFPST) for children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to identify child and parent outcomes most sensitive to OFPST and trajectories of recovery over time. Methods: We examined data from 359 children with complicated mild to severe TBI, aged 5-18, randomized to OFPST or a control condition. Using profile analyses, we examined group differences on parent-reported child (internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, executive function behaviors, social competence) and family outcomes (parental depression, psychological distress, family functioning, parent-child conflict). Results: We found a main effect for measure for both child and family outcomes [F(3, 731) = 7.35, p < .001; F(3, 532) = 4.79, p = .003, respectively], reflecting differing degrees of improvement across measures for both groups. Significant group-by-time interactions indicated that children and families in the OFPST group had fewer problems than controls at both 6 and 18 months post baseline [t(731) = -5.15, p < .001, and t(731) = -3.90, p = .002, respectively, for child outcomes; t(532) = -4.81, p < .001, and t(532) = -3.80, p < .001, respectively, for family outcomes]. Conclusions: The results suggest limited differences in the measures' responsiveness to treatment while highlighting OFPST's utility in improving both child behavior problems and parent/family functioning. Group differences were greatest at treatment completion and after extended time post treatment.

AB Rationale: Racial phenotype shapes the ways in which others perceive and interact with children, with implications for their immediate and long-term well-being. Still, few empirical studies have examined these links in Latinx children.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between skin color, as a salient marker of racial phenotype, and the mental health of young, Latinx children.
   Methods: The present study was conducted in the United States between 2010 and 2013. Participants (N = 684) were Mexican- and Dominican origin 4 - 5-year olds who were rated based on their skin tone as "moderately dark" (54%), "honorary white" (35%), and "collective black" (11%). Regression models were used to estimate the association between skin color (measured at age 4-5) and internalizing and externalizing behaviors (measured at the end of first grade).
   Results: By the end of first grade, "collective black" children had higher ratings on several indicators of internalizing and externalizing problems compared to their "honorary white" peers; this pattern was particularly pronounced for girls. Moreover, the association between externalizing behaviors at baseline and first grade was stronger among children with dark, relative to light, skin color.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that darker-skinned Latinx children may be at increased risk for more severe and/or more persistent mental health problems, perhaps due to discrimination based on their skin color. In order to develop intervention strategies to prevent mental health problems in the Latinx child population, future research is needed to examine how racism may manifest, particularly in teacher-student and parent-child interactions, in the everyday experiences of young children.

AB Introduction: Chronic inflammation plays an important role on the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, as well as on brain function and behaviour. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between inflammatory biomarkers and a wide range of brain health indicators (i.e., academic performance, executive function, behavioural and emotional functioning, and brain volume) in children with overweight/obesity.
   Methods: A total of 107 children (10.0 +/- 1.1 years, 41% girls) from the ActiveBrains project were included in the analysis. Five inflammatory biomarkers were analysed in plasma: white blood cell (WBC) count, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Academic performance was assessed by Woodcock-Munoz Tests of Achievement. Executive function was assessed through the Design Fluency Test for cognitive flexibility, the Stroop test for cognitive inhibition, and the Delayed Non-Match-to-Sample task for working memory. Behavioural and emotional functioning was evaluated through the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) questionnaire. Total and regional brain volume was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: IL-6 was inversely associated with adaptive skills (beta = -0.228; p = 0.030), while TNF-alpha was related to mathematics (beta = -0.198; p = 0.034). In addition, CRP was positively associated with externalizing (beta = 0.246; p = 0.046) and internalizing problems (beta = 0.234; p = 0.039), as well as the behavioural symptoms index (beta = 0.236; p = 0.047). However, these significant associations disappeared after multiple comparisons correction. Inflammatory biomarkers were not associated with executive function and total brain volumes. Regarding regional brain analyses, WBC was positively associated with gray matter volume in the left middle temporal gyms (beta = 0.387; p < 0.001, k = 44), and CRP was positively associated with gray matter volume in the right superior temporal gyms (beta = 0.439; p < 0.001, k = 29). Additionally, when adjusting by total brain volume, CRP was positively associated with gray matter volume in the right supplementary motor cortex (beta = 0.453; p < 0.001, k = 51). Moreover, both, IL-6 (beta = 0.366; p < 0.001, k = 81) and TNF-alpha(beta = 0.368; p < 0.001, k = 62) were positively associated with white matter volume around the right inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis, while CRP was inversely associated with white matter volume around the left superior frontalgyrus (beta = -0.482; p < 0.001, k = 82). After adjusting by total brain volume, CRP was also inversely associated with white matter volume in 3 additional clusters (beta ranging from -0.473 to -0.404; p < 0.001, k = 87).
   Conclusions: Inflammation was slightly associated with brain health (i.e., academic performance, behavioural and emotional functioning and regional brain volume) in children with overweight or obesity. Further larger longitudinal and interventional studies are warranted to elucidate the short-term and long-term effect of systemic low-grade inflammation on children's brain health.

AB Deficits in executive function have been associated with internalizing problems in children. Yet little is known about the mechanisms that may explain this association. Using longitudinal data across elementary school years (N = 1,364), this study examined the role of peer difficulty and poor academic performance in understanding longitudinal associations between executive function and internalizing problems. Executive function was measured in first grade with observed tasks and standardized tests. Peer difficulty and academic performance were reported by teachers and/or mothers at three waves. Internalizing problems were reported by mothers at four waves. Using structural equation modeling, results demonstrated that peer difficulty and poor academic performance independently mediated longitudinal relations between executive function and internalizing problems. Findings highlighted the importance of children's functioning in key identity domains in understanding the adverse impact of inferior executive function on internalizing problems in school-age children.

AB Background: Evidence suggests that externalizing and internalizing symptoms are expressed early in life and are associated with problematic drinking in young adulthood. However, few studies have examined their role during childhood and adolescence in predicting alcohol problems later in life. Objectives: To examine the role of childhood and adolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms in predicting alcohol use disorders in young adulthood. Methods: We searched five electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Sciences and Embase) for studies which diagnosed alcohol use disorders through either the International Classification of Diseases or American Psychiatric Association - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria and followed up children or adolescents into the transition to young adulthood. We performed a meta-analysis and obtained pooled odds ratio estimates with 95% confidence intervals using random-effects models. Results: A total of 12 longitudinal studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. All measured the outcome using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. The majority were of good quality and were conducted in the United States. A total of 19,407 participants (50% female) were included in this meta-analysis. Of these, n = 2337 (12%) had diagnoses of alcohol use disorders/alcohol dependence. Participant ages ranged from birth to 36 years. Internalizing symptoms increased the risk of young adult alcohol use disorders by 21% (odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval = [1.05, 1.39]), with no strong evidence of publication bias. Subgroup analysis suggested significantly lower heterogeneity than for externalizing studies. Externalizing symptoms increased the risk of alcohol use disorders by 62% (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval = [1.39, 1.90]). We found some evidence of publication bias and significant heterogeneity in the studies. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the contribution of early behavioural problems to the development of alcohol use disorders in young adulthood and the need for timely scrutiny of and intervention on early behavioural problems.

AB Although Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) is a widely used anxiety measure in many countries around the world, until now, research has barely focused on the usefulness of the parent version (SCAS-P) in young children. This study examines the psychometric properties and the factor structure of the SCAS-P in a Spanish community sample of 181 children aged 6-8 years (M = 6.87, SD = 0.78). Confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit of the original six-factor model to the Spanish sample. The internal consistency and the test-retest reliability of the scale were high. Regarding the validity of this measure, higher and significant correlations between the SCAS-P and internalizing problems and lower correlations with externalizing problems were obtained, as found in the original version. Girls seemed to show more anxiety problems than boys, but no significant differences were found. The results suggest that the SCAS-P is an adequate measure to assess anxious symptomatology in young children. The availability of measures with good psychometric properties allows psychologists to assess and carry out a correct and early diagnosis of anxiety disorders in children, making possible an early clinical intervention.

AB This study explored the growth of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) frequency over 2.5 years in a clinical sample of adolescent girls. Following a functional model of NSSI, the contribution of emotion dysregulation, peer victimization, and psychological maladjustment were evaluated as the predictors of NSSI trajectories. Participants of 99 girls (M-age = 16.03 years) were admitted for psychiatric hospitalization, who responded to questionnaires assessing NSSI, emotion dysregulation, relational and overt peer victimization, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. NSSI was also assessed at 6 months and 2.5 years following the baseline assessment. Linear mixed modeling estimated NSSI frequency over time. The findings highlight the stable nature of NSSI and the contribution of emotion dysregulation and internalizing symptoms to NSSI patterns. Peer victimization and externalizing behavior problems were not the significant predictors. Developing interventions targeting these NSSI predictors early in girls' development may prevent the emergence and maintenance of NSSI.

AB Aim Documented evidence shows that training in life skills for school going children improves their physical and mental health status. Although Kenya has a curriculum and a policy for life-skills training in schools, these have not been implemented because lack of local evidence for efficacy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of the life-skill training curriculum for primary schools developed by the Ministry of Education, Kenya. Methods We randomly selected 23 schools from two randomly selected sub-counties representing urban/peri-urban and rural contexts in Kenya. We collected baseline socio-demographic characteristics and administered the locally validated youth self-report (YSR) for 11 to 18 years old at baseline and 9 months post-intervention. We used the Ministry of Education validated curriculum for life-skills training for upper primary school as the intervention immediately after the baseline. Results The World Health Organization life-skills training is efficacious in reducing YSR scores in primary school going children in Kenya. We found that socio-demographic characteristics were predictors for mental health and that there were significant positive improvements in internalizing and externalizing YSR symptoms and syndromes in both sites. The improvement was over 40% and therefore unlikely to be attributable to placebo effect or natural recovery without intervention. However, attention problems worsened more so in rural sites and particularly in girls. Conclusions Life-skills training is efficacious in improving mental health in school going children in the Kenyan context. However, it is not effective in attention problems which seem to be cognitive in nature.

AB Aims (a) To investigate the utility of childhood PE as a predictor of adolescent psychopathology while accounting for three known risk factors: childhood mental disorder; traumatic experiences and poor childhood functioning, and (b) to investigate the additive effects of including childhood PE in predictive clinical model of adolescent psychopathology. Method The study sample comprised of 86 Irish youths who completed two waves of the "Adolescent Brain Development" study (baseline age: 11.7 and follow-up age: 15.7). At baseline, participants completed a clinical interview assessing for PE, mental disorders, traumatic experiences and global functioning in childhood. The internalizing and externalizing problems sub-scales from the Youth Self Report questionnaire were used as follow-up outcomes variables in adolescence. Results Logistic regression analyses revealed that childhood PE was the only predictor significantly associated with both internalizing (univariate OR: 7.58, CI: 2.59-22.15; multivariate OR: 5.43, CI: 1.53-19.29) and externalizing (univariate OR: 11.76, CI: 3.70-37.41; multivariate OR: 30.39, CI: 5.28-174.80) problems in adolescence. All predictive models with PE significantly predicted adolescent outcomes (area under the curve range: 0.70-0.81; all P < 0.05) and adding PE to the models improved the predictive value for externalizing problems (P = 0.02). Conclusion Childhood PE is a powerful predictor of adolescent psychopathology, particularly for externalizing problems. Routine assessment of PE and targeted support for children who report PE may reduce the incidence of mental disorder in adolescence.

AB Objectives Dispositional mindfulness (DM) has emerged as an important mental health factor. DM contains many dimensions; however, each dimension's specific role and the mechanisms through which they contribute toward health are not yet clear. Therefore, this study's primary goal is to examine whether DM dimensions attenuate the association between stress and internalizing/externalizing problems in adolescents. Methods The study involved a sample of 737 participants (51.2% girls) aged from 12 to 18 years. They completed measures of five dimensions of mindfulness, stressors, and psychological symptoms (somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and rule-breaking behavior) at the beginning of the study, and the latter (measures of psychological symptoms) were completed again at a 6-month follow-up. Results All increased DM dimensions, except non-reactivity and non-judging, were found to predict fewer psychological problems over time, with acting with awareness being especially prominent (p = .02). Increased describing and non-judging were found to attenuate positive associations between stress and symptoms (p = .03), whereas observing increased this association (p < .05). Moreover, an interaction between DM dimensions emerged, increased non-judging predicted less internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youth with higher levels of acting with awareness (p = .02). Conclusions Future intervention studies could include techniques to improve the capacity for acting with awareness, and the inclusion of techniques aimed at enhancing other dimensions should be conditioned by the nature of the psychological problems that are being targeted in each intervention.

AB Background Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk factor for internalizing psychopathology (IP). ELA is also linked to alterations in neural phenotypes of emotion processing and maladaptive emotion regulatory strategies, such as ruminative brooding, in adulthood. We therefore expected that ELA would predict cortical brain activation to emotional faces in transdiagnostic IP and in turn, mediate the extent of rumination amongst patients with IPs and ELA (IP + ELA). Method One hundred and thirty-two individuals, including 102 treatment-seeking adults with heterogeneous IPs and 30 healthy controls (HCs) performed an Emotional Face-Matching Task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain analyses compared HC (n = 30), IP (n = 52), and IP + ELA (n = 50) neural responses to emotional (angry, fearful, happy, and sad) faces v. shapes, controlling for depression and anxiety symptoms. Parameter estimates of activation were extracted for significant between-group differences and tested as a mediator of ruminative brooding in IP + ELA. Results IP + ELA demonstrated increased activation in the superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (fear), superior parietal lobule, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal gyrus (fear only), and cuneus (fear and angry). These regions were preferentially correlated with ruminative brooding in IP + ELA, many of which mediated the link between IP + ELA and ruminative brooding. Conclusions Results provide evidence that ELA history amongst IP patients augments engagement of brain regions involved in emotion processing, above and beyond what is accounted for by current symptoms. Though longitudinal designs are needed, alterations in the neural correlates of maladaptive processing of socio-emotional information may be a common pathway by which ELA poses risk for psychopathology.

AB There is growing interest in the development of behavioral parent interventions targeting emotional and behavioral problems in children with autism spectrum disorders. Such interventions have potential to improve a number of child and parental well-being outcomes beyond disruptive child behavior. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses evidence for the efficacy of behavioral parent interventions for disruptive and hyperactive child behavior in autism spectrum disorders, as well as parenting efficacy and stress. A total of 11 articles from nine randomized controlled trials were included. Sufficient data were available to calculate standardized mean difference and show favorable effects of behavioral parent interventions on parent-reported measures of child disruptive behavior (standardized mean difference = 0.67), hyperactivity (standardized mean difference = 0.31) and parent stress (standardized mean difference = 0.37); effects on parent efficacy are less clear (standardized mean difference = 0.39, p = 0.17). There were insufficient data to explore intervention effects on internalizing behavior in autism spectrum disorders, parenting behaviors, or observational and teacher-reported outcomes, providing important avenues for future research. This review adds to growing evidence of the efficacy of behavioral parent interventions for child behavior and parental well-being in autism spectrum disorders (Prospero: CRD42016033979).

AB Supportive school services are a primary service modality for youth with autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder, as well as co-occurring psychiatric symptoms and low intellectual abilities, interfere with academic achievement and therefore influence decisions about school services. Therefore, we examined the association of parent, teacher, and clinician ratings of autism spectrum disorder and co-occurring psychiatric symptom severity and intellectual functioning with school services. In total, 283 youth with autism spectrum disorder were assessed with clinical evaluation via the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and parent and teacher versions of the CASI-4R (Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory). Full Scale Intelligence Quotient scores were obtained from case records. Clinical and teacher evaluations of autism spectrum disorder severity predicted services and were more strongly associated with school services than parent ratings. Teacher ratings were only associated with common school services (e.g. speech/language therapy, occupational therapy, and/or social skills training) frequency at medium and high levels of clinician-rated autism spectrum disorder severity. Higher IQ and parent-rated externalizing symptoms predicted lower likelihood of receiving school services, whereas internalizing symptoms were not predictive of school services. Autism spectrum disorder symptoms may overshadow externalizing and internalizing symptoms when considering school service supports. Results highlight the importance of evaluating autism spectrum disorder severity via multiple sources, especially in cases of unclear symptom presentation, when examining correlates of school services for youth with autism spectrum disorder.

AB There is growing evidence supporting the individual associations of maternal occupation and maternal education with children's behavioral outcomes. However, few studies have linked these factors together in a mediation model. The current study is the first to examine the mediating effect of maternal occupational skillfulness on the relationship between the length of maternal education and preschool children's behavioral outcomes in the Chinese context. To assess children's behavior, parents and teachers of 286 preschoolers from the China Jintan Cohort Study completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF), respectively. Sociodemographic information, such as maternal occupational skillfulness and education level, was also collected. Using PROCESS and kappa statistics, maternal occupational skillfulness was found to mediate the effect of length of maternal education on both internalizing and externalizing behaviors of preschoolers, as rated by parents but not on behaviors as rated by teachers. Such findings can provide insight for counseling psychologists or family therapists in providing mothers, particularly those in low-skill jobs, appropriate advice and strategies for handling job-related stress. Mother-child relationships would consequently improve, which could then minimize the development of children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, teachers could identify at-risk children and provide early intervention. Our findings also offer insight for policy makers to consider legislation providing financial assistance from the government to low-income mothers. Future replication studies should be conducted in other countries so as to determine whether similar results can be obtained.

AB Family accommodation (FA) has been linked with myriad negative outcomes in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but extant literature has yielded differential relationships between FA and clinical variables of interest. Consequently, this study examined the phenomenology, clinical profile, and effects of comorbid psychopathology on FA to better understand these behaviors. A total of 150 youths and their caregivers completed clinician- and self-reported measures at a baseline visit for a larger randomized controlled trial. Sociodemographic variables were not associated with FA, but specific types of OCD symptom clusters were. Higher OC-symptom severity and functional impairment were associated with increased FA. Comorbid anxiety disorders moderated the relationship between OC-symptom severity and FA, but comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, and mood disorders did not. Internalizing and externalizing problems both mediated the relationship between FA and functional impairment. These findings provide clinical implications for important treatment targets and factors that may impact FA.

AB Eating disorders are a serious, life-threating condition impacting adolescents and young adults. Providers in primary care settings have an important role in identifying disordered eating (DE) symptoms. Unfortunately, symptoms go undetected in 50% of patients in medical settings. Using the behavioral health screen, this study identified DE risk profiles in a sample of 3620 female adolescents and young adults (ages 14-24), presenting in primary care. A latent class analysis with twenty psychosocial factors identified three DE risk groups. The group at highest risk for DE was characterized by endorsement of internalizing symptoms and a history of trauma. The next risk group consisted of those with externalizing symptoms, particularly substance use. The group at lowest risk for DE reported more time spent with friends compared to their peers. Primary care providers and psychiatric teams can benefit from knowing the psychosocial risk patterns affiliated with DE, and using brief, comprehensive screening tools to identify these symptoms.

AB We investigated the developmental pathways by which bullying perpetration and victimization, anxiety, and disordered eating behavior were related. Participants were drawn from the Canadian McMaster Teen Study. From Grade 5-8 (age 10-14), students (n = 657) were assessed on bullying involvement and symptoms of anxiety, and in Grade 7 and 8, students additionally completed a measure of clinically significant disordered eating behavior. Bullying victimization initiated a cascading effect on bullying perpetration, which subsequently led to disordered eating behavior. Anxiety had direct effects on disordered eating behavior at multiple time points and initiated a cascading effect on bullying victimization, and subsequently, perpetration. There was no evidence of moderation by sex. Bullying perpetration and anxiety may serve as early signals of eating pathology. Bullying prevention programs may attenuate the risk of disordered eating in both sexes, and the high continuity of disordered eating behavior suggests that early intervention is critical.

   RESPONSES
AB Single-session interventions (SSIs) can help reduce youth psychopathology, but SSIs may benefit some youths more than others. Identifying predictors of SSIs' effectiveness may clarify youths' likelihoods of benefitting from an SSI alone, versus requiring further treatment. We tested whether pre-to-post-SSI shifts in hypothesized symptom change mechanisms predicted subsequent reductions in youth internalizing symptoms. Data were from a trial evaluating whether an SSI teaching growth mindset (the belief that personality is malleable) reduced youth anxiety and depression. Youths (N = 96, ages 12-15) self-reported growth mindsets, perceived primary control, and perceived secondary control pre- and immediately post-intervention. They self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms at pre-intervention and 3, 6, and 9-month follow-ups. Larger immediate increases in primary control predicted steeper depressive symptoms declines across the follow-up; larger immediate increases in secondary control predicted steeper anxiety symptoms declines. Immediate shifts in proximal intervention "targets" may predict longer-term response to an SSI for youth internalizing distress.

AB Background Child anxiety sensitivity (AS) is measured almost exclusively using the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI). Yet, in the context of significant discrepancies regarding the CASI factors and how they are scored and reported, it remains unclear whether the CASI reliably and validly assesses the purported multifactorial AS construct. Objective This paper will: (1) provide a comprehensive summary of previous CASI factor analyses by which these factor structures were identified, (2) evaluate evidence regarding the multifactorial nature of AS in youth, and (3) discuss potential directions for continued research in this area. Method In a PsycInfo search, peer-reviewed studies published between 1991 and 2018 were identified for inclusion if they examined the factor structure of the CASI or reported data on the CASI subscales as administered to child participants. Results Findings from the 50 studies reviewed suggested that (1) the 18-item CASI does not consistently yield internally reliable assessments of specific AS facets, (2) significant discrepancies exist regarding the CASI subscales identified, the items comprising these scales, and their predictive validity in terms of anxiety, and (3) alternatives to assess the multifactorial construct of AS in youth do exist, but they have not been systematically examined in the literature. Conclusions Directions for future study include further examining expanded scales for AS in youth, continued study of shorter scales assessing more consistently reliable AS content, and evaluating the utility of an expanded response scale for the CASI.

AB Objectives A growing body of literature has examined differences in the mental health and social support of abused women living in shelters compared with women from the community. However, less attention has been given to the differential effects of living in shelters and living with abusive partner in both mothers and children. A cross-sectional study was carried out to examine differences on cortisol awakening response (CAR), depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms, and social support in a Portuguese sample of women living in shelter compared to women living with abusive partner. Mothers also reported on their children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Methods The sample included 162 mothers and their children (4-10 years of age), of whom 81 were living with the abusive partner and 81 were living in shelters. Results After adjusting for covariates, mothers living in shelters showed better psychological, physiological and social functioning. In contrast, children living in shelters displayed higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms compared with children living at home with their mothers and abusive partners. Conclusions This study suggests that for women, shelter residence may be helpful for mental health and for significant improvements in perceived social support, but for children, the results seem to suggest that they are not benefiting from the time they spend at shelter. Future studies using samples from women in shelters need to evaluate if the services offered are suitable for children's needs.

AB Objectives Research has shown a link between parental and offspring internalizing problems and that parental warmth and overprotection affect these relationships. However, less research has examined how parental warmth and overprotection affect the link between parental internalizing problems and irritability in adolescents. Thus, the current study investigated the moderating effect of parental warmth and overprotection on the relationship between parental internalizing problems and adolescent irritability in the context of parent and child gender. Methods Participants were parents of adolescents aged 10-24 years and completed surveys online about themselves, the adolescent, and the adolescent's other primary caregiver. Questionnaires assessed parental warmth and overprotection, parental internalizing problems, and adolescent irritability. Results Results indicated a moderating effect of parental warmth (b = -0.08, p< 0.01) and overprotection (b = 0.21, p< 0.01) on the relationship between parental internalizing problems and adolescent irritability. Parent and child gender further moderated the relationship when examining parental overprotection (b = -0.16, p< 0.01) but not parental warmth. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of examining factors, such as parental internalizing problems, warmth, and overprotection, that influence the development of irritability symptoms in adolescents. Additionally, results highlight the importance of examining how gender moderates these relationships. For example, the effect of maternal overprotection on male adolescents was particularly important, which suggests that more research should be done to further understand the complex nature of this relationship.

AB Objectives Parents' early school involvement is central to successful school transition. However, results of parenting programs aimed at improving kindergarten transition for children from disadvantaged backgrounds are inconclusive and the achievement gap is increasing. Using a family resilience model, we examine relationships between a set of parenting resilience and risk factors, Kindergarteners' social-emotional readiness, and reading achievement in a sample of families with low-incomes using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten (ECLS-K 1998-99) dataset. Methods Using Structural Equation Modeling, we estimated direct and indirect relationships between parenting processes and children's social-emotional readiness and reading achievement. Parenting factors were latent variables in our model, and included parenting stress, discipline practices, family rules, parent-school involvement, home involvement, and cultural involvement. Mediating variables were indicators of social-emotional readiness including, approaches to learning, self-control, interpersonal skills, externalizing, and internalizing problem behaviors. Results School involvement and approaches to learning directly influenced kindergarten reading achievement. Parenting stress was negatively related to reading achievement through approaches to learning. Parent-school involvement was positively related to achievement through approaches to learning and negatively through self-control. Approaches to learning partially mediated the relationship between parent-school involvement and reading outcomes, and fully mediated the relationship between parenting stress and reading outcomes. Conclusions Kindergarten children's approaches to learning (attention, persistence, organization, and flexibility) may be a helpful focus of intervention for Kindergarten transition. For families with low SES, interventions that target parenting stress, approaches to learning, and reading achievement should be of particular concern for educators.

AB Objectives This study tested the separate and combined effects of father involvement and paternal incarceration on child internalizing and externalizing behaviors at 9 years of age. Methods Our sample contains completed interviews of 2652 fathers, 3515 mothers, and 3377 children. The mean age of fathers was 28 at child age 9. Multiple regression analysis of secondary data was conducted from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a national study that followed a cohort of low-income married and unmarried parents and their young children living in 20 US cities. Results Higher socioeconomic status and greater father involvement were associated with lower child internalizing and externalizing behaviors, while paternal incarceration for property crimes was associated with greater externalizing in boys and internalizing in girls. Incarceration for drug crimes was associated with lower father involvement. Conclusions Multiple regression analyses confirmed the independent effects of father involvement on child internalizing and externalizing, but the incarceration for property crimes effects were attenuated and moderated by SES.

AB Background Predictions of two different models for suicide attempts (SA) over 12 months, as differentially impacted by specific school-based suicide prevention interventions, were compared. These were as follows: (a) interpersonal theory (IPTS) and (b) a two-pathway model, one path associated with externalizing symptoms and continuum of self-harm behaviors, and the other with internalizing symptoms. Methods Self-report questionnaires were completed by 11,110 high school students from ten EU countries enrolled in the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study. Baseline measures included perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness from parents and peers, health risk behaviors, self-injury, suicide ideation (SI), and attempts (SA). SI and SA were reassessed at 12-month follow-up. Each model's predictions of SI and SA groups over time (i.e., repeated SA, remitted SA, SA onset, and no SA) were estimated in the no intervention/control group. The superior model was estimated across intervention groups. Results Interpersonal theory showed better fit compared to the two-pathway model. In partial agreement with IPTS predictions, parental low belongingness but not peer belongingness or burdensomeness predicted greater likelihood of SI. The likelihood of repeated SA versus no SA was higher among adolescents who reported SI, self-injury, risk behaviors, and particularly both SI and self-injury. All three interventions attenuated the combined effect of SI and self-injury. Youth Aware of Mental Health Program (YAM) additionally decreased the effect of risk behaviors on the likelihood of repeated SA. Conclusions Interpersonal theory assumptions were partially supported. Perceived interpersonal difficulties with parents were primarily related with SI, and risk behaviors and self-injury were important predictors of SA. Suicide prevention interventions may be effective by mitigating the hazardous effect of varying self-harm behaviors and may be further advanced by increasing parental involvement.

AB Aim To assess the role of the TAND (tuberous sclerosis complex [TSC] associated neuropsychiatric disorders) checklist as a screening tool for neuropsychiatric pathology, to evaluate behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and related parental stress in children with TSC, and to analyze associations between parental stress, TAND findings, and TSC pathology. Method This is a prospective cohort study including 22 individuals from a national TSC surveillance study in Germany using demographic and clinical data, the TAND checklist, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI). Results Mean (standard deviation) age at follow-up was 4 years (3 years 9 months), and 13/22 of patients were male. Seventeen children had epilepsy (focal: 9; generalized: 4; infantile spasms: 4). Developmental delay was diagnosed in 12/22 patients. The most prevalent TAND items were anxiety and mood swings in 10/22 children. At least one TAND item was reported by 17/22 patients, internalizing symptoms by 10/22, and externalizing symptoms by 11/22. In contrast, only one patient had a clinically relevant score in the CBCL scales. Of 22 parents, 12 reported clinically relevant parental stress due to both child and parenting factors. Higher total parental stress was associated with a higher TAND externalizing score ( r = 0.49; p = 0.028) and TAND total score ( r = 0.51; p = 0.016), a higher CBCL total score ( r = 0.59; p = 0.005), and the number of antiepileptic drugs ( r = 0.50; p = 0.017). Developmental delay was correlated with child stress factors ( r = 0.48; p = 0.023). Interpretation The TAND checklist appears to be a promising screening tool for neuropsychiatric problems in very young children with TSC. Parental stress in children with TSC is modified by TSC-related pathology, both neuropsychiatric and neurological.

AB Emotion dysregulation has been associated with increased risks for psychopathology. During adolescence when the onset of mental illnesses peak, emotion dysregulation may be particularly problematic. In this study, we examined transactional associations between young adolescents' self-report of their emotion dysregulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression at three assessments over 3 years. Participants were 391 Australian students (56% female; 79% White/Caucasian) in Grades 6 to 8 followed until Grades 9 to 11. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), emotion dysregulation was a latent variable indicated by lack of emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotional responses, impulse control difficulties, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior. A sixth aspect of emotion dysregulation, lack of emotional awareness, which was not correlated with the other five subscales, was examined separately in the SEM. Transactional associations over time were identified between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of social anxiety and depression, with adolescents higher in emotion dysregulation at Time 1 (T1) reporting higher social anxiety and depressive symptoms between T1 and Time 2 (T2), and T2 emotion dysregulation predicting increases in adolescents' depression, but not social anxiety, symptoms from T2 to Time 3 (T3), after controlling for baseline symptoms. In addition, earlier social anxiety, but not depressive, symptom level at T2 was significantly associated with later emotion dysregulation between T2 and T3, after baseline emotion dysregulation was controlled. Furthermore, girls were higher in emotion dysregulation, social anxiety, and depression than boys, but sex did not moderate temporal links between emotion dysregulation and symptoms.

   PERSONALITY
AB The present article deals with various eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and obesity with a focus on anorexia and bulimia, which have a clear onset in adolescence. Because disturbed eating and weight control are also phenomena in normal girls of this age, eating disorders have to be considered from the perspective of developmental psychology and developmental psychopathology. Body image disorders, disturbed eating habits, and the influence of the family are placed in the context of normal girl development. Since 40 years, a more negative body image of girls as compared with boys has been found in research. Further, the more negative effect of early maturation on body image and dieting in girls is a robust finding in many studies since decades. The role of fathers in establishing a more positive body image and as a stress buffer, especially in early maturing girls, has been frequently overlooked in the past, but was, however, established in more recent studies. These studies also show the long-term effects of a positive body concept for partnerships in the future, in young adulthood. Thus, long-term outcomes of a negative body concept are far more significant and affect not only nutrition and weight control. Family support and nonjudgmental, non-body-related commentary on weight and attractiveness given by parents are very important here. Even with non-eating-impaired adolescents, extreme dieting, fearful body control, as well as problematic parental communication styles have been found. Recent studies revealed a rather high prevalence of psychological disturbances of mothers of anorexic and bulimic patients. This underscores that the mothers are particularly challenged when dealing with their daughters' extreme diets and weight control, which is certainly hard for the mother being diagnosed as depressed, anxious, or having a personality disorder. In this overview, the influence of friends and the new media is also assessed. This indicates often stressful interactions with peers, which are quite typical even in normal girls. Extreme social comparison and rumination as a negative form of communication between girls were described. Therefore, it is difficult to limit the issue to pathological phenomena. In this context, it is important to note that there are high comorbidities between different eating disorders and with internalizing and externalizing mental disorders. The high comorbidity makes it difficult to develop a treatment plan. Historical phenomena such as the "holy anorexia" of the past centuries, the currently observable increase in eating disorders in boys, and the desire to change gender (transgender) are considered, as well as cultural influences ("Is fat beautiful?"). In this context, the question is raised of whether eating disorders have increased and what contribution the new media may have.

AB Sleep problems and insufficient sleep duration can lead to long-term and sustained impairment of psychological health. Disturbed sleep is a frequent phenomenon in childhood and adolescence. It is associated with lower academic achievement, attention difficulties, increased aggressive behavior, and depressive symptoms. Most studies focus on poor sleep quality in terms of sleep problems or insufficient sleep duration, indicating low sleep quantity to be related to psychosocial health. However, there is a scarcity of studies that consider the effects both of sleep quality and of sleep quantity at the same time. Moreover, gender may influence the relationship between disturbed sleep and psychopathology, but gender-specific studies are rare. Therefore, the present paper investigates whether boys and girls who report sleep problems and insufficient sleep duration have a higher risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. The current data represent secondary analyses of a large German epidemiological study (German Health Survey of Children and Adolescents, KIGGS). The data of 3,414 boys and 3,256 girls were separated into two age groups (11-13 years and 14-17 years) in order to analyze sleep duration, sleep problems, and psychiatric abnormalities, the later determined using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Boys and girls with sleep problems showed a higher risk probability of internalizing and externalizing symptoms (OR = 1.52-3.38) in both age groups. While the presence of sleep problems increased the risk probability of internalizing and externalizing problems in both genders, insufficient sleep duration did so only in girls. Insufficient sleep duration increased the risk of abnormal scores on the emotional problems scale (OR11-13 = 1.70, OR14-17 = 1.56) and for the total score (OR11-13 = 1.48, OR14-17 = 1.66) only in girls of both age groups. Older girls who reported insufficient sleep duration had a higher risk of abnormal scores on the peer problems scale (OR = 1.36) while younger girls showed a higher risk of abnormal scores on the hyperactivity / inattentiveness scale (OR = 1.64) and on the conduct problems scale (OR = 1.78). It can be concluded that there is an association between sleep problems and psychiatric symptoms in different areas in boys and girls and across a wide age range. Insufficient sleep duration, by contrast, only appears to be a risk factor for psychological abnormalities in girls. These gender differences should be taken into account in future studies. A limitation of the presented study was that sleep duration and sleep problems were only assessed using one question each and no sleep-related questionnaire was employed. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that disturbed sleep may be a warning sign for worsened mental health states and should therefore be addressed in pediatric and psychiatric care.

AB When compared to one another, multiple informants' reports of adolescent internalizing problems often reveal low convergence. This creates challenges in the delivery of clinical services, particularly for severe outcomes linked to internalizing problems, namely suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Clinicians would benefit from methods that facilitate interpretation of multi-informant reports, particularly in inpatient settings typified by high-cost care and high-stakes decision-making. 765 adolescent inpatients (70.3% female; M-age = 14.7) and their parents completed measures of adolescent internalizing problems. We obtained baseline clinical and treatment characteristics from electronic medical records. Latent class analysis revealed four reporting patterns: Parent-Adolescent Low (LL; 49.0%), Parent Low-Adolescent High (PL-AH; 11.5%), Parent High-Adolescent Low (PH-AL; 21.8%), Parent-Adolescent High (HH; 17.6%). Relative to the LL class, adolescents in the PH-AL and PL-AH classes were more likely to be admitted with suicidality. In terms of treatment characteristics and relative to the LL class, HH and PH-AL adolescents were more likely to receive standing antipsychotics, PH-AL adolescents were more likely to be in seclusion, and HH adolescents had longer hospital stays. At discharge and relative to the LL class, HH, PH-AL, and PL-AH adolescents were more likely to receive an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Further, HH, PH-AL, and PL-AH adolescents were more likely to receive partial hospitalization or care in another restrictive environment after inpatient treatment, relative to the LL class. This naturalistic study informs clinical decision-making by aiding our understanding of how multi-informant reports facilitate interpretations of adolescents' clinical presentations as well as predictions about treatment characteristics.

AB Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to experiencing loneliness, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms. These internalizing problems often co-occur but, until now, it remains unclear how they are associated over time. Insight in these temporal sequences is important to enhance our understanding of how internalizing problems arise and may reinforce each other over time. To examine these temporal sequences, three samples of adolescents were used: Sample 1 consisted of 1,116 adolescents (48.97% girls, M-age = 13.59), Sample 2 of 1,423 adolescents (52.42% girls, M-age = 13.79), and Sample 3 of 549 adolescents (62.66% girls, M-age = 14.82). Adolescents filled out well-established self-report measures of loneliness, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms during regular school hours at three measurement occasions with a 1-year interval. Meta-analytic techniques were used to estimate the average true effects across three-variable autoregressive cross-lagged models in the three samples. In addition, indirect effects and gender differences in the temporal associations were explored in all three samples. The results suggest that social anxiety symptoms play a crucial role as potential antecedent of emerging feelings of loneliness and depression in adolescence. In addition, in line with theoretical expectations, our results suggest the presence of a vicious cycle between adolescents' feelings of loneliness and social anxiety symptoms. The indirect effects were inconsistent across samples and no gender differences were found. These findings shed more light on the unique temporal relationships among different internalizing problems. Clinical interventions should target social anxiety symptoms to prevent feelings of loneliness and vice versa.

AB Self-inflicted injury (SII) in adolescence is a serious public health concern that portends prospective vulnerability to internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, borderline personality development, suicide attempts, and suicide. To date, however, our understanding of neurobiological vulnerabilities to SII is limited. Behaviorally, affect dysregulation is common among those who self-injure. This suggests ineffective cortical modulation of emotion, as observed among adults with borderline personality disorder. In borderline samples, structural and functional abnormalities are observed in several frontal regions that subserve emotion regulation (e.g., anterior cingulate, insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). However, no volumetric analyses of cortical brain regions have been conducted among self-injuring adolescents. We used voxel-based morphometry to compare cortical gray matter volumes between self-injuring adolescent girls, ages 13-19 years (n = 20), and controls (n = 20). Whole-brain analyses revealed reduced gray matter volumes among self-injurers in the insular cortex bilaterally, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus, an adjacent neural structure also implicated in emotion and self-regulation. Insular and inferior frontal gyrus gray matter volumes correlated inversely with self-reported emotion dysregulation, over-and-above effects of psychopathology. Findings are consistent with an emotion dysregulation construal of SII, and indicate structural abnormalities in some but not all cortical brain regions implicated in borderline personality disorder among adults.

AB Drawing on five waves of longitudinal data from 392 families (52% female; mean age of wave 1 [M-age_W1] = 12.89, standard deviation [SD] = .48; M-age_W5 = 21.95, SD = .77; 199 European American and 193 Mexican American families; 217 intact and 175 stepfather families), this study documented transactional relations of mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms with youth's symptomatology from early adolescence to young adulthood. Trait and time-varying cross-lagged models revealed that both mothers' and fathers' between- and within-person differences in depressive symptoms were associated with youth's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Whereas each parent's depressive symptoms uniquely contributed to youth's internalizing symptoms, however, only mothers' depressive symptoms influenced youth's externalizing symptoms. Although reciprocal effects of youth's internalizing symptoms on parents' depressive symptoms were not significant, youth's externalizing symptoms predicted changes in mothers' depressive symptoms over time. Moderation analyses revealed distinct transactional patterns by family ethnicity and child gender, but not by family structure. This study revealed dynamic transactions among family members' symptomatology that point to opportune times and targets for intervention efforts aimed at mitigating the negative impact of parents' depressive symptoms on youth's adjustment.

AB The current study examined trajectories of maternal and paternal depression in the year following the birth of an infant sibling, and relations with family risk factors and firstborn children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Latent class growth analysis was conducted on 231 families in a longitudinal investigation (prebirth and 1, 4, 8, and 12 months postbirth) and revealed four classes of families: both mother and father low in depressive symptoms (40.7%); mother high-father low (25.1%); father high-mother low (24.7%), and both mother and father high (9.5%). Families with both mothers and fathers high on depressive symptoms were higher on marital negativity, parenting stress, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems, and lower on marital positivity and parental efficacy than other classes. Children, parents, and marital relationships were more problematic in families with fathers higher on depressive symptoms than in families in which mothers were higher, indicating the significant role of paternal support for firstborn children undergoing the transition to siblinghood. Maternal and paternal depression covaried with an accumulation of family risks over time, no doubt increasing the likelihood of children's problematic adjustment after the birth of their infant sibling.

AB Emerging literature suggests fathers may contribute uniquely to child development and emotional health through play. In the present study, a multiple mediational model was analyzed using data from 476 families that participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. After accounting for infant-mother attachment, infant temperament, and family income and stability, a significant indirect effect from father-child play quality to adolescent internalizing symptoms was found through father-reported child emotional dysregulation, B = -.05, 95% confidence interval; CI [-.14, -.01]. Specifically, in first grade, dyads where fathers were rated highly on sensitivity and stimulation during play, and children demonstrated high felt security and affective mutuality during play, had children with fewer father-reported emotional dysregulation problems in third grade, B = -.23, 95% CI [-.39, -.06]. Children with fewer emotional dysregulation problems had lower self-reported internalizing symptoms at age 15, B = .23, 95% CI [.01, .45]. Mothers' ratings of children's emotional dysregulation were not a significant mediator. Results are discussed regarding the importance of father-child play for children's adjustment as well as the usefulness of inclusion of fathers in child developmental research.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the role of repeated exposure to rocket attacks in the links between personality vulnerability (dependency and self-criticism) and internalizing/externalizing psychopathology. A main-effect vulnerability model (personality leads to psychopathology) was compared with a main-effect scarring model (psychopathology leads to personality vulnerability). Also, a stress-diathesis pattern (personality vulnerability is activated under stress) was compared to a dual-vulnerability pattern (either personality vulnerability or stress, but not both, lead to psychopathology). Israeli adolescents (N = 362) repeatedly exposed to rocket attacks were assessed annually over 3 years. In 2008 and 2010, personality and psychopathology were assessed. Cumulative exposure was measured as the sums of exposure across the three assessment waves. Theoretical models were tested via Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Structural Equation Modeling analyses. Baseline dependency and self-criticism were associated with an increase in anxiety, whereas baseline depression was associated with an increase in dependency. Under low, not high, levels of rocket exposure, self-criticism and depression were longitudinally associated. Violence commission was associated with an increase in dependency under high, not low, cumulative exposure. Results are consistent with both scarring and vulnerability models, and with both stress-diathesis and dual-vulnerability patterns of adolescent risk and resilience.

AB Young sexual minority men (YSMM) experience more victimization and are at higher risk for mental health and substance use problems compared with heterosexual youth. We attempt to understand change over time in the experience of these constructs among YSMM. Data were taken from a diverse community-based sample of YSMM (N = 450, baseline mean age 18.93) surveyed every 6 months for 2.5 years. Multilevel modeling was used to model within-person change in victimization, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, alcohol frequency, marijuana use, and illicit drug use. We tested the indirect effect of concurrent and time-lagged victimization on the association between age and mental health and substance use. Victimization, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms decreased over time. Concurrent victimization was associated with higher internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, alcohol use, marijuana use, and illicit drug use. Analysis of indirect effects suggested that the association between victimization and mental health and substance use outcomes decreased as participants transitioned from adolescence into adulthood. This study found that the reduction in victimization that YSMM experience as they grow older is associated with a reduction in negative mental health and substance use outcomes. Prevention efforts to limit victimization exposure may reduce health disparities for YSMM.

AB This study examined changes in adolescents' perceived relationship quality with mothers and fathers from middle school to high school, gender differences, and associated mental health consequences using longitudinal data from the New England Study of Suburban Youth cohort (n = 262, 48% female) with annual assessments (Grades 6-12). For both parents, alienation increased, and trust and communication decreased from middle school to high school, with greater changes among girls. Overall, closeness to mothers was higher than with fathers. Girls, compared to boys, perceived more trust and communication and similar levels of alienation with mothers at Grade 6. Girls perceived stronger increases in alienation from both parents and stronger declines in trust with mothers during middle school. Increasing alienation from both parents and less trust with mothers at Grade 6 was associated with higher levels of anxiety at Grade 12. Less trust with both parents at Grade 6 and increasing alienation and decreasing trust with mothers in high school were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms at Grade 12. Overall, girls reported having higher levels of anxiety at Grade 12 compared to boys. Findings on the course of the quality of parent-adolescent relationships over time are discussed in terms of implications for more targeted research and interventions.

AB Identifying Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs in early childhood is essential for understanding etiological pathways of psychopathology. Our central goal was to identify early emotion knowledge and self-regulation difficulties across different RDoC domains and examine how they relate to typical versus atypical symptom trajectories between ages 3 and 10. Particularly, we assessed potential contributions of children's gender, executive control, delay of gratification, and regulation of frustration, emotion recognition, and emotion understanding at age 3 to co-occurring patterns of internalizing and externalizing across development. A total of 238 3-year-old boys and girls were assessed using behavioral tasks and parent reports and reassessed at ages 5 and 10 years. Results indicated that very few children developed "pure" internalizing or externalizing symptoms relative to various levels of co-occurring symptoms across development. Four classes of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems were identified: low, low-moderate, rising, and severe-decreasing trajectories. Three-year-old children with poor executive control but high emotion understanding were far more likely to show severe-decreasing than low/low-moderate class co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symptom patterns. Child gender and poor executive control differentiated children in rising versus low trajectories. Implications for early intervention targeting self-regulation of executive control are discussed.

AB Objective: Children living with parental cancer are vulnerable to distress and developmental disruption. This review aims to identify current interventions to support cancer patients' children and summarise how effective these are based on children's reports.
   Methods: Between 25 May 2015 and 6 August 2018, a broad search strategy was used to identify relevant references. Seven databases were searched, and grey literature was also vetted. This review was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and Cochrane guidelines.
   Results: Eight studies evaluating six interventions were retained. Research designs and interventions were heterogenous, and study quality was low. A limited number of significant results were reported by studies. These evidenced improvement for PTSD symptoms, emotional regulation, and depression. However, overall current interventions do not appear effective among patients' children.
   Conclusion: Despite encouraging preliminary findings, interventions do not yet adequately support cancer patients' children. There is a need for more tailored and targeted interventions. A theoretical model conceptualising the impact of parental cancer may assist this.
   Practice implications: Findings will assist future intervention research by promoting standardised levels of care among cancer patients' children, that is empirically supported, effective, and meets principles of non-maleficence. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Suicide ideation and behavior remains a significant public policy concern. The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide posits that thwarted belongingness potentiates risk for suicide. Early disruptions in caregiving have documented effects on lifespan social and interpersonal development, and therefore warrants further investigation in suicide research. This novel study investigates risk for suicide ideation conferred by infant-onset child maltreatment and oxytocin genotypes (OXTR and CD38) and tests interactive effects of genetics and early maltreatment experiences.
   Methods: Participants (N = 251) were from a longitudinal follow-up study of emerging adults who participated in a research summer camp program as children (wave 1). Childhood maltreatment was coded from child protective service records and buccal cells were obtained from children and genotyped. At wave 2, self-reported suicide ideation and internalizing symptomatology were obtained.
   Results: Maltreatment onset in infancy was significantly related to lifetime suicide ideation. The CD38 gene variation moderated this association such that early onset maltreatment was related to suicide ideation among C-carriers only. The OXTR gene did not relate to lifetime suicide ideation, nor did it moderate early onset maltreatment risk.
   Limitations: This study was conducted with a relatively small sample, necessitating the combination of genotypes into binary groups. Replication is necessary.
   Conclusions: Child maltreatment experienced early in development confers significant risk for lifetime suicide ideation. Furthermore, greater risk for suicide ideation was present for those with specific oxytocin genotypes. These findings further emphasize the importance of preventive interventions aimed at decreasing the incidence of maltreatment and increasing support for high risk families.

AB Background: This study sought to examine the development of global and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems in preschoolers whose mothers have high depressive symptoms, a topic that is less often studied.
   Method: This longitudinal study consisted of 201 families with mothers who reported clinically-relevant depressive symptoms. Mothers rated their depressive symptoms across children's first two years. Children's internalizing and externalizing problems were reported by caregivers or teachers at three waves in early childhood.
   Results: Using growth curve analyses, findings revealed gender-variant patterns in the development of internalizing and externalizing problems. Across early childhood, boys of mothers with depressive symptoms exhibited stable internalizing and increasing externalizing problems whereas girls exhibited declining trajectories of both problems. Further examination of within-gender variation indicated the heterogeneity in trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems only among girls. Moreover, the co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing problems was evident in both genders.
   Limitations: This study was based on a community sample and thus caution should be exerted to generalize findings to clinical samples.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that boys may be at heightened risk for behavioral problems in the face of high maternal depressive symptoms and that internalizing and externalizing problems tend to co-occur in this group of at-risk preschoolers.

AB Executive function (EF) deficits have been proposed as transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology, and recent research suggests EF impairments are associated with what is shared across forms of psychopathology (p factor). However, most research has not employed methods that differentiate between EF components, and little is known about the mediating mechanisms linking EF and psychopathology dimensions. The current study tested associations between the latent unity/diversity model of EF and latent dimensions of psychopathology and investigated mediating mechanisms in a community sample of 292 youth age 13-22. The results confirmed the finding that poor EF is associated with internalizing psychopathology in older youth via higher dependent stress and rumination, and showed that this pathway was transdiagnostic, predicting the p factor rather than internalizing specifically. Links with psychopathology were specific to the common EF factor, rather than updating- or shifting-specific EF.

AB Background/Objective: In this study, the behavior problems of healthy preterm and full-term children will be compared. The effect of environmental and neonatal conditions on the rate of behavior problems, paying special attention to maternal depression and parental stress, will also be studied.
   Previous studies found significantly higher prevalence rates of total problems in preterm children. Most of these studies were carried out with preterm children under 32 weeks of gestational age. In contrast, some studies carried out with moderately preterm children found no significant difference.
   Method: We assessed 108 low risk preterm children and 33 full-term children through the Child Behavior Checklist when they were 5 years-old. Their mothers' stress and depression were also assessed.
   Results: No significant difference was found between the preterm and the full-term groups for overall internalizing or externalizing behavior problems, or for more fine-grained behavior problems such as anxiety, attention or aggression. No effect of gestational age was found on the rate of behavior problems. In contrast maternal stress, but not maternal depression, was a strong predictor of behavior problems.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that behavior problems are not characteristic of preterm children as a group, but only of very or extremely preterm children.

AB Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the common types of birth defects. Children and young people (CYP) with CHD might exhibit behavioural and emotional changes related to undergoing different medical treatments and hospitalization. Therefore, a literature review was conducted from January 2000 to June 2017 that aimed to understand and evaluate current international literature focusing on CYP's behavioural and emotional status as patients with CHD. A comprehensive search of Medline, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases was undertaken. Eight quantitative studies were reviewed following strict eligibility criteria. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of the reviewed studies. Parents provided proxy reports on their children's behaviour and emotions in all studies. Half of the reviewed studies presented the self-perceptions of children who were over seven years old. CYP with CHD exhibited internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems, withdrawal, depression, social, and attention problems. CYP with more severe CHD reported greater behavioural and emotional problems than CYP with less severe CHD. Moreover, younger children developed more problems than older children. Future more depth research using qualitative designs is required to explore the personal views of children younger than seven years old on the impact of CHD on their behaviour and emotions.

AB While neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Noonan syndrome (NS) are clinically distinct genetic syndromes, they have overlapping features because they are caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding molecules within the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Increased risk for emotional and behavioral challenges has been reported in both children and adults with these syndromes. The current study examined parent-report and self-report measures of emotional functioning among children with NF1 and NS as compared to their unaffected siblings. Parents and children with NS (n = 39), NF1 (n = 39), and their siblings without a genetic condition (n = 32) completed well-validated clinical symptom rating scales. Results from parent questionnaires indicated greater symptomatology on scales measuring internalizing behaviors and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both syndrome groups as compared with unaffected children. Frequency and severity of emotional and behavioral symptoms were remarkably similar across the two clinical groups. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were higher in children who were also rated as meeting symptom criteria for ADHD. While self-report ratings by children generally correlated with parent ratings, symptom severity was less pronounced. Among unaffected siblings, parent ratings indicated higher than expected levels of anxiety. Study findings may assist with guiding family-based interventions to address emotional challenges.

AB Background Social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adolescents may be associated with the use of maladaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies. The present study examined the use of maladaptive and adaptive ER strategies in adolescents with SAD. Methods 30 adolescents with SAD (CLIN) and 36 healthy adolescents for the control group (CON) aged between 11 and 16 years were assessed with the standardized questionnaires PHOKI (Phobiefragebogen fur Kinder und Jugendliche) for self-reported fears as well as FEEL-KJ (Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen) for different emotion regulation strategies. Results Compared to controls, adolescents with SAD used adaptive ER strategies significantly less often, but made use of maladaptive ER strategies significantly more often. There was a significant positive correlation between maladaptive ER and social anxiety in adolescents. Examining group differences of single ER strategy use, the CLIN and CON differed significantly in the use of the adaptive ER strategy reappraisal with CLIN reporting less use of reappraisal than CON. Group differences regarding the maladaptive ER strategies withdrawal and rumination, as well as the adaptive ER strategy problem-solving were found present, with CLIN reporting more use of withdrawal and rumination and less use of problem-solving than CON. Conclusions Promoting adaptive emotion regulation should be a central component of psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy-CBT) for social anxiety in adolescents from the beginning of the therapy process. These findings provide rationale for special therapy programs concentrating on the establishment of different adaptive ER strategies (including reappraisal). As an increased use of maladaptive ER may be associated with SAD in adolescents, it may be paramount to focus on reduction of maladaptive ER (for example withdrawal and rumination) from the beginning of the psychotherapy process. Incorporating more ER components into psychotherapy (CBT) could increase the treatment efficacy. Further investigations of the patterns of emotion regulation in specific anxiety groups like SAD in adolescents is needed to continue to optimize the psychotherapy (CBT) concept.

AB Background: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in children is an important cause of severe heart failure and carries a poor prognosis. Adults with heart failure are at increased risk of anxiety and depression and such symptoms predict adverse clinical outcomes such as mortality. In children with DCM, studies examining these associations are scarce.
   Aims: We studied whether in children with DCM: (1) the level of emotional and behavioral problems was increased as compared to normative data, and (2) depressive and anxiety problems were associated with the combined risk of death or cardiac transplantation.
   Methods: To assess emotional and behavioral problems in children with DCM, parents of 68 children, aged 1.5-18 years (6.95.7 years), completed the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Results: Compared to normative data, more young children (1.5-5 years) with DCM had somatic complaints (24.3% vs. 8.0%; p < .001), but fewer had externalizing problems (5.4% vs. 17.0%; p = .049). Overall internalizing problems did not reach significance. Compared to normative data, more older children (6-18 years) showed internalizing problems (38.7% vs. 17.0%; p = .001), including depressive (29.0% vs. 8.0%; p < .001) and anxiety problems (19.4% vs. 8.0%; p = .023), and somatic complaints (29.0% vs. 8.0%; p < .001). Anxiety and depressive problems, corrected for heart failure severity, did not predict the risk of death or cardiac transplantation.
   Conclusion: Children of 6 years and older showed more depressive and anxiety problems than the normative population. Moreover, in both age groups, somatic problems were common. No association with outcome could be demonstrated.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Functional Disability Inventory for assessing pain-related disability in a community sample of children and adolescents. Materials and methods: Five hundred and sixty-one schoolchildren (aged 8-18 years) completed the Functional Disability Inventory. They were also administered measures assessing anxiety sensitivity, internalizing pain coping behaviors, social support seeking, and positive self-statements. A subset of 107 participants completed measures of quality of life. Results: The results confirmed the two-factor structure solution for the Functional Disability Inventory items. The measure's scales scores demonstrated adequate to good internal consistencies. Convergent validity was supported by significant positive correlations between FDI scores and anxiety sensitivity and internalizing pain coping behaviors, and negative correlations with quality of life. Discriminant validity was supported by weak and non-significant correlations between disability scores and the social support seeking and positive self-statements pain coping strategies scores. Differences in the disability scores between participants who did not experience pain in the last 3 months and those that experienced at least some pain provided additional evidence for construct validity. Conclusions: The findings support the Functional Disability Inventory as a reliable and valid measure for assessing pain-related disability in children and adolescents from the community.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder are at risk of developing internalizing and externalizing problems. However, information on early development of behavior problems and the contributing role of emotional functioning in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder is scarce. This study collected data of boys with and without autism spectrum disorder (N = 156; age: 2-6 years) over three consecutive years (three waves), about their internalizing and externalizing symptoms and emotional functioning (i.e. emotion control, recognition, and vocabulary), using parent-report questionnaires. No age effect was found on internalizing or externalizing problems for boys with and without autism spectrum disorder. Boys with autism spectrum disorder displayed more behavior problems than their typically developing peers and showed lower levels of emotional functioning. Better emotion control and improved emotion recognition were associated with a decrease in problem behaviors for boys with and without autism spectrum disorder, whereas improved emotion vocabulary was uniquely related to a decrease in externalizing problems in boys with autism spectrum disorder. Our findings suggest that boys with and without autism spectrum disorder showed similar developmental courses of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, lower levels of emotional functioning were already more pronounced in boys with autism spectrum disorder at a young age. This contributes to higher levels of behavior problems.

AB SYNOPSIS Objective. Parenting styles are complex and have been well studied in parents of children and adolescents; however, less is known about parenting styles in early infancy, especially among ethnic minority groups. This study examines empirically identifiable profiles of early parenting that are associated with later infant socioemotional development. Design. 239 young, low-income, African American (54.8%) and Latina (45.2%) mothers were videorecorded with their 3-month-old infants. At 13-months, mothers reported on their infants' socioemotional development. Results. Person-oriented latent class analysis was used to identify four parenting styles: Sensitive/Stimulating (25%), Warm/Unstimulating (37%), Engaged/Tough (22%), and Disengaged (16%). The most common style among African American mothers was Engaged/Tough (34.4%), and the most prevalent style among Latina mothers was Warm/Unstimulating (48.2%). Infants of Warm/Unstimulating mothers had the lowest reported levels of problem behavior at 13 months, whereas infants of Sensitive/Stimulating mothers had the highest reported mastery motivation. Infants of Disengaged mothers had the highest reported levels of internalizing and total problem behavior and the lowest reported mastery motivation. Conclusions. Qualitatively distinct styles of early parenting link to different infant socioemotional outcomes in ways not fully captured by single dimensions of parenting. Practitioners working with young mothers from diverse ethnic backgrounds may be more effective at promoting positive parenting and infant development if they understand and can build on the strengths of certain parenting styles.

AB Background & Objectives: A growing body of work supports linear associations between sleep and socioemotional adjustment in adolescence. However, associations between sleep and adjustment are not necessarily linear and investigations of nonlinear effects are scarce. This study examined linear and nonlinear relations between several sleep-wake parameters and externalizing behavior and internalizing symptoms in adolescence, and assessed the role of adolescent sex as a moderator of effects. Participants: Participants were high school students (N = 180; M age = 17.49, SD = .62; 59% female; 68% White/European American, 32% Black/African American) from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds living in semirural communities and small towns in Alabama. Methods: Sleep-wake parameters were indexed by actigraphy-derived sleep minutes and adolescents' reports on morningness-eveningness (circadian preference), sleep-wake problems (sleep quality), and sleepiness. Adolescents completed questionnaires on externalizing behaviors and internalizing symptoms. Results: Controlling for sleep duration, a higher preference for eveningness and poor sleep quality were associated in a linear fashion with increased externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Nonlinear relations between sleepiness and internalizing symptoms emerged with pronounced sex-related effects, including somewhat delayed accelerating relations for males and rapidly accelerating associations that tended to plateau for females. Conclusions: Results illustrate the importance of examining multiple sleep-wake and adjustment variables as well as linear and nonlinear associations.

AB Research across age groups has consistently indicated that psychopathology has a general factor structure such that a broad latent dimension (or p factor) captures variance common to all mental disorders as well as specific internalizing and externalizing factors. This research has found that the p factor overlaps substantially with trait negative emotionality (or neuroticism). However, less is known about the psychological substance of the specific factors of the general psychopathology model or how lower-order facets of neuroticism may relate to each psychopathology factor. We investigated the structure of neuroticism and psychopathology as well as associations between these domains using multimethod assessments in a sample of 695 preadolescent children. We found that both psychopathology and neuroticism may be well characterized by bifactor models and that there was substantial overlap between psychopathology (p) and neuroticism (n) general factors as well as between specific factors (Internalizing with Fear, Externalizing with Irritability).

AB This study aimed to evaluate direct and indirect effects of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and the behavioral activation system (BAS) on depression and current suicidal ideation through rumination and self-reflection in a sample of suicide attempters. Three hundred suicide attempters completed the Rumination/Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ), the Carver and White BIS/BAS scales, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Results revealed that the BAS and BIS had direct effects on suicidal ideation but not depression. Low BAS had an indirect effect on depression through decreased self-reflection. High BIS had an indirect effect on depression via increased rumination. Low BAS and high BIS had indirect effects on suicidal ideation through decreased self-reflection. The findings suggest that low BAS and high BIS may be associated with depression and suicidal ideation in suicide attempters who have decreased self-reflection and increased rumination. Also, increasing self-reflection and reducing rumination as respectively adaptive and maladaptive self-focused attention strategies may prohibit depression and suicidal ideation.

AB Although high-quality friendships are presumed to protect peer-victimized adolescents from distress, evidence supporting this claim is mixed. This study investigated whether the protective function of high-quality best friendships for victimized youth varies depending on adolescents' perceptions of their best friend's victimization. Among a sample of 1,667 eighth graders, we tested the effects of self-perceived victimization, best friend emotional support, and best friend victimization on depressive symptoms and social anxiety across eighth grade. Perceptions of higher emotional support buffered links between boys' victimization and depressive symptoms. Perceived emotional support buffered links between girls' victimization and internalizing symptoms if they viewed their best friend as nonvictimized, but it amplified such associations if they viewed their friend as victimized. These results suggest that although perceptions of best friend emotional support benefit peer-victimized youth, highly intimate friendships between victimized adolescent girls may promote maladaptive coping and increased distress.

AB Most studies of bullying rely on school-based samples of youth; however, a few studies of justice-involved populations suggest delinquent youth experience higher rates of bullying than youth in the general population. Little is known about gender differences in bullying among justice-involved youth. Using data from a Health Coach service project for justice-involve youth implemented at two intake facilities, 312 female and 857 male newly arrested youth were included in the current study. The current study sought to determine gender differences in prevalence rates of bullying involvement. Logistic regression was used to explore gender differences in how key covariates of demographic, risk factors, and traumatic experiences related to bullying. Rates of bullying experiences were higher for girls (35%) than boys (17%), and these rates were higher than rates reported in studies using general population or school-based samples. Analysis revealed differences in risk factors of bullying by gender. For both arrested girls and boys, depressive symptoms and sexual assault victimization increased the odds of bullying. Justice-involved youth are at greater risk of bullying and experience multiple problems. Holistic treatment and prevention strategies that recognize the co-occurrence of mental health symptoms, serious victimization, and substance abuse with bullying experiences are needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Childhood adversity is strongly linked to negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety. Leveraging cognitive neuroscience to identify mechanisms that contribute to resilience in children with a history of maltreatment may provide viable intervention targets for the treatment or prevention of psychopathology. We present a conceptual model of a potential neurobiological mechanism of resilience to depression and anxiety following childhood adversity. Specifically, we argue that neural circuits underlying the cognitive control of emotion may promote resilience, wherein a child's ability to recruit the frontoparietal control network to modulate amygdala reactivity to negative emotional cues-such as during cognitive reappraisal-buffers risk for internalizing symptoms following exposure to adversity.
   METHODS: We provide preliminary support for this model of resilience in a longitudinal sample of 151 participants 8 to 17 years of age with (n = 79) and without (n = 72) a history of childhood maltreatment who completed a cognitive reappraisal task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   RESULTS: Among maltreated youths, those who were better able to recruit prefrontal control regions and modulate amygdala reactivity during reappraisal exhibited lower risk for depression over time. By contrast, no association was observed between neural functioning during reappraisal and depression among youths without a history of maltreatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that children who are better able to regulate emotion through recruitment of the frontoparietal network exhibit greater resilience to depression following childhood maltreatment. Interventions targeting cognitive reappraisal and other cognitive emotion regulation strategies may have potential for reducing vulnerability to depression among children exposed to adversity.

AB Objective: Amid growing concern about internalizing disorders on college campuses, few researchers have examined the ways emotional awareness deficits may contribute to risk. We examined the effect of the interaction between daily hassles, emotional awareness, and sex on depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants: Data were collected from 196 college students (M-age = 19.6, SDage = 2.26) at a large university in June 2016. Methods: Participants completed online surveys to assess daily hassles, emotional awareness, and internalizing symptoms. Results: Daily hassles were significantly associated with internalizing symptoms, p < .01. For women, daily hassles were significantly associated with internalizing symptoms at all levels of emotional awareness, ps < .05. For men, daily hassles were significantly associated with internalizing symptoms only at high levels of emotional awareness, ps < .05. Conclusion: Future researchers could examine the context in which emotional awareness may be most beneficial to college students.

AB A critical task in psychotherapy research is identifying the conditions within which treatment benefits can be replicated and outside of which those benefits are reduced. We tested the robustness of beneficial effects found in two previous trials of the modular Child STEPs treatment program for youth anxiety, depression, trauma, and conduct problems. We conducted a randomized trial, with two significant methodological changes from previous trials: (a) shifting from cluster- to person-level randomization, and (b) shifting from individual to more clinically feasible group-based consultation with STEPs therapists. Fifty community clinicians from multiple outpatient clinics were randomly assigned to receive training and consultation in STEPs (n = 25) or to provide usual care (UC; n = 25). There were 156 referred youths-ages 6-16 (M = 10.52, SD = 2.53); 48.1% male; 79.5% Caucasian, 12.8% multiracial, 4.5% Black, 1.9% Latino, 1.3% Other-who were randomized to STEPs (n = 77) or UC (n = 79). Following previous STEPs trials, outcome measures included parent- and youth-reported internalizing, externalizing, total, and idiographic top problems, with repeated measures collected weekly during treatment and longer term over 2 years. Participants in both groups showed statistically significant improvement on all measures, leading to clinically meaningful problem reductions. However, in contrast to previous trials, STEPs was not superior to UC on any measure. As with virtually all treatments, the benefits of STEPs may depend on the conditions-for example, of study design and implementation support-in which it is tested. Identifying those conditions may help guide appropriate use of STEPs, and other treatments, in the future.

AB Youth with ADHD are more at-risk for peer victimization than their typically developing peers, and may not be benefiting from current interventions. Thus, we sought to examine risk (i.e., anxiety, depression, and forms of aggression) and protective (i.e., social skills and social acceptance) factors for peer victimization in this group. Participants were 123 young adolescents diagnosed with ADHD, who were attending grades six through eight. We found that relational aggression (i.e., excluding others from activities) and anxiety symptoms were among the strongest risk factors for victimization. Anxiety symptoms were associated with victimization over and above depressive symptoms. Social acceptance buffered risk conferred by the risk factors. Future work is needed to investigate the degree to which the relations among internalizing symptoms and victimization differ in youth with ADHD relative to typically developing youth, and assess causality of the relations.

AB So far, there is a dearth of research comparing identity processes across cultures and its contributing factors. In this study, the association of individual and family factors with identity processes was analyzed in 2,113 emerging adults (M = 22.0 years; 66% female) from France, Germany, Greece, Peru, Pakistan, Poland, and Turkey. Exploration and commitment levels were highest in non-Western countries like Peru, Turkey, and Pakistan, whereas emerging adults in France scored lowest in exploration and commitment and reported highest levels in identity distress, internalizing/externalizing symptoms, and identity diffusion. Identity distress, coping with identity distress, parental behavior, and mental health were regressed on identity processes (exploration breadth/depth, commitment, and ruminative exploration). Distinctive patterns emerged; high identity distress, high identity diffusion, and high maternal anxious rearing in all countries were related to ruminative exploration. Findings were interpreted with a focus on universal and distinctive pathways in different countries in changing times.

AB Background Compared to their indigenous peers, migrant children and adolescents are at increased risk for mental health problems. The aim of our study was to compare psychological disorders of children and adolescents with Turkish migration background and their native Austrian peers. Methods We analysed 302 children and adolescents aged between 7 and 18 years. The sample consisted of 100 Austrian and 100 Turkish outpatients with mental health problems, and 102 healthy controls, 52 with Austrian and 50 with Turkish background, recruited from various Viennese local child and youth centres. Results Native patients had more frequently externalizing problems (42.1%) compared to the Turkish-speaking sample (28%). However, in the control group, Turkish-speaking children and adolescents had higher levels of internalizing, depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to their native peers. Conclusions We found noticeable differences in psychological problems among children and adolescents with and without migration background. We assume that migration-related stress factors are responsible for these differences. Also, children and adolescents with migration background seek for psychological help less frequently than their indigenous peers.

AB Theories of allostatic load suggest that recurrent adaptive adjustments in contexts of adversity may have a negative impact on physical well-being. To test this hypothesis, this study evaluated 6-year-old children's ego-resilience and physical abuse experiences on behavior problems and physical illness at the age of 8 years. A significant interaction between ego-resilience and physical abuse exposure indicated that, although ego-resilience buffered physically abused children from internalizing problems, it also predicted more physical illness in that group. Findings contribute to the growing body of evidence suggesting that efforts to mobilize an adaptive response in contexts of adversity may exact a cost on physical well-being.

AB Researchers consistently report links between psychological control and adolescent behavior problems, but the processes linking psychological control with behavior problems are unclear. Adolescents' negative emotional reactions and psychological reactance were tested as potential longitudinal mediators linking parental psychological control with both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Data were collected from a sample of 242 adolescents (M age = 15.4 at Time 1; 50.8% female; 50% white, non-Hispanic, 18% African American, 16% Hispanic, and 16% of other or multiple ethnicities) at three time points over a 2-year period. Adolescents self-reported depressive symptoms, antisocial behavior, negative emotional reactions, and psychological reactance. Adolescents and their parents provided ratings of parental psychological control. Cross-sectional models replicated patterns previously reported suggesting that negative emotional reactions and reactance mediate between psychological control and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. However, in cross-lagged panel models, neither negative emotional reactions nor reactance emerged as a mediator between psychological control and internalizing or externalizing problems. In contrast, results suggested that psychological control is an outcome of rather than contributor to, negative emotional reactions. Moreover, the addition of random intercepts to cross-lagged models indicated that associations between psychological control, emotional and behavioral reactions, and internalizing/externalizing behavior may represent stable trait-like patterns.

AB Substance-dependent individuals tend to be stigmatized. Internalizing that stigma may result in impairments to their adherence to treatment and social reintegration. This study analyzed stigma internalized by individuals in treatment for substance dependence and its relation to physical activity. Questionnaires on internalized stigma and physical activity were responded by 106 substance-dependent individuals. The data were treated by descriptive statistics and correlation analyzes. Internalized stigma was generally high, with higher scores for Alienation, Perception of Discrimination, and Social Avoidance. Significant inverse correlation was found between physical activity and internalized stigma, indicating that physical activity programs during rehabilitation may not only improve those individuals' physical condition but also reduce the psychological damages imposed by substance dependency.

AB A diverse sample of 239 primarily low-income couples participated in a random controlled trial of the Supporting Father Involvement couples group intervention. In this report, we examined the value of adding measures of fathers' attachment style and parenting to mothers' measures in order to explain variations in children's behavior problems. We also tested the hypothesis that the link between intervention-induced reductions in couple conflict and reductions in anxious/harsh parenting can be explained by intervention effects on parents' attachment insecurity or on anxiety and depression. Fathers' attachment security and parenting behavior added significantly to mothers' in accounting for children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Fathers' anxious attachment style and anxiety/depression mediated the link between post-intervention reductions in parental conflict and anxious/harsh parenting. For mothers, only improvements in attachment security accounted for those links. The findings support the need for attachment researchers to consider the contributions of both parents to their children's development.

AB This study sought to expand scientific knowledge on psychopathic personality traits in female offenders by evaluating the relationship between MMPI-2-RF triarchic scales and self-reported external variables in a sample of 205 female offenders. Results indicated that boldness was inversely related to internalizing dysfunction, including suicidal behavior, psychosis, youth conduct problems, problems stemming from alcohol use, and a history of outpatient mental health treatment. Meanness was positively related to internalizing dysfunction as well as youth conduct problems, anger, prison disciplinary reports, and psychosis. Disinhibition was associated with a history of abuse in childhood, suicidal behavior, internalizing dysfunction, problems associated with alcohol and drug use, family history of mental illness, prison disciplinary reports for violence, number of previous criminal charges, and anger. Consistent with views of psychopathy as a configural condition, interactive effects of boldness with disinhibition and meanness were observed for multiple key external variables (e.g., conduct problems, substance use, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior). This study provides further evidence for the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy in female offenders and lends additional support for the validity of MMPI-2-RF triarchic psychopathy scales.

AB Background There are significant barriers to providing accessible, quality mental health care for young adolescents affected by adversity. In an attempt to overcome this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions (EASE) psychological intervention for young adolescents with internalising problems. EASE is group-based (seven sessions for adolescents, three sessions for their caregivers) and can be delivered by non-specialist providers. This paper outlines the study protocols for two trials of EASE in the Middle East - one in Lebanon and one in Jordan. Methods We will conduct two, single-blind, two-arm, individually randomised group treatment trials in Lebanon and Jordan, with at least 445 young adolescents per trial. Adolescents will be screened eligible for the trial if they demonstrate levels of psychological distress indicative of internalizing problems requiring treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the EASE intervention, or enhanced usual care (one home-visit psychoeducation session). The primary outcome is reduction in overall child-reported psychological distress over time, with 3 months post-treatment as the primary end point. Secondary child-reported outcomes include post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression symptoms, daily functioning, and wellbeing. Secondary caregiver-reported outcomes include parenting style, overall child distress, and caregiver psychological distress. Coping strategy use will be explored as a mediator of treatment effects in Lebanon, and relevant moderators of treatment effects will be explored. Discussion These trials will provide the first assessments of the effectiveness of the EASE intervention for use in the Middle East, with important implications for the use of low-intensity, non-specialist interventions for this age range.

AB The purpose of the current study was to identify how defending behaviors in bullying overlap with bullying behaviors and victimization experiences using an empirical approach. Furthermore, an additional goal was to examine internalizing problems associated with these bullying role behaviors. Data on students' defending and bullying behaviors, victimization experiences, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem were collected from 700 sixth- through eighth-grade students using the Bully Participant Behaviors Questionnaire, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders-Child Version, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results of a latent profile analysis identified the following roles: defenders, bully-victim-defenders, and students who had low involvement in bullying, victimization, and defending. Results documented significant differences in internalizing problems among the roles. Specifically, bully-victim-defenders reported higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem than did defenders and students who had low involvement with bullying scenarios.

TI Impact of Behavioral Feeding Intervention on Child Emotional and

LA English
DT Article

AB Objectives: Behavioral intervention is the only treatment for pediatric feeding problems with well documented empirical support. However, parents may be hesitant to pursue behavioral intervention because of concerns about possible negative side effects on child behavioral health and the parent-child relationship. This study investigated associations between behavioral feeding treatment and parenting stress, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in young children, and parent-child attachment quality. Methods: Participants included 16 mother-child dyads seeking treatment from a behavioral feeding clinic at a large Midwestern university medical center. Children were between the ages of 30 and 45 months (adjusted) at baseline. Caregivers completed the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 1.5 to 5 (CBCL/1.5-5), the Parenting Stress Index, 3rd Edition Short Form (PSI/SF), and mother-child dyads participated in the Strange Situation procedure at baseline and again after 6 months. The treatment group (n = 12) began outpatient behavioral feeding intervention following the baseline evaluation, whereas the control group (n = 12) remained on the clinic waitlist until after the 6-month follow-up. Results: The treatment group demonstrated decreases in internalizing and externalizing child behavior problems and parenting stress compared with the control group. No significant differences were demonstrated in parent-child attachment quality within or between groups. Conclusions: Behavioral feeding intervention had positive effects on perceptions of child emotional and behavioral functioning and maternal parenting stress. Intervention also did not impact the quality of the mother-child attachment relationship. Further research with a larger sample size and additional observational measures of behavior is needed to support the replicability and generalizability of these results.

   REGULATION
AB Somewhat surprisingly, social anxiety has been linked with aggressive behavior in adults. Among youth, this connection has been demonstrated with anxiety symptoms more broadly. This review extends previous work by evaluating this association specifically with social anxiety in the child and adolescent literature. Given the complexities of aggressive behavior, the review is organized by its various forms (relational and physical) and functions (reactive and proactive). Findings from sixteen identified studies are suggestive of links between social anxiety and reactive and relational forms of aggression. Albeit more tenuous, there appear to be associations with physical aggression as well. Overall, though suggestive of connections between social anxiety and aggression, confidence in the findings is attenuated by the relatively small number of relevant studies combined with inconsistent gender findings. Before suggesting directions for further study, we propose putative dysfunctional biological, emotional, and cognitive processes as factors that may underlie associations between social anxiety and these particular forms of aggression. Future research should target differences in age, gender, relationship type, and anxiety subtype. Determining the extent to which these associations may be attributable to comorbid pathology such as depression or a broader internalizing syndrome is also important.

AB Study Objectives: Poor sleep and daytime sleepiness in children and adolescents have short- and long-term consequences on various aspects of health. Midday napping may be a useful strategy to reduce such negative impacts. The effect of habitual napping on a wide spectrum of cognitive, behavioral, psychological, and metabolic outcomes has not been systematically investigated.
   Methods: This study characterized midday napping habits in 3819 elementary school children from the China Jintan Cohort Study. In 2011, weekly nap frequency and average duration were collected once from students at grades 4-6. Prior to their completion of elementary school at grade 6 (in 2011-2013 respective to each grade), the following outcomes were collected once: behavioral and academic achievement evaluated by teachers, and self-reported positive psychology measures including grit, self-control, and happiness. IQ tests were conducted on a subgroup. Metabolic indices, including body mass index and fasting glucose concentration, were measured through physical exams. For the whole sample, we assessed associations between napping and each outcome, adjusted for sex, grade, school location, parental education, and time in bed at night. We also conducted stratified analyses on grade 6 (cross-sectional), grade 4 (2-year gap), and grade 5 (1-year gap) data.
   Results: Overall, napping was significantly associated with higher happiness, grit, and self-control, reduced internalizing behavior problem, higher verbal IQs, and better academic achievement, although specific patterns varied across frequency and duration for different outcomes. More limited significant associations were found for decreased externalizing behavior problems, compared to non-nappers, while no significant associations were found for performance IQ and metabolic outcomes.
   Conclusions: Results indicate benefits of regular napping across a wide range of adolescent outcomes, including better cognition, better psychological wellness, and reduced emotional/behavioral problems. The current study underscores the need for further large-scale intervention studies to establish causal effects.

AB This study analyzed the unique effects of gender and culture on psychopathology in adolescents from seven countries, after controlling for factors that might have contributed to variations in psychopathology. In a sample of 2259 adolescents (M = 15 years: 54% female) from France, Germany,Turkey, Greece, Peru, Pakistan, and Poland, we assessed identity development, maternal parenting (support, psychological control, anxious rearing), and psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing). Using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), we analyzed country, sex, age, and the interaction country x sex as independent variables, while controlling for maternal rearing dimensions and identity development as covariates. This resulted in similar findings for internalizing and externalizing symptoms: Identity rumination and maternal rearing (support, psychological control, anxious rearing) proved to be significant covariates. Further, country, sex, age, and the interaction country x sex were significant.These analyses result in a clearer picture of culture- and gender-specific effects on psychopathology, which is helpful in designing interventions.

AB Background: Although individuals who experience childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) are more likely to use maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, resulting in vulnerability to depression, no research has examined whether emotion dysregulation may explain the association between CEM and current depressive symptoms in a clinical sample of heroin-dependent individuals.
   Objectives: The current study aimed to assess the direct effect of CEM on current depressive symptoms and its indirect effect via emotion dysregulation in a treatment-seeking sample of males with heroin dependence. In a cross-sectional design, participants (N = 350) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), the Obsessive-Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS), and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II).
   Results: Emotional abuse and neglect severity had significant direct effects on current depressive symptoms and significant indirect effects through emotion dysregulation after controlling for clinical factors related to heroin use.
   Limitations: Study limitations include the cross-sectional design and use of self-report scales.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest emotion dysregulation may increase depressive symptoms in heroin users who experienced CEM. Training in emotion regulation strategies may decrease depressive symptoms in heroin-dependent individuals with CEM. Additional research with a longitudinal design to confirm these results is warranted.

AB Background: Preterm and low weight children at birth are exposed to higher risks and rates of motor, cognitive, behavioral and emotional problems. Being born under low socioeconomic conditions adds even more complexity to these children. This report describes the emotional and behavioral issues of a group of children who were born in low income families and had low weigh at birth in the Northeast region of Brazil.
   Method: A total of 100 children (47 with adequate and 53 with low weigh) were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist for behavioral and emotional problems, as well as with the Autism Behavior Checklist for autism symptoms.
   Results: Results show no difference between the two groups (low and adequate weight) in terms of behavior problems or autism characteristics, however, it shows elevated clinical prevalence's of behavioral and emotional problems and more vulnerability for autism symptoms when compared to the general population. Data also showed the more years children spent in pre-school, the less internalizing problems they manifested.
   Conclusion This study indicates that the impact of low socioeconomics environment is more prominent in the development of behavioral and emotional problems than low weight a birth, in addition it points to the benefits of pre-school years for the emotional and behavioral adjustment of children from low income and with low weight at birth.

AB The present study examined the contribution of effortful control to child well-being in early, preschool and school years (N = 302). Effortful control was measured by the behavioral multitask batteries developed by G. Kochanska and colleagues, and parental questionnaires developed by M. Rothbart and colleagues; child well-being was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Huebner's Student's Life Satisfaction Scale and schoolchildren's academic achievement. The results showed that parent-reported effortful control was a predictor of prosocial behavior, externalizing, internalizing, and impact on the child's life; observational measure of effortful control had a protective effect for externalizing problems. Among the components of effortful control, parent-reported inhibitory control and attention focusing, and observational measure of delaying capacity contributed to child well-being. For schoolchildren, parent-reported activation control predicted prosocial behavior and lower peer problems, and observational measure of suppressing/initiating activity predicted child life satisfaction. The findings indicate the importance of effortful control for Russian child well-being.

AB The shift toward transdiagnostic and dimensional approaches to psychopathology research has created a growing need for psychometric assessments that reflect this conceptualization. We aimed to test whether an omnibus measure of psychopathology, the Social Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ), has suitable properties to serve as a dimensional, transdiagnostic assessment. We used an item response theory (IRT) approach to evaluate the reliable ranges of measurement of the psychopathology dimensions measured by the SBQ. For the dimensions of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Prosociality, Internalizing, and Externalizing, the SBQ can provide a reliable measure for below average to very high levels in a normative sample.

AB This study evaluates a model linking shyness, aspects of peer relations, and internalizing problems among young adolescents in the People's Republic of China. Participants were 547 young adolescents from Shanghai, China (46% boys; M-age = 10.35 years, SD = 0.77 years) who completed peer nominations of shyness, rejection, and victimization, and self-report measures of loneliness, depression, and friendship support. Analyses demonstrated that peer difficulties (rejection, victimization) mediated the associations between shyness and internalizing problems. However, moderated mediation analyses revealed a protective effect for highly supportive friendships, especially for boys. Findings highlight the importance of considering different types of peer experiences in studies of shy young adolescents and are discussed in terms of importance to theory and intervention in China and elsewhere.

AB This study examined the item and category response option functioning of items on the Student Risk Screening Scale for Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors (SRSS-IE), using item response theory (IRT) methods with a sample of 2,122 middle school students. The SRSS-IE is a screening instrument used to identify students who are potentially at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). Utilizing the nominal response and generalized partial credit models of IRT, items from the SRSS-IE were evaluated in terms of the degree to which the response options for each item functioned as intended and how well those response options discriminated among students who exhibited varying levels of EBD risk. Results indicate that the four-response option configuration used in this study may not adequately discriminate regarding the frequency of externalizing and internalizing behaviors demonstrated by middle school students. Recommendations for revising the response options and scoring procedures are discussed.

AB In France more than 140 000 children live in foster homes under the responsibility of the French Child Protection Agency. These children have lived in environments that cannot be good for their development and have been separated from their families which have to have consequences on their mental development. A literature review in France and abroad was made to identify the profiles of these children, their risk factors, and the mental disorders they can present. French child protection is handled by smaller territories, called Departements of which there are more than 90 and count around 1 000 000 people each. The number of foster children differ byDepartement, as do the placement types and meaning of the placement. More than half of these children have suffered maltreatment prior to placement. Comparing them to children of the same age, they present more internalizing and externalizing disorders, more addiction problems and suicidal behaviors. Protection factors have nonetheless been identified, such as early age of placement and placement stability. The main inhibitors of good health care are the absence of a common regulatory framework, source of organization difficulties, and the lack of collaboration between health and social services.
   French cohort studies using validated tools are necessary to precise and confirm these results. They could then lead to national recommendations for mental health screening and care organization, as well as validation of protocols for specific therapies for foster children.

AB The family represents a set of interconnected relationships, characterized by high levels of intimacy and closeness, which also provide opportunities for family conflict. In the literature, there appears to be a shift in understanding of what family conflict is and its subsequent consequences. Previous research focuses on dyadic family conflicts and often views it as a negative experience, resulting in the study of various maladaptive outcomes including internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems. Recently, researchers argue that family conflict should be operationalized to include more than two individuals. Further, evidence suggests that experience in conflict offers children a unique context to hone their social and cognitive skills. This review explores how research on family conflict has evolved. We investigate the status of the field by specifying that family conflict should include instances where more than two members are involved, how theories can be bridged to support this claim, and why it is also necessary to view family conflict as a positive experience. Lastly, we discuss key methodological and analytical issues as well as possible interventions that would help disentangle the inherent complexity of studying family conflict. We emphasize the implications of advancing the field for researchers and frontline professionals.

AB A growing body of recent research has identified associations between various parenting practices and styles and internalizing problems among adolescents. However, the reported findings are inconsistent and the studies in question have been conducted from different theoretical backgrounds. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the literature on the association of parental socialization styles with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. To this end, we conducted a systematic search of the PsycInfo, Scopus, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases, covering literature published from 2010 to 2019. The search was restricted to peer-reviewed studies in English or Spanish. The results show that parental warmth, behavioural control, and autonomy granting are inversely related to internalizing symptoms in adolescents. Conversely, psychological control and harsh control by parents are positively associated with adolescent anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Although the associated effect sizes are only small or moderate, the results suggest that these variables should be taken into account when designing programmes aimed at promoting parenting styles conducive to the wellbeing of adolescents.

AB Whether and to what extent kindergarten children's executive functions (EF) constitute promising targets of early intervention is currently unclear. This study examined whether kindergarten children's EF predicted their second-grade academic achievement and behavior. This was done using (a) a longitudinal and nationally representative sample (N = 8,920, M-age = 97.6 months), (b) multiple measures of EF, academic achievement, and behavior, and (c) extensive statistical control including for domain-specific and domain-general lagged dependent variables. All three measures of EF-working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control-positively and significantly predicted reading, mathematics, and science achievement. In addition, inhibitory control negatively predicted both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors. Children's EF constitute promising targets of experimentally evaluated interventions for increasing academic and behavioral functioning.

AB Several studies in the last decades provide scientific evidence about the benefits of family intervention at an early age. Carried out the implementation of the Aprender a Convivir en Casa [Learning to Live Together at Home] program (ACC), aimed for Spanish families with preschoolers to prevent behavioural problems, juvenile delinquency and harassment, as well as promote an optimal family functioning and parenting wellbeing; the aim of this study is to compare the effects on pre-schooler's adaptive skills and behavioural problems through the BASC-P1 and BASC-T1, parents and teachers respectively. Parents of 18 three to five-year-old children participated in the study, 9 parents were assigned to parent training (PT. experimental group) and 9 to a waiting list group (WL, control group). The results indicate that the children of the PT group obtained significantly higher scores in social competence compared with the WL group. The effect sizes ranges are large in this dimension, ranging from 2.12 in adaptive skills and 2.57 in social skills. Moreover, no significant differences have been found in internalizing and externalizing problems. Related to the comparison between teachers and parent's perspective in the PT group, there is an agreement in some aspects of the social competence factors but there is no arrangement in the conduct problems dimensions, coinciding with other current research. Based on the parent's perception of ACC efficacy, it is found high satisfaction and benefits after participating. These results suggest that ACC family program may be useful to promote family functioning and wellbeing and preschooler's social competence.

AB There has been increasing attention to the assessment of minimally verbal (MV) children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous research has begun to examine the relationship between verbal abilities and emotional and behavioral problems (EBP). The current study compared parent-reported EBP in children of differing language levels on two instruments commonly used in ASD research and clinical practice, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). The study consisted of 1,937 6-18 years old children with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection. Children were divided into three language groups, by ADOS module (Module 1 = MV, 2 = phrase speech (PS), and 3 = verbally fluent (VF)) and then compared on CBCL and ABC subscales. The ABC and CBCL showed different patterns of elevations across the language groups. MV children were reported to have more impairment than VF children on the ABC irritability, lethargy, and hyperactivity scales. Children with less language (MV and PS) exhibited less impairment on the CBCL internalizing domain than VF children, but did not differ on the externalizing domain. Post hoc comparisons showed that internalizing differences were driven by fewer children with less language exhibiting clinically elevated anxious/depressed scores compared to VF children. The present study underscores the significance of considering language when assessing EBP. Results have implications for the psychiatric screening of children with ASD, particularly those with language impairments. Researchers should exercise caution when applying EBP instruments designed for use with different populations and purposes to broad samples of children. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1367-1375. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary Some emotional and behavioral problem (EBP) scales include items that may be inappropriate for children with ASD and limited language. The present study found that there was a tendency for children with language impairment to have lower internalizing scores on the Child Behavior Checklist, but higher scores lethargy and irritability scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, relative to verbally fluent children. This suggests that each of these instruments may underestimate EBPs in certain subsets of children.

AB Depressive symptomatology is a serious mental health problem that has been observed among Malaysian adolescents. Hence, we conducted a cross-sectional study to identify the risk and protective factors for adolescent depressive symptoms. Specifically, we hypothesized that stressful life events, parental verbal aggression, and parental warmth are significantly associated with adolescent depressive symptoms. A sample of 1092 adolescents (13-19 years old; 447 boys and 645 girls) was recruited using probability proportional to size cluster sampling from 20 secondary schools in four states across Malaysia. Results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that stressful life events and maternal verbal aggression had significant main effects on depressive symptoms. In the moderation analyses, paternal warmth alleviated the influence of paternal verbal aggression on depressive symptoms. In contrast, both paternal and maternal warmth exacerbated the depressogenic impact of maternal verbal aggression. Such findings could improve prevention and intervention programs for combatting depressive symptoms in Malaysian adolescents.

AB School absenteeism and dropout are associated with many different life-course problems. To reduce the risk for these problems it is important to gain insight into risk factors for both school absenteeism and permanent school dropout. Until now, no quantitative overview of these risk factors and their effects was available. Therefore, this study was aimed at synthesizing the available evidence on risk factors for school absenteeism and dropout. In total, 75 studies were included that reported on 781 potential risk factors for school absenteeism and 635 potential risk factors for dropout. The risk factors were classified into 44 risk domains for school absenteeism and 42 risk domains for dropout. The results of a series of three-level meta-analyses yielded a significant mean effect for 28 school absenteeism risk domains and 23 dropout risk domains. For school absenteeism, 12 risk domains were found with large effects, including having a negative attitude towards school, substance abuse, externalizing and internalizing problems of the juvenile, and a low parent-school involvement. For dropout, the risk domains having a history of grade retention, having a low IQ or experiencing learning difficulties, and a low academic achievement showed large effects. The findings of the current study contribute to the fundamental knowledge of the etiology of school absenteeism and dropout which in turn contributes to a better understanding of the problematic development of adolescents. Further, more insight into the strength of effects of risk factors on school absenteeism and dropout is important for the development and improvement of both assessment, prevention and intervention strategies.

AB Given the recent rise in adolescent mental health issues, many researchers have turned to school-based mental health programs as a way to reduce stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among large groups of adolescents. The purpose of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify and evaluate the efficacy of school-based programming aimed at reducing internalizing mental health problems of adolescents. A total of 42 articles, including a total of 7310 adolescents, ages 11-18, met inclusion for the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were completed for each of the three mental health outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety) and meta-regression was used to determine the influence of type of program, program dose, sex, race, and age on program effectiveness. Overall, stress interventions did not reduce stress symptoms, although targeted interventions showed greater reductions in stress than universal programs. Overall, anxiety interventions significantly reduced anxiety symptoms, however higher doses may be necessary for universal programs. Lastly, depression interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms, but this reduction was moderated by a combination of program type, dose, race, and age group. Although, school-based programs aimed at decreasing anxiety and depression were effective, these effects are not long-lasting. Interventions aimed at reducing stress were not effective, however very few programs targeted or included stress as an outcome variable. Implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.

AB Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience high rates of temperamental negative affect and comorbid internalizing and externalizing pathology. The current study explored the role of emotion-specific regulation in accounting for the link between temperamental negative affect and psychopathology among children with ADHD. Forty parents of children ages 8-11 (N =29 males, N =11 females) completed measures of child temperament, emotion-specific dysregulation (i.e., anger dysregulation, sadness dysregulation), and psychopathology. Children completed a measure of emotion-specific dysregulation. Results revealed that anger dysregulation fully statistically accounted for the relationship between temperamental negative affect and concurrent externalizing problems. Sadness dysregulation did not account for the relationship between temperamental negative affect and internalizing problems. These novel findings implicate the robust role of anger dysregulation in explaining the link between temperamental negative affect and concurrent externalizing pathology. The results of this study have significant implications for the treatment of emotionally driven externalizing behavior among children with ADHD.

AB Objective Exposure to high levels of fine particle air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with adolescent pathophysiology. It is unclear, however, if PM2.5 is associated with physiology within psychosocial contexts, such as social stress, and whether some adolescents are particularly vulnerable to PM2.5-related adverse effects. This study examined the association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress in adolescents and tested whether symptoms of anxiety and depression moderated this association. Methods Adolescents from Northern California (N = 144) participated in a modified Trier Social Stress Test while providing high-frequency heart rate variability and skin conductance level data. PM2.5 data were recorded from CalEnviroScreen. Adolescents reported on their own symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Youth Self-Report, which has been used in prior studies and has good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha in this sample was .86). Results Adolescents residing in neighborhoods characterized by higher concentrations of PM2.5 demonstrated greater autonomic reactivity (i.e., indexed by lower heart rate variability and higher skin conductance level) (beta = .27; b = .44, p = .001, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.68) in response to social stress; this association was not accounted for by socioeconomic factors. In addition, adolescents who reported more severe anxiety and depression symptoms showed the strongest association between PM2.5 and autonomic reactivity to social stress (beta = .53; b = .86, p < .001, 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.23). Conclusions Exposure to PM2.5 may heighten adolescent physiological reactivity to social stressors. Moreover, adolescents who experience anxiety and depression may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5 on stress reactivity.

AB Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked, progressive neuromuscular disorder that results in chronic respiratory insufficiency and subsequently failure requiring noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Adherence to NIV in neuromuscular disorders and related barriers are poorly described. The aim of the current study was to assess NIV adherence, adherence barriers, and identify psychosocial predictors of adherence in young boys with early DMD-related sleep disordered breathing and recommended nocturnal NIV. This cross-sectional study included 42 youth with DMD with prescribed nocturnal NIV, and their caregivers. Caregivers and youth completed questionnaires assessing adherence barriers, psychosocial symptoms (eg, anxiety and depressive symptoms), and stress. Medical information pertinent to cardiopulmonary health and neurologic status at both enrollment and initiation of NIV was reviewed. Adherence to NIV, defined as percent days used and days used >= 4 hours/day was 56.1 +/- 38.7% and 46.2 +/- 40.6%, respectively. Average duration of use on days worn was 5.61 +/- 4.23 hours. NIV usage was correlated with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea but not cardiopulmonary variables. Mask discomfort was the most commonly reported adherence barrier followed by behavioral barriers (eg, refusing to use). Multiple regression analyses revealed that internalizing behaviors (eg, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and total adherence barriers significantly predicted NIV adherence. Adherence to NIV in DMD is poor and similar to other pediatric chronic diseases. Our data suggest interventions targeting adherence barriers and patient internalizing symptoms may improve adherence to NIV in DMD.

AB The current longitudinal study is the first comparative investigation across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to test the hypothesis that harsher and less affectionate maternal parenting (child age 14 years, on average) statistically mediates the prediction from prior household chaos and neighborhood danger (at 13 years) to subsequent adolescent maladjustment (externalizing, internalizing, and school performance problems at 15 years). The sample included 511 urban families in six LMICs: China, Colombia, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, and Thailand. Multigroup structural equation modeling showed consistent associations between chaos, danger, affectionate and harsh parenting, and adolescent adjustment problems. There was some support for the hypothesis, with nearly all countries showing a modest indirect effect of maternal hostility (but not affection) for adolescent externalizing, internalizing, and scholastic problems. Results provide further evidence that chaotic home and dangerous neighborhood environments increase risk for adolescent maladjustment in LMIC contexts, via harsher maternal parenting.

AB Mothers in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) suffer heightened vulnerability for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which is exacerbated by the multitude of risk factors associated with poverty and may lead to increased risk of psychiatric disorder. The constellation of complex, co-occurring biological, environmental, social, economic and psychological risk factors are in turn transmitted to her child, conferring vulnerability for adverse development. This study examines the association between maternal intra- and extra-familial ACEs, maternal education and the mental health of her child, mediated by maternal mental health. Mother-child dyads (n = 121) in Machakos, Kenya were examined cross-sectionally using self-report measures of ACEs, maternal mental health and child internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. The four models proposed to examine the relationship between intra- and extra-familial maternal ACEs and child internalizing and externalizing problems demonstrated indirect pathways through maternal mental health. These effects were found to be conditional on levels of maternal education, which served as a protective factor at lower levels of maternal ACEs. These models demonstrate how the impact of ACEs persists across the lifespan resulting in a negative impact on maternal mental health and conferring further risk to subsequent generations. Elucidating the association between ACEs and subsequent intergenerational sequelae, especially in LMIC where risk is heightened, may improve targeted caregiver mental health programs for prevention and intervention.

AB Introduction: In the last decades the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and mental health has been analyzed. One of the ways in which emotional intelligence is conceived is as a feature that is composed of three dimensions: attention, clarity and repair. On the other hand, one of the main measures of mental health includes the presence/absence of both internalizing and externalizing symptoms
   Objective: In this study, the cluster analysis approach is used to determine the existence of different profiles by combining the three dimensions that make up the emotional intelligence construct.
   Method: The sample consisted of 328 university students aged between 17 and 31 years (M = 20.86; SD = 2.22). The students are in the stage emerging adulthood.
   Results: Three differential profiles in emotional intelligence are obtained that suppose different combinations of attention, clarity and emotional repair and that present significant differences in internalizing and externalizing symptomatology.
   Conclusions: It is verified that the cluster analysis can determine the existence of different profiles in emotional intelligence whose influence in the mental health of the students is different for each one of them.

AB Objectives The goal of the present study was to examine whether mindfulness is related to psychological outcomes in children and adolescents after hurricane exposure, and to examine the strength of the relationship. It was hypothesized that mindfulness would be negatively associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing symptoms. It was also hypothesized that mindfulness would act as a moderator of PTSD symptoms, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Methods The study's sample consisted of 108 children and adolescents (74.5% Black, Non-Hispanic, 56.1% female, M age = 11.59) in grades 3-12 recruited from schools on the island of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, 3 months after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Participants completed questionnaires electronically at school reporting on demographic characteristics, hurricane exposure, mindfulness strategies, and PTSD, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms. Results Results from the current study showed that mindfulness was negatively correlated with PTSD symptoms, internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Additionally, it was found that the association between perceived life threat and internalizing symptoms was positive when children reported lower levels of trait mindfulness, but the association was not significant when children reported higher levels of trait mindfulness. Conclusions The results of the present study support the importance of mindfulness among children and adolescents and suggest that mindfulness is a helpful strategy for children and adolescents exposed to trauma. While more research is needed, the results suggest that mindfulness may be helpful to include in intervention for the psychological functioning of children following exposure to a hurricane.

AB Unaccompanied minor refugees (UMR) who arrive in Germany are generally placed in institutional child care facilities. UMR are a very burdened group, however other children and adolescents in institutional care are burdened as well, and their quality of life is often reduced. The aim of the current study was thus to compare quality of life and behavioral problems of UMR in child care facilities with those of other resident adolescents. For a total of 50 UMR, data regarding behavioral problems was available, for 41 UMR ratings on quality of life, both from external assessments. Two parallel comparison samples of other adolescents in the same institutional care facilities were drawn with adolescents with and without a migration background. Results show that in general, UMR show fewer behavioral problems than the other two groups, especially in externalizing behavior. For internalizing behavior, no differences were evident. For quality of life, no differences could be found between the three groups of inhabitants in institutional care. This indicates that the same factors determining quality of life are present in all three groups, but that the underlying mental problems are different in UMR than in other adolescents. Thus, staff in institutional care should possibly work differently with these group of adolescents than with other inhabitants and should be educated respectively.

AB Objective: Childhood maltreatment is a major risk factor for the development of behavioral problems and poor physical and mental health. Accelerated cellular aging, through reduced telomere length and mitochondrial dysfunction, may be a mechanism underlying these associations.
   Methods: Families with (n = 133) and without (n = 123) child welfare documentation of moderate-severe maltreatment in the past six months participated in this study. Children ranged in age from 3 to 5 years, were racially and ethnically diverse, and 91% qualified for public assistance. Structured record review and interviews were used to assess a history of maltreatment and other adversities. Telomere length and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) were measured from saliva DNA using real-time PCR. Measures were repeated at a six-month follow-up assessment. Repeated measures general linear models were used to examine the effects of maltreatment and other adversities on telomere length and mtDNAcn over time.
   Results: Maltreatment and other adverse experiences were significant positive predictors of both telomere length and mtDNAcn over time. Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were also both significantly associated with telomere length, but only internalizing symptoms were associated with mtDNAcn.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to show that mtDNAcn is altered in children with stress and trauma, and the findings are consistent with recent studies of adults. Surprisingly, children who experienced moderate-severe levels of maltreatment in the prior six months had longer telomeres, possibly reflecting compensatory changes in response to recent trauma. Telomere length and mtDNAcn were also associated with behavioral problems, suggesting that these measures of cellular aging may be causally implicated in the pathophysiology of stress related conditions.

AB Pediatric obesity is a serious public health concern affecting almost 16% of two- to five-year-olds. Prior research has not sufficiently addressed how various factors combine to contribute to the heterogeneous condition of obesity. The goal of this study was to assess multiple individual factors to determine how they collectively contribute to weight status in young children, as this information could lead to tailored interventions. This was a cross-sectional, population-based study of three- to five-year-olds. Child height and weight were measured. Parents completed a demographic survey and validated questionnaires regarding these child characteristics: internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, executive functions, and food approach and food avoid behaviors. Data for 154 participants (mean age: 4.4 +/- 0.8 years; mean body mass index-z: .28 +/- 1.0; 50% male) were analyzed using linear and logistic regression and a stepwise regression procedure. In the stepwise selection procedure for the binary outcome of obese/overweight versus normal weight, food avoid (p = .151), food approach (p = .017), and the White demographic variable (p = .117) were identified as important predictors. In conclusion, when considering various cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors, only food approach and food avoid eating behaviors predicted weight status in young children, suggesting prevention and intervention efforts should specifically address these aspects in young children.

AB Altering the proportion of total physical activity time accumulated while participating in different types of physical activity may influence health. Our objective was to use observational data to estimate whether replacing time from 1 type of physical activity with another is associated with physical and mental health indicators among children. Participants were 385 children aged 10-13 years. They wore a Global Positioning System watch and accelerometer and completed an activity log for 7 days. Data from these instruments was used to estimate time spent in outdoor active play, organized sport, curriculum-based physical activity at school, and active transportation. A cardiometabolic risk factor score was created from body fat, resting heart rate, and resting blood pressure measures. An internalizing symptoms score was created using anxiety and depression symptom questionnaire items. Isotemporal substitution models estimated if health indicators changed when time in 1 type of physical activity was replaced with equivalent time from another. The results indicated that time spent in all types of physical activity combined was associated with the cardiometabolic risk factor and internalizing symptom scores. Replacing active transportation with outdoor active play was associated with an increase in the internalizing symptoms score but a decrease in the cardiometabolic risk factor score. The internalizing symptoms score decreased when active transportation was replaced by equivalent time in organized sport. Other time substitutions were not significant. In conclusion, the total time spent participating in physical activity and not a specific type of physical activity was the most consistent correlate of the health indicators.

AB Background/Objective: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the diferential efficacy of conitive behavioral family treatment in children under 8 years of age with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in the reduction of obsessive-compulsive responses and secondary outcomes in three treatment conditions: (a) Treatment of parents and child, (b) Treatment of mother and child, and (c) Treatment of mother.
   Method: Forty-four children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, aged 5.2-7.9 years old and their parents, were randomized to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Seventy-five percent was male and 100% Caucasian (White-European). Treatment involved 12 individual sessions of is Cognitive-Behavioral Family-Based Treatment delivered.
   Results: The three conditions produced clinical improvements in post-test and follow-up in the primary (symptom severity OCD) and secondary outcomes. The results showed no intergroup differences in variables related to OCD symptom severity, although statistically significant differences were found in groups in Internalizing and Externalizing problem, mother and fathers accomodation.
   Conclusions: The most efficient condition was that including a greater number of family members even when there was high family accommodation. The direct involvement of the child in the psychological treatment was important in achieving better results. (C) 2019 Asociacion Espanola de Psicologia Conductual.

AB Objective: Different domains of internalizing symptoms (somatic, anxiety, depressive) often occur concurrently, suggesting that they may share common etiology. In longitudinal analyses of internalizing among youth, anxiety is often found to precede depression. However, relatively few studies have also assessed how somatic problems, the third symptom domain, are involved in longitudinal patterns of internalizing. In addition, temporal relations among internalizing symptom domains may vary by cultural group as somatic symptoms are posited to be a more culturally-normative way of communicating or experiencing distress in non-Western, interdependent cultures. Thus, the present study examined longitudinal relations among these three internalizing symptom domains in three ethnocultural adolescent samples.
   Methods: 304 European American, 420 Vietnamese American, and 717 Vietnamese adolescents' self-reported internalizing symptoms (somatic, anxiety, depressive) were assessed at three time points, spaced three months apart, using multigroup cross-lagged path analysis.
   Results: Anxiety symptoms consistently predicted increases in depressive symptoms in European American adolescents. In contrast, for Vietnamese and Vietnamese American adolescents, the most consistent relation was with somatic complaints predicting increases in anxiety. Anxiety and depressive symptoms bidirectionally predicted each other among the Vietnamese and Vietnamese American adolescents.
   Conclusions: Cultural group differences were evident in the temporal course of internalizing symptoms. The pattern of results have implications for culturally relevant intervention targets, during a developmental period of risk for internalizing disorders.

AB Background The prevalence of sleep problems among pregnant women is over 50%, and daytime sleepiness is among the most common sleep problems. Previous studies have associated antenatal sleep problems with adverse maternal health and neonatal outcomes, but the consequences of antenatal sleep problems and particularly daytime sleepiness on child psychological development have not been assessed prospectively. Methods In this prospective cohort study including 111 mother-child dyads, we examined the associations of maternal daytime sleepiness during pregnancy, assessed at 17 and 28 weeks of gestation using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with child neuropsychiatric problems and neuropsychological development, assessed with mother-rated questionnaires and individually administered neuropsychological tests, at child age 2.6-5.7 years (mean = 4.3 years). Results Independently of sociodemographic and perinatal covariates and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during and/or after pregnancy, maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness was associated with increased total [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) = 0.25 standard deviation (s.d.) units; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.48] and internalizing (B = 0.25 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.01-0.49) psychiatric problems and ADHD symptoms (B = 0.27 s.d.s: 95% CI 0.04-0.50) in children, and with poorer executive function, particularly in the areas of attention, working memory and inhibitory control (B = -0.39 s.d.s: 95% CI -0.69 to -0.10). Conclusions Maternal antenatal daytime sleepiness carries adverse consequences for offspring psychological development. The assessment of sleep problems may be an important addition to standard antenatal care.

AB This study examined family processes on the adjustment of adolescents from single-mother households using a dyadic approach. Participants included 107 noncohabiting Black parental dyads of adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. Each parent completed measures of positive parenting. parent-child relationship quality, parental depressive symptoms, coparenting relationship quality, and adolescent adjustment. Data were analyzed using the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) and extended mediational model (APIMeM) within a structural equation modeling framework. APIM demonstrated significant actor effects from parent-child relationship quality and parental depressive symptoms to both adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems as well as significant partner effects from parent-child relationship quality to adolescent externalizing problems for both mothers and fathers. Additionally, APIMeM revealed significant indirect actor and partner effects from parent-child relationship quality to externalizing behavior through one's own and one's coparent's coparenting relationship quality for both parents. Indirect actor effects were also observed from positive parenting to externalizing behavior through one's own perception of coparenting relationship quality for both parents. Both APIM and APIMeM models found a significant gender difference for the direct effect from positive parenting to externalizing problems. Specifically. the association was negative for mothers in both models; whereas it was nonsignificant (APIM) and positive (APIMeM) for fathers. This study highlights the unique contributions of mother's and father's parent and coparent factors on one's own, and one's coparent's, perception of adolescent adjustment.

AB Despite widespread acknowledgment that "frequent, continuing, and meaningful" (Pruett & DiFonzo, 2014) time with both parents is beneficial for children from divorced or separated families, and that interparental conflict (IPC) is associated with increased child mental health problems, the joint effects of parenting time (PT), parenting quality (PQ), and IPC on children's mental health problems are less clear. The current study integrates two theoretical models in multiple mediator analyses to test indirect effects of mothers' and fathers' PQ and IPC to explain the association between PT and children's mental health problems within the same model. Participants were children aged 9-18 years (N = 141) who had one or both parents participate in a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of a court-based prevention program for high-conflict divorcing or separating families. Data were collected at pretest and 9-month follow-up. Analyses revealed an indirect effect in which fathers' PQ mediated the association between PT and child internalizing problems both concurrently and 9 months later. There were no significant indirect effects involving IPC. Analyses indicated a significant quadratic relation between PT and fathers' PQ, suggesting that although more PT is associated with better father-child relationships, there is a point beyond which more time is not related to a better relationship. We discuss the study findings, research limitations, and implications for public policy.

AB Distress Intolerance (DI), defined as the perceived inability to tolerate negative mood states and experiential discomfort, has been posited as a vulnerability factor for several anxiety and emotional disorders. There is a relative paucity of research on DI in youth samples, in large part due to the absence of a psychometrically sound measure of DI in youth. The current study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Distress Intolerance Index for Youth (DII-Y) and the Distress Intolerance Index for Youth-Parent Report (DII-Y-P), which are downward extension adaptations of the adult-oriented Distress Intolerance Index (McHugh and Otto Behavior Therapy 43(3), 641-651, 2012). Participants were 176 youth (ages 9-17) and their parents who were seeking treatment for child anxiety problems. The DII-Y and DII-Y-P demonstrated good-to-excellent internal consistency. Convergent validity of the DII-Y and the DII-Y-P was supported by large, significant associations with measures of intolerance of uncertainty, as well as with anxiety sensitivity in the case of the DII-Y. Discriminant validity of the DII-Y and the DII-Y-P was supported by the absence of significant direct relationships with a measure of defiant behavior. Results support the use of DII-Y and DII-Y-P as reliable and valid instruments for the assessment of youth DI, providing a practical and efficient tool to study DI as a potential factor in the etiology and maintenance of youth anxiety and emotional disorders.

AB The current study examined the moderating role of friendship quality on the relation between maternal anxiety and internalizing symptoms in a 3-year prospective study of adolescent development. Participants included 177 adolescents (M-age = 16.05, SDage = 0.91) and their mothers. Mothers reported their own levels of anxiety; youth completed self-reports of internalizing symptoms and friendship quality. Positive friendship quality moderated the relation between maternal anxiety and initial levels of internalizing symptoms. Maternal anxiety was associated with steeper increases in internalizing symptoms over time, but only for those with greater negative peer interactions. Findings underscore the important role of both parental and peer relationships in the development of internalizing symptoms and highlight specific avenues for clinical interventions.

AB The ability to form attachments with other human beings is an essential skill that typically begins early in life. The parent/caregiver-child relationship is the first crucial relationship that an infant forms, and the health of this relationship has a profound effect on the child's social and emotional development. Children who form secure relationships with their parent or other primary caregiver have fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors, are more socially competent, and have better-quality friendships. Conversely, children with attachment disorders exhibit a varying capacity to form and sustain relationships and demonstrate emotional depth, they and experience a higher level of peer conflict. Children with insecure attachments have a greater likelihood for physical health morbidities and impaired social, psychological, and neurobiological functioning extending into adulthood. It is crucial that pediatric nurse practitioners implement practice behaviors to better identify children at risk for attachment disorders and link them with appropriate interventions. This continuing education article will explore attachment; and attachment theory; and attachment disorders in terms of types, risk factors, consequences, and treatment and will also provide implications for practice.

AB Construct equivalence of measures across studies is necessary for synthesizing results when combining data in meta-analysis or integrative data analysis. We discuss several assumptions required for construct equivalence, and review methods using individual-level data and item response theory (IRT) analysis for detecting or adjusting for violations of these assumptions. We apply IRT to data from 7 measures of depressive symptoms for 4,283 youth from 16 randomized prevention trials. Findings indicate that these data violate assumptions of conditional independence. Bifactor IRT models find that depression measures contain substantial reporter variance, and indicate that a single common factor model would be substantially biased. Separate analyses of ratings by youth find stronger evidence for construct equivalence, but factor invariance across sex and age does not hold. We conclude that data synthesis studies employing measures of youth depression should analyze results separately by reporter, explore more complex approaches to integrate these different perspectives, and explore methods that adjust for sex and age differences in item functioning.

AB This study examined the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Third Edition Behavioral and Emotional Screening System, Parent Form-Preschool, which is used to identify children at risk for emotional/behavioral problems. Rasch rating scale methods were used to provide information about psychometric properties of items, parent raters, and the response scale. Using the norming sample of 459 children, we investigated the structure of the screener, performance of the scale, and coverage of the maladaptive behavior construct to identify children with emerging behavioral difficulties. Most items showed good fit to the rating scale methods model with broad coverage of the latent domain. Items measuring internalizing and externalizing problems indicated a greater tendency for at-risk behavior, and items measuring adaptive skills offered a minimal contribution to measuring risk status. No differential item functioning was observed due to child gender; however, differential item functioning was observed between ratings for Caucasian and Hispanic or African American students for select items.

AB Background The Online Assessment of Preschool Anxiety (OAPA) is a newly developed measure that assesses anxiety disorders in preschool children aged 3-6 years. This study aimed to explore the OAPA's initial psychometric properties with a particular focus on examining its construct validity, both convergent and discriminant. Method The OAPA was completed online by a community sample of 319 Australian parents of temperamentally inhibited preschool children (M: 5.3 years). Preliminary diagnoses were automatically generated before assessment reports were reviewed by a psychologist. Construct validity was examined by assessing the degree of agreement between the OAPA and existing valid questionnaire measures that were simultaneously administered online. Results Nearly half of participants met criteria for a child anxiety disorder according to the OAPA, most commonly social phobia. Findings supported convergent validity with the Revised Preschool Anxiety Scale (an anxiety symptom measure), the Children's Anxiety Life Interference Scale - Preschool Version (a measure of life interference from anxiety), the Emotional Symptoms scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent Version (a measure of broader internalizing symptoms), as well as an over-involved/protective parenting scale. Findings also supported initial discriminant validity with the Conduct Problems scale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent Version. Conclusions Results of this study provide evidence for the OAPA's preliminary construct validity. With further research into the OAPA's reliability (test-retest and interrater) and confirming construct validity, the OAPA may be a useful instrument for use in research settings and clinical practice.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to compare children with ADHD with children without ADHD on frustration tolerance and to examine the role of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in frustration tolerance within the sample. Method: Participants included 67 children ages 10 to 14 years-old with (n = 37) and without (n = 30) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) ADHD who completed the Mirror Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT), a validated computerized behavioral measure of frustration tolerance. Results: Children with ADHD were more likely to quit this task than children without ADHD, demonstrating lower levels of frustration tolerance. There were no differences in frustration tolerance between children with ADHD + ODD and those with ADHD - ODD. Moreover, ODD did not moderate the relationship between ADHD and frustration tolerance. Conclusion: Our results suggest that low frustration tolerance is directly linked to ADHD and not better accounted for by ODD. This research highlights specific behavioral correlates of frustration in children with ADHD.

AB Objective: Studies on comorbidity in children diagnosed with ADHD have relied more on parent/teacher reports instead of self-reported data and have focused on the frequency of comorbid symptoms instead of scores above clinical cutoffs. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety, and depression in children with ADHD, using self-report measures for internalizing symptoms and parent-reported measures for externalizing symptoms for increased accuracy. Gender differences were also assessed. Method: Parents of 197 children diagnosed with ADHD answered the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale, and 112 of the children filled out the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and the Children's Depression Inventory. Results: Results revealed that 19.28% of the children met cut-off criteria for ODD, 41.96% for anxiety, and 21.43% for depression. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a relatively lower prevalence of ODD and a slightly higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than previously reported. Possible explanations and future directions are discussed.

AB There is sound evidence that increased level of peer support is linked negatively with youth vulnerably to internalizing and externalizing problems. Conversely, victimization by peers is associated positively with youth adjustment difficulties. The current study examines the mediating role of victimization in the association between classmates' support and internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and the moderating role of gender in that association. The study is based on a sample of 243 7th grade Canadian adolescents. The results show that classmates' support has a unique contribution to reduced adolescents' internalizing behaviors above and beyond the effects of parental and teachers' support. This association was partially mediated by youth victimization. Classmates' support was a stronger predictor of internalizing behaviors among females compared to males. With respect to externalizing behaviors, the results indicated that while classmates' support has no direct association with that outcome, parental support plays a central role in predicting externalizing behaviors. The association between classmates' support and externalizing behavior was fully mediated by youth victimization. The current study highlights the importance of support by peers, with whom they interact on a regular basis, to adolescents' well-being and functioning. The results also indicate that parents are still significant figures in adolescents' lives. Those facts should be taken into account when intervening with young people.

AB Objectives The relationship between bully victimization and depression has been examined extensively with prior research showing long-term cascade of problems stemming from both exposure to victimization and depressive symptomology. However, prior research has failed to consider how protective factors may mitigate these long-term problems. Three theoretical models were tested: the interpersonal risk model, symptom driven model, and transactional model. Methods The present study employs a novel statistical technique to explore longitudinal reciprocal associations among bullying, depression, and school belonging in a sample of 2177 middle school students (ages 11 to 15) in a Midwestern state. We used a model building process to explore the overall association between bully victimization, depression, and school belonging as well as a multi-group model in which models were estimated for boys and girls, separately. Results In our overall model, results indicated support for both symptom driven and interpersonal risk models. However, we did not find any significant buffering effect of school belonging. In our multi-group model, we found support for a buffering effect of school belonging for girls, but not boys. School belonging buffered long term problems associated with experiences of bully victimization via reductions in depression. Conclusions Our findings point to the broader concept of school structure being differentially supportive and protective for various demographic groups and the need to consider the entire social ecology of a school when planning and implementing prevention interventions.

AB Bullying is often ongoing during middle- and high-school. However, limited research has examined how cumulative experiences of victimization, perpetration, and bystander behavior impact adolescent behavioral and mental health and academic achievement outcomes at the end of high school. The current study used a sample of over 8000 middle- and high-school students (51% female; mean age 12.5 years) from the Rural Adaptation Project in North Carolina to investigate how cumulative experiences as a bullying victim and perpetrator over 5 years, and cumulative experiences of bystander behavior over 2 years impacted students' aggression, internalizing symptoms, academic achievement, self-esteem, and future optimism. Following multiple imputation, analysis included a Structural Equation Model with excellent model fit. Findings indicate that cumulative bullying victimization was positively associated with aggression and internalizing symptoms, and negatively associated with self-esteem and future optimism. Cumulative bullying perpetration was positively associated with aggression and negatively associated with future optimism. Cumulative negative bystander behavior was positively associated with aggression and internalizing symptoms and negatively associated with academic achievement and future optimism. Cumulative prosocial bystander behavior was positively associated with internalizing symptoms, academic achievement, self-esteem, and future optimism. This integrative model brings together bullying dynamics to provide a comprehensive picture of implications for adolescent behavioral and mental health and academic achievement.

AB There is a dearth of research examining the relation between adolescent peer victimization and internalizing symptoms during emerging adulthood. This retrospective study examined relations among offline and online peer victimization, internalizing symptoms, as well as offline and online social support. A sample of 416 participants aged 18-24 was recruited and self-report data on adolescent victimization, support, and internalizing symptoms were collected. The results showed that retrospective reports of peer victimization and social support predicted current internalizing symptomology. However, this varied as a function of online/offline context and symptomology. Specifically peer victimization was more predictive of depressive symptoms than social anxiety symptoms. Offline social support predicted fewer internalizing symptoms, but online support did not. Social support diminished the association between peer victimization and social anxiety.

AB Bullying is a serious public health issue among children and adolescents in the United States. Existing national data sources provide limited current information about involvement in bullying among youth. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of parent-reported bullying victimization and perpetration among U.S. children and adolescents ages 6-17 years using nationally representative data, and to examine health-related factors associated with bullying experiences. We conducted secondary data analysis of the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, and stratified the sample by age (6-11 years, 12-17 years). We performed bivariate analyses to examine prevalence of bullying experiences according to demographic characteristics, health conditions, health behaviors, health services, and family environment. Using multivariable logistic regressions, we assessed the association between these factors and bullying experiences. Results showed that 22.7% of U.S. children and adolescents were bullied by others and 6.4% bullied others. The rate of bullying victimization was slightly higher among 6-11 year olds than among 12-17 year olds (24.1 vs. 21.1%, p = 0.011). The rate of bullying perpetration was 7.2% among children and 5.6% among adolescents but the difference between age groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.086). Several health conditions and health services factors were associated with either bullying victimization or perpetration, including special health care needs, internalizing problems, behavior or conduct problems, speech or other language disorders, autism, and unmet need for mental health treatment or counseling. Bullying victimization was also strongly associated with bullying perpetration.

AB Objectives Bullying victimization increases the risk of displaying internalized and externalized symptoms and alexithymia traits among adolescents. The aim of this study is to examine the mediating role of Alexithymia in the relationships between bullying victimization and internalized and externalized symptoms. Methods A total of 1092 students and their teachers (N = 67) of 4th to 6th grade anonymously completed a series of measures about experiences of bullying victimization, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and alexithymia. Results Our data suggest that three types of bullying victimization (verbal, physical and social) predicted internalized, externalized and alexithimic symptoms. Furthermore, alexithymia partially mediated the positive effect of all the three types of bullying victimization on both internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Conclusions This study provided empirical data about the mediating role of alexithimia in exacerbation of internalized and externalized symptoms among adolescents and pre-adolescents exposed to three types of bullying victimization.

AB Objectives Bullied students are at increased risk of internalizing problems. Many school bullying-prevention programs encourage targets of bullying to seek help from an adult at school. However, few students report victimization to school staff, and reports do not always result in positive outcomes for the victimized student. This study aimed to understand factors associated with students telling an adult at school about experienced victimization, and victimization and internalizing problems a year after taking this action. Methods Students in Grade 7-9 (mean age 13 years) in 12 schools completed online surveys in 2015 (T1). Data from the victimized students (n = 316) were analyzed to determine factors associated with speaking with school staff about their experience. The Grade 7-8 students were surveyed again in 2016 (T2) and matched data on 101 students victimized at T1 used to compare the longer-term internalizing problems and victimization outcomes for students who spoke with staff. Results Victimization status and level of internalizing problems at T2 of students bullied at T1 were associated with telling an adult at T1, and these associations were moderated by severity of T1 victimization. For students more severely victimized at T1, speaking with a staff member was associated with increased odds of continued victimization at T2, but fewer internalizing problems when compared to those who did not tell. Conclusions To prevent persistent victimization, schools and teachers need to be better equipped to respond effectively when a student first becomes a target of bullying, and discourage ongoing perpetrator behavior.

AB Background Children born very preterm often display selective cognitive difficulties at school age even in the absence of major brain injury. Alterations in neurophysiological activity underpinning such difficulties, as well as their relation to specific aspects of adverse neonatal experience, remain poorly understood. In the present study, we examined interregional connectivity and spectral power in very preterm children at school age, and their relationship with clinical neonatal variables and long-term outcomes (IQ, executive functions, externalizing/internalizing behavior, visual-motor integration). Methods We collected resting state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and psychometric data from a cohort at the age of 8 years followed prospectively since birth, which included three groups: Extremely Low Gestational Age (ELGA, 24-28 weeks GA n = 24, age 7.7 +/- 0.38, 10 girls), Very Low Gestational Age (VLGA, 29-32 weeks GA n = 37, age 7.7 +/- 0.39, 24 girls), and full-term children (38-41 weeks GA n = 39, age 7.9 +/- 1.02, 24 girls). Interregional phase synchrony and spectral power were tested for group differences, and associations with neonatal and outcome variables were examined using mean-centered and behavioral Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses, respectively. Results We found greater connectivity in the theta band in the ELGA group compared to VLGA and full-term groups, primarily involving frontal connections. Spectral power analysis demonstrated overall lower power in the ELGA and VLGA compared to full-term group. PLS indicated strong associations between neurophysiological connectivity at school age, adverse neonatal experience and cognitive performance, and behavior. Resting spectral power was associated only with behavioral scores. Conclusions Our findings indicate significant atypicalities of neuromagnetic brain activity and connectivity in very preterm children at school age, with alterations in connectivity mainly observed only in the ELGA group. We demonstrate a significant relationship between connectivity, adverse neonatal experience, and long-term outcome, indicating that the disruption of developing neurophysiological networks may mediate relationships between neonatal events and cognitive and behavioral difficulties at school age.

AB There are increasing concerns about student's possibility of becoming victim of negative online experiences, including cyberbullying victimization (CV). The outcome of these experiences on student's psychological and mental health is not well understood. This study used stimulus-organism-response paradigm to inspect the antecedents of social media fatigue and how social media attachment (SMA) is related to internalizing disorders (depression and anxiety). We also examined the moderating role of moral disengagement in the positive association between SMA and CV. The distinctive stimulus-organism-response paradigm in the suggested model is empirically examined through a sample of 305 college students. SMA was related to more CV and greater symptoms of internalizing disorders. CV and internalizing disorders were positively associated with social media fatigue. Moral disengagement moderated the relationship between SMA and CV. Implications for online awareness struggles are discussed.

AB Not only are childhood onset offenders at high risk of becoming serious persistent offenders, they are also at high risk of becoming victimized themselves. Furthermore, studies in the general population suggest that a combined perpetrator-victim group can be distinguished from a perpetrator-only and a victim-only group on individual and family risk factors. The current study investigated the co-occurrence of offending and victimization among first-time arrestees and the 2-year predictive value of previously found clusters of dynamic risk factors of offending. Childhood first-time arrestees (N = 308; M-age = 10.3, SD = 1.45) were clustered into three groups based on dynamic risk factors of offending in the individual, peer, school, and family domains: a pervasive high, an externalizing intermediate, and a low problem group. Police records and self-report data on re-offending and victimization of these children were collected over a 2-year follow-up period. Compared with the low problem group, the prevalence of re-offending was higher in both the externalizing intermediate group and the pervasive high group. The pervasive high group was most likely to display co-occurring future antisocial behavior and victimization. These findings emphasize that attention should be paid to victimization in addition to future antisocial behavior, especially if additional internalizing and family problems are present. Furthermore, the differences in re-offending and victimization between subgroups of childhood onset offenders stress the need for specific interventions tailored to the risk profile of a child.

AB The development of expectations to attend college is the first step toward future college attendance, yet its predictors are not fully understood. The current study seeks to identify individual and parent predictors of expectations for college completion among eighth grade students and examine inter-relationships between the independent variables. Data were used from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLSK), a nationally representative and longitudinal study of 21,260 kindergarteners. Logistic regression models were employed to predict college expectations of eighth grade students from child and parent characteristics. Youth were more likely to expect to complete college when they had greater learning approaches (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.05-3.15) and higher school competence/liking (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.13-2.26). Controlling for demographic covariates, the odds of students expecting to complete college were nearly four times greater for youth whose parents expected them to complete a bachelor's degree (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 2.34-6.23), compared to parents who expected their children to complete high school or less. A generalized structural equation model was then specified to understand the inter-relationships between child's behavior, learning approaches, and reading and math abilities. Child's self-control (beta = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.53-0.60) and internalizing behavior (beta = 0.15, 95% CI = -0.19 - -0.12) significantly predicted learning approaches, which then predicted child's reading ability (beta = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.20-0.28) and math ability (beta = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.00-0.53). Future research should examine effectiveness of programs seeking to increase student learning abilities and feelings of competence.

   QUESTIONNAIRE; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; DISTRESS; KINSHIP; SAMPLE
AB Although custodial grandchildren (CG) are likely to have more emotional and behavioral problems than children in general, only a handful of studies involving nationally representative data have investigated this important public health issue. The present study is unique in examining informant reports of psychological difficulties and prosocial behavior, obtained via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) parent version, regarding two samples (n = 509 and n = 323) of CG between ages 4-12 and three samples of age peers from the 2004 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) residing in homes with either no birth parent (n = 184), one parent (n = 1618), or both parents (n = 3752). A MANCOVA encompassing the main effects of sample type, child gender, and informants race across six SDQ subscales (with informant age and education, as well as child age controlled) showed all three main effects to be statistically significant (p < .001). Between subjects effects for sample type were significant for all six subscales (p < .001), with a general pattern found whereby the two CG samples had higher difficulty and lower prosocial scores than all three NHIS samples, with corresponding effect sizes falling in the moderate to very large range. Tests of between subjects effects for child gender showed, that regardless of sample type, males typically had higher difficulty scores and lower prosocial scores than those for females. Tests of between subjects effects by informant's race showed only sporadic differences that were independent of sample type. Comparisons of the SDQ banded scores suggested that CG have considerably different cutoff points than do children in other family structures to indicate a likely diagnosis of a serious psychological disorder. We conclude that primary school aged CG are at an especially high risk for both internalizing and externalizing difficulties regardless of children's gender or informant's race.

AB The study examined the screening effectiveness of the Children's Emotional Adjustment Scale (CEAS), a parent-reported scale that measures the emotional competence of children across four continuous factors (temper control, mood repair, anxiety control, social assertiveness) anchored in adaptive child behaviors, characteristics and skills that are vital to healthy social-emotional development and adjustment of children. Mothers of 1071 school students aged 6-12 years reported on their children's emotional functioning on the CEAS. In addition, mothers answered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, as well as the generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder subscales of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-Parent Version, which served as indicators of mental health problems to be targeted in the analysis. Area under the curve estimates ranged from .56 to .94, and sensitivity and specificity rates were .59-.93, and .55-.83, respectively. Temper control evidenced the greatest accuracy relative to overall mental health problems, externalizing problem and depression problems. Mood repair was most accurate in detecting overall mental health problems, internalizing problems and depression problems. Anxiety control was most efficient in detecting anxiety problems and internalizing problems. Social assertiveness was most sensitive in identifying internalizing problems. The findings suggest that the CEAS may be of value in early population-based screening. The instrument provides developmentally appropriate and actionable information on the emotional competence of all mainstream children on broad factors underlying both healthy and unhealthy social-emotional development, which can inform preventive interventions and treatment of common mental health problems in school-aged children.

AB The present study examined the measurement properties of the Emotional and Behavioral Screener (EBS), a universal screening instrument which identifies students presenting with emotional and behavioral problems. The primary research questions sought to examine the degree to which the EBS item responses fit the Rasch model through evaluating fit of item responses to the Rasch model and item-measure correlations. The sample consisted of K-12 students with emotional disturbance (n = 1138) and with no identified disabilities (n = 1096). Students were rated by their teachers on the 10-item EBS. The findings suggested the EBS possesses favorable measurement properties such that most items had (1) overall good fit to the Rasch model, (2) a few items across age/gender that assess internalizing problems were found to be somewhat problematic, (3) the item hierarchy was found to align with logical and theoretical expectations, and (4) teachers endorsed the response options in a reliable and predictive manner with response categories mostly being distinguishable from one another. Overall, the results justify the interpretations and decisions made with the EBS scores.

AB Although instances of discrimination are increasing across US schools, little is known about the relations of discrimination to mental health outcomes across the full range of school ages or how experiences of discrimination interact with various sociodemographic characteristics. This study entailed analysis of data from approximately 60,700 respondents to the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health to explore the associations between racial/ethnic discrimination and depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder for children and youth ages 6-17. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that experiencing racial discrimination was associated with significantly increased odds of having a range of mental health problems including depression, anxiety problems, and behavior disorders. Moreover, an interaction effect was observed between discrimination, race, and anxiety. No interactions were observed for variables related to age groupings. Implications for school-based mental health practitioners and researchers are discussed.

AB Classroom observations have long been considered a necessary component of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) evaluations. Yet, research evaluating the utility of observational ratings in ADHD assessment is limited. This study examined the contributions of the Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools (BOSS) to ADHD assessment by investigating associations between BOSS scores with ADHD symptom clusters and symptoms of frequently co-occurring externalizing and internalizing disorders. The utility of BOSS scores in predicting future ADHD-related impairment beyond standard parent and teacher ratings was also examined. One hundred and thirty-five children in grades 2-5 across 23 public schools participated in a randomized controlled trial examining a psychosocial treatment for ADHD. BOSS ratings were collected at baseline. Parent and teacher ratings of child symptoms and impairment were collected at baseline, post-treatment (3-4 months later), and follow-up (8-12 months later). Multiple regressions investigated the associations between the BOSS subscale of Task Engagement (TE) and parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms and related disorders. Multi-level modeling accounted for school cluster effects. Results showed that lower BOSS TE was related to higher teacher-rated inattention but not hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. Lower BOSS TE was also associated with higher teacher-rated Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and depression symptoms, but not anxiety symptoms. Further, BOSS TE predicted higher future impairment beyond baseline teacher and parent ratings of ADHD symptoms and impairment, controlling for treatment. The BOSS appears sensitive to symptoms of child inattention, ODD, and depression, and may have utility in informing future impairment beyond standard informant ratings of ADHD.

AB With rising awareness of the negative effects of school bullying on victims' psychosocial adjustment, schools worldwide are intervening more to try to reduce bullying among their students. However, even when these interventions succeed (i.e., lead to average decreases in bullying), some children continue to experience victimization. Recent studies suggest that their situation is particularly concerning: The adjustment difficulties commonly experienced by victims of bullying may be exacerbated in social contexts in which less victimization occurs, the proportion of victims has decreased, or an antibullying program is being implemented. The possibility that improved social contexts harm some individuals has been referred to as the healthy context paradox. Although strict evidence of this paradox is pending, in this article, we discuss plausible explanations for it, such as causal attributions for the bullying and opportunities for friendship, as well as possible implications for antibullying interventions.

AB Stressful experiences have repeatedly been related to psychological problems. The current study extends previous work on stress and psychological problems by examining the link between stressful experiences and both internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) problems. Additionally, individual differences are investigated by testing the moderating role of self-esteem. Questionnaire data of 750 adolescents aged 12-18 were collected and analyzed using multiple regression analyses. Analyses were controlled for sex and socioeconomic status. Results indicated that adolescents who report more stressful experiences are more likely to experience both INT and EXT problems, and these relationships were stronger for adolescents with low self-esteem. Post hoc analyses (e.g., different thresholds for determining stressful experiences) support the robustness of our findings. The findings on self-esteem emphasize the importance of taking individual differences into account in the relation between stressful experiences and psychological problems. The results can be seen as a next step in cross-sectional research.

AB Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are reported to have greater levels of anger rumination than typically developing children. This study examined anger rumination in children with ASD in comparison to children with disruptive behavior disorder without ASD. We also tested if anger rumination is associated with aggression and the core ASD symptoms of restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). This study included three groups of children aged 8-16years: 63 had ASD (ASD group), 79 had disruptive behavior disorder (DB group), and 40 healthy controls (HC). ASD and DB groups showed greater anger rumination relative to the HC group. Anger rumination was associated with RRBs in children with ASD, suggesting the link to core ASD symptoms.

AB Parental mind-mindedness, the parent's propensity to treat the child as an intentional agent, has repeatedly shown to promote children's development of social understanding and secure attachment. Less is known about whether the impact of maternal and paternal mind-mindedness extends to children's social and behavior problems. We investigated the combined effect of mothers' and fathers' (N=104) mind-mindedness at 4, 12, and 30months on children's social competence and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems at 4.5years. Besides, we examined the stability, continuity, parental concordance, and inter-parental differences in the use of mind-related comments. Appropriate mind-mindedness (i.e., correct interpretations of the child's mental states) and nonattuned mind-mindedness (i.e., misinterpretations of the child's mental states) were observed during parent-child free-play interactions. Social competence, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems were assessed using both parents' reports. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that, at 12months, infrequent use of appropriate mind-related comments of both parents predicted children's externalizing problems, while their frequent use of nonattuned comments predicted children's low social competence. Furthermore, mothers' frequent use of nonattuned comments at 12 and 30months and fathers' nonattuned comments at 30months predicted children's externalizing behavior. The findings suggest that both parents' low use of mind-related comments, and frequent misinterpretations of their child's mind, may act as risk factors for later social and behavior problems of their child.

AB Work on affective forecasting has provided support for the finding that people overestimate their predicted emotional reactions towards future life events. We extend past work by highlighting individual differences in affective forecasting. A sample of 368 undergraduate students differing in trauma experience and symptoms were asked to complete emotion regulation questionnaires and predict their emotions and reactions towards two hypothetical future negative life events (i.e. academic failure and cyberbullying). Using structural equation modelling, emotion dysregulation mediated the association between higher trauma experience and symptomatology and greater negative affective forecasts towards both hypothetical negative life events. The mediating role of emotion dysregulation suggests it can be a potential target for intervention, especially for those with a history of trauma. The present findings extend the research on individual differences in affective forecasting and expand our understanding of the role of emotion in shaping ones decision-making and outlook for the future.

AB Objective: Recent research has documented cultural differences in the extent and manner in which various forms of emotion regulation are linked with psychological well-being. Most of these studies, however, have been cross-sectional, nor have they directly examined the values underlying the use of emotion regulation. The present study examined emotion restraint values and their interactions with life stress in predicting internalizing symptoms across time among Vietnamese American and European American adolescents. The study focused on adolescence as a critical developmental period during which life stress and internalizing symptoms increase significantly. Method: Vietnamese American (n = 372) and European American (n = 304) adolescents' levels of emotion restraint values, internalizing symptoms, and stress were assessed at two timepoints six months apart. Results: Results indicated differential associations between emotion restraint values, stress, and symptoms over time for the two groups. For Vietnamese American adolescents, emotion restraint values did not predict depressive, anxiety, or somatic symptoms. For European American adolescents, emotion restraint values predicted higher somatic symptoms but buffered against the effects of interpersonal stress on anxiety and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: These results provide increased understanding of the role of values related to emotion restraint in shaping adolescent internalizing symptoms and responses to stress across cultural groups. Implications of the findings for guiding intervention efforts are discussed.

AB Background: Children of parents with alcoholism face considerable stress, and often have externalizing behaviors. Early adversity is known to affect DNA methylation and the functioning of the HPA axis. We investigated the association of early adversity with cortisol reactivity, 5HTTLPR genotype, site specific DNA methylation in the SLC6A4 gene and externalizing behavior in children of alcoholics (COA), and a matched sample of control children.
   Methods: We examined children of alcoholics (N = 50) and age matched control children (N = 50) for exposure to early adversity (both prenatal and postnatal), assessed their salivary cortisol reactivity and evaluated their levels of emotional and behavioral difficulty in terms of externalizing and internalizing behavior. Site-specific DNA methylation at a previously characterized SLC6A4 region was determined in salivary DNA using pyrosequencing. The 5HTTLPR region of the SLC6A4 gene was also genotyped.
   Results: COA had significantly higher experience of early adversity than control children. Cortisol reactivity was reduced in COA, and negatively correlated with early adversity. Both early adversity and cortisol reactivity correlated with externalizing behavior. SLC6A4 methylation was higher in COA, and correlated with early adversity. SLC6A4 genotype did not show association with any of the variables.
   Conclusion: Our study provides further evidence that early adversity is associated with blunted cortisol reactivity, increased site-specific CpG DNA methylation at the SLC6A4 gene, and high externalizing behavior.

AB This study identified (a) friendship changes during the first year of college, and how this change is affected by shyness, and (b) how shyness and friendship individually and in combination affect socioemotional well-being. In Fall and Spring, first-year college students reported on shyness, friendship quality and stability, internalizing symptoms, loneliness, and life satisfaction. There was substantial stability in friendships, particularly among shy students. A Person x Interpersonal Environment Interaction predicted socioemotional well-being. Shy students with high-quality versus low-quality friendships reported lower internalizing symptoms. Although shyness was associated with increased loneliness and decreased life satisfaction, high-quality friendships showed modest evidence of moderating these relationships. Many students maintained precollege friendships, but high-quality friendships were particularly beneficial for shy students.

AB Students with and at-risk for academic and behavioral challenges often have low levels of academic engagement. Providing instructional choice is one way to increase engagement in the classroom. In this study, we replicated and extended previous inquiry by investigating the effects of across-activity choices offered by third-grade teachers during reading instruction to participating students with behavioral (one with internalizing and two with internalizing and externalizing patterns) and academic needs. Using a standardized professional development module, teachers learned to implement instructional choice during reading instruction while collecting direct observation data on a student's academic engagement. Teachers implemented practices with integrity and collected momentary time sampling data for one student in their classroom with high levels of reliability. Results of a withdrawal design indicated a functional relation between the introduction of instructional choice and increases in the academic engagement for the three students. Teachers and students rated the intervention goals, procedures, and outcomes as acceptable. Limitations and future directions are presented.

AB Hemophilia is a congenital bleeding disorder that mainly affects men. Men with severe hemophilia experience stigma because they are unable to live up to various ideals of masculinity. This study involves a qualitative analysis of how nine Danish men aged 40-54 years with severe hemophilia manage life as functionally impaired relative to their masculine identity. The analytical focus is on how the men manage on a daily basis, how they construct their identity as a result of the disorder, and the body's importance in these identity negotiations. The source of their biggest defeat is that the disorder often prevents them from living up to social expectations about men as fathers. This results in a variety of management strategies that they apply to neutralize the stigma, allowing them to (a) distance themselves from the disorder in various practical and verbal ways and to (b) assume primary responsibility for managing the disorder, including internalizing being experts on the disorder. The results identify that men with severe hemophilia are frustrated by the lack of advice provided by the health sector. The article proposes initiatives that can be taken to address the lack of knowledge and to create a broader network of peers for men with hemophilia across varying age groups.

AB Inconsistencies exist regarding the relation between physical activity (PA) and internalizing symptomology in early adolescence, and there is need for investigation of potential moderators that may account for these discrepancies. The current study utilized a Self-Determination Theory Framework to investigate the main effects of five key motivations to exercise and their moderating effects between PA and internalizing problems in an underserved sample of adolescents (n = 167; mean age = 12.19 years; 73% African American). Analyses showed that intrinsic motivations were negatively related to internalizing problems and extrinsic motivations were positively related. PA was only protective against internalizing problems when intrinsic motivations were high and had iatrogenic effects when these were low. Exploratory analyses further delineated the unique effects of motivational orientations. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB Background Very preterm (VPT; <30 weeks gestation) children are a heterogeneous group, yet the co-occurrence of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental impairments remains unclear. Moreover, the clinical and socio-environmental factors that promote resilient developmental outcomes among VPT children are poorly understood. Methods One hundred and twenty five children (85 VPT and 40 full-term) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation at age 5-years. Parents and teachers completed measures of internalizing, externalizing, attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), and autism symptoms. Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental measures were analyzed using Latent Profile Analysis. Multinomial regression examined the extent that infant, sociodemographic, and family factors, collected prospectively from birth to follow-up, independently differentiated resilient and impaired children. Results Four latent profiles were identified, including a Typically Developing Group which represented 27.1% of the VPT group and 65.0% of the full-term group, an At-Risk Group with mild psychiatric and neurodevelopmental problems (VPT 44.7%, full-term 22.5%), a Psychiatric Group with moderate-to-severe psychiatric ratings (VPT 12.9%, full-term 10.0%), and a school-based Inattentive/Hyperactive Group (VPT 15.3%, full-term 2.5%). Clinical diagnoses were highest among the Psychiatric Group (80%). Factors that differentiated resilient and impaired subgroups of VPT children included prolonged exposure to maternal psychosocial distress (p <= .04), current family dysfunction (p <= .05), and maternal ADHD symptoms (p <= .02), whereas social risk index scores differentiated resilient and impaired full-term children (p < .03). Conclusions Lower levels of maternal distress, family dysfunction, and maternal ADHD symptoms were associated with resilience among VPT children. Maternal distress and family dysfunction are modifiable factors to be targeted as part of psychiatric interventions embedded in the long-term care of VPT children.

This study evaluated the prevalence of concerns and proportion of outpatient referrals provided and completed at follow-up. Participants included 100 adolescents and young adults seen at a multidisciplinary diabetes clinic. Referrals were made to 61.2% of participants for internalizing (51.6%), externalizing (8%), diabetes-related (50%), comprehensive evaluation (17%), interpersonal (10%), and other needs (3%). At follow-up, 23.7% of those referred were enrolled in outpatient services. Pediatric psychologists offer effective mental health screening and referral. Barriers to follow-up outpatient care included transportation, organization, and stigma. Implications for improving access are discussed.

AB Locus of control-the expectation that one is in control of one's outcomes in life-is linked to well-being. The authors explored one of the possible antecedents of locus of control such as secure children's attachment. The hypothesis was that locus of control acts as a mediator of the association between children's attachment and their mental health, in terms of depression, anxiety (internalizing problems), and aggression (externalizing problems). Participants were 206 children with ages ranging from 8 to 14 years. The authors obtained data from teachers as well as by self-report. Structural equations modelling yielded significant results for both a direct path from insecure attachment to internalizing problems and an indirect pathway in which locus of control functions as a mediating variable between children's attachment and internalizing problems. Although the data were consistent with the mediated pathway with regard to internalizing problems, different findings emerged for aggression. Insecure attachment was a significant predictor of aggressive behavior, while locus of control was not a mediator between attachment and aggressive behavior. The authors' findings confirm the mediating role of the locus of control between attachment and internalizing problems, but not between attachment and externalizing ones.

AB During adolescence there is a relatively high prevalence of weight problems and eating disorders. Furthermore, body image plays an important role in weight control and eating behaviors as well as in mental health. This study analyses the influence of body mass index, perception of being overweight, and body image satisfaction (BIS) on internalizing symptoms related to mental health in adolescents. In addition, sex, age, socioeconomic status (SES), dieting, and physical activity are taken into consideration. This research is based on the international study Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC). The sample consists of 4531 Spanish adolescents from 13 to 18 years old. Participants were selected through random multi-stage sampling stratified by conglomerates. Two instruments were employed: the HBSC questionnaire and the Youth Self-Report (Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment, ASEBA). Results demonstrated that BIS -the emotional component related to body image- was the main predictor of adolescent internalizing symptoms. In addition, results show double-inequalities according to the interaction effects of sex, age, and SES. Likewise, interesting results are shown regarding how dieting behaviors to lose or gain weight/volume and physical activity relate to body image perception and satisfaction, as well as with internalizing symptoms. This study highlights important body image aspects relevant to intervention and prevention of internalized mental health problems in adolescence.

ID CHILDHOOD ABUSE; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; FIT INDEXES; PTSD;
   DIFFICULTIES; SYMPTOMS
AB Incarcerated women report high rates of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion regulation has been identified as a potential mechanism that contributes to the association between trauma exposure and PTSD severity. The present study examined associations among cumulative trauma exposure, emotion regulation difficulties, and current (30-day) PTSD in 152 randomly selected women in prison. Utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM), results indicated cumulative trauma was significantly associated with emotion regulation difficulties, beta = .31, SE = .13, p = .005; and PTSD symptom severity, beta = .41, SE = .14, p = .005. We identified a significant indirect effect, 0.11, z = 2.37, p = .018, of emotion regulation on the association between cumulative trauma exposure and severity of current PTSD symptoms. These findings are consistent with previous longitudinal research suggesting that emotion regulation is significantly affected by trauma exposure, and they support previously identified associations between emotion regulation difficulties and severity of PTSD. Further, these findings have the potential to inform current efforts to identify and implement effective PTSD-focused interventions with incarcerated women. In particular, it appears that emotion regulation skills may be an important component of effective PTSD focused interventions for this population.

AB In this study, we examined the relations between perceived social-class discrimination, attachment, and behavior problems in a sample of Chinese migrant children in Beijing (age X over bar = 11.48, SD = 1.12; n = 179). Data were collected from two migrant schools in Beijing. The participants completed measures of perceived social-class discrimination, attachment to parents and peers, and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The results indicated that perceived social-class discrimination was associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems. In addition, attachments to mother, father, and peer were negatively associated with behavior problems. Results of hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that child-father attachment significantly moderated the associations between perceived social-class discrimination and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. The negative effects of perceived social-class discrimination on child outcomes were mitigated when children reported higher levels of attachment to their fathers. Child-mother and child-peer attachment demonstrated no moderating effects. The findings provide some evidence of child-father attachment's unique contribution to child socioemotional development and protection against behavior problems associated with social risks.

AB Perceptions of the ecology and middle school transition are examined in relation to interpersonal competence patterns (ICPs) of approximately 3,000 sixth graders (46.2% boys) including 415 students with disabilities from 26 metropolitan schools. Teacher ratings of students' academic competence, externalizing and internalizing behavior, popularity, physical attractiveness/athletic ability, and friendliness are used to determine students' ICPs. Using latent profile analyses, distinct ICPs are identified, including Model (high adaptive), Average, Tough (popular-aggressive), Passive (shy, withdrawn), and Troubled (low adaptive) for boys and girls, respectively. Although students with disabilities are overrepresented in Passive and Troubled ICPs and underrepresented in the Model ICP, 804 students without disabilities (367 boys) were identified in risk ICPs (i.e., Passive, Tough, Troubled) compared with 197 students with disabilities (128 boys). Risk ICPs are differentially associated with students' perceptions of the school ecology and the transition experience of students with disabilities. Implications for Multitiered Systems of Support and the tailoring of interventions are considered.

AB This study examined the relations between parental empathy, parenting physical aggression, parental psychological control, and child adjustment in a sample of parents who had their children removed from their custody because of child abuse or neglect. Twenty parents between 24 and 40 years of age (M = 31.15, SD = 4.85; 85% female) with a child aged between 1.5 and 16 years (M = 6.5, SD = 3.88; 70% boys) participated in the study. Our sample was comprised of relatively racially diverse and low-income parents, with 40% from racial minority groups and 70% below the poverty line. Parents were recruited from a local nonprofit organization providing court-mandated parenting classes. Parents reported on their dispositional empathy, physical aggression toward children, psychological control and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms in an interview format. Parents also reported on empathy for their children through a semistructured interview; their empathy was later coded by trained research assistants. Bivariate correlation analyses revealed that parental empathy in the parent-child relationship negatively correlated with parental psychological control. Greater parental psychological control significantly correlated with greater approval of corporal punishment. Moreover, in the subsample of older children (6 years old and above), greater parental dispositional empathy was associated with greater child externalizing symptoms. Further exploratory analyses showed that associations between parental empathy, psychological control, and spanking attitudes differed across parents of boys and of girls. This study highlights the importance of examining empathy specific to the parent-child relationship in addition to dispositional empathy to predict parenting aggression. More importantly, studies should focus on a more covert form of parenting aggression, parental psychological control, in addition to physical aggression.

AB Objective: ADHD and depression co-occur at higher than chance levels in adolescence, but moderators of this association are not well understood. Consistent with a developmental-transactional framework, one such moderator may be maternal emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Using latent growth curve modeling, the current study examined the independent and interactive effects of adolescent ADHD symptoms and maternal ER difficulties on the trajectory of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Method: This study included a community sample of 247 adolescents (M-age = 13.06 years) assessed annually over a 6-year period. Results: Findings suggested that youth with greater ADHD symptoms whose mothers evidenced more ER difficulties demonstrated steeper increases in depressive symptoms over time relative to their peers with lower ADHD symptoms or whose mothers reported fewer ER difficulties. Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of maternal ER difficulties in predicting the trajectory of depressive symptoms among adolescents with ADHD symptomatology.

AB Introduction: A wide proportion of children and adolescents with headache tends not to respond to various pharmacological treatments in use. The failure to respond to symptomatic treatment and prophylaxis is often due to the presence of a comorbid psychopathology undiagnosed or not properly treated. For these reasons and for the negative impact of headache on the quality of life of the patients and on the costs for the public health system, the adoption of an integrated multi-disciplinary perspective in the diagnosis and treatment of headache is needed. Areas covered: Several researchers have shown that behavioral treatment is effective as pharmacological treatment, not only for headache management but also to maintain a lifetime response to the headache treatment. In particular, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness have proven to be very resolutive both in the management of pain and in the management of stressful situations that can trigger the headache in children and adolescents with headache. Expert opinion: Although studies on behavioral treatments on children and adolescents with primary headaches are still few but a combined approach seems to be very useful in improving the quality of life of these subjects, especially in those who have internalizing disorders in comorbidities.

AB Background: Prevention of depression and anxiety disorders early in life is a global health priority. Evidence on risk and protective factors for youth internalizing disorders indicates that the family represents a strategic setting to target preventive efforts. Despite this evidence base, there is a lack of accessible, cost-effective preventive programs for parents of adolescents. To address this gap, we recently developed the Partners in Parenting (PiP) program-an individually tailored Web-based parenting program targeting evidence-based parenting risk and protective factors for adolescent depression and anxiety disorders. We previously reported the postintervention outcomes of a single-blinded parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which PiP was found to significantly improve self-reported parenting compared with an active-control condition (educational factsheets).
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the PiP program on parenting risk and protective factors and symptoms of adolescent depression and anxiety using data from the final assessment time point (12-month follow-up) of this RCT.
   Methods: Parents (n=359) and adolescents (n=332) were recruited primarily from secondary schools and completed Web-based assessments of parenting and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, postintervention (3 months later), and 12-month follow-up (317 parents, 287 adolescents). Parents in the PiP intervention condition received personalized feedback about their parenting and were recommended a series of up to 9 interactive modules. Control group parents received access to 5 educational factsheets about adolescent development and mental health. Both groups received a weekly 5-min phone call to encourage progress through their program.
   Results: Intervention group parents completed an average of 73.7% of their intended program. For the primary outcome of parent-reported parenting, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvement from baseline to 12-month follow-up compared with controls, with a medium effect size (Cohen d=0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72). When transformed data were used, greater reduction in parent-reported adolescent depressive symptoms was observed in the intervention group (Cohen d=-0.21; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.01). Mediation analyses revealed that these effects were mediated by improvements in parenting (indirect effect b=-0.08; 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01). No other significant intervention effects were found for adolescent-reported parenting or adolescent depression or anxiety symptoms. Both groups showed significant reductions in anxiety (both reporters) and depressive (parent reported) symptoms.
   Conclusions: PiP improved self-reported parenting for up to 9 months postintervention, but its effects on adolescent symptoms were less conclusive, and parent-reported changes were not perceived by adolescents. Nonetheless, given its scalability, PiP may be a useful low-cost, sustainable program to empower parents of adolescents.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Patient-centered care includes efforts to align treatment with patient preferences to improve outcomes and has not been studied in adolescent depression prevention. Within a school-based randomized trial, we examined the effects of offering a preference between two evidence-based preventive interventions for youth at risk of depression, Learning to BREATHE (L2B) and Interpersonal Therapy-Adolescent Skills Training. We examined the effects of 3 preference factors (assignment condition [preference vs. random], receipt of preferred program, and baseline program preference) on outcomes in a diverse sample of 111 adolescents (Mage = 15.18 years, SD = .86): 81 (73%) girls, 45 (41%) White, 40 (36%) Asian American, 8 (7%) Latinx, 1 (1%) African American, and 17 (15%) multiracial or other race/ethnicity. Findings revealed little evidence that receiving a preferred intervention or being given a choice of interventions was linked to greater improvement or initial engagement. Further, analyses did not indicate that adolescents with baseline indications for a specific intervention would benefit more from that intervention; rather, adolescents with generally lower baseline functioning improved more regardless of the intervention received. However, receipt of L2B and a baseline preference for L2B were associated with greater improvements in about half of the outcomes examined, with effect sizes ranging from R-2 = 0.04 to 0.14. There was little support for the need to match interventions to adolescent preferences in school-based prevention efforts. Rather, the more scalable mindfulness-based intervention had stronger effects than the interpersonal intervention and may hold promise for diverse adolescents.

AB The purpose of this study is to clarify the magnitude of the association between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity, and to identify possible moderators of this relationship. An extensive literature search was conducted using multiple databases of both published and unpublished studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment security and to establish the effect size. The main findings from this meta-analysis, which included 42 studies, indicate that there is a small, yet significant, relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity. The rate of nonsecurity in infants of mothers with depression was approximately 20% higher than expected rates in a nonclinical population, and the association between depressive symptoms and nonsecurity was small, but significant. Infants of mothers with depression were nearly twice as likely to have a nonsecure attachment than were infants of healthy mothers. Depression measure and maternal sample source were identified as significant moderators of the odds ratio effect size. Results of this study demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity, and suggest that interventions that focus on both maternal mental health and the attachment relationship are warranted.

AB High levels of negative, and low levels of positive parenting behaviors can increase the risk of internalizing symptoms in children, but the mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. One possibility is that parenting behaviors affect the neural correlates of emotion processing in children. Further, genetic variants relevant to the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are thought to moderate the effect of early experiences on the brain circuits underlying emotion processing, particularly those involving the amygdala. However, no studies have investigated the interactive effect of parenting behaviors and HPA axis-related genes on amygdala activity and connectivity during emotion processing, and in turn internalizing symptoms in children. Participants comprised 80 children (46 females, mean age = 10.0 years) from the community. Observational measures of maternal behavior were collected during mother-child interactions. Children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an implicit emotion-processing task, and mothers and children completed measures of child internalizing symptoms. Genetic risk was calculated using an HPA genetic risk score. HPA genetic risk score was indirectly associated with greater child self-reported depressive symptoms via increased amygdala-precuneus connectivity during the emotion-processing task, and interacted with negative maternal parenting behavior to predict increased connectivity between amygdala and superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex and parietal cortex. HPA-related genetic variation appears to moderate the effect of negative maternal parenting behavior on the neural underpinnings of emotion processing in children, and may confer risk for depressive symptoms via modulation of amygdala connectivity.

AB This study sought to examine school anxiety and depression by parents' immigrant status and identify differences by region of birth and language proficiency. Data were used from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort, a nationally representative and longitudinal study of students in the United States. The analytic sample included 6,156 youth. Linear regression models predicted school anxiety and depression of American eighth grade students from English proficiency and parents' region of birth. Controlling for demographic covariates, there was no significant difference in school anxiety or depression between youth with American-born parents and those with parents born in any major world region. With the inclusion of an interaction between language proficiency and region of birth, children with limited English proficiency from Europe (B = 2.86, 95% CI = 2.16, 3.55), Central America (B = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.73, 2.31), Asia (B = 1.48, 95% CI = 0.55, 2.40), and South America (B = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.08, 1.61) had significantly heightened school anxiety compared to native-English speakers with native-born parents. When considering sources of school anxiety, it was revealed that over 60% of these youth worried about doing well in school. Future research should explore interventions to increase English proficiency and ease school-related stress among children of immigrants.

AB Although prior research has shown potential academic difficulties for Tibetan adolescents when coping with the mainstream Han culture, little is known about their psychosocial adjustment. Adopting a person-centered approach, the current study explores psychosocial adjustment profiles based on internalizing indicators (i.e., depression, loneliness, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect) and externalizing indicators (i.e., prosocial behavior and antisocial behavior). Moreover, guided by the empathy theory, this study also examines the direct and interactive effects of empathy (affective and cognitive empathy) and ethnicity (Tibetan vs. Han adolescents) on psychosocial adjustment profiles. A total of 306 Tibetan adolescents (66.3% girls) and 321 Han adolescents (55.1% girls) were involved in this study, and participants were asked to fill in a set of self-report questionnaires. A latent profile analysis revealed five psychosocial adjustment profiles: adaptive, maladaptive, externalizing, internalizing, and moderate. Furthermore, a multiple multinomial analysis showed Han adolescents were more likely than Tibetan adolescents to be a member of adaptive and moderate profiles than of the externalizing profile. Individuals with low affective empathy and high cognitive empathy were prone to be adequate in terms of psychosocial functioning, and the effects of low affective empathy and high cognitive empathy on psychosocial functioning were highlighted in Han adolescents only.

AB Background The structure of psychopathology has been much debated within the research literature. This study extends previous work by providing comparisons of the links between psychopathology and several life outcomes (temperamental, economic, social, psychological and health) using a three-correlated-factors model, a bifactor model, a revised-bifactor model and a higher-order model. Methods Data from a sample of Dutch adolescents were used (n = 2 230), and psychopathology factors were modelled using self-reported and parent-reported longitudinal data from youth across four assessments during adolescence, from ages 11 to 19. Outcome variables were assessed at age 22 using adolescent-reports and parent-reports and more objective measures (e.g. body mass index). Results While no measurement model was clearly superior, we found modest associations between the psychopathology factors and life outcomes. Importantly, after taking into account a general factor, the associations with life outcomes decreased for the residual parts of thought problems (across all domains) and internalizing problems (for temperamental and psychological outcomes), but not for externalizing problems, compared with the traditional three-correlated-factors model. Patterns were similar for adolescent-reported and parent-reported data. Conclusions Findings suggest that a general factor is related to psychopathology and life outcomes in a meaningful way. Results are discussed in terms of individual differences in propensity to psychopathology and more broadly in light of recent developments concerning the structure of psychopathology.

AB Youth community violence has been linked with depressive and anxious symptoms, and aggressive behavior; however, little research has examined different combinations of emotional and behavioral adjustment among community-violence-exposed youth, or individual characteristics that may account for different patterns of emotional and behavioral adjustment in community-violence-exposed youth. This research used person-centered methods to examine how gender, temperament characteristics, and prior exposure to community violence were linked with classes of community violence exposure and internalizing and externalizing adjustment among a sample of urban African American youth. Participants were 464 African American adolescents (46.7% female; mean age = 14.83, SD = .43) who reported their community violence exposure in Grade 9 and for whom reports of depressive and anxious symptoms, and aggressive behavior were available. Latent class analysis identified four classes of adolescents distinguished by their exposure to community violence exposure and internalizing and externalizing behavior. The two classes with high community violence exposure were characterized by internalizing symptoms or aggressive behavior; the two classes with low community violence exposure had low internalizing symptoms with moderate aggression or had all moderate symptoms. These community violence adjustment classes were distinguished by gender, history of community violence exposure, behavioral inhibition, and fight-flight-freeze systems. Findings highlight heterogeneity in internalizing and externalizing responses of community-violence-exposed youth and suggest factors that explain community violence exposure, repeat exposure, and responses to community violence exposure.

AB Background In recent times, sibling bullying has emerged of interest to researchers concerned with the emotional and behavioural implications for victimization regardless of type and setting. Aims This research attempts to extend current knowledge on both peer and sibling bullying and to determine the effects of poly-setting victimization. This paper is concerned with the following objectives: (1) determining the current rate of bullying and victimization among siblings and peers in a large sample of adolescents; (2) investigating the relationship between sibling and peer bullying and depression and behaviour; (3) highlighting the carry-over effects of bullying from one setting to another; and (4) determining the overall association of poly-setting victimization with depression and behaviour. Sample and methods Over 2,000 adolescents aged between 12 and 15 years participated in an online survey. Results Results found lower rates of sibling bullying compared to international studies. Sibling victims of bullying were at increased risk of becoming peer victims. Poor friendship quality, disliking school, along with peer and sibling bullying involvement predicted scores in the clinical range for outcome measures of internalizing and externalizing problem. Conclusions The current study has clinical and educational implications for working with all important stakeholders (i.e., schools, parents, siblings) to reduce bullying and improve mental health.

Data come from three sources: 26 semistructured interviews with 14 Mexican-origin adolescents (mean age = 15.43, SD = 1.22), 64.3% female, living in neighborhood environments predominated by Latinos; neighborhood (N = 9) data from the U.S. Census Bureau; and systematic social observations of neighborhood block faces (N = 256). Using Key-Word-In-Context analysis, we found that adolescents used a variety of labels to describe themselves and members of their ethnic-racial group while discussing the strengths and challenges associated with their residential neighborhoods. Semistructured interview themes included adolescents' references to cultural and social resources within neighborhoods, neighborhood challenges, ethnic-racial biases, and normative developmental processes. We examined label usage across interview themes and neighborhood characteristics derived from the census and systematic social observation data. Two triangulated findings emerged: (a) diversity in ethnic-racial label usage in the context of neighborhood resources and (b) greater restriction to the use of panethnic labels in the context of neighborhood challenges. Our study suggests that adolescents may be internalizing messages and symbols in their neighborhoods in ways that have implications for their ethnic-racial labeling and identity development.

AB Aims Headaches in preschool children are associated with behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms. As the co-occurrence with incontinence is not known in young children, the aim of the study was to examine associations of headache, psychological symptoms and nocturnal enuresis (NE), daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), and fecal incontinence (FI) in a population-based sample of preschool children. Methods All preschool children of a defined geographical area were examined at school-entry. Parents completed a 22-item questionnaire, including 14 headache, 4 incontinence, and 25 items of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Five hundred eighty-five children (50.4% males) with a mean age of 5.8 years were included. Results In total, 27.2% of all children had headaches. 15.7% had secondary and 11.3% primary headaches. Five children had migraine and five tension-type headaches, while all others were unclassifiable. 9.4% of children had incontinence (7.7% NE; 2.4% DUI, 1.2% FI) and 4.0% constipation. The rates of incontinence did not differ between children with primary and those without headache for NE (12.9% vs 7.5%), DUI (3.1% vs 2.7%) or FI (3.0% vs 1.0%), but for constipation (12.1% vs 2.6%). Incontinent children had significantly more behavioral and externalizing symptoms, children with headache more internalizing problems. Primary headache was a significant predictor for internalizing, while constipation and FI were predictors for externalizing symptoms. Conclusions This population-based study showed that headache is associated with constipation, but not with incontinence in preschool children. Headache and incontinence are common risk factors for specific psychological symptoms and should be assessed in clinical practice.

AB Exposure to social stress is a well-established risk factor for the development and recurrence of depression. Reduced neural responsiveness to monetary reward has been associated with greater symptoms following stress exposure. However, it remains unclear whether reduced reward responsiveness serves as a mediator or moderator of the effects of stress on internalizing symptoms or whether similar patterns emerge with responses to social reward. We addressed this issue by measuring lifetime stress exposure and event-related potentials (ERPs) to social reward in 231 emerging adults (M = 18.16, SD = 0.41 years old). Participants completed the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) to assess severity of lifetime stressors and self-report measures of current internalizing symptoms. In addition, participants completed the Island Getaway task in which the reward positivity (RewP) ERP was recorded in response to social acceptance, adjusting for responses to rejection (RewP residual). In this task, participants vote to accept or reject peers and receive reward/acceptance and rejection feedback. Stressors were divided into social and non-social stress severity scores. Analyses were conducted to test social reward responsiveness as a mediator or moderator of the effects of social and non-social stress on internalizing symptoms. Both social and non-social stress exposure over the life course predicted symptoms of depression (ps < 0.001) and social anxiety (ps < 0.002). The effect of social stress on depression was moderated by the residual RewP to social reward, adjusting for responses to social rejection (p = 0.024), such that greater lifetime social stress exposure and a relatively blunted RewP to social reward were associated with greater depressive symptoms. Social reward responsiveness did not mediate effects of stress on internalizing symptoms. Reduced processing of social reward may be a vulnerability for depression that increases risk for symptoms following exposure to social stress. Blunted social reward responsiveness appears to be a relatively unique vulnerability for depression, rather than social anxiety. Results support the utility of ERP measures in measuring individual differences in social reward processing that can be applied to better understand neural processes involved in the development of depression, and highlight the importance of considering specific dimensions of stressful life experiences.

AB Pediatric concussion is a major public health concern. Despite the prevalence of behavior problems following concussion and their potential role in prolonged symptoms, little is known about how child and adolescent behavior may impact post-concussion recovery. We sought to examine change in behavioral and emotional functioning in a sample of children ages 5 to <18 years with concussion. This study reports on data collected as part of a larger single-site prospective longitudinal cohort study. Participants were recruited from the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary children's hospital and completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 2 weeks (acute; T2) and 3 months (post-acute; T4) post-injury. Children with concussion (n = 231) showed a significant reduction in internalizing (p < 0.001, d = 0.27), externalizing (p < 0.001, d = 0.23), and total behavior problems (p < 0.001, d = 0.36) at 3 months compared with 2 weeks post-injury. Multiple regression models found a significant interaction between age and sex with higher rates of internalizing (p = 0.048, eta(2)(p) = 0.02) and total (p = 0.040, eta(2)(p) = 0.02) behavior problems as age increased in females. The results show that pediatric concussion is associated with temporary behavioral disturbances that are likely to improve considerably in the months following injury. Nonetheless, as age increases, females may be at increased risk for experiencing ongoing internalizing problems several months after concussion and may require targeted clinical intervention.

AB Objective As the number of pediatric cancer survivors increases, so does our need to understand behavioral late effects. Prior studies show mixed results, with some noting increased emotional distress and psychiatric diagnoses in cancer survivors and others suggesting resilience. The purpose of our study was to evaluate internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression in young adult survivors of childhood cancer compared with matched classroom matched peers. Method We completed a multisource, cross-sectional examination of internalizing symptoms using a semistructured psychiatric interview with 18-year-olds with a history of pediatric cancer compared with age, race, and gender matched classroom peers who had been identified during the survivor's first year of treatment and their primary caregivers. Results Fifty-seven young adult survivors of childhood cancer and 60 comparison peers participated. There were no significant differences between survivors and their peers on the basis of self- or parent-reported depressive or anxiety symptoms or number of psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusions Young adult survivors of childhood cancer and their parents did not report increased rates of anxiety or depression compared with their former classroom peers. Despite experiencing a major life challenge, this group of young adults with cancer did not report more current or past symptoms of internalizing psychopathology.

AB Maternal depression is a robust risk factor for children's internalizing symptoms; however, the intergenerational transmission of mood disorders is likely more complex than unidirectional parent-directed effects. Theoretical models support transactional associations between maternal and child symptomatology over time but have not been well examined, especially in younger high-risk samples. The present investigation examined predictive transactional relations between maternal depression and children's internalizing in toddlerhood and early childhood using a cross-lagged panel model. Participants were 162 low-income, largely racial/ethnic minority mothers and their offspring (32% African American, 16% White, 52% Other/Multiethnic; 53% female) who were assessed when children were 18 months and 4 years old. There were significant cross-sectional relations between maternal depressive and child internalizing symptoms when children were 18 months but not 4 years of age. Cross-lagged associations were evident such that maternal depression symptoms at 18 months were positively associated with internalizing symptoms among children at 4 years, adjusting for prior maternal symptom levels and the cross-sectional correlations between maternal-child symptoms at 18 months. Within the same model, children's internalizing symptoms at 18 months were also positively associated with maternal depressive symptoms at 4 years, adjusting for prior child symptom levels and cross-sectional correlations. This study is among the first to demonstrate that transactional relations between maternal and child mood symptoms occur as early as toddlerhood/early childhood. Findings highlight the potential utility of inclusive, family-focused interventions that support both parents and children in the treatment of early emotional problems.

AB This study examined foster parent physical and mental health over time. It was hypothesized that increased severity and frequency of child behavioural problems, whether externalizing or internalizing, would be associated with poorer health over time, especially for foster parents >= 60 years of age. Data from the baseline and Wave 2 interview of the 2010 National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being were used. The final analytic sample included kin and nonkin foster parents who had custody of a foster child for both waves of data collection (n = 962). Ordinary Least Squares regression models with lagged dependent variables showed that foster parents >= 60 had deteriorating physical health over time, but caregiver age alone had no association with worsening mental health. However, parents >= 60 caring for children with externalizing behavioural problems had significantly improved physical health. Mental health of parents >= 60 significantly diminished if child externalizing or internalizing problems worsened. Findings indicate that for aging foster parents, externalizing child behaviours may stimulate physical activity and improved physical health, yet any type of child behavioural problem can deteriorate mental health functioning.

AB Introduction: Internalizing mental disorders (IMDs) in HIV+ children and adolescents are associated with impaired quality of life and non-adherence to anti-retroviral treatment. Telomere length is a biomarker of cellular aging, and shorter telomere length has been associated with IMDs. However, the nature of this association has yet to be elucidated.
   Objective: We determined the longitudinal association between IMDs and relative telomere length (rTL) and the influence of chronic stress among Ugandan perinatally HIV-infected youth (PHIY).
   Methods: IMDs (depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder) and IMDs were assessed using the locally adapted Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5. In 368 PHIY with any IMD and 368 age- and sex-matched PHIY controls without any psychiatric disorder, rTL was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to generate the three chronic stress classes (mild, moderate, and severe). t-tests were used to assess the difference between baseline and 12 month rTL and the mean difference in rTL between cases and controls both at baseline and at 12 months. Linear regression analysis was used to model the effects of chronic stress on the association between IMDs and rTL, controlling for age and sex.
   Results: We observed longer rTL among cases of IMDs compared with controls (p < 0.001). We also observed a statistically significant reduction in rTL between baseline and 12 months in the combined sample of cases and controls (p < 0.001). The same statistical difference was observed when cases and controls were individually analyzed (p < 0.001). We found no significant difference in rTL between cases and controls at 12 months (p = 0.117). We found no significant influence of chronic stress on the association between IMDs and rTL at both baseline and 12 months.
   Conclusion: rTL is longer among cases of IMDs compared with age- and sex-matched controls. We observed a significant attrition in rTL over 12 months, which seems to be driven by the presence of any IMDs. There is a need for future longitudinal and experimental studies to understand the mechanisms driving our findings.

AB Background: The cholinergic system has an important role in mood regulation. Cholinesterase inhibitor pesticides (e.g. organophosphates) appear to increase depression and anxiety symptoms in the few existing animal and human studies. Human studies have not described such associations using biomarkers of exposure and studies among children are needed.
   Methods: We studied 529 adolescents (ages 11-17y) in agricultural communities in the Ecuadorian Andes (ESPINA study). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in a finger-stick sample. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the CDI-2 and MASC-2 (greater scores reflect greater internalizing symptoms). Models adjusted for age, gender, hemoglobin, income among others.
   Results: The median age was 14.38y and 51% were female. The mean (SD) of the following parameters were: AChE 3.7 U/mL (0.55), depression T-score 53.0 (9.4) and anxiety T-score: 57.6 (9.8). Lower AChE activity (reflecting greater cholinesterase inhibitor exposure) was associated with higher depression symptoms (difference per SD decrease of AChE [beta [95% CI:]]: 1.09 [0.02, 2.16]), was stronger among girls (beta = 1.61) than boys (beta = 0.69), and among younger (<14.38y, beta = 1.61) vs. older children (beta = 0.57). The associations were strongest among girls <14.38y (beta = 3.30 [0.54, 6.05], OR for elevated symptoms per SD decrease in AChE = 2.58 [1.26, 5.27]). No associations were observed with anxiety scores. Analyses of AChE change between 2008 and 2016 concurred with these findings.
   Discussion: We observed associations between a biomarker of pesticide exposure and children's depression symptoms. Lower AChE activity may create risk for depression in teenagers, particularly among girls during early adolescence.

AB Prior research shows that mental health problems are linked to worse student achievements in school, but few studies address whether the consequences of such problems vary by student achievement level and the role of teachers' grading practices in these processes. In this study, I examine the relationship between mental health problems and grade achievement at the end of compulsory education using a population-based Norwegian health survey, the Young-HUNT study, matched with administrative data. The results show a robust negative influence of attention problems and conduct problems on average grade achievement, and a positive role of internalizing problems, in fixed-effects models controlling for unobserved characteristics of school context. Further, conduct problems are more strongly related with student achievement in the lower end of the grade distribution, indicating that low-achieving students are disproportionally affected by mental health problems. I also compare grades assigned by classroom teachers with anonymously graded exams, and find that part of the negative association between externalizing problems and achievement reflect a 'behavioural penalty' due to teacher-bias in grading practices.

ID LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; STRESS; IMPACT
AB Comprehensive long-term follow-up ( LTFU) for survivors of childhood cancer is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality. Current standards recommend screening all survivors for psychological and academic problems and certain survivors for neurocognitive problems based upon treatment exposures. This study aimed to determine if differences exist in executive functioning (EF) based on treatment exposures and characterize relationships between EF, treatment exposure, and internalizing problems. Participants included adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors (N = 70) of non-central nervous system cancer, aged 14-21 presenting for LTFU. Patient-reported data were obtained on survivors' EF, internalizing symptoms, academic performance, and educational supports. Children's Oncology Group's LTFU Guidelines classified survivors as at risk or not at risk for neurocognitive deficits based on treatment exposures. Group differences, relationships, and moderation by risk group were examined. No differences were found in EF, internalizing symptoms, academic performance, or educational supports between survivors who were at risk versus those not at risk for neurocognitive deficits. Problems with EF predicted internalizing symptoms, an effect that was moderated by risk group (R-2 =.64 for AYA self-report; R-2 =.38 for parent-proxy report). Survivors with poorer EF experienced higher levels of internalizing symptoms. These data indicate that current screening practices may not identify survivors who are not at risk for neurocognitive deficits, yet struggle with EF. Survivor care providers should consider universal screening for EF problems in AYAs, regardless of treatment exposure history. Clinical assessment of internalizing problems in survivors with EF problems is also recommended.

AB ObjectivesUsing longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (N=507), we considered the role of parents' earlier (child age 5) relationship quality, co-parenting quality, and father involvement in children's later (age 9) internalizing and externalizing behaviors, with a specific focus on mediational links. We also explored the possibility of different patterns of associations based on child gender.MethodA demographically diverse sample of women who were in stable relationships (married or cohabiting) with the focal child's biological father completed questionnaires assessing the primary study variables at child ages 5 and 9 years.ResultsCorrelational analyses supported many of the hypothesized links between relationship quality, co-parenting quality, father involvement, and children's behaviors problems, although more so for boys. Regression analyses further illuminated the associations among the study variables. Importantly, co-parenting quality served as a mediator in the link between relationship quality and boys' age 9 internalizing and externalizing behaviors.ConclusionsThis study identified different patterns for boys and girls, with relationship quality, co-parenting quality, and father involvement being important for boys but only co-parenting quality being important for girls. Further, findings suggest that for boys, the quality of the mother's romantic relationship has a bearing on the quality of her co-parenting with the father, which in turn impacts the son's behavioral adjustment. Future studies are needed to understand the nature of the longitudinal associations among the study variables more fully.

AB ObjectivesWe aimed to compare obese children and their non-obese counterpart on children's negative emotionality, emotion regulation and maternal parenting styles and to examine the joint contribution of children's temperament and maternal styles to children's obesity.MethodsA total of 200 mothers were involved in this study, 100 with children diagnosed with obesity (49 boys, 51 girls; the age ranged from 6 to 12 years), and 100 with children with a normal weight (49 boys, 51 girls; the age ranged from 6 to 12 years). Mothers completed self-report measures on children's emotionality, emotion regulation, and parenting styles.ResultsThe comparison between the two groups showed that obese children, compared with their non-obese counterpart, had higher levels of negative emotionality and emotional lability and a lower level of emotion regulation; they also had more authoritarian and permissive mothers than non-obese counterpart. Logistic regressions showed a joint contribution of the authoritarian parenting style and emotional lability to obesity, so that both at lower and higher levels of emotion lability, children's obesity tended to be lower when authoritarian style was low and to be higher when authoritarian style was high.ConclusionsUnderstanding the mechanisms through which parenting styles and characteristics of children are associated to obesity risk may lead to the development of more-comprehensive and better-targeted interventions.

AB Introduction
   Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) often presents with other associated comorbidities such as urinary tract infections, constipation, fecal incontinence, and vesicoureteral reflux. However, the psychiatric conditions that can be associated with LUTD tend to go unnoticed. The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of LUTD and psychiatric disorders in children are difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, there is currently no accepted consensus on this subject.
   Objective
   In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the relationship between the subgroups of both LUTD and psychiatric disorders.
   Study design
   LUTD were divided into 4 groups by using voiding dysfunction symptom score (VDSS), bladder diary, and uroflowmetry/electromyography (UF/EMG) test. A short screening test for psychological problems was used to detect psychiatric disorders accompanying each LUTD group. In terms of psychiatric disorders, the patients were divided into two groups: externalizing and internalizing disorders.
   Results
   A total of 156 children were diagnosed with LUTD. Seventy-six patients had overactive bladder (OAB), 53 had dysfunctional voiding (DV), 14 had primary bladder neck dysfunction (PBND), and 13 had underactive bladder (UAB). Psychiatric disorder was detected in 46 children (29.4%). Of these, 32 had an externalizing and 14 had an internalizing disorder. In terms of age, externalizing disorders were more common in children aged between 6 and 11 years (87.5%), whereas internalizing disorders were seen equally in both age groups. Among these, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most common psychiatric disorder (16.1%). The LUTD groups with the most frequent psychiatric disorders were UAB (53.8%), PBND (35.7%), and OAB (28.9%).
   Discussion
   Most of the studies investigating the relationship between the lower urinary tract and psychiatric disorders so far have been concerned with the lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) (such as nighttime or daytime incontinence) and ADHD. However, the present study was performed according to the LUTD classification, which is primarily based on VDSS, bladder diary, and UF/EMG tests. Furthermore, psychiatric disorders were classified into their subgroups. The results have shown that around a quarter of children with LUTD also had comorbid psychiatric disorders. The relationship between LUTD and psychiatric disorders constitutes a critical point. Identifying this association can contribute to the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment for these patients.
   Conclusions
   LUTD and psychiatric disorders can be seen together, and this can be detected by the short screening test for psychological problems. Therefore, the authors think that patients who applied with LUTS should undergo this short test along with the routine urinary system examination and tests.

AB Premature infants hospitalized after birth are exposed to repeated painful procedures as part of their routine medical care. Early neonatal exposure to unmanaged pain has been linked to numerous negative long-term outcomes, such as the development of pain hypersensitivity, detrimental psychological symptomology, and altered neurodevelopment. These findings emphasize the crucial role of pain management in neonatal care. The aim of this article is to give an overview of evidence-based non-pharmacological pain management techniques for hospitalized neonates. Research supporting the effectiveness of various proximal, distal, and procedural pain management methods in neonates will be presented. Additionally, understanding the larger biopsychosocial context of the infant that underpins the mechanisms of these pain management methods is essential. Therefore, two important models that inform non-pharmacological approaches to infant pain management (DIAPR-R [The Development of Infant Acute Pain Responding-Revised], Attachment Theory) will be discussed.

AB Using data (N = 1,803) from the Mobile Youth Survey, a community-based study of risk and resilience among predominantly African American youth, this study examines whether indicators of parenting and youth psychological distress mediate the relationship between household member arrest and substance use. Results of structural equation analyses suggest that household member contact with the criminal justice system has indirect effects on adolescent substance use via its impact on parenting. Household member arrest was associated with fewer family rules, monitoring, and curfew restrictions, which in turn was associated with increased frequency of alcohol and marijuana use. Although household member arrest was positively associated with psychological distress, there was no evidence of an internalizing pathway to substance use. Findings underscore the importance of identifying and then intervening on family processes as a way to reduce the impact of family contact with the criminal justice system on young people.

AB Background: It has been suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs; short non-protein-coding RNA molecules that mediate post-transcriptional regulation), including mir-9 and mir-34 families, are important for brain development. Current data suggest that mir-9 and mir-34 may have shared effects across psychiatric disorders. This study aims to explore the role of genetic polymorphisms in the MIR9-2 (rs4916723) and MIR34B/C (rs4938723) genes on the susceptibility of psychiatric disorders in children from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort. Methods: Psychiatric disorders were assessed in 3585 individuals using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), criteria through the application of standard semi-structured interviews (using the Development and Well-Being Assessment, DAWBA) at the six-years-of-age follow-up. The outcome was defined as the presence of any mental disorder. We also considered two broad groups of internalizing and externalizing disorders to further investigate the role of these variants in mental health. Results: We observed an association between rs4916723 (MIR9-2) and the presence of any psychiatric disorder (odds ratios (OR) = 0.820; 95% CI = 0.7130-0.944; p = 0.006) and a suggestive effect on internalizing disorders (OR = 0.830; 95% CI = 0.698-0.987; p = 0.035). rs4938723 (MIR34B/C) was not associated with any evaluated outcome. Conclusion: The study suggests that MIR9-2 may have an important role on a broad susceptibility for psychiatric disorders and may be important mainly for internalization problems.

AB The N2 event-related potential component is a well-studied neurophysiological index of response inhibition that is considered to be a biomarker of externalizing psychopathology. The literature on the N2 elicited in childhood has been inconsistent, though, with different studies yielding different findings regarding the association between the N2 and the constructs it is thought to index. The current meta-analysis sought to clarify the functional meaning of the N2 component elicited in childhood across three widely used response inhibition tasks. The current study meta-analyzed the findings of 54 studies examining the association of the N2 component and three phenotypes of interest: (1) behavioral response inhibition (as indexed by performance on the inhibition trials of the task used to elicit the N2 component), (2) performance on behavioral measures of self-regulation, and (3) psychopathology (both externalizing and internalizing) in samples of children, to clarify the meaning of the N2 component and evaluate its utility as a potential endophenotype. Results suggest that the N2 component is associated with response inhibition and externalizing psychopathology.

AB Introduction: Youth of color (e.g., Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic) are over-represented in the juvenile justice system and experience greater health disparities compared to non-Hispanic White youth. Ethnic/racial discrimination (ERD) is a risk marker for poor mental health and behavioral outcomes among youth of color, and traumatic stress and emotion dysregulation have been implicated in these pathways. Despite the relevance of these factors for justice-involved youth of color, understanding of their interrelations within this demographic is lacking.
   Methods: Participants were 173 recently arrested adolescents (86% African American; 45% girls; ages 13-18) on probation in a large Midwest city in the United States. Participants completed surveys assessing ERD, traumatic stress, emotion dysregulation, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors. Using linear regression and path analysis, this study tested the cross-sectional links among two types of ERD (i.e., interpersonal experiences and perceptions of group experiences), traumatic stress symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors.
   Results: Interpersonal ERD (e.g., hearing racial insults) was associated with increased internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors; for internalizing symptoms, the relation was stronger for girls than boys. Gender differences were partially accounted for by traumatic stress symptoms and emotion dysregulation.
   Conclusions: This study offers new insights into ERD experiences among juvenile justice-involved youth of color, gender differences in ethnic/racial discrimination experiences, and the potential value of gender-sensitive and culturally responsive programming in strengthening youths' ability to cope with ERD.

AB Parental behavior is one of the most influential factors on the development of adolescent externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. These behavioral problems are closely related and often co-occur. The objectives of this work were: (i) to identify adolescents profiles according to their behavior problems; (ii) to explore individual, family, and social characteristics associated with these profiles; and (iii) to analyze the potential role of parenting styles in belonging to adolescents' profiles. A total of 449 Spanish adolescents (223 from families declared at-risk and enrolled in Child Welfare Services and 226 from families from the general population) participated in this study. The analyses revealed three profiles of adolescents based on external and internal behavior problems (adjusted, external maladjustment, and internal maladjustment). Parenting styles explained the adolescents' belonging to different profiles, in which the indulgent style was the most favorable in general terms. The distinctive role of parenting styles on two types of maladjustment profiles was confirmed. The relationship between parenting styles and adolescent adjustment is a key component that should be included in interventions according to adolescents' behavior problem profiles. Furthermore, the results shed light on the need that family interventions are complemented with individualized interventions with adolescents that accumulate stressful life events.

AB Background: The impact of HIV and antiretrovirals (ART) on long-term mental health in perinatally infected children has not been well studied in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is most prevalent.
   Setting: Cape Town, South Africa.
   Methods: We investigated mental health measures, including depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, motivation, disruptive behavior, and functioning in perinatally infected adolescents (PHIV+) stable on ART within the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort. Two hundred four adolescents living with HIV (median age 10 years; mean CD4 953) and a sample of 44 uninfected adolescents were enrolled. The Beck Youth Inventories, Children's Motivation Scale, Conner's Parent's Rating Scale, and Child Behavior Checklist were administered. Among PHIV+, we explored independent associations between HIV-related stigma, recent life stressors, sociodemographic, clinical, and caregiver-related variables, and mental health measures.
   Results: PHIV+ had poorer functional competence, self-concept and motivation, higher levels of disruptive behavior, depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms and clinically significant anger and disruptive behavior. Within the PHIV+ group, the loss of both biological parents was associated with higher levels of disruptive behavior. Within the PHIV+, factors associated with mental health symptoms and poorer functioning were mostly sociodemographic factors, HIV-related stigma, and life stressors. Age of initiation of ART was associated with self-concept, and failing first-line ART with internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.
   Conclusions: PHIV+ are likely to face future physical and psychological health consequences related to the functional competence challenges they face if mental health care is not made a priority in the fight against HIV.

AB Developmental research documents that anhedonia, or diminished interest in usual activities, is associated with a diverse array of emotional problems in childhood and adolescence. Meanwhile, official nosologies desginate anhedonia as a more specific characteristic of major depressive disorder. Using a quantitative model of the internalizing domain, we compared the strength of transdiagnostic versus diagnosis-specific pathways from anhedonia to major depression (and other internalizing conditions) during adolescence. We recruited 241 youth ages 14-17 who completed semistructured interviews of anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as several self-report surveys of trait anhedonia and neuroticism. Confirmatory factor analysis of diagnostic correlations revealed good fit for a unidimensional model of the 10 internalizing conditions we assessed. This overarching internalizing dimension was statistically significantly correlated with trait anhedonia (r= 0.17) and neuroticism (r= 0.59). In contrast, anhedonia was virtually unrelated to major depression (r = -0.02), net the internalizing dimension. Thus, in this sample, the connection between anhedonia and major depression was explained by a transdiagnostic dimension presumed to underlie all internalizing problems. Compared to neuroticism, however, anhedonia had a more limited association with internalizing, consistent with established personality models of anxiety and depression. We conclude that these data are consistent with conceptualizing anhedonia predominantly as a transdiagnostic correlate of internalizing conditions, rather than a specific marker of major depression, in developmental psychopathology research and clinical interventions for young people.

AB Normal-range personality provides a framework for the hierarchical organization of psychopathology. However, little is known about how personality-psychopathology associations differentiate across this hierarchy. The developmental aspects of this hierarchy and its personality framework are also understudied. We used National Comorbidity Survey data to construct bass-ackwards comorbidity models in age groups ranging from adolescence to middle adulthood and related the resulting dimensions to neuroticism, extraversion, and openness. Neuroticism showed stronger associations with internalizing versus externalizing and with broader versus narrower psychopathology dimensions. Extraversion showed comparatively weaker associations at all levels of psychopathology hierarchy. Openness was generally unrelated to psychopathology. Results were consistent across age groups, suggesting that psychopathology hierarchy and its relations with personality are largely stable across adolescence and adulthood. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study explored transactional associations among adolescent personality (i.e., conscientiousness, agreeableness), parental control (i.e., proactive, punitive, psychological control), and externalizing problem behavior (i.e., aggressive or rule-breaking behavior). A three-wave longitudinal study across a two-year time span provided questionnaire data from 1,116 adolescents (M-age Wave 1 = 13.79, 51% boys), 841 mothers, and 724 fathers that was used in random intercept cross-lagged panel models. At the between-person level, adolescent personality, parental control, and externalizing problem behavior were significantly associated. Concerning the within-person level, conscientiousness showed reciprocal associations with externalizing problem behavior (negative), with agreeableness (positive) and punitive control (negative). Our findings observed a reciprocity between adolescent personality and externalizing problem behavior, but also suggest a role for parental control in this interplay. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective To investigate near-term risk for self-injurious urges, we evaluated how within-person changes in internalizing and externalizing negative affect, as well as interpersonal rejection and criticism, impact subsequent nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide urges in daily life. Method Young adult women (N = 62) from an ongoing community cohort study with past-year self-injurious thoughts completed a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol. We used multilevel path analyses to model within-person effects of negative affect and interpersonal stress on subsequent suicide and NSSI urges within several hours. Results When modeled simultaneously, within-person changes in internalizing, but not externalizing, negative affect predicted later self-injurious urges. Rejection and criticism predicted later self-injurious urges, with rejection showing a unique relationship to NSSI urges specifically. Effects of rejection and criticism on later NSSI and suicide urges were mediated by internalizing negative affect; rejection also retained a significant direct effect on NSSI urges. Conclusion Interpersonal stressors may be potent near-term risk factors for self-injurious urges by increasing internalizing negative affect among vulnerable individuals. The direct role of rejection and criticism on self-injurious urges is less clear, particularly for suicide. These findings have implications for understanding processes underlying self-injurious urges, as well as designing real-time interventions for these experiences in daily life.

AB Childhood trauma is associated with many long-term negative outcomes, and is not limited to the individual experiencing the trauma, but extends to subsequent generations. However, mechanisms underlying the association between maternal childhood trauma and child psychopathology are not well understood. Here, we targeted frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) as a potential underlying factor of the relationship between maternal childhood trauma and child behavioral problems. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from (N = 45) children (Mean age = 57.9 months, SD = 3.13) during an eyes-closed paradigm in order to evaluate FAA. Mothers reported on their childhood trauma experiences using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and on their child's behavior using the child behavior checklist (CBCL). We found that maternal childhood trauma significantly predicted child total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior at age 5 years. We also observed a role for FAA such that it acted as a moderator, but not mediator, for behavioral problems. We found that children with relative more right/less left frontal activity were more at risk to develop behavioral problems when their mother had been exposed to trauma in her childhood. These results indicate that child frontal asymmetry may serve as a susceptibility marker for child behavioral problems.

AB This cohort study assesses association of the type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment with hyperactive and hypoactive amygdala responses in young adults.
   Key PointsQuestionWhat is the association between exposure to childhood maltreatment at different ages and adult amygdala response to threatening faces? FindingsIn this cohort study of 202 young adults, self-reported exposure to maltreatment during early childhood was significantly associated with blunted amygdala response via functional magnetic resonance imaging, whereas early teen exposure was significantly associated with augmented amygdala response. MeaningThe findings suggest that maltreatment may be a risk factor for disorders characterized by hyperactive amygdala response and disorders associated with hypoactive amygdala responses, which may be associated with differences in age at the time of exposure to specific types of adversity during childhood.
   ImportanceAbnormalities in amygdala response to threatening faces have been observed in anxiety disorders, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormally hyperactive and hypoactive responses have typically been associated with anxiety and inhibition vs risk taking and inappropriate social behaviors. Maltreatment is a major risk factor for most of these disorders and is associated with abnormal amygdala function. ObjectiveTo identify the type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment that are associated with hyperactive and hypoactive amygdala responses in young adulthood. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData collection for this retrospective cohort study took place from November 8, 2010, to August 23, 2012. Data analyses were conducted from September 20, 2012, to June 27, 2018. Participants were recruited from the urban and suburban Boston vicinity without diagnostic restrictions based on exposure history. ExposuresThe Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale was used to retrospectively assess type and age of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Main Outcomes and MeasuresActivation and pattern information functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess bilateral amygdala response to angry and fearful faces vs neutral faces or shapes, and sensitive exposure periods were identified using cross-validated artificial intelligence predictive analytics (50 averaged randomized iterations with training on 63.3% and testing on 36.7% of the sample). ResultsOf the 202 participants (mean [SD] age, 23.2 [1.7] years; 118 [58.4%] female), 52 (25.7%) reported no exposure to maltreatment and 150 (74.3%) reported exposure to 1 or more maltreatment types. Eight participants (15.1%) with a MACE score of 0 and 51 (34.2%) with a MACE score of 1 or higher had a history of major depression (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.05-6.06; P=.03); 8 unexposed participants (15.1%) and 46 with MACE scores of 1 or higher (30.9%) had a history of 1 or more anxiety disorders (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.03-6.50; P=.03). Retrospective self-report of physical maltreatment between 3 and 6 years of age and peer emotional abuse at 13 and 15 years were associated with amygdala activation to emotional faces vs shapes. Early exposure was associated with blunted response (beta=-0.17, P<.001), whereas later exposure was associated with augmented response (beta=0.16, P<.001). Prepubertal vs postpubertal maltreatment was associated with an opposite response on the voxelwise response pattern in clustering stimuli of the same type (eg, mean [SD] emotional ellipse areas for physical maltreatment at age 4 years vs nonverbal emotional abuse at 13 years: 1.41 [1.05] vs 0.25 [0.10], P<.001) and in distinguishing between stimuli of different types (eg, mean [SD] emotional vs neutral faces distance for peer emotional abuse at age 6 years vs 13 years: 1.89 [0.75] vs 0.80 [0.39], P<.001). Conclusions and RelevanceThe findings suggest that prepubertal vs postpubertal developmental differences in the association between maltreatment and amygdala response to threatening or salient stimuli exist. Understanding the role of adversity in different sensitive exposure periods and the potential adaptive significance of attenuated vs enhanced amygdala response may help explain why maltreatment may be a risk factor for many different disorders and foster creation of targeted interventions to preempt the emergence of psychopathology in at-risk youths.

AB Objective The present study examined parent-teacher agreement and discrepancy when assessing kindergarten children's behavioral and emotional problems, social-emotional skills, and developmental status. Method Parents and teachers of overall n = 922 kindergarten children (M-age = 3.99; 449 girls) rated the children using the Conners Early Childhood, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Questionnaire for Assessing Preschool Children's Behavior. Results Agreement was moderate for problem behaviors and social-emotional skills and substantial for developmental status. Agreement was stronger for externalizing than for internalizing problems. Agreement on the clinical relevance of problem behaviors and of social-emotional skills was stronger for children with a clinical diagnosis than for those without. Parents tended to report more problems, but also greater social-emotional skills and developmental status, than teachers. Conclusions The findings corroborate the importance of situational specificity for understanding interrater agreement and discrepancy. Future teacher questionnaires should more specifically assess children's functioning in kindergarten.

AB Objective: The present study aimed to examine the predictor effects of neonatal, sociodemographic characteristics, and temperament assessed at 18-36 months of age on behavioral problems in 4- to 5-year-old children born preterm.
   Methods: The sample comprised 70 children born preterm. The amount and the intensity of stress procedures during a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit were evaluated using the Neonatal Infant Stressor Scale. Temperament was assessed using the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire, and behavioral problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist 1(1/2)-5. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed.
   Results: Total behavioral problems were predicted by a child temperament of more negative affectivity and less effortful control, moderated by gestational age. Internalizing behavioral problems was predicted by more negative affectivity and less effortful control moderated by male sex and associated with lower gestational age. Externalizing behavior problems was predicted by less effortful control.
   Conclusions: The main findings of the present study showed that the high immaturity at the birth of preterm infants, associated with temperament traits of more negative affectivity and less effortful control, increase the risk for future behavioral problems.

AB Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with severe problems later in life. This study examines how eleven types of ACEs and mental health care use history are related to current psychological dysfunction among multi-problem young adults. A sample of 643 multi-problem young adult men (age 18-27) gave informed consent for us to collect retrospective regional psychiatric case register data and filled out questionnaires. ACEs were highly prevalent (mean 3.6, SD 2.0). Logistic regression analysis showed that compared with participants who experienced other ACEs, participants who experienced psychological problems in their family and grew up in a single-parent family were more likely to have used mental health care, and physically abused participants were less likely to have used mental health care. Linear regression analyses showed a dose-response relationship between ACEs and internalizing and externalizing problems. Linear regression analyses on the single ACE items showed that emotional abuse and emotional neglect were positively related to internalizing problems. Emotional and physical abuse and police contact of family members were positively related to externalizing problems. While multi-problem young adults experienced many ACEs, only a few ACEs were related to mental health care use in childhood and adolescence. Long-term negative effects of ACEs on psychological functioning were demonstrated; specifically, emotional abuse and emotional neglect showed detrimental consequences. Since emotional abuse and emotional neglect are not easily identified and often chronic, child health professionals should be sensitive to such problems.

AB The majority of youth with mental health problems do not receive treatment, highlighting the critical need to transport evidence-based interventions into community settings, such as schools. Despite being able to reach a large number of adolescents and minority youth, the process of implementing evidence-based interventions to schools is challenging. This paper discusses some expected and unexpected challenges experienced during the implementation of an open trial and a pilot randomized controlled trial examining the acceptability and effectiveness of a school-based preventive intervention for adolescents at risk for internalizing disorders. First, we highlight key programs and findings on preventive interventions for adolescents at risk for depression and anxiety. Next, we provide a brief overview of the preventive intervention we implemented in schools. This provides a context for the section that describes implementation issues and highlights specific challenges and potential solutions for intervention implementation. Finally, the paper offers recommendations for researchers and clinicians interested in implementing school-based mental health services for adolescents.

AB Deficient emotion regulation is a common and impairing area of difficulty among children with ADHD. Few interventions specifically address deficient emotion regulation. The Managing Frustration for Children With ADHD (MEC) group treatment was developed to specifically target deficient emotion regulation deficits common to children with ADHD. The MEC was developed as a 12-week multisystemic intervention for emotion regulation deficits among children with ADHD. An open trial assessed the effectiveness of the MFC as an adjunctive treatment for deficient emotion regulation among children with ADHD. Fifty-two children with ADHD ages 9-11 (42 boys, 10 girls) were enrolled in the MFC, with 44 completing treatment. The majority (71.2%) of participants had at least one comorbid internalizing, externalizing, or learning disorder. Intent-to-treat repeated-measures ANCOVA suggested significant decreases in emotion regulation deficits, mood difficulties, and externalizing difficulties following completion of treatment. More than half (53 %) of children who completed treatment experienced reliable and clinically signcant improvement in at least one area of functioning. The MEC demonstrated promising initial effectiveness in addressing the emotion regulation deficits of children with ADHD.

AB Associations between stressful life events (SLEs) and internalizing psychopathology are complex and bidirectional, involving interactions among stressors across development to predict psychopathology (i.e., stress sensitization) and psychopathology predicting greater exposure to SLEs (i.e., stress generation). Although stress sensitization and generation theoretical models inherently focus on within-person effects, most previous research has compared average levels of stress and psychopathology across individuals in a sample (i.e., between-person effects). The present study addressed this gap by investigating stress sensitization and stress generation effects in a multiwave, prospective study of SLEs and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms. Depression, anxiety, and SLE exposure were assessed every 3 months for 2 years (8 waves of data) in a sample of adolescents (n = 382, aged 11 to 15 at baseline). Multilevel modeling revealed within-person stress sensitization effects such that the association between within-person increases in SLEs and depression, but not anxiety, symptoms were stronger among adolescents who experienced higher average levels of SLEs across 2 years. We also observed within-person stress generation effects, such that adolescents reported a greater number of dependent-interpersonal SLEs during time periods after experiencing higher levels of depression at the previous wave than was typical for them. Although no within-person stress generation effects emerged for anxiety. higher overall levels of anxiety predicted greater exposure to dependent-interpersonal SLEs. Our findings extend prior work by demonstrating stress sensitization in predicting depression following normative forms of SLEs and stress generation effects for both depression and anxiety using a multilevel modeling approach. Clinical implications include an individualized approach to interventions.

AB The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) represents the most widely used protocol for mental and behavioral health screening in the Child Welfare System (CWS). However, because past studies have (a) relied on the self- or parent report, (b) focused on the internalizing subscales, (c) focused solely on current or prospective depression, and (d) not assessed incremental validity, it is difficult to use the ASEBA to address recommended universal depression screening initiatives in the CWS. In response, the present study used an evidence-based medicine (EBM) framework to identify the best combination of subscales that predict adolescent depression outcomes within the CWS. Overall, we found that a combination of self-reported internalizing symptoms, and to a lesser extent, self-reported attention problems, delinquent behavior, and parent-reported social problems best forecasted concurrent depression status. Meanwhile, self-reported anxious/depressed and externalizing symptoms, in addition to parent-reported somatic complaints and withdrawn symptoms, were necessary to adequately forecast prospective depression outcomes. Using these algorithms, we were able to differentiate and classify youth at minimal, moderate, or substantial risk for current and future depression symptoms. Findings are contextualized with past research on the Achenbach scales and clinical implications for more targeted depression screening are discussed.
